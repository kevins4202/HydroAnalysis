7775,study region this study refers to the hydrological open air laboratory hoal watershed located in south west austria study focus the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is sometimes synthetized by geometric mean k s and coefficient of variation while areal average infiltration models rely upon the arithmetic mean k sl associated to log transformed ks and relative coefficient of variation cv al robust estimation of k sl and cv al as well as of k s and associated coefficient of variation cv g would require a large number of ks observations the determination of the minimum number of ks measurements n for obtaining sufficiently accurate values of each aforementioned quantity over an area is an open issue addressed here a statistical approach has been applied to ks datasets on three grassy plots for an uncertainty analysis based on the non parametric bootstrap method with replacement the uncertainty of each quantity has been derived for different observation numbers and areas new hydrological insights for the region considering different sub regions in the largest plot the uncertainty is almost invariant with increasing the sub region area beyond a threshold furthermore for a given n the uncertainty of k sl and cv al is much smaller than that of k s and cv g our approach defines a methodology for determining over an area the n associated to a fixed uncertainty level in the joint estimation of the selected quantities guidelines for investigations over different plots are also proposed graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil

transport through the vadose zone as well as the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and overland flow at different spatial scales under natural conditions it is characterized by extensive spatial heterogeneity variations over two orders of magnitude have been reported even at small catchment scales sharma et al 1987 loague and gardner 1990 baiamonte et al 2017 as well as at the hillslope and plot scales papanicolaou et al 2015 morbidelli et al 2017 picciafuoco et al 2019 the heterogeneity of ks influences infiltration which in turn affects surface and sub surface flows especially for light and moderate rainfall events the quantity ks depends on soil matrix basic properties such as structure and texture as well as land cover and management practices in addition the presence of macropores and other preferential flow paths can greatly influence the ks variability most of these features cannot be fully quantified therefore the heterogeneity of ks is often represented as a random field with a univariate probability density function pdf that is commonly recognized to be lognormal in nature nielsen et al 1973 greminger et al 1985 sharma et al 1987 loague and gander 1990 in this context considering the spatial variability of ks under natural conditions only in the hypothetical case of knowledge of ks over a very narrow spatial grid it would not be necessary to synthesize the ks field however even in this case solutions of distributed models with this spatial resolution would not be possible at the scales of interest therefore the determination of quantities which allow a simplified representation of the ks field is required recently proposed theoretical models for estimating expected areal infiltration rate and overland flow in both vertically homogeneous and layered soils require for the ks log transformed values the knowledge of the arithmetic mean k sl standard deviation σ al or relative coefficient of variation cv al that allow to define the pdf of ks corradini et al 2011a b corradini et al 2017 the ks geometric mean k s and the coefficient of variation cv g have been also used to synthetize the observed spatially heterogeneity reynolds et al 2000 skøien and blöschl 2006 verbist et al 2013 ahmed et al 2015 picciafuoco et al 2019 bagarello et al 2021 for a reliable joint estimate of k sl and cv al as well as k s and cv g many local ks data would be needed however these data are usually obtained by devices e g the traditional well permeameters and double ring infiltrometers that involve an indirect procedure based on long duration measurements of infiltration rate performed until steady conditions are observed each experiment can last several hours measurement techniques that do not require attainment of steady conditions do exist bagarello et al 2014 nevertheless the planning of monitoring campaigns with a proper density of measurements over extended areas is not straightforward because of possible variations in environmental conditions for instance heavy rainfalls occurring in the middle of a campaign could produce a decrease of ks particularly over bare soils assouline and mualem 2000 morbidelli et al 2011 leading to incomparable values of ks important insights for addressing the above issues can be obtained by experimental analyses aimed at identifying control factors of ks and through the knowledge of the minimum number of measurements required for a reliable assessment of means and coefficients of variation at the plot scale as a support for investigations at larger scales vieira et al 1981 examined the spatial heterogeneity of ks in an area of 8800 m2 using 1280 measurements of infiltration rates through a geostatistical approach they deduced that a minimum of 128 observations was sufficient to have nearly the same information as obtained by the complete dataset skøien and blöschl 2006 examined the effect of the scale triplet average distance between samples extent of the sampled domain and average support area of one measurement on the estimates of k s spatial variance and range of ks in a landscape on the basis of the selected scale triplet the authors generated 1000 synthetic random fields and from each realization sampled some ks values for each realization they compared the sample geometric mean and variance with those of the entire random field their main results suggested that for a given number of samples the uncertainty of k s increased with increasing the spacing between ks samples in any case actual measurements of ks could have different characteristics than those obtained by the approach of skøien and blöschl 2006 ahmed et al 2015 performed infiltration measurements in six roadside grassed swales from which the spatial distribution of ks was derived a dataset with 722 values were generated by a falling head device applying an uncertainty analysis on the sub dataset observed in 4 swales they found that 20 spatially distributed values of ks were the minimum number required for estimating a representative k s of a swale with acceptable uncertainty picciafuoco et al 2019 carried out infiltration measurements using double ring infiltrometers in 12 plots of a small austrian watershed and derived 131 spatially distributed ks values the data were found slightly related to physical and topographical soil features but strongly affected by land use large values of ks were obtained in arable fields where k s and cv g values much larger than those in grassland areas were deduced the authors used an uncertainty analysis based on the non parametric bootstrap method carpenter and bithell 2000 to determine the minimum number of ks measurements necessary over a given plot for assessing k s with a target accuracy the 95 confidence interval of k s decreased with increasing the number of measurements and the addition of measurements beyond the minimum number did not produce significant benefits bagarello et al 2021 examined the ks spatial variability in two adjacent plots characterized by bare clay soil in each plot they first observed 176 values of ks obtained by single ring infiltrometers 30 cm diameter through a simplified falling head technique bagarello et al 2004 many months later they conducted a second monitoring campaign with a ring of different diameter 15 cm an uncertainty analysis was used to determine the minimum number of ks measurements to be chosen for estimating k s with a specified accuracy the effects of the extent of the sample area and of the density of available measurements on the uncertainty analysis were also examined they noted that the use of the device with the larger ring reduced the minimum number of ks measurements by a factor 2 with respect to the one required with the smaller ring the above discussion points out that previous studies including picciafuoco et al 2019 concerned only k s and joint estimates of the uncertainty associated to k s and cv g and especially to k sl and cv al have not been resolved while their importance in hydrology is widely recognized at any spatial scale the main objective of this paper is to fill the existing gap by a statistical approach involving random variables for developing an uncertainty analysis based on the non parametric bootstrap method with replacement in this context the minimum number n of ks measurements necessary for obtaining a nearly stable 95 confidence interval associated to k s k sl and their respective coefficients of variation is determined measurements carried out by picciafuoco et al 2019 on three plots of a small austrian watershed characterized by silty loam soil covered by grass have been selected they used these observations to investigate by the non parametric bootstrap method without replacement only the uncertainty on k s following carpenter and bithell 2000 these data have been examined here through a different re sampling procedure bagarello et al 2021 used a similar statistical approach but their study was limited to k s furthermore the ks measurements were carried out over an area of south italy with much smaller extension and characterized by different soil type and soil cover these differences through a comparative analysis of results allow to assess the possibility to transfer some insights of this study to other plots the representation of the ks random field in terms of estimated k s and cv g and their uncertainty can be useful for comparing different experimental studies while that based on the estimate of k sl cv al and their uncertainty is required for the solution of semi empirical smith and goodrich 2000 and semi analytical govindaraju et al 2001 corradini et al 2017 flammini et al 2018 areal infiltration models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental data a dataset has been extracted from infiltration measurements earlier performed by picciafuoco et al 2019 on the hydrological open air laboratory hoal watershed area of 0 66 km2 located in south west austria the main soil use in the watershed was represented by arable land 87 the remaining part was characterized by forested area with grassland and high stemmed vegetation of low density without brushwood 6 pasture 5 and paved surfaces 2 blöschl et al 2016 since the forested area was substantially covered by grassland it was considered jointly with pasture as grassland area organic matter content clay silt and sand percentages were estimated at the infiltration measurement sites from data available on a 50 m 50 m grid local elevation and slope were derived by a digital terrain model minimum spatial variability was found for organic matter and textural composition with coefficient of variation associated to the arithmetic mean less than 15 while a value of about 30 was observed for the slope angle according to the usda united states department of agriculture soil classification the topsoil types of the watershed inferred from the 50 m x 50 m grid data were silty loam 75 of the area silty clay loam 20 and silt 5 using a 3 m x 3 m grid infiltration measurements were performed in 131 sites on 12 plots of which 9 were characterized as grassland and 3 were subjected to agricultural practice double ring infiltrometers with internal and external rings of 30 and 60 cm respectively were used in all the grassland areas ks measurements were carried out during the spring period of 3 weeks while in the agricultural areas they were performed in a period of 2 months between harvest and tillage however in each plot the measurements were completed within a maximum of 3 days the statistical approach anova armstrong et al 2000 was chosen by picciafuoco et al 2019 for estimating the variance of the data observed in different plots with the objective of understanding whether the spatial variability of ks was linked to specific soil characteristics such as texture organic matter slope elevation and land cover among these quantities the results highlighted that the land cover had a major role in determining the ks variability and that k s in arable and grassy plots was significantly different in this study three grassland plots see fig 1 with 40 20 and 9 available measurements characterized by the same spatial density have been selected to analyse the value of n required for determining over a given area k s cv g k sl and cv al with a specific level of uncertainty the choice of these three plots has been made on the basis of the following considerations i the plots had the same grassy land cover with 69 measurements of ks while only 24 observations were available on the three arable plots ii the plots had measurements with similar density over very different areas ranging from 80 m2 to 595 m2 iii in the three grassy plots ks measurements were performed in a short period not affected by rain thereby as a first approximation the data could also be considered representative of simultaneous sampling on the other hand the measurements in the three arable plots occurred over a much longer duration table 1 shows a minor variability of both soil structure and topographic features of the three plots that are characterized by the same soil type silty loam and land use table 2 displays the general statistics of the observed datasets of ks in the three plots for plot 1 and plot 2 the arithmetic mean of ks k s is greater than k s by about a factor 2 while a reverse trend is observed between the coefficients of variation associated to k s cv a and cv g the same trends characterize plot 3 but the differences between similar quantities are not significant the data of table 2 suggest that the ks spatial variability in each plot between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude was probably linked to random factors similar minimum values of ks were observed while the maximum value increased of about 60 from plot 3 to the two larger plots between the smallest and largest plot cv a and cv g approximately varied by factors 2 and 3 respectively finally by applying the classical statistical analysis to the ks data n 40 observed over plot 1 it was found that the associated pdf was of lognormal type 2 2 statistical approach the adoption of a consolidated statistical approach is required to reach the pre established objectives over a given plot the spatial variability of the saturated hydraulic conductivity is commonly represented by a random variable k s and is characterized by a log normal pdf that is undefined because the involved parameters are usually unknown robust estimations of means k s k sl and respective coefficients of variation cv g cv al should be obtained through a significant but not too large number of measurements considering that as previously mentioned under natural conditions the monitoring period should be rather limited therefore it is important to determine the appropriate minimum number of measurements n and related confidence intervals in which the investigated quantities are included this issue can be solved considering that a sample of n independent observations k s k s 1 k s 2 k sn is a realization of a variety of possible samples involving values drawn from a random sample k s k s 1 k s 2 k sn with each component characterized by the same pdf of ks this implies that the samples should be drawn from the k s population that is unknown hence an approximated approach is needed this issue is addressed here using all the observations n carried out in a given plot as the ensemble of ks values from which a great number of samples of dimension n is drawn different values of n with n n have been examined to determine for each investigated quantity the n value associated to a condition of nearly steady confidence interval along these lines the numerical approach known as the non parametric bootstrap method has been selected for developing an uncertainty analysis based on the estimate of the normalized 95 confidence intervals of k s cv g k sl and cv al for different values of n in each plot this method is recognized to be suitable for applications to datasets that do not allow to estimate the pdf of the random variable following carpenter and bithell 2000 a re sampling procedure with replacement has been adopted and repeated m times with m 2000 over a given plot from the complete set of n available measurements m samples sub sets each one with the same n value have been taken out synthetically a re sampling matrix r ˆ n of n x m data of ks denoted by ki j with i 1 n and j 1 m has been obtained 1 r ˆ n k 1 1 k 1 2 k 1 m k 2 1 k 2 2 k 2 m k n 1 k n 2 k n m n 4 n and m 2 000 where each column represents a sample of ks values individually extracted from the complete dataset from each sample the arithmetic mean k nj l the geometric mean k nj and the associated coefficients of variation cv nj al and cv nj g respectively have been computed as 2 k 1 nj 1 n i 1 n k i j j 1 m 3 cv nj al 1 k nj l i 1 n k i j k nj l 2 n 1 j 1 m 4 k nj i 1 n k i j n j 1 m 5 cv nj g 1 k nj i 1 n k i j k nj 2 n 1 j 1 m where ki j i 1 n and j 1 m in eqs 2 and 3 denotes log transformed values of ks from the set of m values obtained for each quantity the corresponding 95 confidence limit has been first deduced in the standard form as difference between the 97 5 and 2 5 percentiles then a normalized form of the 95 confidence interval has been obtained through its ratio with the mean of the m values of k nj l cv nj al k nj and cv nj g denoted henceforth as k sn l cv n al k sn and cv n g respectively the aforementioned statistical analysis has been applied to the datasets available over the three selected grassland plots and over nine sub regions of plot 1 of 55 110 165 215 280 345 405 470 and 535 m2 the larger sub regions included all the smaller ones and the corresponding available measurements of ks the partition of plot 1 has been made for determining for a given uncertainty how the required minimum number of ks observations varies with increasing the study area 3 results representative outcomes of the uncertainty analysis performed are synthesized for each investigated quantity by providing the normalized 95 confidence interval as a function of the number of usable ks measurements and its width for the different sub regions the reduction of the 95 confidence interval width associated with the increase of the number of local observations is also discussed the above normalization has been carried out dividing the 95 confidence interval by the variable average value referred to the given n k sn l for k sl and cv n al for cv al k sn for k s and cv n g for cv g the normalization procedure makes visual comparison of the results easier and meaningful because these are properly scaled considering the different values of the normalizing variable among the investigated areas and the differences due to the use of ks values for k s and cv g and of log transformed ks values for k sl and cv al before displaying the results to avoid confusion with the study of picciafuoco et al 2019 it is necessary to specify that they focused their analysis on k s and denoted plot 1 plot 2 and plot 3 as plot 2 plot 11 12 and plot 7 respectively furthermore in their study the re sampling procedure of the bootstrap method was limited to m 1000 and the sub regions of plot 1 were examined up to 345 m2 3 1 uncertainty analysis of k s and cv g figs 2 and 3 highlight the outcomes achieved here for k s fig 2 shows that the widths of the normalized 95 confidence intervals for plot 1 and plot 2 steeply decrease up to about n 16 while for the smallest plot plot 3 a very limited decrease is observed up to n 6 the uncertainties in plot 1 and plot 2 are very similar and significantly larger than in plot 3 the widths reduce with increasing the number of measurements tending as deduced from the computations in absolute terms to values almost close to k s for n equal to the maximum number of ks available observations see also table 2 the outcomes of a more in depth analysis on the role of plot area in determining the uncertainty associated to the estimate of k s are given in fig 3 where the widths of the normalized 95 confidence intervals computed for plot 1 and its 9 sub regions are represented for different numbers of measurements n 4 16 for any value of n the normalized uncertainty increases up to about 50 in the area range between 110 m2 and 345 m2 and subsequently experiences a slight lowering for the larger sub regions up to the entire plot 1 the same dataset selected for the uncertainty analysis associated to the assessment of k s has been used for that linked with the estimate of cv g fig 4 highlights that the widths of the normalized 95 confidence intervals for plot 1 and plot 2 have a significant reduction up to n 16 and for plot 3 up to n 9 the uncertainty in the three plots is not much different with the curves of the normalized 95 confidence interval of the largest plot nearly coincident with those of the smallest plot and very close to the curves of plot 2 increasing n the normalized 95 confidence intervals become narrower and in absolute terms tend towards values closer to the cv g values given in table 2 in fig 5a more extensive representation of the link between the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval and the area is displayed for different values of n in the largest plot and its sub regions for any area the uncertainty level reduces with increasing n while for any specific n it is essentially constant for areas increasing from 110 m2 to 595 m2 on the other hand it has an appreciable growth from 55 m2 to 110 m2 for n 7 3 2 uncertainty analysis of k sl and cv al the results of the uncertainty analysis are displayed for k sl figs 6 and 7 and cv al figs 8 and 9 following the same lines adopted for k s and cv g figs 6 and 8 show that for the three plots the normalized curves of k sl and cv al with increasing n have trends and relative positions similar to those obtained for k s and cv g respectively for their width some significant differences with respect to the corresponding geometric variables can be deduced comparing figs 6 and 8 with figs 2 and 4 respectively specifically the width associated to each plot for k sl is significantly smaller than that for k s furthermore the three plots have widths for cv al reduced up to about 50 with respect to those for cv g for any value of n thus for a given level of uncertainty the number of ks measurements required for determining k sl and cv al is smaller than that for k s and cv g a more detailed representation of the width of the normalized 95 confidence intervals associated to k sl and cv al as function of area is shown in figs 7 and 9 respectively for different n values in plot 1 and its sub regions the uncertainty decreases for any area with increasing the number of observations up to 16 of the available ones 40 in plot 1 furthermore for k sl it experiences a steep growth for areas up to 165 m2 with n 7 while for each n it assumes a nearly constant value for larger areas up to 595 m2 as to the uncertainty associated to cv al for n 7 it decreases for areas up to 165 m2 while for larger areas stays at a nearly constant value for each n 4 comparing the results illustrated in figs 7 and 9 with those of figs 3 and 5 respectively it can be deduced that there are appreciable differences in the trends of the width of the normalized 95 confidence intervals jointly with substantial reductions of the uncertainty from the two geometric quantities to the arithmetic ones 4 discussion of results significant effects of the spatial variability of ks on surface runoff and infiltration have been shown by hydrological modeling at the plot scale for soils subjected to light and moderate rainfall events as a basis for studies at larger scales a monte carlo method assuming a lognormal pdf with given k sl and cv al was commonly used to assess the effects of this spatial variability smith and hebbert 1979 maller and sharma 1981 saghafian et al 1995 empirical and semi analytical models for estimating mean areal infiltration have been proposed corradini et al 2017 they require the knowledge of k sl and σ al or cv al for synthesizing the pdf of ks a joint interpretation of results of k sl and cv al for modeling use as well as of k s and cv g for characterizing the ks field is required subsequently the possibility to use a minimum number of ks measurements at an acceptable level of uncertainty suitable for estimating both geometric and arithmetic quantities is examined the data shown in terms of normalized 95 confidence interval and its width as a function of n and area help us to understand the trend of the uncertainty associated with each quantity a comparison of figs 2 and 4 suggests that for plots 1 and 2 a minimum number of measurements n 16 with normalized uncertainty of about 1 2 would be an appropriate choice for the estimate of both k s and cv g on the other hand for plot 3 different values of n would be required in particular n 6 with normalized uncertainty of about 1 1 for the assessment of k s and n n 9 with doubled uncertainty for cv g for the three different plots n increases from the smallest 80 m2 to the middle 200 m2 and then remains unchanged for the largest one 595 m2 importantly the link between n and area can be deduced from figs 3 and 5 considering the differences existing between their data associated to a sole plot with 9 sub regions each containing all the smaller ones and from figs 2 and 4 referred to 3 plots characterized by significant differences in terms of means and coefficients of variation of ks table 2 a comparison of figs 3 and 5 indicates that for each n the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval for cv g has a more regular trend with increasing area a minimum value n 10 appears to be suitable for approximating both k s and cv g on areas from 165 m2 to 595 m2 with the two variables characterized by a nearly constant normalized uncertainty of about 1 8 increasing the minimum number to n 16 the normalized uncertainty decreases by about 25 on the other hand at least for k s with n up to 10 the uncertainty tends to reduce with decreasing area from 165 m2 down to 110 m2 these evaluations are limited by the grid 3 m x 3 m used for the ks measurements that implied a total number of 6 observation on the smallest sub region of plot 1 of area 55 m2 overall this comparison indicates that over a large grassland plot of 595 m2 a minimum number of ks measurements for reasonably approximating k s and cv g is n 10 the measurements could be carried out over a much smaller sub region over a grid of 3 m x 3 m as previously mentioned the estimates of k sl and cv al are involved as inputs in areal infiltration modeling they enable us to determine the pdf of ks and therefore its moments of any order required in a few recently proposed models for instance one may consider the semi analytical model of corradini et al 2017 first presented here through implicit functions f1 and f2 for spatially uniform and steady rainfall rate r and negligible runon in a given soil the expected areal average infiltration rate i f as a function of cumulative infiltration f can be expressed as 6 i f f 1 f r k sl σ al with σ al cv al k sl and the relation between the expected time t and f by 7 t f f 2 f r k sl σ al eqs 6 and 7 in explicit form involve the moments of the lognormal pdf of ks that can be obtained for given values of k sl and cv al the two combined equations represent the expected areal average infiltration rate as a function of the expected time i t in this context the uncertainty associated to the estimate of k sl and cv al performed by a reduced number of ks measurements leads to an uncertainty interval for i f t f and i t for an explicit formulation of this modeling the reader is referred to appendix a comparison of figs 6 and 8 indicates that the normalized 95 confidence interval of k sl as a function of n is fairly narrower than that of cv al on plot 1 and plot 2 n 16 with widths of about 0 6 and 0 4 respectively appears to be suitable for k sl the same value of n gives a width of about 1 for plot 1 and 0 7 for plot 2 for cv al therefore n 16 is a satisfactory choice for estimating both k sl and cv al in the two larger plots even though with a greater uncertainty for cv al on plot 3 n 7 gives a width of about 0 4 for k sl while n tending to 9 produces a much larger width at least doubled for cv al thereby n increases from the smallest plot to the middle one while remains unchanged over the largest plot clearer insights for determining k sl and cv al can be derived from the analysis of the outcomes achieved for the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval as a function of the area associated to plot 1 and its sub regions figs 7 and 9 show that for k sl and cv al the broken lines have similar trend in the area range 110 595 m2 for n 5 for both k sl and cv al the choice of n 10 with an uncertainty of about 0 4 for k sl and 1 3 for cv al appears to be reasonable in this area range adopting n 16 the uncertainty reduces by about 20 a combination of the outcomes above discussed indicates that a choice of n 10 can be considered appropriate for estimating k s and cv g as well as k sl and cv al in a large grassy plot of 595 m2 and in its smaller sub regions of area down to 110 m2 however the estimates of the two arithmetic variables have much lower uncertainties with values reduced of 70 for k sl and 27 for cv al only adopting n n 40 the assessments of k s and cv g in plot 1 see figs 2 and 4 would have accuracy similar to the ones computed for k sl and cv al with n 10 see figs 6 and 8 a comparison of our results for k s with those previously found by bagarello et al 2021 who used a non parametric bootstrap method with replacement can be made to interpret the approach utility over different study plots the normalized uncertainty as a function of area of the sub regions of plot 1 fig 3 beyond a threshold value a 165 m2 for k s and cv g 110 m2 for k sl and cv al has a trend similar to that derived for k s by bagarello et al 2021 over sub regions of a much smaller plot 88 m2 however they found a very different value of a about 28 m2 even though a similar statistical method was involved some important factors differentiated these two plots these factors were soil type silty loam and clay soil cover grass and bare soil and environmental conditions region of south west austria and south italy they could be linked with the value of a through further investigations to be performed in other properly selected plots in any case on the basis of these deductions it can be expected that a similar trend of uncertainty characterizes a variety of plots a comparison has also been made between figs 3 and 11 of picciafuoco et al 2019 and some differences due to the different version of the adopted non parametric bootstrap method have been found in addition picciafuoco et al 2019 limited their analysis to an area range up to 345 m2 narrower than that considered in this study up to 595 m2 and they did not detect the steady trend of the curves observed here our outcomes are not conflicting with those of ahmed et al 2015 who for determining k s selected 20 ks data over a grassed swale of area more extended than that of plot 1 as a value of n balanced between experimental effort and accuracy a more extended comparison cannot be made because they did not examine either the link between area and n for k s and did not consider the estimate of cv g k sl and cv al a comparison in depth of our results with those presented by vieira et al 1981 is barred because they limited their study to the construction of a contour map of ks for a given area using both observations and kriged values for synthesizing the ks field in any case a common insight is that over a large area a very reduced number of ks measurements can be planed 5 conclusions experimental data concerning the spatial heterogeneity of ks are generally synthesized in terms of geometric mean and coefficient of variation while existing semi empirical and semi analytical areal infiltration models at the plot scale commonly involve the arithmetic mean of log transformed ks data and related coefficient of variation however the uncertainty associated with the estimate of these quantities has not been sufficiently investigated the approach presented here may be considered a useful tool to resolve this gap the main insights to be emphasized are a for a given value of n the uncertainty with k sl and cv al is much smaller than that on k s and cv g b the use of k sl and cv al as input data to areal average infiltration models at the plot scale influences through their uncertainty the computations of the expected areal average infiltration rate the analysis performed here provides a support for research aimed at quantifying this issue c the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval related to a properly selected n shows a rather limited variation with increasing the size of the study area beyond a threshold value a d once n and the associated uncertainty are determined estimations of the investigated quantities over a large plot could also be performed by confining the ks measurements to a much smaller sub region the selection of n sites should be made considering the spatial grid used for the statistical analysis e the value of n for assessing k s cv g k sl and cv al over a given sub region has been derived by the non parametric bootstrap method with replacement involving m random re samplings of n observed values of ks with m assumed equal to 2000 drawn from the complete set of available measurements thereby the bootstrap method does not allow a definition of the measurement sites more detailed than that specified at point d because different measurement networks could be chosen over the adopted spatial grid f the trend of the normalized uncertainty with increasing the area of sub regions of plot 1 see point c quite similar to that observed for k s by bagarello et al 2021 over a very different plot could be typical of many other plots however the remarkable difference found for a should be explained g our results achieved by the bootstrap method applied to observations of ks made over a grid of 3 m 3 m should not be significantly influenced at least for areas larger than a by an increase in the measurement density simulations carried out by bagarello et al 2021 using different densities over a specific plot support this statement in principle for a fixed measurement density the proposed approach is expected to be more accurate with increasing the number of available measurements and area in our case this means that for the larger plot with 40 observations the outcomes would be more reliable however the similar trend of results obtained in the smaller areas appears to be reasonable finally it is important to note that our study at the plot scale should stimulate further investigations useful for applications of distributed hydrological models at the watershed scale credit authorship contribution statement a

7775,study region this study refers to the hydrological open air laboratory hoal watershed located in south west austria study focus the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is sometimes synthetized by geometric mean k s and coefficient of variation while areal average infiltration models rely upon the arithmetic mean k sl associated to log transformed ks and relative coefficient of variation cv al robust estimation of k sl and cv al as well as of k s and associated coefficient of variation cv g would require a large number of ks observations the determination of the minimum number of ks measurements n for obtaining sufficiently accurate values of each aforementioned quantity over an area is an open issue addressed here a statistical approach has been applied to ks datasets on three grassy plots for an uncertainty analysis based on the non parametric bootstrap method with replacement the uncertainty of each quantity has been derived for different observation numbers and areas new hydrological insights for the region considering different sub regions in the largest plot the uncertainty is almost invariant with increasing the sub region area beyond a threshold furthermore for a given n the uncertainty of k sl and cv al is much smaller than that of k s and cv g our approach defines a methodology for determining over an area the n

transport through the vadose zone as well as the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and overland flow at different spatial scales under natural conditions it is characterized by extensive spatial heterogeneity variations over two orders of magnitude have been reported even at small catchment scales sharma et al 1987 loague and gardner 1990 baiamonte et al 2017 as well as at the hillslope and plot scales papanicolaou et al 2015 morbidelli et al 2017 picciafuoco et al 2019 the heterogeneity of ks influences infiltration which in turn affects surface and sub surface flows especially for light and moderate rainfall events the quantity ks depends on soil matrix basic properties such as structure and texture as well as land cover and management practices in addition the presence of macropores and other preferential flow paths can greatly influence the ks variability most of these features cannot be fully quantified therefore the heterogeneity of ks is often represented as a random field with a univariate probability density function pdf that is commonly recognized to be lognormal in nature nielsen et al 1973 greminger et al 1985 sharma et al 1987 loague and gander 1990 in this context considering the spatial variability of ks under natural conditions only in the hypothetical case of knowledge of ks over a very narrow spatial grid it would not be necessary to synthesize the ks field however even in this case solutions of distributed models with this spatial resolution would not be possible at the scales of interest therefore the determination of quantities which allow a simplified representation of the ks field is required recently proposed theoretical models for estimating expected areal infiltration rate and overland flow in both vertically homogeneous and layered soils require for the ks log transformed values the knowledge of the arithmetic mean k sl standard deviation σ al or relative coefficient of variation cv al that allow to define the pdf of ks corradini et al 2011a b corradini et al 2017 the ks geometric mean k s and the coefficient of variation cv g have been also used to synthetize the observed spatially heterogeneity reynolds et al 2000 skøien and blöschl 2006 verbist et al 2013 ahmed et al 2015 picciafuoco et al 2019 bagarello et al 2021 for a reliable joint estimate of k sl and cv al as well as k s and cv g many local ks data would be needed however these data are usually obtained by devices e g the traditional well permeameters and double ring infiltrometers that involve an indirect procedure based on long duration measurements of infiltration rate performed until steady conditions are observed each experiment can last several hours measurement techniques that do not require attainment of steady conditions do exist bagarello et al 2014 nevertheless the planning of monitoring campaigns with a proper density of measurements over extended areas is not straightforward because of possible variations in environmental conditions for instance heavy rainfalls occurring in the middle of a campaign could produce a decrease of ks particularly over bare soils assouline and mualem 2000 morbidelli et al 2011 leading to incomparable values of ks important insights for addressing the above issues can be obtained by experimental analyses aimed at identifying control factors of ks and through the knowledge of the minimum number of measurements required for a reliable assessment of means and coefficients of variation at the plot scale as a support for investigations at larger scales vieira et al 1981 examined the spatial heterogeneity of ks in an area of 8800 m2 using 1280 measurements of infiltration rates through a geostatistical approach they deduced that a minimum of 128 observations was sufficient to have nearly the same information as obtained by the complete dataset skøien and blöschl 2006 examined the effect of the scale triplet average distance between samples extent of the sampled domain and average support area of one measurement on the estimates of k s spatial variance and range of ks in a landscape on the basis of the selected scale triplet the authors generated 1000 synthetic random fields and from each realization sampled some ks values for each realization they compared the sample geometric mean and variance with those of the entire random field their main results suggested that for a given number of samples the uncertainty of k s increased with increasing the spacing between ks samples in any case actual measurements of ks could have different characteristics than those obtained by the approach of skøien and blöschl 2006 ahmed et al 2015 performed infiltration measurements in six roadside grassed swales from which the spatial distribution of ks was derived a dataset with 722 values were generated by a falling head device applying an uncertainty analysis on the sub dataset observed in 4 swales they found that 20 spatially distributed values of ks were the minimum number required for estimating a representative k s of a swale with acceptable uncertainty picciafuoco et al 2019 carried out infiltration measurements using double ring infiltrometers in 12 plots of a small austrian watershed and derived 131 spatially distributed ks values the data were found slightly related to physical and topographical soil features but strongly affected by land use large values of ks were obtained in arable fields where k s and cv g values much larger than those in grassland areas were deduced the authors used an uncertainty analysis based on the non parametric bootstrap method carpenter and bithell 2000 to determine the minimum number of ks measurements necessary over a given plot for assessing k s with a target accuracy the 95 confidence interval of k s decreased with increasing the number of measurements and the addition of measurements beyond the minimum number did not produce significant benefits bagarello et al 2021 examined the ks spatial variability in two adjacent plots characterized by bare clay soil in each plot they first observed 176 values of ks obtained by single ring infiltrometers 30 cm diameter through a simplified falling head technique bagarello et al 2004 many months later they conducted a second monitoring campaign with a ring of different diameter 15 cm an uncertainty analysis was used to determine the minimum number of ks measurements to be chosen for estimating k s with a specified accuracy the effects of the extent of the sample area and of the density of available measurements on the uncertainty analysis were also examined they noted that the use of the device with the larger ring reduced the minimum number of ks measurements by a factor 2 with respect to the one required with the smaller ring the above discussion points out that previous studies including picciafuoco et al 2019 concerned only k s and joint estimates of the uncertainty associated to k s and cv g and especially to k sl and cv al have not been resolved while their importance in hydrology is widely recognized at any spatial scale the main objective of this paper is to fill the existing gap by a statistical approach involving random variables for developing an uncertainty analysis based on the non parametric bootstrap method with replacement in this context the minimum number n of ks measurements necessary for obtaining a nearly stable 95 confidence interval associated to k s k sl and their respective coefficients of variation is determined measurements carried out by picciafuoco et al 2019 on three plots of a small austrian watershed characterized by silty loam soil covered by grass have been selected they used these observations to investigate by the non parametric bootstrap method without replacement only the uncertainty on k s following carpenter and bithell 2000 these data have been examined here through a different re sampling procedure bagarello et al 2021 used a similar statistical approach but their study was limited to k s furthermore the ks measurements were carried out over an area of south italy with much smaller extension and characterized by different soil type and soil cover these differences through a comparative analysis of results allow to assess the possibility to transfer some insights of this study to other plots the representation of the ks random field in terms of estimated k s and cv g and their uncertainty can be useful for comparing different experimental studies while that based on the estimate of k sl cv al and their uncertainty is required for the solution of semi empirical smith and goodrich 2000 and semi analytical govindaraju et al 2001 corradini et al 2017 flammini et al 2018 areal infiltration models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental data a dataset has been extracted from infiltration measurements earlier performed by picciafuoco et al 2019 on the hydrological open air laboratory hoal watershed area of 0 66 km2 located in south west austria the main soil use in the watershed was represented by arable land 87 the remaining part was characterized by forested area with grassland and high stemmed vegetation of low density without brushwood 6 pasture 5 and paved surfaces 2 blöschl et al 2016 since the forested area was substantially covered by grassland it was considered jointly with pasture as grassland area organic matter content clay silt and sand percentages were estimated at the infiltration measurement sites from data available on a 50 m 50 m grid local elevation and slope were derived by a digital terrain model minimum spatial variability was found for organic matter and textural composition with coefficient of variation associated to the arithmetic mean less than 15 while a value of about 30 was observed for the slope angle according to the usda united states department of agriculture soil classification the topsoil types of the watershed inferred from the 50 m x 50 m grid data were silty loam 75 of the area silty clay loam 20 and silt 5 using a 3 m x 3 m grid infiltration measurements were performed in 131 sites on 12 plots of which 9 were characterized as grassland and 3 were subjected to agricultural practice double ring infiltrometers with internal and external rings of 30 and 60 cm respectively were used in all the grassland areas ks measurements were carried out during the spring period of 3 weeks while in the agricultural areas they were performed in a period of 2 months between harvest and tillage however in each plot the measurements were completed within a maximum of 3 days the statistical approach anova armstrong et al 2000 was chosen by picciafuoco et al 2019 for estimating the variance of the data observed in different plots with the objective of understanding whether the spatial variability of ks was linked to specific soil characteristics such as texture organic matter slope elevation and land cover among these quantities the results highlighted that the land cover had a major role in determining the ks variability and that k s in arable and grassy plots was significantly different in this study three grassland plots see fig 1 with 40 20 and 9 available measurements characterized by the same spatial density have been selected to analyse the value of n required for determining over a given area k s cv g k sl and cv al with a specific level of uncertainty the choice of these three plots has been made on the basis of the following considerations i the plots had the same grassy land cover with 69 measurements of ks while only 24 observations were available on the three arable plots ii the plots had measurements with similar density over very different areas ranging from 80 m2 to 595 m2 iii in the three grassy plots ks measurements were performed in a short period not affected by rain thereby as a first approximation the data could also be considered representative of simultaneous sampling on the other hand the measurements in the three arable plots occurred over a much longer duration table 1 shows a minor variability of both soil structure and topographic features of the three plots that are characterized by the same soil type silty loam and land use table 2 displays the general statistics of the observed datasets of ks in the three plots for plot 1 and plot 2 the arithmetic mean of ks k s is greater than k s by about a factor 2 while a reverse trend is observed between the coefficients of variation associated to k s cv a and cv g the same trends characterize plot 3 but the differences between similar quantities are not significant the data of table 2 suggest that the ks spatial variability in each plot between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude was probably linked to random factors similar minimum values of ks were observed while the maximum value increased of about 60 from plot 3 to the two larger plots between the smallest and largest plot cv a and cv g approximately varied by factors 2 and 3 respectively finally by applying the classical statistical analysis to the ks data n 40 observed over plot 1 it was found that the associated pdf was of lognormal type 2 2 statistical approach the adoption of a consolidated statistical approach is required to reach the pre established objectives over a given plot the spatial variability of the saturated hydraulic conductivity is commonly represented by a random variable k s and is characterized by a log normal pdf that is undefined because the involved parameters are usually unknown robust estimations of means k s k sl and respective coefficients of variation cv g cv al should be obtained through a significant but not too large number of measurements considering that as previously mentioned under natural conditions the monitoring period should be rather limited therefore it is important to determine the appropriate minimum number of measurements n and related confidence intervals in which the investigated quantities are included this issue can be solved considering that a sample of n independent observations k s k s 1 k s 2 k sn is a realization of a variety of possible samples involving values drawn from a random sample k s k s 1 k s 2 k sn with each component characterized by the same pdf of ks this implies that the samples should be drawn from the k s population that is unknown hence an approximated approach is needed this issue is addressed here using all the observations n carried out in a given plot as the ensemble of ks values from which a great number of samples of dimension n is drawn different values of n with n n have been examined to determine for each investigated quantity the n value associated to a condition of nearly steady confidence interval along these lines the numerical approach known as the non parametric bootstrap method has been selected for developing an uncertainty analysis based on the estimate of the normalized 95 confidence intervals of k s cv g k sl and cv al for different values of n in each plot this method is recognized to be suitable for applications to datasets that do not allow to estimate the pdf of the random variable following carpenter and bithell 2000 a re sampling procedure with replacement has been adopted and repeated m times with m 2000 over a given plot from the complete set of n available measurements m samples sub sets each one with the same n value have been taken out synthetically a re sampling matrix r ˆ n of n x m data of ks denoted by ki j with i 1 n and j 1 m has been obtained 1 r ˆ n k 1 1 k 1 2 k 1 m k 2 1 k 2 2 k 2 m k n 1 k n 2 k n m n 4 n and m 2 000 where each column represents a sample of ks values individually extracted from the complete dataset from each sample the arithmetic mean k nj l the geometric mean k nj and the associated coefficients of variation cv nj al and cv nj g respectively have been computed as 2 k 1 nj 1 n i 1 n k i j j 1 m 3 cv nj al 1 k nj l i 1 n k i j k nj l 2 n 1 j 1 m 4 k nj i 1 n k i j n j 1 m 5 cv nj g 1 k nj i 1 n k i j k nj 2 n 1 j 1 m where ki j i 1 n and j 1 m in eqs 2 and 3 denotes log transformed values of ks from the set of m values obtained for each quantity the corresponding 95 confidence limit has been first deduced in the standard form as difference between the 97 5 and 2 5 percentiles then a normalized form of the 95 confidence interval has been obtained through its ratio with the mean of the m values of k nj l cv nj al k nj and cv nj g denoted henceforth as k sn l cv n al k sn and cv n g respectively the aforementioned statistical analysis has been applied to the datasets available over the three selected grassland plots and over nine sub regions of plot 1 of 55 110 165 215 280 345 405 470 and 535 m2 the larger sub regions included all the smaller ones and the corresponding available measurements of ks the partition of plot 1 has been made for determining for a given uncertainty how the required minimum number of ks observations varies with increasing the study area 3 results representative outcomes of the uncertainty analysis performed are synthesized for each investigated quantity by providing the normalized 95 confidence interval as a function of the number of usable ks measurements and its width for the different sub regions the reduction of the 95 confidence interval width associated with the increase of the number of local observations is also discussed the above normalization has been carried out dividing the 95 confidence interval by the variable average value referred to the given n k sn l for k sl and cv n al for cv al k sn for k s and cv n g for cv g the normalization procedure makes visual comparison of the results easier and meaningful because these are properly scaled considering the different values of the normalizing variable among the investigated areas and the differences due to the use of ks values for k s and cv g and of log transformed ks values for k sl and cv al before displaying the results to avoid confusion with the study of picciafuoco et al 2019 it is necessary to specify that they focused their analysis on k s and denoted plot 1 plot 2 and plot 3 as plot 2 plot 11 12 and plot 7 respectively furthermore in their study the re sampling procedure of the bootstrap method was limited to m 1000 and the sub regions of plot 1 were examined up to 345 m2 3 1 uncertainty analysis of k s and cv g figs 2 and 3 highlight the outcomes achieved here for k s fig 2 shows that the widths of the normalized 95 confidence intervals for plot 1 and plot 2 steeply decrease up to about n 16 while for the smallest plot plot 3 a very limited decrease is observed up to n 6 the uncertainties in plot 1 and plot 2 are very similar and significantly larger than in plot 3 the widths reduce with increasing the number of measurements tending as deduced from the computations in absolute terms to values almost close to k s for n equal to the maximum number of ks available observations see also table 2 the outcomes of a more in depth analysis on the role of plot area in determining the uncertainty associated to the estimate of k s are given in fig 3 where the widths of the normalized 95 confidence intervals computed for plot 1 and its 9 sub regions are represented for different numbers of measurements n 4 16 for any value of n the normalized uncertainty increases up to about 50 in the area range between 110 m2 and 345 m2 and subsequently experiences a slight lowering for the larger sub regions up to the entire plot 1 the same dataset selected for the uncertainty analysis associated to the assessment of k s has been used for that linked with the estimate of cv g fig 4 highlights that the widths of the normalized 95 confidence intervals for plot 1 and plot 2 have a significant reduction up to n 16 and for plot 3 up to n 9 the uncertainty in the three plots is not much different with the curves of the normalized 95 confidence interval of the largest plot nearly coincident with those of the smallest plot and very close to the curves of plot 2 increasing n the normalized 95 confidence intervals become narrower and in absolute terms tend towards values closer to the cv g values given in table 2 in fig 5a more extensive representation of the link between the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval and the area is displayed for different values of n in the largest plot and its sub regions for any area the uncertainty level reduces with increasing n while for any specific n it is essentially constant for areas increasing from 110 m2 to 595 m2 on the other hand it has an appreciable growth from 55 m2 to 110 m2 for n 7 3 2 uncertainty analysis of k sl and cv al the results of the uncertainty analysis are displayed for k sl figs 6 and 7 and cv al figs 8 and 9 following the same lines adopted for k s and cv g figs 6 and 8 show that for the three plots the normalized curves of k sl and cv al with increasing n have trends and relative positions similar to those obtained for k s and cv g respectively for their width some significant differences with respect to the corresponding geometric variables can be deduced comparing figs 6 and 8 with figs 2 and 4 respectively specifically the width associated to each plot for k sl is significantly smaller than that for k s furthermore the three plots have widths for cv al reduced up to about 50 with respect to those for cv g for any value of n thus for a given level of uncertainty the number of ks measurements required for determining k sl and cv al is smaller than that for k s and cv g a more detailed representation of the width of the normalized 95 confidence intervals associated to k sl and cv al as function of area is shown in figs 7 and 9 respectively for different n values in plot 1 and its sub regions the uncertainty decreases for any area with increasing the number of observations up to 16 of the available ones 40 in plot 1 furthermore for k sl it experiences a steep growth for areas up to 165 m2 with n 7 while for each n it assumes a nearly constant value for larger areas up to 595 m2 as to the uncertainty associated to cv al for n 7 it decreases for areas up to 165 m2 while for larger areas stays at a nearly constant value for each n 4 comparing the results illustrated in figs 7 and 9 with those of figs 3 and 5 respectively it can be deduced that there are appreciable differences in the trends of the width of the normalized 95 confidence intervals jointly with substantial reductions of the uncertainty from the two geometric quantities to the arithmetic ones 4 discussion of results significant effects of the spatial variability of ks on surface runoff and infiltration have been shown by hydrological modeling at the plot scale for soils subjected to light and moderate rainfall events as a basis for studies at larger scales a monte carlo method assuming a lognormal pdf with given k sl and cv al was commonly used to assess the effects of this spatial variability smith and hebbert 1979 maller and sharma 1981 saghafian et al 1995 empirical and semi analytical models for estimating mean areal infiltration have been proposed corradini et al 2017 they require the knowledge of k sl and σ al or cv al for synthesizing the pdf of ks a joint interpretation of results of k sl and cv al for modeling use as well as of k s and cv g for characterizing the ks field is required subsequently the possibility to use a minimum number of ks measurements at an acceptable level of uncertainty suitable for estimating both geometric and arithmetic quantities is examined the data shown in terms of normalized 95 confidence interval and its width as a function of n and area help us to understand the trend of the uncertainty associated with each quantity a comparison of figs 2 and 4 suggests that for plots 1 and 2 a minimum number of measurements n 16 with normalized uncertainty of about 1 2 would be an appropriate choice for the estimate of both k s and cv g on the other hand for plot 3 different values of n would be required in particular n 6 with normalized uncertainty of about 1 1 for the assessment of k s and n n 9 with doubled uncertainty for cv g for the three different plots n increases from the smallest 80 m2 to the middle 200 m2 and then remains unchanged for the largest one 595 m2 importantly the link between n and area can be deduced from figs 3 and 5 considering the differences existing between their data associated to a sole plot with 9 sub regions each containing all the smaller ones and from figs 2 and 4 referred to 3 plots characterized by significant differences in terms of means and coefficients of variation of ks table 2 a comparison of figs 3 and 5 indicates that for each n the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval for cv g has a more regular trend with increasing area a minimum value n 10 appears to be suitable for approximating both k s and cv g on areas from 165 m2 to 595 m2 with the two variables characterized by a nearly constant normalized uncertainty of about 1 8 increasing the minimum number to n 16 the normalized uncertainty decreases by about 25 on the other hand at least for k s with n up to 10 the uncertainty tends to reduce with decreasing area from 165 m2 down to 110 m2 these evaluations are limited by the grid 3 m x 3 m used for the ks measurements that implied a total number of 6 observation on the smallest sub region of plot 1 of area 55 m2 overall this comparison indicates that over a large grassland plot of 595 m2 a minimum number of ks measurements for reasonably approximating k s and cv g is n 10 the measurements could be carried out over a much smaller sub region over a grid of 3 m x 3 m as previously mentioned the estimates of k sl and cv al are involved as inputs in areal infiltration modeling they enable us to determine the pdf of ks and therefore its moments of any order required in a few recently proposed models for instance one may consider the semi analytical model of corradini et al 2017 first presented here through implicit functions f1 and f2 for spatially uniform and steady rainfall rate r and negligible runon in a given soil the expected areal average infiltration rate i f as a function of cumulative infiltration f can be expressed as 6 i f f 1 f r k sl σ al with σ al cv al k sl and the relation between the expected time t and f by 7 t f f 2 f r k sl σ al eqs 6 and 7 in explicit form involve the moments of the lognormal pdf of ks that can be obtained for given values of k sl and cv al the two combined equations represent the expected areal average infiltration rate as a function of the expected time i t in this context the uncertainty associated to the estimate of k sl and cv al performed by a reduced number of ks measurements leads to an uncertainty interval for i f t f and i t for an explicit formulation of this modeling the reader is referred to appendix a comparison of figs 6 and 8 indicates that the normalized 95 confidence interval of k sl as a function of n is fairly narrower than that of cv al on plot 1 and plot 2 n 16 with widths of about 0 6 and 0 4 respectively appears to be suitable for k sl the same value of n gives a width of about 1 for plot 1 and 0 7 for plot 2 for cv al therefore n 16 is a satisfactory choice for estimating both k sl and cv al in the two larger plots even though with a greater uncertainty for cv al on plot 3 n 7 gives a width of about 0 4 for k sl while n tending to 9 produces a much larger width at least doubled for cv al thereby n increases from the smallest plot to the middle one while remains unchanged over the largest plot clearer insights for determining k sl and cv al can be derived from the analysis of the outcomes achieved for the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval as a function of the area associated to plot 1 and its sub regions figs 7 and 9 show that for k sl and cv al the broken lines have similar trend in the area range 110 595 m2 for n 5 for both k sl and cv al the choice of n 10 with an uncertainty of about 0 4 for k sl and 1 3 for cv al appears to be reasonable in this area range adopting n 16 the uncertainty reduces by about 20 a combination of the outcomes above discussed indicates that a choice of n 10 can be considered appropriate for estimating k s and cv g as well as k sl and cv al in a large grassy plot of 595 m2 and in its smaller sub regions of area down to 110 m2 however the estimates of the two arithmetic variables have much lower uncertainties with values reduced of 70 for k sl and 27 for cv al only adopting n n 40 the assessments of k s and cv g in plot 1 see figs 2 and 4 would have accuracy similar to the ones computed for k sl and cv al with n 10 see figs 6 and 8 a comparison of our results for k s with those previously found by bagarello et al 2021 who used a non parametric bootstrap method with replacement can be made to interpret the approach utility over different study plots the normalized uncertainty as a function of area of the sub regions of plot 1 fig 3 beyond a threshold value a 165 m2 for k s and cv g 110 m2 for k sl and cv al has a trend similar to that derived for k s by bagarello et al 2021 over sub regions of a much smaller plot 88 m2 however they found a very different value of a about 28 m2 even though a similar statistical method was involved some important factors differentiated these two plots these factors were soil type silty loam and clay soil cover grass and bare soil and environmental conditions region of south west austria and south italy they could be linked with the value of a through further investigations to be performed in other properly selected plots in any case on the basis of these deductions it can be expected that a similar trend of uncertainty characterizes a variety of plots a comparison has also been made between figs 3 and 11 of picciafuoco et al 2019 and some differences due to the different version of the adopted non parametric bootstrap method have been found in addition picciafuoco et al 2019 limited their analysis to an area range up to 345 m2 narrower than that considered in this study up to 595 m2 and they did not detect the steady trend of the curves observed here our outcomes are not conflicting with those of ahmed et al 2015 who for determining k s selected 20 ks data over a grassed swale of area more extended than that of plot 1 as a value of n balanced between experimental effort and accuracy a more extended comparison cannot be made because they did not examine either the link between area and n for k s and did not consider the estimate of cv g k sl and cv al a comparison in depth of our results with those presented by vieira et al 1981 is barred because they limited their study to the construction of a contour map of ks for a given area using both observations and kriged values for synthesizing the ks field in any case a common insight is that over a large area a very reduced number of ks measurements can be planed 5 conclusions experimental data concerning the spatial heterogeneity of ks are generally synthesized in terms of geometric mean and coefficient of variation while existing semi empirical and semi analytical areal infiltration models at the plot scale commonly involve the arithmetic mean of log transformed ks data and related coefficient of variation however the uncertainty associated with the estimate of these quantities has not been sufficiently investigated the approach presented here may be considered a useful tool to resolve this gap the main insights to be emphasized are a for a given value of n the uncertainty with k sl and cv al is much smaller than that on k s and cv g b the use of k sl and cv al as input data to areal average infiltration models at the plot scale influences through their uncertainty the computations of the expected areal average infiltration rate the analysis performed here provides a support for research aimed at quantifying this issue c the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval related to a properly selected n shows a rather limited variation with increasing the size of the study area beyond a threshold value a d once n and the associated uncertainty are determined estimations of the investigated quantities over a large plot could also be performed by confining the ks measurements to a much smaller sub region the selection of n sites should be made considering the spatial grid used for the statistical analysis e the value of n for assessing k s cv g k sl and cv al over a given sub region has been derived by the non parametric bootstrap method with replacement involving m random re samplings of n observed values of ks with m assumed equal to 2000 drawn from the complete set of available measurements thereby the bootstrap method does not allow a definition of the measurement sites more detailed than that specified at point d because different measurement networks could be chosen over the adopted spatial grid f the trend of the normalized uncertainty with increasing the area of sub regions of plot 1 see point c quite similar to that observed for k s by bagarello et al 2021 over a very different plot could be typical of many other plots however the remarkable difference found for a should be explained g our results achieved by the bootstrap method applied to observations of ks made over a grid of 3 m 3 m should not be significantly influenced at least for areas larger than a by an increase in the measurement density simulations carried out by bagarello et al 2021 using different densities over a specific plot support this statement in principle for a fixed measurement density the proposed approach is expected to be more accurate with increasing the number of available measurements and area in our case this means that for the larger plot with 40 observations the outcomes would be more reliable however the similar trend of results obtained in the smaller areas appears to be reasonable finally it is important to note that our study at the plot scale should stimulate further investigations useful for applications of distributed hydrological models at the watershed scale credit authorship contribution statement a

runoff an important buffer against drought is enhancing with climate warming projection of glacier especially small glaciers runoff change is imperative for adapting to climate change and mitigating relevant risks we aim to provide an up to date knowledge of the glacier area and runoff change for 2016 2099 in the sanjiangyuan new hydrological insights for the region projections based on cmip6

abstract ga1 keywords the sanjiangyuan glacier area change glacier runoff future projections the tibetan plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the high mountain asia hma or asia water tower has the largest glacier area outside the polar regions encompassing over 97 590 km2 approximately 30 of the mountain glaciers area all over the world farinotti et al 2019 the valuable freshwater from the glacier melt to many prominent rivers in the hma meets the requirements of nearly 2 5 billion people pritchard 2019 as well as agriculture irrigation biemans et al 2019 due to rapid climate warming a great majority of glaciers in the hma are experiencing mass loss and are becoming more vulnerable brun et al 2017 immerzeel et al 2020 miles et al 2021 small glaciers may even disappear in the 21st century hock et al 2019 huss and hock 2018 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 as glacier melt continues glacier runoff typically transforms from peak water to low flow eventually huss and hock 2018 this will enhance water stress and threaten water security for the local and downstream the sanjiangyuan is known as the water tower of china which is located in the northeastern tibetan plateau tp is the headwater of the yangtze river yellow river and lancang upper mekong river which together contribute 411 m3 s streamflow to the downstream and support the ecosystem and livelihood of the population in the local eastern china and southeast asia cuo et al 2014 the sanjiangyuan contains 1406 glaciers whose glacier area is approximately of 2237 km2 lin et al 2022 the headwater basins rely on the glacier runoff supply due to dry alpine climate especially in dry and warm season huss and hock 2018 su et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 based on the second chinese glacier inventory cgi 2 about 85 of the glaciers in the sanjiangyuan are smaller than 2 km2 which is facing the fate of disappearance in the future the glacier runoff in the sanjiangyuan will be more likely to undergo the transition because most glaciers are small glaciers water stress will become a serious issue for local ecosystem and growing populations wang et al 2021 better understanding of glacier runoff peak water and its timing in the sanjiangyuan is therefore crucial for not only regional climate impact assessment and water management for the local and downstream but also providing reference for studying global mountainous watersheds where water resources are rely on small and medium sized glaciers the general consensus is that glacier mass in the sanjiangyuan is projected to experience remarkable loss in the future and the glacier area will continue to shrink huss and hock 2018 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 resulting in significant change in glacier runoff rounce et al 2020 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 however there are considerable differences in the projection of the amount of glacier runoff especially in the peak water and its timing in the 21st century one of the reasons is that previous studies did not consider the spatiotemporal variation of the degree day factors ddf used in the glacier model which is a key parameter for the degree day model treating ddf as a constant su et al 2016 or a coefficient depending on aspect zhao et al 2019 or just calibrating ddf rounce et al 2020 are common practices however in situ monitoring shows significant spatiotemporal ddf variation among glaciers in the hma zhang et al 2006a previous studies also demonstrated that ddf should be a coefficient closely related to the sky solar radiation hock 1999 2003 due to scarce glacier mass balance measurement in the hma widely available remote sensing mass balance products remotely sensed mass balance is frequently used to calibrate model parameters many studies also applied aster grace and icesat data to calibrate model parameters huss and hock 2015 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 for example aster mass balance dataset covering a great number of glaciers in the hma with median uncertainty of 0 22 m w e a 1 was also used to calibrate parameters rounce et al 2020 compared to remote sensing mass balance glacier inventory dataset is more accurate and could produce a better glacier simulation when it is used as a reference for calibrating glacier model zhao et al 2019 the inventory provides a possibility to calibrate parameters for every glacier thus enabling us to better constrain models to produce reasonable glacier areas in the historical period and credible future projections earth system models esms are used to understand climate change since the establishment of the cmip in 1995 cmip has released two phases of esm results cmip5 and cmip6 the cmip5 had great discrepancy in precipitation across the tp such as overestimation of total precipitation in the southeastern tp jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2014 missing spatial differences of seasonal and monsoonal precipitation in the tp duan et al 2013 su et al 2013 which are likely due to the coarse resolution and insufficient subgrid scale physics in the esms of the cmip5 the effects of intricate atmospheric and ocean circulations and their connections and the complex tp terrains chen et al 2017 while in the cmip6 esms have improved physical schemes model resolution and biogeochemical processes veronika et al 2016 which could yield better future climate projection studies reporting the glacier and runoff changes using the cmip6 esm archive are just emerging gao et al 2020 ji et al 2020 up to date how glacier and runoff in the sanjiangyuan region will change in response to the cmip6 climate projection remains unclear in this study a mass balance model is first improved by adopting spatiotemporally varied ddf calculated from the clear sky solar radiation in the glacier model next monitored mass balance and glacier runoff at the xdkmd xiao dongkemadi glacier and areas from two glacier inventory datasets that span 4 decades and cover all the glaciers in the sanjiangyuan are used as reference to calibrate the model parameters during the historical period the aster result is further adopted to validate the simulation result then the calibrated and validated glacier model is run over 2016 2099 using the downscaled and bias corrected cmip6 esm projections the objective is to provide the most recent and credible understanding of changes in glacier area and number and timing of peak water of glacier runoff in the 21st century in the sanjiangyuan 2 methodology 2 1 study area the sanjiangyuan is located in the northeastern tp fig 1 with an area and average elevation of approximately 3 61 105 km2 and 5000 m a s l respectively ji et al 2020 the averaged annual precipitation is 467 mm and air temperature is 1 56 base on latest glacier inventory guo et al 2015 glaciers are mostly distributed in the yangtze river basin where glacier number accounts for 74 0 and glacier area is about 87 7 in the sanjiangyuan the yellow river basin contains about 6 1 of the glacier number and 4 7 of the glacier area and the lancang river basin has 20 3 and 7 5 respectively these glaciers are the summer accumulation type which are sensitive to the summer precipitation and temperature change wang et al 2019 xdkmd glacier is the only long time monitored glacier in the sanjiangyuan fig 1 and its glacier mass balance was monitored from 1989 to 2010 2 2 data 2 2 1 glacier inventory data areas from the two glacier area datasets i e the first chinese glacier inventory cgi 1 and the second chinese glacier inventory cgi 2 were used the cgi 1 was used as model initial input data and the cgi 2 was adopted to calibrate the model parameters the former was generated using historical topographic maps acquired from 1980s shi et al 2009 with area error less than 5 for most glaciers and less than 10 for all glaciers in china wu and li 2011 the quality of the cgi 1 is suitable for glacier mass balance and glacier runoff simulation the cgi 2 is an updated version of the cgi 1 completed based on images from landsat tm etm aster and google earth images from 2004 to 2011 with an error of 3 2 guo et al 2015 area difference between cgi 1 and cgi 2 is shown in table 1 based on the cgi 2 the lancang river basin has the greatest proportion 84 6 of glaciers with area less than 1 km2 the yellow river basin has 76 7 and the yangtze river basin has 69 1 these small glaciers are especially vulnerable to warming climate 2 2 2 climate data the glacier mass balance model was driven by monthly climate data from the gridded 0 25º spatial resolution daily temperature and precipitation data in 1957 2016 the grid climate data were generated by considering elevation effects on observed daily temperature and precipitation and using the synographic mapping system symap interpolation algorithm data at 181 temperature stations and 357 precipitation stations were used to generate the grids that cover the entire tp the detailed of the gridding approach and the evaluation of the dataset is provided in cuo et al 2013 cmip6 projection data were used to drive the model for future projection over 2016 2099 the 31 cmip6 models and four socioeconomic shared pathways ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 representing sustainable middle of the road regional rivalry and fossil fuel development approaches respectively were selected supplementary table s1 in total 116 combinations of models and ssp scenarios were used the resolution of these cmip6 models ranges from 0 495 º to 3 75º all glacier runoff simulations used the rlilp1 ensemble member in order to match the resolutions between the historical and cmip6 forcing we adopted the dc v method a statistically downscaling method by which the ssp data were corrected by referencing to historical monthly values and variance wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 dc v method ensures that gridded temperature and precipitation means and variability in 1957 2016 were the same as or similar to the cmip6 models the downscaled and bias corrected future monthly temperature and precipitation in 2016 2099 were used to drive the model given the objective of the study we will examine the future monthly time series not 30 year decadal time step as many future studies did previously 2 2 3 dem data dem digital elevation model was used to calculate the sky solar radiation for each glacier thus quantifying the ddfc difference among all glaciers in the sanjiangyuan glacier surface dem was clipped by srtm dem jarvis et al 2008 and which was used to extract the glacier aspect and slope with a spatial resolution of 30 m 2 2 4 mass balance data the monitored mass balance at the xdkmd glacier was also used to calibrate the model and aster mass balance data was used to validate model the mass balance at the xdkmd glacier during the period of 1989 2010 comes from wgms world glacier monitoring service wgms 2022 which is the longest and only mass balance record 22 year available in the sanjiangyuan so far wgsm published mass balance records for more than 65 glaciers in the hma most are more than 3 years wang et al 2019 calibrated and validated model parameters at xdkmd were used for the entire study area as initial parameter values these initial values were further calibrated based on the cgi 2 and aster result the aster results from 2000 to 2016 were obtained by calculating elevation difference brun et al 2017 covering most glaciers in the hma there was a high deviation in mass balance for individual glaciers ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 m w e a 1 depending on some factors such as glacier area and image quality or number available brun et al 2019 we extracted every glacier in the aster mass balance dataset and matched with glaciers in the sanjiangyuan using the cgi 2 glacier mask 2 3 glacier change model the mass balance model is a foundation for the glacier runoff simulation we chose the model by radic and hock 2011 to calculate glacier runoff which was demonstrated to be appropriate to simulate mass balance in monitored glaciers in the hma wang et al 2019 the detailed model method can be found in wang et al 2019 in this model we defined f c snow ice ddfc as the corrected degree day factor and f snow ice is ddf for snow or ice mm w e d 1 1 respectively 1 f snow ice c f snow ice k the ddfc is not uniform in space and time which is closely related to clear sky solar radiation hock 1999 immerzeel et al 2012 in this study k is the standardized clear sky solar radiation i in order to quantify the degree day factor differences for each glacier in the sanjiangyuan we calculated the clear sky solar radiation i for all glaciers 2 i i 0 r m r 2 ψ a p p 0 cos z cos z where i 0 is solar constant assumed to be 1368 w m2 r m r 2 is eccentricity correction factor of earth orbit over time r is the sun earth distance and r m is the mean sun earth distance ψ a is a mean vertical atmosphere clear sky transmissivity in the range of 0 6 0 9 here it is 0 75 hock 1999 p is atmospheric pressure and p 0 is sea level atmospheric pressure 101325 pa p p 0 shows the effect of altitude to solar radiation with lower air pressure corresponding to higher solar radiation and cos z represents the variability of the path length of solar rays passing through the atmosphere z is glacier grid zenith angle by multiplying with cos z eq 2 calculates projected horizontal surface receiving radiation in each glacier grid which varies among glaciers we used the volume area scaling relationship to simulate the glacier area which is a widely used method for glacier change simulation previously hock et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2010 raper and braithwaite 2006 zhao et al 2019 volume area v a scaling relationship was derived from glacier inventory data all over the world radić et al 2008 3 v c a γ where v is glacier volume km3 and a is glacier area of the whole glacier km2 according to optimal scaling constant based on measured ice thickness in western china from liang and tian 2022 c 0 0376 and the scaling exponents is γ 1 3475 2 4 glacier runoff according to bliss et al 2014 glacier runoff refers to all water that generated by the surface of all glaciers glacier runoff q is as a sum of rain p liq i ablation a i and refreezing r i in the glacier area in each elevation band s i from all elevation bands as follows 4 q i 1 n s i a i p liq i r i we assume that evaporation sublimation and any storage changes groundwater englacial or subglacial in glacierized band is negligible which proves to be reasonable by huss et al 2008 the glacier runoff is integrated over an annually updated glacier area called moving gauge glacier runoff with glacier retreats or advances over the time rounce et al 2020 similar to peak water calculated from huss and hock 2018 we calculate peak water and its timing based on the time series of 11 year moving average of the simulated annual glacier runoff for 2016 2099 3 result 3 1 model parameter of calibration and validation 3 1 1 model parameter optimization the model calibration period is 1970 2016 depending on the two glacier inventory datasets and glacier area do not change in the model before 1970 due to data limitation with reference to the monitored xdkmd glacier in the sanjiangyuan we optimized model parameters to obtain the minimum deviation between the simulated and observed annual mass balance timeseries radić and hock 2011 wang et al 2019 rmse and r2 were used to examine the goodness of fit the key parameters and their initial value ranges for xdkmd glacier are shown in table 2 radić and hock 2011 wang et al 2019 tlap refers to the statistical lapse rate glap is the temperature lapse rate along the glacier surface f snow ice shows ddf for snow or ice kp is a precipitation correction factor used to interpolate the monthly precipitation from the climate grid data to the glacier maximum elevation band dpre is a precipitation gradient along the glacier surface and tsnow is the threshold temperature to distinguish snow or rainfall fig 2 a compares the simulated and observed annual mass balance for the xdkmd glacier with rmse of 0 21 m w e and r2 of 0 76 moreover we validated the glacier runoff using values from gao et al 2012 and zhang et al 1997 fig 2 b the model can capture the glacier runoff change even though there is discrepancy in 2008 2009 in general the model performs well in simulation of glacier mass balance and glacier runoff for xdkmd glacier therefore we further regionalized the ddf from the xdkmd glacier to the other glaciers by relationship with the standardized clear sky solar radiation previous study found that ddfc is spatiotemporally variable and is mainly affected by the topography and solar radiation in the sanjiangyuan zhang et al 2006b to extrapolate the ddf from the xdkmd glacier to other glaciers we calculated the sky solar radiation using eq 2 then ddfc of the other glaciers can be derived by extrapolating that of xdkmd glacier using eq 1 fig 3 shows that standardized clear sky solar radiation scksr for all glaciers are different low in the east and high in the west the other three model parameters that need calibration are the dprec glap and tsnow as shown in table 2 at this step glacier areas of all glaciers from cgi 2 that represent 2010 status were used for calibration the objective during calibration was to minimize the difference between the simulated and observed glacier area for every glacier this area referenced calibration step generated independent sets of model parameters for individual glaciers these parameter sets were adopted to simulate glacier runoff change in the future fig 4 shows the comparisons between simulated and observed glacier areas among four area classes 1 km2 1 5 km2 5 10 km2 and 10 km2 relative bias decreases with increasing glacier area especially in the group with glacier area larger than 10 km2 which has a relatively small bias the model underestimates the area of small glaciers less than 1 km2 with a greater relative bias the possible reason might be constant parameters of the glacier v a scaling fitted by observed glaciers with area ranging from 0 1 1000 km2 all over the world grinsted 2013 in addition small glaciers are more sensitive to climate change and their area change is more drastic making them difficult to simulate especially for some small glaciers which disappeared before the 2010 but the model determines the time of disappearance as 2012 it is also a challenge to accurately simulate glacier mass balance and area under the condition of data scarcity however small glaciers have limited glacier runoff and model deficiency in small glacier simulation might not affect basin integrated glacier runoff significantly as it is essentially dominated by larger glaciers 3 1 2 model validation glaciers in aster glacier wide mass balance dataset account for approximately 45 of the total glaciers number in the sanjiangyuan during 2000 2016 model validated at these 45 individual glaciers by comparing the simulated mass balance with aster mass balance over 2000 2016 fig 5 yielded rmse of 0 33 m w e a 1 the good agreement in simulated glacier area and mass balance generally indicates model is suitable for future glacier runoff projection in the sanjiangyuan the c 0 0376 and γ 1 3475 are key parameters in the mass balance model and differences in these parameters could lead to different glacier area and glacier runoff simulations to quantify their influence we conducted the sensitivity experiments on coefficients c 10 0 10 and γ 10 0 10 two sets of simulations were designed 1 γ kept constant c changed by 10 0 10 and 2 c kept constant γ changed by 10 0 10 the sensitivity test shows that glacier area and runoff were not sensitive to the parameters of c and γ in historical period table 3 although γ has a slightly more influence than c on glacier area and runoff 3 2 glacier area projections the spatial variations are apparent in the future temperature and precipitation for the four ssps fig 6 multi esm ensemble mean temperature will increase by 1 4 ºc for ssp1 2 6 2 6ºc for ssp2 4 5 5 2ºc for ssp3 7 0 and 6 0 ºc for ssp5 8 5 during 2016 2099 by the end of the 21st century the yangtze basin will experience the greatest temperature increase especially for glaciers in the northwest for ssp1 2 6 and in the south for higher emission scenarios compared to yangtze basin the yellow and lancang basins will experience a lower temperature increase throughout the century the precipitation is projected to increase slightly in sanjiangyuan with maximum precipitation increase by 19 mm for ssp5 8 5 while for other scenarios the increase of precipitation will be less than 10 mm such climate change pattern with remarkable temperature increase but moderate precipitation change will enhance the area reduction and glacier melt from 2016 2099 multi esm ensemble means of glacier area in the sanjiangyuan will reduce by 36 12 ssp1 2 6 42 20 ssp2 4 5 49 19 ssp3 7 0 and 61 15 ssp5 8 5 compared to 2016 the glacier area retreat increases with intense emission the response of glacier area to the climate change is complex although all basins will experience glacier shrinkage the relative shrinkage the fraction of the initial glacier area in 2016 varies significantly among basins fig 7 because of glacier area differences the lancang river basin will experience smaller relative glacier area decrease more than 61 for ssp1 2 6 while the yangtze and yellow basins will experience the smaller relative glacier area decrease less than 53 for both basins for ssp5 8 5 despite experiencing a relative smaller glacier area decrease the glacier area in the yangtze basin will decrease from 1894 km2 to 1242 km2 in the 21st century due to a large number of glaciers with various sizes in the basin the temporal evolution of glacier area in the three basins for the four ssps shows significant variability due to the spatial differences in the temperature and precipitation fig 6 and proportion of small glaciers table 1 for the ssp1 2 6 the lancang basin will experience the greatest relative area shrinkage owing to the dominance of small glaciers whereas yangtze and yellow basins will have smaller relative area shrinkage despite that the northern yangtze basin will be much warmer than the other location while climate change is a reason for glacier shrinkage the fact that smaller glaciers are sensitive to climate change is another reason for the greatest relative area shrinkage in the lancang basin glacier area shrinks in all basins since the increase in precipitation most likely in the form of rainfall does not compensate the glacier mass loss resulted by melting owing to the warming most glaciers are completely lost in the 21st century fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the timing of glacier disappearance during 2016 2099 it is obvious that number of missing glaciers increases from 448 for ssp1 2 6 865 for ssp5 8 5 as emission intensifies from ssp1 2 6 to ssp5 8 5 moreover the initial area of single lost glacier will increase from 2 km2 for ssp1 2 6 3 5 km2 for ssp5 8 5 among the three basins the area of the disappeared glacier in the yellow river will be the smallest accounting for 1 of basin total glacier area for ssp1 2 6 in the 21st century corresponding to 1 of basin glacier number table 4 on the other hand 44 of glacier area will be lost for ssp5 8 5 corresponding to 51 glacier number with area smaller than 2 km2 in the yellow basin in contrary 26 of basin total glacier area corresponding to 15 of basin glacier number in the lancang rvier will disappear for ssp1 2 6 but for the ssp5 8 5 approximately 35 of glacier area and 84 of glacier number will disappear in the lancang basin the lost glacier area in the yangtze river will be at intermediate level with 10 of basin glacier area and 56 of basin glacier number is projected to disappear for ssp5 8 5 in the 21st century 3 3 glacier runoff projections the multi esm ensemble means of annual glacier runoff also vary significantly among basins in the sanjiangyuan region fig 9 glacier runoff of all basins will reach peak water before 2080 for all ssps and the lancang river is already near its peak water whereas the yangtze river has the latest peak water timing except for ssp3 7 0 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 have delayed peak water timing as emission intensifies in the yangtze river and yellow river basins the peak water amount is greater for ssp5 8 5 than for ssp3 7 0 increase in annual glacier runoff at peak water can reach 72 of the initial glacier runoff in the yangtze basin multi esm ensemble mean for ssp5 8 5 22 in the yellow basin multi esm ensemble mean for ssp5 8 5 but very small in the lancang basin regardless of the ssps spatial patterns of peak water and its timing of individual glaciers are highly variable in the sanjiangyuan fig 10 the lancang river basin has already reached peak water in the approximately in 2020 or will reach peak water by 2025 at the latest for ssp3 7 0 while yangtze river and yellow river basins will reach peak water later approximately in 2080 given that a majority of larger glaciers are in the yangtze river and yellow river glacier runoff from these basins determines the peak water and its timing in the entire sanjiangyuan the increase in temperature is pronounced and widespread for all ssps precipitation also increases especially for ssp5 8 5 in the sanjiangyuan fig 6 the later peak water timing in ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 than in ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 seems counter intuitive that greater warming will result in faster melt however based on eq 4 glacier runoff is the balance of ice snow melt liquid precipitation and refrozen water on the glacier surface apparently changes in liquid precipitation and snow ice combined put off the peak water timing in the intensified emission scenarios the glacier runoff is composed of meltwater including glacier ice melt and snow melt at the glacier surface and rainfall fig 11 glacier ice melt is essentially the release of a long term water storage that cannot be replenished in the warming climate enhanced emission intensifies the glacier melt but delays the peak water timing as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 further analysis show that snow melt is an essential component that determines the peak water timing as it accounts for the greatest portion of the glacier runoff in the three basins fig 11 for example despite decrease of glacier ice melt due to warming and little change in liquid precipitation after 2070 in the yangtze river and yellow river for ssp5 8 5 snow melting increases and still accounts for more than 30 of the annual glacier runoff however there is little change in snow melt in the lancang river and its glacier runoff peak water occurs very early fig 12 shows the contribution to glacier runoff during melt season averaged in 2016 2099 relative to the monthly runoff in 2016 the rising temperature will enhance monthly snow and glacier ice melt and increases total glacier runoff in the yangtze river basin and yellow basin conversely rising temperature will decrease the glacier ice melt due to most small glaciers disappeared in the lancang basin the remarkable increases in snow and glacier ice melt occur in july for all ssps and in august for all ssps except ssp1 2 6 in yangtze river and yellow river snow melt increases by 20 6 26 6 37 8 and 49 4 relative to 2016 for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in yangtze river basin snow melt is the key component of peak water while glacier ice melt dwindles because of fast disappearing small glaciers fig 11 the similar phenomenon occurs in the yellow river but in the lancang river future monthly glacier runoff for 2016 2099 decreases relative to 2016 which is why peak water occurs early 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies the accuracy of glacier runoff projection heavily relies on future climate forcing glacier physical structure e g volume area relation radić and hock 2010 glacier mass redistribution huss and hock 2018 and glacier flow model kraaijenbrink et al 2017 and model calibration the differences in any aspects will have a crucial impact on the simulation which is why there are great significant differences in simulated results among the glacier modeling studies in the sanjiangyuan huss and hock 2018 rounce et al 2020 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 as a key parameter for the degree day model the differences in ddfc could result in a great discrepancy in the simulation of glacier melt and area change zhao et al 2019 which was proved by the glacier monitoring study in the hma zhang et al 2006a this discrepancy was further quantified by a new parameterization scheme introduced to the degree day model to simulate the glacier runoff at basin or regional scales immerzeel et al 2012 radić and hock 2011 zhao et al 2019 based on the fact that ddfc is closely related to the solar radiation as shown by immerzeel et al 2012 e g glaciers on the north facing slope have smaller ddfc than those on the south facing slope we applied the standardized clear sky solar radiation to individual glaciers to account for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of ddfc in the sanjiangyuan fig 3 ddfc variability in the temperature index model is realized through sky solar radiation hock 1999 however some glacier modeling studies treated ddfc as a constant kraaijenbrink et al 2017 su et al 2016 and failed to account for the spatiotemporal variation in glacier melt many remote sensing mass balance products have emerged including spot5 mass balance for 1999 2011 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 aster for 2000 2018 rounce et al 2020 and icesat for 2003 2008 huss and hock 2018 however these products have relatively high uncertainty e g aster mass balance in the hma has a relatively high level of uncertainty range with a median uncertainty value of 0 22 m w e a 1 brun et al 2019 due to the scarce mass balance measurement previous study only used remote sensing mass balance to calibrate model parameters which will result in great discrepancy among the simulated present day mass balance rounce et al 2020 to improve the simulation accuracy we used not only remote sensing mass balance but also long term series of monitored mass balance and trustworthy glacier inventory data three steps are followed in degree day based model calibration and validation 1 in situ mass balance measurement in the xdkmd glacier was used to optimize model parameters which were the basis of parameter regionalization 2 the areas of all glaciers in the sanjiangyuan from two credible chinese glacier inventories that span four decades cgi 1 in the 1960 1980 s cgi 2 in the 2004 2011 were used to convert the regionalized parameters to specific individual glaciers in the sanjiangyuan and by further calibration and validation of model parameters for individual glaciers and 3 aster mass balance dataset that covers 45 of the glacier in sanjiangyuan were used to make sure that not only area but also mass balance was reasonably simulated by the model rmse in mass balance simulation of 0 33 m w e fig 5 proves that the results from the three steps are robust our study demonstrates that peak water for the lancang river basin will occur in 2021 for ssp1 2 6 2022 for ssp2 4 5 2035 for ssp3 7 0 and 2023 for ssp5 8 5 respectively different from proximately 2000 for both rcp 2 6 and for rcp 4 5 reported by zhao et al 2019 for the yangtze river basin our peak water is around 2043 for ssp1 2 6 2046 for ssp2 4 5 2085 for ssp3 7 0 and 2068 for ssp5 8 5 and all are later than zhao et al 2019 which is 2010 for rcp 2 6 2020 for rcp 4 5 zhao et al 2019 also used v a scaling to simulate the glacier area change and the glacier area from the inventories to calibrate model parameters similar to our approach we attribute the discrepancy in the peak water timing to the improvement of cmip6 over cmip5 rounce et al 2020 used aster mass balance data over 2000 2018 for calibration and estimated peak water around 2030 for rcp 2 6 and for rcp 4 5 2040 for rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 for the yangtze river basin which are earlier than our results rounce et al 2020 used aster mass balance to calibrate and measured glacier mass balance to validate the model however glacier thickness change scheme is applied for glacier area change projection without evaluating the scheme in the calibrated period due to no available glacier thickness data while our study used area of all glaciers to calibrate model parameters which were continuously used in the future simulation the continuity ensures consistent and accurate projection over 2016 2099 regarding climate projections by cmip5 and cmip6 it is found that temperature change in the sanjiangyuan is greater in cmip6 than in cmip5 according to fig 6 in this study and rounce et al 2020 higher temperature will delay the peak water timing according to our simulation shown in fig 9 4 2 uncertainties in projections the uncertainty associated with glacier area and glacier runoff projections can be attributed to future climate forcing model structure calibration data scheme and input data the dominant source of uncertainty in our study is future climate forcing the ranges in annual precipitation and air temperature from cmip6 esms for the four ssps were large the standard deviations of the simulated glacier area and runoff in sanjiangyuan driven by 31 ems ensemble numbers are 141 km2 and 5 0 108 m3 239 km2 and 5 2 108 m3 245 km2 and 5 3 108 m3 231 km2 and 5 6 108 m3 respectively for ssp1 2 5 ssp2 2 6 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 figs 7 and 9 although the uncertainty associated with v a scaling scheme is smaller than that with cmip6 future climate forcing it is an additional contribution to uncertainty in the simulated glacier area change despite that various v a scaling empirical parameters were adopted in previous simulated studies we used the parameter values from liang and tian 2022 which were obtained from observed glaciers with areas ranging from 0 1 to 50 km2 from measured ice thickness in western china owing to lacking glacier thickness data in the cgi 1 from the 1960 s to the 1980 s although this method was widely used to simulate the glacier area evolution hock et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2010 raper and braithwaite 2006 zhao et al 2019 the differences in the scaling values among glaciers were ignored study shows that uncertainties caused by v a scaling when adopted to simulate glacier runoff and glacier area change were 4 0 and 5 0 respectively zhao et al 2019 the scaling scheme had significant impact on small glacier fig 4 thus affecting glacier area and runoff in the basin with majority glaciers being small in the sanjiangyuan the other uncertainty could come from calibration data for example the area error for cgi 1 was lower than 5 for most glaciers and less than 10 for all glaciers in china and it was 3 2 for all glaciers for cgi 2 the aster mass balance data has a relatively high level of uncertainty with a median uncertainty of 0 22 m w e a 1 there are some deviations in model parameters calibrated especially for small glaciers these deviations become smaller with glacier area increase so this will transferred to future projection of glacier area and glacier runoff simulation and generate some uncertainty in projection result nevertheless small glaciers have limited glacier runoff and model deficiency in small glacier simulation might not affect basin integrated glacier runoff significantly however all these errors could accumulate and propagate to the future projections 5 conclusions in the model we quantified the spatial variation in ddfc using sky solar radiation in situ measurement at xdkmd glacier and two glacier inventory datasets covering all glaciers in the sanjaingyuan were applied either as initial values or to calibrate the model parameters aster mass balance was used to validate the mass balance simulation calibration and validation of the mass balance model show that the model can simulate glacier area and runoff reasonably well glacier area and runoff for 2016 2099 were projected for the four ssps using 31 esms from cmip6 by the end of the 21st century glaciers area will shrink by 36 12 for ssp1 2 6 42 20 for ssp2 4 5 49 19 for ssp3 7 0 and 61 15 for ssp5 8 5 relative to 2016 in the sanjiangyuan small glacier dominated lancang river basin is more sensitive to climate change than large glacier abundant yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the lancang river basin is projected to experience the greatest relative glacier area shrinkage 35 of glacier area and 84 of glacier number will disappear for ssp5 8 5 by the end of 21st century projections of annual glacier runoff reveal that the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin will reach peak water approximately 2080 in ssp3 7 0 while the lancang river basin will experience fast reduction in the annual glacier runoff and have much earlier peak water timings for all ssps the timing of peak water for all river basins is determined by the amount of snow melt at the glacier surface future warming will produce more snow melt in ablation period than historical period does in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin this study does not consider the glacier dynamic process especially the glacier velocity and temperature change with the air temperature increase hence the dynamic movement of the glacier is ignored which will be further studied and the glacier physical process will be incorporated to the mass balance model in the future this study not only demonstrates regional climate impact assessment and helps water management for the local and downstream in the sanjiangyuan but also provides reference for studying global mountainous watersheds where water resources are

relevant risks we aim to provide an up to date knowledge of the glacier area and runoff change for 2016 2099 in the sanjiangyuan new hydrological insights for the region projections based on cmip6

abstract ga1 keywords the sanjiangyuan glacier area change glacier runoff future projections the tibetan plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the high mountain asia hma or asia water tower has the largest glacier area outside the polar regions encompassing over 97 590 km2 approximately 30 of the mountain glaciers area all over the world farinotti et al 2019 the valuable freshwater from the glacier melt to many prominent rivers in the hma meets the requirements of nearly 2 5 billion people pritchard 2019 as well as agriculture irrigation biemans et al 2019 due to rapid climate warming a great majority of glaciers in the hma are experiencing mass loss and are becoming more vulnerable brun et al 2017 immerzeel et al 2020 miles et al 2021 small glaciers may even disappear in the 21st century hock et al 2019 huss and hock 2018 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 as glacier melt continues glacier runoff typically transforms from peak water to low flow eventually huss and hock 2018 this will enhance water stress and threaten water security for the local and downstream the sanjiangyuan is known as the water tower of china which is located in the northeastern tibetan plateau tp is the headwater of the yangtze river yellow river and lancang upper mekong river which together contribute 411 m3 s streamflow to the downstream and support the ecosystem and livelihood of the population in the local eastern china and southeast asia cuo et al 2014 the sanjiangyuan contains 1406 glaciers whose glacier area is approximately of 2237 km2 lin et al 2022 the headwater basins rely on the glacier runoff supply due to dry alpine climate especially in dry and warm season huss and hock 2018 su et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 based on the second chinese glacier inventory cgi 2 about 85 of the glaciers in the sanjiangyuan are smaller than 2 km2 which is facing the fate of disappearance in the future the glacier runoff in the sanjiangyuan will be more likely to undergo the transition because most glaciers are small glaciers water stress will become a serious issue for local ecosystem and growing populations wang et al 2021 better understanding of glacier runoff peak water and its timing in the sanjiangyuan is therefore crucial for not only regional climate impact assessment and water management for the local and downstream but also providing reference for studying global mountainous watersheds where water resources are rely on small and medium sized glaciers the general consensus is that glacier mass in the sanjiangyuan is projected to experience remarkable loss in the future and the glacier area will continue to shrink huss and hock 2018 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 resulting in significant change in glacier runoff rounce et al 2020 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 however there are considerable differences in the projection of the amount of glacier runoff especially in the peak water and its timing in the 21st century one of the reasons is that previous studies did not consider the spatiotemporal variation of the degree day factors ddf used in the glacier model which is a key parameter for the degree day model treating ddf as a constant su et al 2016 or a coefficient depending on aspect zhao et al 2019 or just calibrating ddf rounce et al 2020 are common practices however in situ monitoring shows significant spatiotemporal ddf variation among glaciers in the hma zhang et al 2006a previous studies also demonstrated that ddf should be a coefficient closely related to the sky solar radiation hock 1999 2003 due to scarce glacier mass balance measurement in the hma widely available remote sensing mass balance products remotely sensed mass balance is frequently used to calibrate model parameters many studies also applied aster grace and icesat data to calibrate model parameters huss and hock 2015 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 for example aster mass balance dataset covering a great number of glaciers in the hma with median uncertainty of 0 22 m w e a 1 was also used to calibrate parameters rounce et al 2020 compared to remote sensing mass balance glacier inventory dataset is more accurate and could produce a better glacier simulation when it is used as a reference for calibrating glacier model zhao et al 2019 the inventory provides a possibility to calibrate parameters for every glacier thus enabling us to better constrain models to produce reasonable glacier areas in the historical period and credible future projections earth system models esms are used to understand climate change since the establishment of the cmip in 1995 cmip has released two phases of esm results cmip5 and cmip6 the cmip5 had great discrepancy in precipitation across the tp such as overestimation of total precipitation in the southeastern tp jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2014 missing spatial differences of seasonal and monsoonal precipitation in the tp duan et al 2013 su et al 2013 which are likely due to the coarse resolution and insufficient subgrid scale physics in the esms of the cmip5 the effects of intricate atmospheric and ocean circulations and their connections and the complex tp terrains chen et al 2017 while in the cmip6 esms have improved physical schemes model resolution and biogeochemical processes veronika et al 2016 which could yield better future climate projection studies reporting the glacier and runoff changes using the cmip6 esm archive are just emerging gao et al 2020 ji et al 2020 up to date how glacier and runoff in the sanjiangyuan region will change in response to the cmip6 climate projection remains unclear in this study a mass balance model is first improved by adopting spatiotemporally varied ddf calculated from the clear sky solar radiation in the glacier model next monitored mass balance and glacier runoff at the xdkmd xiao dongkemadi glacier and areas from two glacier inventory datasets that span 4 decades and cover all the glaciers in the sanjiangyuan are used as reference to calibrate the model parameters during the historical period the aster result is further adopted to validate the simulation result then the calibrated and validated glacier model is run over 2016 2099 using the downscaled and bias corrected cmip6 esm projections the objective is to provide the most recent and credible understanding of changes in glacier area and number and timing of peak water of glacier runoff in the 21st century in the sanjiangyuan 2 methodology 2 1 study area the sanjiangyuan is located in the northeastern tp fig 1 with an area and average elevation of approximately 3 61 105 km2 and 5000 m a s l respectively ji et al 2020 the averaged annual precipitation is 467 mm and air temperature is 1 56 base on latest glacier inventory guo et al 2015 glaciers are mostly distributed in the yangtze river basin where glacier number accounts for 74 0 and glacier area is about 87 7 in the sanjiangyuan the yellow river basin contains about 6 1 of the glacier number and 4 7 of the glacier area and the lancang river basin has 20 3 and 7 5 respectively these glaciers are the summer accumulation type which are sensitive to the summer precipitation and temperature change wang et al 2019 xdkmd glacier is the only long time monitored glacier in the sanjiangyuan fig 1 and its glacier mass balance was monitored from 1989 to 2010 2 2 data 2 2 1 glacier inventory data areas from the two glacier area datasets i e the first chinese glacier inventory cgi 1 and the second chinese glacier inventory cgi 2 were used the cgi 1 was used as model initial input data and the cgi 2 was adopted to calibrate the model parameters the former was generated using historical topographic maps acquired from 1980s shi et al 2009 with area error less than 5 for most glaciers and less than 10 for all glaciers in china wu and li 2011 the quality of the cgi 1 is suitable for glacier mass balance and glacier runoff simulation the cgi 2 is an updated version of the cgi 1 completed based on images from landsat tm etm aster and google earth images from 2004 to 2011 with an error of 3 2 guo et al 2015 area difference between cgi 1 and cgi 2 is shown in table 1 based on the cgi 2 the lancang river basin has the greatest proportion 84 6 of glaciers with area less than 1 km2 the yellow river basin has 76 7 and the yangtze river basin has 69 1 these small glaciers are especially vulnerable to warming climate 2 2 2 climate data the glacier mass balance model was driven by monthly climate data from the gridded 0 25º spatial resolution daily temperature and precipitation data in 1957 2016 the grid climate data were generated by considering elevation effects on observed daily temperature and precipitation and using the synographic mapping system symap interpolation algorithm data at 181 temperature stations and 357 precipitation stations were used to generate the grids that cover the entire tp the detailed of the gridding approach and the evaluation of the dataset is provided in cuo et al 2013 cmip6 projection data were used to drive the model for future projection over 2016 2099 the 31 cmip6 models and four socioeconomic shared pathways ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 representing sustainable middle of the road regional rivalry and fossil fuel development approaches respectively were selected supplementary table s1 in total 116 combinations of models and ssp scenarios were used the resolution of these cmip6 models ranges from 0 495 º to 3 75º all glacier runoff simulations used the rlilp1 ensemble member in order to match the resolutions between the historical and cmip6 forcing we adopted the dc v method a statistically downscaling method by which the ssp data were corrected by referencing to historical monthly values and variance wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 dc v method ensures that gridded temperature and precipitation means and variability in 1957 2016 were the same as or similar to the cmip6 models the downscaled and bias corrected future monthly temperature and precipitation in 2016 2099 were used to drive the model given the objective of the study we will examine the future monthly time series not 30 year decadal time step as many future studies did previously 2 2 3 dem data dem digital elevation model was used to calculate the sky solar radiation for each glacier thus quantifying the ddfc difference among all glaciers in the sanjiangyuan glacier surface dem was clipped by srtm dem jarvis et al 2008 and which was used to extract the glacier aspect and slope with a spatial resolution of 30 m 2 2 4 mass balance data the monitored mass balance at the xdkmd glacier was also used to calibrate the model and aster mass balance data was used to validate model the mass balance at the xdkmd glacier during the period of 1989 2010 comes from wgms world glacier monitoring service wgms 2022 which is the longest and only mass balance record 22 year available in the sanjiangyuan so far wgsm published mass balance records for more than 65 glaciers in the hma most are more than 3 years wang et al 2019 calibrated and validated model parameters at xdkmd were used for the entire study area as initial parameter values these initial values were further calibrated based on the cgi 2 and aster result the aster results from 2000 to 2016 were obtained by calculating elevation difference brun et al 2017 covering most glaciers in the hma there was a high deviation in mass balance for individual glaciers ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 m w e a 1 depending on some factors such as glacier area and image quality or number available brun et al 2019 we extracted every glacier in the aster mass balance dataset and matched with glaciers in the sanjiangyuan using the cgi 2 glacier mask 2 3 glacier change model the mass balance model is a foundation for the glacier runoff simulation we chose the model by radic and hock 2011 to calculate glacier runoff which was demonstrated to be appropriate to simulate mass balance in monitored glaciers in the hma wang et al 2019 the detailed model method can be found in wang et al 2019 in this model we defined f c snow ice ddfc as the corrected degree day factor and f snow ice is ddf for snow or ice mm w e d 1 1 respectively 1 f snow ice c f snow ice k the ddfc is not uniform in space and time which is closely related to clear sky solar radiation hock 1999 immerzeel et al 2012 in this study k is the standardized clear sky solar radiation i in order to quantify the degree day factor differences for each glacier in the sanjiangyuan we calculated the clear sky solar radiation i for all glaciers 2 i i 0 r m r 2 ψ a p p 0 cos z cos z where i 0 is solar constant assumed to be 1368 w m2 r m r 2 is eccentricity correction factor of earth orbit over time r is the sun earth distance and r m is the mean sun earth distance ψ a is a mean vertical atmosphere clear sky transmissivity in the range of 0 6 0 9 here it is 0 75 hock 1999 p is atmospheric pressure and p 0 is sea level atmospheric pressure 101325 pa p p 0 shows the effect of altitude to solar radiation with lower air pressure corresponding to higher solar radiation and cos z represents the variability of the path length of solar rays passing through the atmosphere z is glacier grid zenith angle by multiplying with cos z eq 2 calculates projected horizontal surface receiving radiation in each glacier grid which varies among glaciers we used the volume area scaling relationship to simulate the glacier area which is a widely used method for glacier change simulation previously hock et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2010 raper and braithwaite 2006 zhao et al 2019 volume area v a scaling relationship was derived from glacier inventory data all over the world radić et al 2008 3 v c a γ where v is glacier volume km3 and a is glacier area of the whole glacier km2 according to optimal scaling constant based on measured ice thickness in western china from liang and tian 2022 c 0 0376 and the scaling exponents is γ 1 3475 2 4 glacier runoff according to bliss et al 2014 glacier runoff refers to all water that generated by the surface of all glaciers glacier runoff q is as a sum of rain p liq i ablation a i and refreezing r i in the glacier area in each elevation band s i from all elevation bands as follows 4 q i 1 n s i a i p liq i r i we assume that evaporation sublimation and any storage changes groundwater englacial or subglacial in glacierized band is negligible which proves to be reasonable by huss et al 2008 the glacier runoff is integrated over an annually updated glacier area called moving gauge glacier runoff with glacier retreats or advances over the time rounce et al 2020 similar to peak water calculated from huss and hock 2018 we calculate peak water and its timing based on the time series of 11 year moving average of the simulated annual glacier runoff for 2016 2099 3 result 3 1 model parameter of calibration and validation 3 1 1 model parameter optimization the model calibration period is 1970 2016 depending on the two glacier inventory datasets and glacier area do not change in the model before 1970 due to data limitation with reference to the monitored xdkmd glacier in the sanjiangyuan we optimized model parameters to obtain the minimum deviation between the simulated and observed annual mass balance timeseries radić and hock 2011 wang et al 2019 rmse and r2 were used to examine the goodness of fit the key parameters and their initial value ranges for xdkmd glacier are shown in table 2 radić and hock 2011 wang et al 2019 tlap refers to the statistical lapse rate glap is the temperature lapse rate along the glacier surface f snow ice shows ddf for snow or ice kp is a precipitation correction factor used to interpolate the monthly precipitation from the climate grid data to the glacier maximum elevation band dpre is a precipitation gradient along the glacier surface and tsnow is the threshold temperature to distinguish snow or rainfall fig 2 a compares the simulated and observed annual mass balance for the xdkmd glacier with rmse of 0 21 m w e and r2 of 0 76 moreover we validated the glacier runoff using values from gao et al 2012 and zhang et al 1997 fig 2 b the model can capture the glacier runoff change even though there is discrepancy in 2008 2009 in general the model performs well in simulation of glacier mass balance and glacier runoff for xdkmd glacier therefore we further regionalized the ddf from the xdkmd glacier to the other glaciers by relationship with the standardized clear sky solar radiation previous study found that ddfc is spatiotemporally variable and is mainly affected by the topography and solar radiation in the sanjiangyuan zhang et al 2006b to extrapolate the ddf from the xdkmd glacier to other glaciers we calculated the sky solar radiation using eq 2 then ddfc of the other glaciers can be derived by extrapolating that of xdkmd glacier using eq 1 fig 3 shows that standardized clear sky solar radiation scksr for all glaciers are different low in the east and high in the west the other three model parameters that need calibration are the dprec glap and tsnow as shown in table 2 at this step glacier areas of all glaciers from cgi 2 that represent 2010 status were used for calibration the objective during calibration was to minimize the difference between the simulated and observed glacier area for every glacier this area referenced calibration step generated independent sets of model parameters for individual glaciers these parameter sets were adopted to simulate glacier runoff change in the future fig 4 shows the comparisons between simulated and observed glacier areas among four area classes 1 km2 1 5 km2 5 10 km2 and 10 km2 relative bias decreases with increasing glacier area especially in the group with glacier area larger than 10 km2 which has a relatively small bias the model underestimates the area of small glaciers less than 1 km2 with a greater relative bias the possible reason might be constant parameters of the glacier v a scaling fitted by observed glaciers with area ranging from 0 1 1000 km2 all over the world grinsted 2013 in addition small glaciers are more sensitive to climate change and their area change is more drastic making them difficult to simulate especially for some small glaciers which disappeared before the 2010 but the model determines the time of disappearance as 2012 it is also a challenge to accurately simulate glacier mass balance and area under the condition of data scarcity however small glaciers have limited glacier runoff and model deficiency in small glacier simulation might not affect basin integrated glacier runoff significantly as it is essentially dominated by larger glaciers 3 1 2 model validation glaciers in aster glacier wide mass balance dataset account for approximately 45 of the total glaciers number in the sanjiangyuan during 2000 2016 model validated at these 45 individual glaciers by comparing the simulated mass balance with aster mass balance over 2000 2016 fig 5 yielded rmse of 0 33 m w e a 1 the good agreement in simulated glacier area and mass balance generally indicates model is suitable for future glacier runoff projection in the sanjiangyuan the c 0 0376 and γ 1 3475 are key parameters in the mass balance model and differences in these parameters could lead to different glacier area and glacier runoff simulations to quantify their influence we conducted the sensitivity experiments on coefficients c 10 0 10 and γ 10 0 10 two sets of simulations were designed 1 γ kept constant c changed by 10 0 10 and 2 c kept constant γ changed by 10 0 10 the sensitivity test shows that glacier area and runoff were not sensitive to the parameters of c and γ in historical period table 3 although γ has a slightly more influence than c on glacier area and runoff 3 2 glacier area projections the spatial variations are apparent in the future temperature and precipitation for the four ssps fig 6 multi esm ensemble mean temperature will increase by 1 4 ºc for ssp1 2 6 2 6ºc for ssp2 4 5 5 2ºc for ssp3 7 0 and 6 0 ºc for ssp5 8 5 during 2016 2099 by the end of the 21st century the yangtze basin will experience the greatest temperature increase especially for glaciers in the northwest for ssp1 2 6 and in the south for higher emission scenarios compared to yangtze basin the yellow and lancang basins will experience a lower temperature increase throughout the century the precipitation is projected to increase slightly in sanjiangyuan with maximum precipitation increase by 19 mm for ssp5 8 5 while for other scenarios the increase of precipitation will be less than 10 mm such climate change pattern with remarkable temperature increase but moderate precipitation change will enhance the area reduction and glacier melt from 2016 2099 multi esm ensemble means of glacier area in the sanjiangyuan will reduce by 36 12 ssp1 2 6 42 20 ssp2 4 5 49 19 ssp3 7 0 and 61 15 ssp5 8 5 compared to 2016 the glacier area retreat increases with intense emission the response of glacier area to the climate change is complex although all basins will experience glacier shrinkage the relative shrinkage the fraction of the initial glacier area in 2016 varies significantly among basins fig 7 because of glacier area differences the lancang river basin will experience smaller relative glacier area decrease more than 61 for ssp1 2 6 while the yangtze and yellow basins will experience the smaller relative glacier area decrease less than 53 for both basins for ssp5 8 5 despite experiencing a relative smaller glacier area decrease the glacier area in the yangtze basin will decrease from 1894 km2 to 1242 km2 in the 21st century due to a large number of glaciers with various sizes in the basin the temporal evolution of glacier area in the three basins for the four ssps shows significant variability due to the spatial differences in the temperature and precipitation fig 6 and proportion of small glaciers table 1 for the ssp1 2 6 the lancang basin will experience the greatest relative area shrinkage owing to the dominance of small glaciers whereas yangtze and yellow basins will have smaller relative area shrinkage despite that the northern yangtze basin will be much warmer than the other location while climate change is a reason for glacier shrinkage the fact that smaller glaciers are sensitive to climate change is another reason for the greatest relative area shrinkage in the lancang basin glacier area shrinks in all basins since the increase in precipitation most likely in the form of rainfall does not compensate the glacier mass loss resulted by melting owing to the warming most glaciers are completely lost in the 21st century fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the timing of glacier disappearance during 2016 2099 it is obvious that number of missing glaciers increases from 448 for ssp1 2 6 865 for ssp5 8 5 as emission intensifies from ssp1 2 6 to ssp5 8 5 moreover the initial area of single lost glacier will increase from 2 km2 for ssp1 2 6 3 5 km2 for ssp5 8 5 among the three basins the area of the disappeared glacier in the yellow river will be the smallest accounting for 1 of basin total glacier area for ssp1 2 6 in the 21st century corresponding to 1 of basin glacier number table 4 on the other hand 44 of glacier area will be lost for ssp5 8 5 corresponding to 51 glacier number with area smaller than 2 km2 in the yellow basin in contrary 26 of basin total glacier area corresponding to 15 of basin glacier number in the lancang rvier will disappear for ssp1 2 6 but for the ssp5 8 5 approximately 35 of glacier area and 84 of glacier number will disappear in the lancang basin the lost glacier area in the yangtze river will be at intermediate level with 10 of basin glacier area and 56 of basin glacier number is projected to disappear for ssp5 8 5 in the 21st century 3 3 glacier runoff projections the multi esm ensemble means of annual glacier runoff also vary significantly among basins in the sanjiangyuan region fig 9 glacier runoff of all basins will reach peak water before 2080 for all ssps and the lancang river is already near its peak water whereas the yangtze river has the latest peak water timing except for ssp3 7 0 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 have delayed peak water timing as emission intensifies in the yangtze river and yellow river basins the peak water amount is greater for ssp5 8 5 than for ssp3 7 0 increase in annual glacier runoff at peak water can reach 72 of the initial glacier runoff in the yangtze basin multi esm ensemble mean for ssp5 8 5 22 in the yellow basin multi esm ensemble mean for ssp5 8 5 but very small in the lancang basin regardless of the ssps spatial patterns of peak water and its timing of individual glaciers are highly variable in the sanjiangyuan fig 10 the lancang river basin has already reached peak water in the approximately in 2020 or will reach peak water by 2025 at the latest for ssp3 7 0 while yangtze river and yellow river basins will reach peak water later approximately in 2080 given that a majority of larger glaciers are in the yangtze river and yellow river glacier runoff from these basins determines the peak water and its timing in the entire sanjiangyuan the increase in temperature is pronounced and widespread for all ssps precipitation also increases especially for ssp5 8 5 in the sanjiangyuan fig 6 the later peak water timing in ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 than in ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 seems counter intuitive that greater warming will result in faster melt however based on eq 4 glacier runoff is the balance of ice snow melt liquid precipitation and refrozen water on the glacier surface apparently changes in liquid precipitation and snow ice combined put off the peak water timing in the intensified emission scenarios the glacier runoff is composed of meltwater including glacier ice melt and snow melt at the glacier surface and rainfall fig 11 glacier ice melt is essentially the release of a long term water storage that cannot be replenished in the warming climate enhanced emission intensifies the glacier melt but delays the peak water timing as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 further analysis show that snow melt is an essential component that determines the peak water timing as it accounts for the greatest portion of the glacier runoff in the three basins fig 11 for example despite decrease of glacier ice melt due to warming and little change in liquid precipitation after 2070 in the yangtze river and yellow river for ssp5 8 5 snow melting increases and still accounts for more than 30 of the annual glacier runoff however there is little change in snow melt in the lancang river and its glacier runoff peak water occurs very early fig 12 shows the contribution to glacier runoff during melt season averaged in 2016 2099 relative to the monthly runoff in 2016 the rising temperature will enhance monthly snow and glacier ice melt and increases total glacier runoff in the yangtze river basin and yellow basin conversely rising temperature will decrease the glacier ice melt due to most small glaciers disappeared in the lancang basin the remarkable increases in snow and glacier ice melt occur in july for all ssps and in august for all ssps except ssp1 2 6 in yangtze river and yellow river snow melt increases by 20 6 26 6 37 8 and 49 4 relative to 2016 for ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in yangtze river basin snow melt is the key component of peak water while glacier ice melt dwindles because of fast disappearing small glaciers fig 11 the similar phenomenon occurs in the yellow river but in the lancang river future monthly glacier runoff for 2016 2099 decreases relative to 2016 which is why peak water occurs early 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies the accuracy of glacier runoff projection heavily relies on future climate forcing glacier physical structure e g volume area relation radić and hock 2010 glacier mass redistribution huss and hock 2018 and glacier flow model kraaijenbrink et al 2017 and model calibration the differences in any aspects will have a crucial impact on the simulation which is why there are great significant differences in simulated results among the glacier modeling studies in the sanjiangyuan huss and hock 2018 rounce et al 2020 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 as a key parameter for the degree day model the differences in ddfc could result in a great discrepancy in the simulation of glacier melt and area change zhao et al 2019 which was proved by the glacier monitoring study in the hma zhang et al 2006a this discrepancy was further quantified by a new parameterization scheme introduced to the degree day model to simulate the glacier runoff at basin or regional scales immerzeel et al 2012 radić and hock 2011 zhao et al 2019 based on the fact that ddfc is closely related to the solar radiation as shown by immerzeel et al 2012 e g glaciers on the north facing slope have smaller ddfc than those on the south facing slope we applied the standardized clear sky solar radiation to individual glaciers to account for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of ddfc in the sanjiangyuan fig 3 ddfc variability in the temperature index model is realized through sky solar radiation hock 1999 however some glacier modeling studies treated ddfc as a constant kraaijenbrink et al 2017 su et al 2016 and failed to account for the spatiotemporal variation in glacier melt many remote sensing mass balance products have emerged including spot5 mass balance for 1999 2011 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 aster for 2000 2018 rounce et al 2020 and icesat for 2003 2008 huss and hock 2018 however these products have relatively high uncertainty e g aster mass balance in the hma has a relatively high level of uncertainty range with a median uncertainty value of 0 22 m w e a 1 brun et al 2019 due to the scarce mass balance measurement previous study only used remote sensing mass balance to calibrate model parameters which will result in great discrepancy among the simulated present day mass balance rounce et al 2020 to improve the simulation accuracy we used not only remote sensing mass balance but also long term series of monitored mass balance and trustworthy glacier inventory data three steps are followed in degree day based model calibration and validation 1 in situ mass balance measurement in the xdkmd glacier was used to optimize model parameters which were the basis of parameter regionalization 2 the areas of all glaciers in the sanjiangyuan from two credible chinese glacier inventories that span four decades cgi 1 in the 1960 1980 s cgi 2 in the 2004 2011 were used to convert the regionalized parameters to specific individual glaciers in the sanjiangyuan and by further calibration and validation of model parameters for individual glaciers and 3 aster mass balance dataset that covers 45 of the glacier in sanjiangyuan were used to make sure that not only area but also mass balance was reasonably simulated by the model rmse in mass balance simulation of 0 33 m w e fig 5 proves that the results from the three steps are robust our study demonstrates that peak water for the lancang river basin will occur in 2021 for ssp1 2 6 2022 for ssp2 4 5 2035 for ssp3 7 0 and 2023 for ssp5 8 5 respectively different from proximately 2000 for both rcp 2 6 and for rcp 4 5 reported by zhao et al 2019 for the yangtze river basin our peak water is around 2043 for ssp1 2 6 2046 for ssp2 4 5 2085 for ssp3 7 0 and 2068 for ssp5 8 5 and all are later than zhao et al 2019 which is 2010 for rcp 2 6 2020 for rcp 4 5 zhao et al 2019 also used v a scaling to simulate the glacier area change and the glacier area from the inventories to calibrate model parameters similar to our approach we attribute the discrepancy in the peak water timing to the improvement of cmip6 over cmip5 rounce et al 2020 used aster mass balance data over 2000 2018 for calibration and estimated peak water around 2030 for rcp 2 6 and for rcp 4 5 2040 for rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 for the yangtze river basin which are earlier than our results rounce et al 2020 used aster mass balance to calibrate and measured glacier mass balance to validate the model however glacier thickness change scheme is applied for glacier area change projection without evaluating the scheme in the calibrated period due to no available glacier thickness data while our study used area of all glaciers to calibrate model parameters which were continuously used in the future simulation the continuity ensures consistent and accurate projection over 2016 2099 regarding climate projections by cmip5 and cmip6 it is found that temperature change in the sanjiangyuan is greater in cmip6 than in cmip5 according to fig 6 in this study and rounce et al 2020 higher temperature will delay the peak water timing according to our simulation shown in fig 9 4 2 uncertainties in projections the uncertainty associated with glacier area and glacier runoff projections can be attributed to future climate forcing model structure calibration data scheme and input data the dominant source of uncertainty in our study is future climate forcing the ranges in annual precipitation and air temperature from cmip6 esms for the four ssps were large the standard deviations of the simulated glacier area and runoff in sanjiangyuan driven by 31 ems ensemble numbers are 141 km2 and 5 0 108 m3 239 km2 and 5 2 108 m3 245 km2 and 5 3 108 m3 231 km2 and 5 6 108 m3 respectively for ssp1 2 5 ssp2 2 6 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 figs 7 and 9 although the uncertainty associated with v a scaling scheme is smaller than that with cmip6 future climate forcing it is an additional contribution to uncertainty in the simulated glacier area change despite that various v a scaling empirical parameters were adopted in previous simulated studies we used the parameter values from liang and tian 2022 which were obtained from observed glaciers with areas ranging from 0 1 to 50 km2 from measured ice thickness in western china owing to lacking glacier thickness data in the cgi 1 from the 1960 s to the 1980 s although this method was widely used to simulate the glacier area evolution hock et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2010 raper and braithwaite 2006 zhao et al 2019 the differences in the scaling values among glaciers were ignored study shows that uncertainties caused by v a scaling when adopted to simulate glacier runoff and glacier area change were 4 0 and 5 0 respectively zhao et al 2019 the scaling scheme had significant impact on small glacier fig 4 thus affecting glacier area and runoff in the basin with majority glaciers being small in the sanjiangyuan the other uncertainty could come from calibration data for example the area error for cgi 1 was lower than 5 for most glaciers and less than 10 for all glaciers in china and it was 3 2 for all glaciers for cgi 2 the aster mass balance data has a relatively high level of uncertainty with a median uncertainty of 0 22 m w e a 1 there are some deviations in model parameters calibrated especially for small glaciers these deviations become smaller with glacier area increase so this will transferred to future projection of glacier area and glacier runoff simulation and generate some uncertainty in projection result nevertheless small glaciers have limited glacier runoff and model deficiency in small glacier simulation might not affect basin integrated glacier runoff significantly however all these errors could accumulate and propagate to the future projections 5 conclusions in the model we quantified the spatial variation in ddfc using sky solar radiation in situ measurement at xdkmd glacier and two glacier inventory datasets covering all glaciers in the sanjaingyuan were applied either as initial values or to calibrate the model parameters aster mass balance was used to validate the mass balance simulation calibration and validation of the mass balance model show that the model can simulate glacier area and runoff reasonably well glacier area and runoff for 2016 2099 were projected for the four ssps using 31 esms from cmip6 by the end of the 21st century glaciers area will shrink by 36 12 for ssp1 2 6 42 20 for ssp2 4 5 49 19 for ssp3 7 0 and 61 15 for ssp5 8 5 relative to 2016 in the sanjiangyuan small glacier dominated lancang river basin is more sensitive to climate change than large glacier abundant yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the lancang river basin is projected to experience the greatest relative glacier area shrinkage 35 of glacier area and 84 of glacier number will disappear for ssp5 8 5 by the end of 21st century projections of annual glacier runoff reveal that the yangtze river basin and yellow river basin will reach peak water approximately 2080 in ssp3 7 0 while the lancang river basin will experience fast reduction in the annual glacier runoff and have much earlier peak water timings for all ssps the timing of peak water for all river basins is determined by the amount of snow melt at the glacier surface future warming will produce more snow melt in ablation period than historical period does in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin this study does not consider the glacier dynamic process especially the glacier velocity and temperature change with the air temperature increase hence the dynamic movement of the glacier is ignored which will be further studied and the glacier physical process will be incorporated to the mass balance model in the future this study not only demonstrates regional climate impact assessment and helps water management for the local and downstream in the sanjiangyuan but also provides reference for studying global mountainous watersheds where water resources are

7777,study region calabar cross river state nigeria study focus urban groundwater is a strategic water resource in africa that offers a buffer against climate variability increasing population extensive pollution and climate change threaten the contribution of urban groundwater in compensating increasing freshwater demand modern urban areas are often established on productive alluvial aquifers because of the proximity between shallow water bodies and historical settlements groundwater dynamics in urban aquifers are complex impervious surfaces impede water infiltration and leakage from water infrastructure contributes to groundwater recharge in this study groundwater dynamics of an african metropolis are assessed and insights into aquifer protection are provided through detailed hydrogeological analysis and numerical models new hydrogeological insights for the region the calabar metropolis area of 166 km2 and 570 000 inhabitants is characterized by a tropical climate with annual rainfall of over 3000 mm y and large groundwater resources enabling supply for 69 of the population a simplified three dimensional hydrogeological model of the metropolis was proposed using usgs modflow to assess groundwater resources and recharge rates recharge decreased to 46 from water rich rural areas to disadvantaged and highly urbanized communities aquifer recharge driven by huge rainfall dilutes the nitrogen content and pathogens contributing to an acceptable drinking water quality during the prolonged wet season graphical abstract ga1 keywords aquifer recharge modflow niger delta numerical analysis quantitative hydrogeology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently population growth urban expansion and climate variability have quantitatively and qualitatively stressed african groundwater resources adelana and macdonald 2008 the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals is a concern for both rural and urban populations who often have no access to alternative water sources healy 2019 unregulated urban expansion created large districts with substandard housing including a lack of efficient water infrastructure un habitat 2006 without modern water systems collecting pristine water from rural areas urban groundwater is a vital resource for african metropolises lapworth et al 2017 since ancient times urban areas have expanded on top of productive alluvial aquifers owing to the proximity between shallow water bodies and historical settlements urban expansion has altered the natural water cycle depleting groundwater resources population growth and unregulated exploitation have caused global groundwater crises famiglietti 2014 a dedicated water management plan involving the regulation of urban water wells may satisfy the increasing water demand of the african metropolis guarantee egalitarian water access and achieve sustainable development goals in urban areas groundwater exhibits unconventional dynamics that are partially disconnected from the natural water cycle lerner 2002 impervious surfaces of cities such as buildings paved roads parking lots and other infrastructure impede aquifer recharge while simultaneously increasing runoff rainfall increases the volume of water collected by urban rivers and streams which often enters sewers urban streams merge into sewers increasing the volume of water to be treated by wastewater treatment plants and causing additional costs broadhead et al 2013 simultaneously aquifer recharge occurs beneath permeable surfaces such as lawns parks and golf courses irrigation excess and leaks of water pipes also provide a continuous recharge especially during the dry season nguyen et al 2021 exfiltration from pipes and tanks to aquifers can occur seasonally depending on the spatial relationship between water infrastructure and water levels lancia et al 2020 additionally urban expansion involving the deviation or drying up of streams and rivers can alter the natural water regime disentangling the hydrogeological processes and quantifying spatio temporal recharge contributions can be challenging because of the heterogeneity of the urban pattern and sub soil media african metropolises have a strong diversity of urban infrastructure standards reflecting social inequity un habitat 2006 these conditions exacerbate the groundwater dynamics at the city scale rich residential districts with greenery and a low density population supplied by modern water infrastructure hardly affect the natural water cycle in contrast overcrowded districts are characterized by substandard housing facilities without efficient pipe networks in such disadvantaged areas water supply is exclusively through water wells further impacting local groundwater dynamics sanitation system failures represent a primary source of pollution for urban aquifers fecal contamination which releases pathogens and nitrates into groundwater is a major issue in overpopulated sub saharan cities such as juba engström et al 2015 niamey hassane et al 2016 addis ababa hailu debela et al 2018 abidjan lagos douala nlend et al 2018 cotonou houéménou et al 2020 onitcha chinye ikejiunor et al 2021 and abuja etuk et al 2022 in these areas contaminated groundwater is one of the leading causes of child morbidity by causing diseases such as dysentery unicef 2020 the calabar metropolis southern nigeria area of 166 km2 is an intriguing location for a case study offering large heterogeneous urban conditions fig 1a calabar s population is 570 000 growing at a rate of 9 per year for the past 30 years ubugha et al 2017 the calabar waterworks cross river state water board limited crswbl supplies water to the northern and central sectors of the metropolis by collecting water from the great kwa river fig 1b the southern sector is supplied by urban water wells calabar is an urbanized hill consisting of a terrigenous sequence in the niger delta basin fig 1c mesozoic to cenozoic deposits are extensively weathered on the surface owing to the tropical climate for hydrogeological purposes the sequence can be schematized into three different aquifers the tropical climate with an average annual rainfall of over 3000 mm y in the wet season from early spring to late autumn provides extensive water resources on a regional scale unfortunately lack of investments and unregulated urban development led to modern water infrastructure deficiencies especially in the southern sector of calabar understanding the groundwater dynamics is fundamental for safe drinking water and can promote sustainable water management in the area because urban aquifers are the sources of water supply for 69 of the population ubugha et al 2017 to achieve these results this study aimed to characterize the subsoil of the study area via a three dimensional numerical model based on geological and hydrogeological data 1 assess the urban recharge throughout of the metropolis 2 and provide insights into urban aquifer protection 3 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrogeological setting calabar is located in south east nigeria sharing its border with cameroon fig 1a between the calabar and great kwa rivers the two branches of the cross river delta fig 1b the urban area is located on an n s elongated hill with a maximum elevation of approximately 120 masl m above sea level laterally constrained by riverbeds between 5 and 10 masl the eastern and western hillsides have streams with an e w trend that carves the gentle slopes the study area connects the oban basement to the niger delta basin fig 1b is characterized by highly deformed precambrian crystalline rocks mainly migmatites granites gneiss and schists and rock masses dominated by nw se faults and mineral foliations ugbaja and ephraim 2019 the niger delta basin was created by the opening of the benue trough a failed arm of a rift tripled junction associated with the african south american rifting adighije 1979 the cretaceous sequence consists of cross bedded sandstones limestones and shales testifying the marine transgression triggered by the tectonic rifting itam et al 2019 the youngest formation of the cretaceous sequence nkporo formation consists of ammonite bearing shales with limestone and sandstone lenses odunze and obi 2013 the nkporo formation outcrops at the northern edge of the calabar metropolis edet and okereke 2002 the terrigenous sequence continues with the benin formation characterized by tertiary undifferentiated deposits fig 1b this sequence is heterogeneous embracing an alternation of clays silts and gravels sea level fluctuations caused transgressive regressive phases controlling sedimentary deposition throughout the region essien and okon 2017 described the formation of coarse layers of poorly sorted sandstones from braid bars alternated with matrix supported conglomerates in a unidirectional flow pattern the bedrock sequence is masked by thick layers of laterite soil caused by the tropical climate quaternary alluviums were observed near rivers and streams for hydrogeological purposes the entire sequence of calabar is simplified with a shallow thin aquifer consisting of laterites and alluviums aquifer i at greater depths a coarse upper aquifer aquifer ii and a less permeable lower aquifer aquifer iii complete the simplified conceptual model edet and okereke 2002 the hydrogeological setting of calabar is summarized by a hydrogeological map figs 1c and 1d the transition between aquifers ii and iii across calabar hill is difficult to identify through borehole logs and field surveys correlation literature on the boundary between these two aquifers is based on electrical resistivity surveys performed throughout the calabar metropolis edet and okereke 2002 edet et al 2004 ugbaja and edet 2004 amah et al 2012 average resistivity of aquifers ii and iii were 1500 and 320 ωm respectively the aquifers are described as follows aquifer i unit is the top layer of calabar hill and is composed of detritus laterites reworked sands and gravel with a maximum thickness of 10 15 m edet and okereke 2002 this layer is generally unsaturated with water infiltrating toward aquifer ii the aquifer gets saturated nearby streams increasing ground to surface water exchange aquifer i is prone to contamination edet and okereke 2002 heterogeneity of the underlying aquifer ii results in perched aquifers if aquifer i is underlaid by low hydraulic conductivity deposits throughout the plain corresponding to the calabar and great kwa rivers are clays and silts deposited in poor drainage environments in the plain the water table generally coincides with the top surface the local thickness depends on the paleo morphology created during the passages between low and high sea level stands hydraulic conductivity is variable aquifer ii unit consists of saturated medium to coarse sands and gravels with intercalations of silts clays and shales the thickness ranges from 20 to 90 m and the unit is vertically and horizontally heterogeneous reflecting a multi layer aquifer sandy bar deposits are poorly layered and the silty matrix contributes to a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the unit essien and okon 2017 fine sediments arranged in fine layers from the tidal delta deposits act as local aquitards pumping tests report hydraulic conductivities between 7 10 4 and 2 10 3 m s edet and okereke 2002 aquifer iii unit constitutes the base of calabar hill and includes the less permeable sequence of the benin and nkporo formations with an inferred thickness of 1000 m silts clays and shales characterize the upper part whereas ammonite bearing shales limestone lenses and sandstone are predominant in the lower part of the aquifer the unit is vertically and horizontally heterogeneous as reflected by the multilayer aquifer pumping tests report hydraulic conductivities between 7 10 4 and 8 10 4 m s edet and okereke 2002 2 2 groundwater quality hydrogeochemical studies have indicated shallow groundwater circulation with sodium bicarbonate facies fig 2a edet and okereke 2002 the groundwater sodium content is derived from the weathering of silicate minerals and cation exchange processes literature indicates levels of nitrates between 1 and 100 mg l confirming progressive contamination caused by the overlying anthropogenic activities as demonstrated by the nitrate versus chloride mixing model in fig 2b edet et al 2012 amah et al 2012 reported extensive e coli contamination average value of 6 count 100 ml in 85 of the tested water wells in calabar pollution is considerably high in disadvantaged neighborhoods marked by unregulated siting of pit latrines and waste dumps ugbaja and edet 2004 excavations up to the water table extend the pit latrine lifecycle but increase contaminant load ugbaja et al 2007 characterized the impact of pit latrines on groundwater quality by analyzing the total fecal coliform count tfc and total bacterial count tbc in groundwater a 100 m buffer between pit latrines and water wells was recommended in the municipality of calabar south fig 2c open channels and streams collect mismanaged waste discharging it into sewers and causing urban waterlogging an additional source of pollution in fact these cement lining water infrastructures are often distressed and end up leaking contamination may also occur through leakage of septic tanks sewers and urban channels in the central and northern sectors of the study area contaminant inflow in these sectors is estimated to be up to four times lower compared to that in the calabar south edet et al 2012 due to lower population density 2 3 urban land use discretization remotely sensed imagery was used to characterize the different urban land uses in the study area above ground perspective offers a comprehensive overview making it easier to compare urban land use and the underlying hydrogeological settings the analysis was performed using photogeological techniques greenwood 1969 the world imagery dataset 15 meter terra color imagery by esri a high resolution satellite and aerial image base map was used for the analysis urban land use discretization was manually performed by drawing contiguous polygons using arcgis 10 4 and gms 10 1 5 graphic interfaces during discretization polyline elements such as channels and streams were also detected and employed during groundwater modeling the analysis was conducted on a 1 4000 scale the density of impervious surfaces e g roofs paved roads in urban areas was selected as the key parameter for this analysis additionally secondary parameters such as additional urban elements including streams channels and green spaces were also examined variations in the color tone and pattern of the images were assumed as criteria for manually discretizing the domain detected akin areas were controlled with field surveys and later grouped into four classes with expected similar hydrodynamic properties in addition to large and homogeneous infrastructures such as the airport airstrip and golf courses the analysis focused on the differences between the rich residential areas of the north and the poor neighborhoods of the south which can be considered the two end members of the analysis 2 4 three dimensional model construction the construction of the three dimensional geological model was based on stratigraphic boreholes and geoelectrical logs from literature data were processed using arcgis 10 4 and gms 10 1 5 graphic interfaces for data representation and analysis the borehole logs were interpreted according to the hydrogeological conceptual model described in the literature edet and okereke 2002 edet et al 2004 2012 ugbaja and edet 2004 amah et al 2012 cross sections were manually constructed considering the geological setting maximum minimum thickness of the deposits and surface morphology fig 3a a single cross section was built between the two boreholes in accordance with the gms software requirements the boundary between aquifers i and ii was traced following morphological variations a thickness between 10 and 15 m corresponding to the valleys and flat areas was reduced up to 5 m along the hillsides considering that shallow landslides contribute to thinning of laterites on the slopes the boundary between aquifers ii and iii was assumed to be continuous disregarding possible tectonic displacements boreholes cross sections and top surfaces from the digital elevation model aster global digital elevation model v003 with a resolution of 1 were interpolated using the inverse distance weighted idw method artificial boreholes with inferred stratigraphy were also introduced to simplify the interpolation procedures a six node prism mesh 90 m sided subdivided into hydrogeological solids i e volumes of subsoils was obtained the solids were further approximated using a numerical grid to determine the thickness of the layers within the modflow model fig 3b 2 5 numerical model reconstruction 2 5 1 numerical model structure numerical analysis was performed using usgs modflow with the support of the gms graphic interface the domain was schematized with a three dimensional grid of 214 053 active cells distributed in three layers of dimensions 50 m 50 m fig 3c the first layer corresponded to aquifer i and the second and third layers were introduced to represent aquifers ii and iii respectively the proposed model took advantage of the newton nwt solver combined with the upstream weighting upw flow package niswonger et al 2011 as only static groundwater level observations are available in the literature steady state conditions were selected the top elevation was reconstructed from the aster global digital elevation model the bottom elevation of the third layer was set at 100 masl and the intermediate horizons were reconstructed via interpolation analyses layers were set as convertible and the cells were considered either confined or unconfined depending on the difference between the simulated head and the cell top distances the model was manually calibrated and residual errors were further improved using the parameter estimation pest utility doherty 2021 2 5 2 boundary conditions the recharge inflow was set to the highest active cells of the model fig 3d in the first attempt the recharge was set at ten percent of the total rainfall and was later increased to calibrate each subsoil type and urban zone calibrated recharge also included leakage from pipes and other water infrastructures the drain package was set to simulate the ground to surface water discharge fig 3d the drain elevation was set 1 m below the cell top and the drain conductance was calculated starting from the alluvium hydraulic conductivity the data necessary to assess the conductance of rivers and streams were estimated from satellite images unfortunately in urban areas numerous streams receiving groundwater are lost in valueless channel systems to avoid this additional drains were added above ground surface in the case of anomalous simulated groundwater heads additional drain lines were traced according to the geomorphological criteria the contribution of water wells was also considered fig 3d beneath the traced urban areas groundwater pumping was simulated in layer 2 aquifer ii cells flow rates were indirectly estimated starting from public water company bulletins and other literature data ubugha et al 2017 3 results 3 1 recharge zone discretization the top surface had different aquifer recharge rates depending on the urban land use and subsoil characteristics in fact aquifer recharge of overpopulated districts with substandard housing can vary significantly from that in rich residential zones to distinguish the different degrees of urbanization for groundwater purposes urban land use parameters were discretized based on satellite image analysis the domain was discretized into four classes rural low average and high density urban areas as follows rural areas were characterized by forests with a homogeneous pattern and vivid green tones fig 4a dark green tones were present in swampy lowland sectors close to rivers and streams while hills with vegetated forests had lighter tones agricultural activities in urban areas showed a regular pattern with an alternation of colors from green to brown ochre typical of the crops in this region large crops were located on hill crests outside the study area low density urban areas were recognizable from the image by gray white and green blue pixels with a heterogeneous pattern green pixels representing gardens small crops and abandoned areas were also included in this class fig 4b this corresponded to the wealthy zones of the metropolises industrial and residential areas runoff from impervious infrastructure could easily infiltrate the surrounding green areas the potholes in the major paved roads represented preferential infiltration spots undeveloped areas were represented a green patch usually surrounded by urban infrastructure average density urban areas had patterns of pixels similar to those of low density urbanized areas green areas were limited and houses and other infrastructure were clustered fig 4c the distance between consecutive buildings was generally sufficient to allow rainfall to infiltrate through unpaved surfaces only major roads were paved this class characterized the central and northern sectors of calabar hill and represented average conditions in terms of infrastructure advancement high density urban areas had continuous small infrastructure represented by gray to reddish brown pixels fig 4d most buildings had tin rusted roofs without modern sewer systems and water supply pipes green areas were rare inside the urban clusters the distance between buildings was often not detectable and backwater after rainfall was likely only major roads were paved this zone extended throughout the calabar south municipality recharge zonation is mapped in fig 4e 3 2 groundwater consumption estimation the public water authority supplies water to the northern and central sectors of the study area calabar municipality whereas the calabar south municipality fig 4e has no access to pipe borne water communities with no access to the public water system drill water wells and sell the water groundwater pumping is not regulated and a water well census with flow rates is not available groundwater consumption was estimated based on literature data based on opinion surveys conducted in calabar municipality 53 of the population relies on private groundwater extraction 42 is supplied by the public water system and the remaining 5 draws water directly from streams and rivers ubugha et al 2017 the public water system supplies 4 0 million m3 y which roughly corresponds to a water demand of approximately 70 l day person this value is in line with international water reports unicef 2020 considering the same water demand 53 of the calabar metropolis extracts approximately 5 1 million m3 y of groundwater under the same conditions in calabar south where local groundwater is the sole source of water the consumption is estimated to be approximately 4 9 million m3 y the amount of estimated groundwater extraction was less than that from the abundant rainfall that occur during the prolonged wet season the pumped volume roughly corresponds to 2 of the total rainfall from a management point of view groundwater is sufficient for the current population but a full comprehension of groundwater dynamics is important to promote egalitarian access to safe drinking water table 1 3 3 model calibration model calibration provides an optimized dataset of recharge and hydraulic conductivity considering the difference between the computed and observed groundwater heads provided by amah et al 2012 residual errors mostly within 10 m are acceptable considering the simplified approach of the hydrogeological conceptual model fig 5 recharge is affected by both the hydraulic characteristics of the subsoil and urban land use rural areas underlying the benin formation fig 1c have an estimated recharge of 1070 mm y in the north similar rural areas overlying the nkporo formation have a lower recharge of approximately 790 mm y with increasing urban infrastructure density the benin formation areas showed a recharge of 820 700 and 570 mm y in the low average and highly urbanized areas respectively fig 4e simultaneously the calibrated dataset suggests a recharge rate of 690 and 620 mm y for the low and average urbanized areas throughout the nkporo formation fig 1c recharge depletion in low urbanized areas compared with that in highly urbanized areas is consistent with the observations in hydrogeological literature e g lerner 2002 in fact the increments of the impervious surface increases runoff as backwaters accumulate on the ground surface the shales and clays of the nkporo formation explain the lower recharge values throughout the northern sector hydraulic conductivity values from the pumping tests were set during calibration unfortunately the simulated groundwater heads were insufficient and did not match majority of the observed heads even with overestimated recharge rates in fact the main drains i e the calabar and great kwa rivers with elevations between 5 and 10 masl tightly bound the groundwater dynamics at the end of the calibration process hydraulic conductivity values of aquifers i ii and iii were 5 0 10 6 3 3 10 5 and 3 8 10 6 m s respectively corresponding to those of rivers and streams fig 3d the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer i increased to 1 1 10 4 m s to enhance numerical convergence and better simulate ground to surface water exchange the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values were in line with the poorly sorted sands and gravels described by essien and okon 2017 higher values from the pumping tests might be related to the well development procedures that remove the finer portion of the soil in fact pumping tests are generally short term to maintain costs ngah and eze 2017 and involve only limited aquifer volume the calibrated dataset is listed in table 2 small differences in the head solution among the three layers were related to the hydraulic conductivity variation which was higher in aquifer ii than in i and iii simulated groundwater head of aquifer ii is mapped in fig 6a the water table elevation ranged from 5 to 65 masl with three peaks distributed on the hill crest groundwater predominantly flowed from the east to the west toward the calabar and great kwa rivers representing basal discharge lines of the study area along the ridge two head peaks were simulated corresponding to the calabar airport and calabar south with head values reaching 50 and 25 masl respectively between these maxima the streams carving the sedimentary sequence of the hill increased ground to surface water discharge causing a local groundwater head drop in the north the maximum head simulated in bacoco was produced by the geological change between the benin and nkporo formations the location and intensity of the head maxima were consistent with those of previous hydrogeological studies compared with previous models based on geostatistical methods edet et al 2012 2004 obianuju and efiong 2015 the proposed numerical approach also provided a better reconstruction of the ground to surface water exchange from a quantitative perspective the current model estimated the total groundwater budget in addition the model distinguished between groundwater extracted by pumping and that discharged to rivers and streams based on simulated data the total groundwater flow was approximately 154 million m3 y groundwater flowing to the numerous streams and urban channels is approximately 100 million m3 y and 44 million m3 y was directly discharged into the calabar and great kwa rivers under the current boundary conditions simulated groundwater consumption was approximately 10 million m3 y 4 discussions 4 1 insights on aquifer protection negligent drilling wastewater mismanagement and improper waste disposal produce diffuse contamination in vulnerable aquifers i and ii edet and okereke 2002 edet et al 2012 vertical groundwater flows triggered by pumping increases seepage of contaminated water into the deeper sections of the groundwater system modernization of urban infrastructure may effectively contribute to the mitigation of pollution risk at the cost of reducing local recharge recharge loss can be avoided with low impact development lid or sponge city installations but these elements are expensive and difficult to retrofit in a built up area fletcher et al 2014 jin et al 2021 although infrastructure modernization is necessary in calabar south reduction in the local aquifer recharge can be simulated by zeroing the recharge in the numerical model from a management perspective lack of aquifer recharge represents the worst case scenario a new water table distribution was simulated under such extreme conditions fig 6b the high groundwater table compensates for the lack of infiltrated water in calabar south urban groundwater flux has a new ne sw trend as the northern sectors contribute to sustaining calabar south water demand during the simulation groundwater pumping triggered a piezometric cone with a minimum groundwater head at 6 masl just above the river stage of the calabar and great kwa rivers this solution may not be representative of future conditions considering the large annual population increment of calabar which will inevitably increase water demand thus a pumping rate increment of 80 that possibly corresponds to the area s water demand for the next decade was considered in a new simulation fig 6c new boundary conditions consisting of null recharge and increased groundwater pumping simulated a water table depression up to 11 masl fig 6c under these extreme conditions the calabar and great kwa rivers contributed to the extracted volume of water the simulated water regime is a major aspect that must be considered by town planners because these shallow water bodies serve as collectors of untreated wastewater to increase water recharge and simultaneously improve groundwater quality town planners can dedicate green areas within calabar south with sponge city features that must be protected from waste disposal and littering under the current conditions the large and consistent recharge during the prolonged wet season dilutes the fecal contaminants and contributes to acceptable groundwater quality throughout the study area low levels of coliform bacteria and other pathogens recorded in most of the water wells were related to fecal contamination and urban waste mismanagement fig 7 during the short dry season diminished aquifer recharge contributes to a higher concentration of pathogens in the aquifer occasional rainfall occurring during the dry months can temporarily increase the water table reducing the unsaturated zone and increasing contaminant input dysentery waves emerging during the driest months of the year require urgent action to improve groundwater quality sanitary conditions may improve if urban groundwater utilization was completely abandoned for pipe borne water collected from the abundant and pristine resources of the calabar flank additionally modern sewer systems and coordinated municipal waste collection can mitigate aquifer pollution risk this scenario is feasible on a long term scale when accompanied by sustained economic growth that supports investments with revenue from utility bills nevertheless extensive unauthorized construction and rapid population growth complicate the role of decision makers in taking effective actions 4 2 limitations of the model a three dimensional reconstruction of the subsoil setting is difficult if correlation among the stratigraphic facies is attempted the benin formation has strong lateral and vertical heterogeneity and characterization of the productive layers within the sequence could not be realized with the available data additionally the tropical climate that produces laterites masked the surface and geological data could only be collected in correspondence with fresh road cuts moreover the investigations were also uncertain in some aspects affordable geoelectrical boreholes and other shallow geophysical investigations could have been disturbed by urban infrastructure inevitably increasing the amount of uncertainty to optimize costs groundwater wells are drilled by the private sector with percussions and rotary techniques destroying the core without providing a chance to compile the stratigraphic logs negligent drilling also causes cross contamination among the productive layers of aquifers continuous monitoring systems were not available and only rain gauge stations are present hence the static water levels included in several reports and used as observation wells in the proposed steady state conditions had to be averaged and the data on groundwater variation during the short dry season were unavailable 5 conclusions the hydrogeological setting was reconstructed using the usgs modflow groundwater model of calabar south a major metropolis in the niger delta with a tropical climate urban aquifers supply 69 of the water demand and represent exclusive access to water in disadvantaged districts massive rainfall that occurs during the wet season is stored in coarse sand deposits and largely supports the water demand of the population urban aquifer resources are mostly underutilized and the estimated groundwater pumping approximately 10 million m3 y represents less than 6 of the entire groundwater renewable resources in the study area the remaining groundwater quota approximately 144 m3 y flows to the calabar and great kwa rivers as well as various other streams and channels of the metropolis unpaved roads and undeveloped water infrastructure are a threat to water safety throughout the shallow but productive aquifers literature reports low but diffuse levels of coliform bacteria in the groundwater nevertheless abundant rainfall disperse organic contaminants during the prolonged wet seasons modernization of the water infrastructure that reduces the local aquifer recharge would mitigate the pollution risk without compromising on the groundwater resources future scenarios pose emerging questions regarding the vulnerability of aquifers rapid population growth will surely increase groundwater consumption and simultaneously the contaminant load in the future actions to improve access to safe drinking water are essential in calabar south at a regional scale the described hydrogeological setting is a starting point for further investigations and assessment of pollution risk at the populous

7777,study region calabar cross river state nigeria study focus urban groundwater is a strategic water resource in africa that offers a buffer against climate variability increasing population extensive pollution and climate change threaten the contribution of urban groundwater in compensating increasing freshwater demand modern urban areas are often established on productive alluvial aquifers because of the proximity between shallow water bodies and historical settlements groundwater dynamics in urban aquifers are complex impervious surfaces impede water infiltration and leakage from water infrastructure contributes to groundwater recharge in this study groundwater dynamics of an african metropolis are assessed and insights into aquifer protection are provided through detailed hydrogeological analysis and numerical models new hydrogeological insights for the region the calabar metropolis area of 166 km2 and 570 000 inhabitants is characterized by a tropical climate with annual rainfall of over 3000 mm y and large groundwater resources enabling supply for 69 of the population a simplified three dimensional hydrogeological model of the metropolis was proposed using usgs modflow to assess groundwater resources and recharge rates recharge decreased to 46 from water rich rural areas to disadvantaged and highly urbanized communities aquifer recharge driven by huge rainfall dilutes the nitrogen content and pathogens contributing to an acceptable drinking water quality during the prolonged wet season graphical abstract ga1 keywords aquifer recharge modflow niger delta numerical analysis quantitative hydrogeology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently population growth urban expansion and climate variability have quantitatively and qualitatively stressed african groundwater resources adelana and macdonald 2008 the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals is a concern for both rural and urban populations who often have no access to alternative water sources healy 2019 unregulated urban expansion created large districts with substandard housing including a lack of efficient water infrastructure un habitat 2006 without modern water systems collecting pristine water from rural areas urban groundwater is a vital resource for african metropolises lapworth et al 2017 since ancient times urban areas have expanded on top of productive alluvial aquifers owing to the proximity between shallow water bodies and historical settlements urban expansion has altered the natural water cycle depleting groundwater resources population growth and unregulated exploitation have caused global groundwater crises famiglietti 2014 a dedicated water management plan involving the regulation of urban water wells may satisfy the increasing water demand of the african metropolis guarantee egalitarian water access and achieve sustainable development goals in urban areas groundwater exhibits unconventional dynamics that are partially disconnected from the natural water cycle lerner 2002 impervious surfaces of cities such as buildings paved roads parking lots and other infrastructure impede aquifer recharge while simultaneously increasing runoff rainfall increases the volume of water collected by urban rivers and streams which often enters sewers urban streams merge into sewers increasing the volume of water to be treated by wastewater treatment plants and causing additional costs broadhead et al 2013 simultaneously aquifer recharge occurs beneath permeable surfaces such as lawns parks and golf courses irrigation excess and leaks of water pipes also provide a continuous recharge especially during the dry season nguyen et al 2021 exfiltration from pipes and tanks to aquifers can occur seasonally depending on the spatial relationship between water infrastructure and water levels lancia et al 2020 additionally urban expansion involving the deviation or drying up of streams and rivers can alter the natural water regime disentangling the hydrogeological processes and quantifying spatio temporal recharge contributions can be challenging because of the heterogeneity of the urban pattern and sub soil media african metropolises have a strong diversity of urban infrastructure standards reflecting social inequity un habitat 2006 these conditions exacerbate the groundwater dynamics at the city scale rich residential districts with greenery and a low density population supplied by modern water infrastructure hardly affect the natural water cycle in contrast overcrowded districts are characterized by substandard housing facilities without efficient pipe networks in such disadvantaged areas water supply is exclusively through water wells further impacting local groundwater dynamics sanitation system failures represent a primary source of pollution for urban aquifers fecal contamination which releases pathogens and nitrates into groundwater is a major issue in overpopulated sub saharan cities such as juba engström et al 2015 niamey hassane et al 2016 addis ababa hailu debela et al 2018 abidjan lagos douala nlend et al 2018 cotonou houéménou et al 2020 onitcha chinye ikejiunor et al 2021 and abuja etuk et al 2022 in these areas contaminated groundwater is one of the leading causes of child morbidity by causing diseases such as dysentery unicef 2020 the calabar metropolis southern nigeria area of 166 km2 is an intriguing location for a case study offering large heterogeneous urban conditions fig 1a calabar s population is 570 000 growing at a rate of 9 per year for the past 30 years ubugha et al 2017 the calabar waterworks cross river state water board limited crswbl supplies water to the northern and central sectors of the metropolis by collecting water from the great kwa river fig 1b the southern sector is supplied by urban water wells calabar is an urbanized hill consisting of a terrigenous sequence in the niger delta basin fig 1c mesozoic to cenozoic deposits are extensively weathered on the surface owing to the tropical climate for hydrogeological purposes the sequence can be schematized into three different aquifers the tropical climate with an average annual rainfall of over 3000 mm y in the wet season from early spring to late autumn provides extensive water resources on a regional scale unfortunately lack of investments and unregulated urban development led to modern water infrastructure deficiencies especially in the southern sector of calabar understanding the groundwater dynamics is fundamental for safe drinking water and can promote sustainable water management in the area because urban aquifers are the sources of water supply for 69 of the population ubugha et al 2017 to achieve these results this study aimed to characterize the subsoil of the study area via a three dimensional numerical model based on geological and hydrogeological data 1 assess the urban recharge throughout of the metropolis 2 and provide insights into urban aquifer protection 3 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrogeological setting calabar is located in south east nigeria sharing its border with cameroon fig 1a between the calabar and great kwa rivers the two branches of the cross river delta fig 1b the urban area is located on an n s elongated hill with a maximum elevation of approximately 120 masl m above sea level laterally constrained by riverbeds between 5 and 10 masl the eastern and western hillsides have streams with an e w trend that carves the gentle slopes the study area connects the oban basement to the niger delta basin fig 1b is characterized by highly deformed precambrian crystalline rocks mainly migmatites granites gneiss and schists and rock masses dominated by nw se faults and mineral foliations ugbaja and ephraim 2019 the niger delta basin was created by the opening of the benue trough a failed arm of a rift tripled junction associated with the african south american rifting adighije 1979 the cretaceous sequence consists of cross bedded sandstones limestones and shales testifying the marine transgression triggered by the tectonic rifting itam et al 2019 the youngest formation of the cretaceous sequence nkporo formation consists of ammonite bearing shales with limestone and sandstone lenses odunze and obi 2013 the nkporo formation outcrops at the northern edge of the calabar metropolis edet and okereke 2002 the terrigenous sequence continues with the benin formation characterized by tertiary undifferentiated deposits fig 1b this sequence is heterogeneous embracing an alternation of clays silts and gravels sea level fluctuations caused transgressive regressive phases controlling sedimentary deposition throughout the region essien and okon 2017 described the formation of coarse layers of poorly sorted sandstones from braid bars alternated with matrix supported conglomerates in a unidirectional flow pattern the bedrock sequence is masked by thick layers of laterite soil caused by the tropical climate quaternary alluviums were observed near rivers and streams for hydrogeological purposes the entire sequence of calabar is simplified with a shallow thin aquifer consisting of laterites and alluviums aquifer i at greater depths a coarse upper aquifer aquifer ii and a less permeable lower aquifer aquifer iii complete the simplified conceptual model edet and okereke 2002 the hydrogeological setting of calabar is summarized by a hydrogeological map figs 1c and 1d the transition between aquifers ii and iii across calabar hill is difficult to identify through borehole logs and field surveys correlation literature on the boundary between these two aquifers is based on electrical resistivity surveys performed throughout the calabar metropolis edet and okereke 2002 edet et al 2004 ugbaja and edet 2004 amah et al 2012 average resistivity of aquifers ii and iii were 1500 and 320 ωm respectively the aquifers are described as follows aquifer i unit is the top layer of calabar hill and is composed of detritus laterites reworked sands and gravel with a maximum thickness of 10 15 m edet and okereke 2002 this layer is generally unsaturated with water infiltrating toward aquifer ii the aquifer gets saturated nearby streams increasing ground to surface water exchange aquifer i is prone to contamination edet and okereke 2002 heterogeneity of the underlying aquifer ii results in perched aquifers if aquifer i is underlaid by low hydraulic conductivity deposits throughout the plain corresponding to the calabar and great kwa rivers are clays and silts deposited in poor drainage environments in the plain the water table generally coincides with the top surface the local thickness depends on the paleo morphology created during the passages between low and high sea level stands hydraulic conductivity is variable aquifer ii unit consists of saturated medium to coarse sands and gravels with intercalations of silts clays and shales the thickness ranges from 20 to 90 m and the unit is vertically and horizontally heterogeneous reflecting a multi layer aquifer sandy bar deposits are poorly layered and the silty matrix contributes to a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the unit essien and okon 2017 fine sediments arranged in fine layers from the tidal delta deposits act as local aquitards pumping tests report hydraulic conductivities between 7 10 4 and 2 10 3 m s edet and okereke 2002 aquifer iii unit constitutes the base of calabar hill and includes the less permeable sequence of the benin and nkporo formations with an inferred thickness of 1000 m silts clays and shales characterize the upper part whereas ammonite bearing shales limestone lenses and sandstone are predominant in the lower part of the aquifer the unit is vertically and horizontally heterogeneous as reflected by the multilayer aquifer pumping tests report hydraulic conductivities between 7 10 4 and 8 10 4 m s edet and okereke 2002 2 2 groundwater quality hydrogeochemical studies have indicated shallow groundwater circulation with sodium bicarbonate facies fig 2a edet and okereke 2002 the groundwater sodium content is derived from the weathering of silicate minerals and cation exchange processes literature indicates levels of nitrates between 1 and 100 mg l confirming progressive contamination caused by the overlying anthropogenic activities as demonstrated by the nitrate versus chloride mixing model in fig 2b edet et al 2012 amah et al 2012 reported extensive e coli contamination average value of 6 count 100 ml in 85 of the tested water wells in calabar pollution is considerably high in disadvantaged neighborhoods marked by unregulated siting of pit latrines and waste dumps ugbaja and edet 2004 excavations up to the water table extend the pit latrine lifecycle but increase contaminant load ugbaja et al 2007 characterized the impact of pit latrines on groundwater quality by analyzing the total fecal coliform count tfc and total bacterial count tbc in groundwater a 100 m buffer between pit latrines and water wells was recommended in the municipality of calabar south fig 2c open channels and streams collect mismanaged waste discharging it into sewers and causing urban waterlogging an additional source of pollution in fact these cement lining water infrastructures are often distressed and end up leaking contamination may also occur through leakage of septic tanks sewers and urban channels in the central and northern sectors of the study area contaminant inflow in these sectors is estimated to be up to four times lower compared to that in the calabar south edet et al 2012 due to lower population density 2 3 urban land use discretization remotely sensed imagery was used to characterize the different urban land uses in the study area above ground perspective offers a comprehensive overview making it easier to compare urban land use and the underlying hydrogeological settings the analysis was performed using photogeological techniques greenwood 1969 the world imagery dataset 15 meter terra color imagery by esri a high resolution satellite and aerial image base map was used for the analysis urban land use discretization was manually performed by drawing contiguous polygons using arcgis 10 4 and gms 10 1 5 graphic interfaces during discretization polyline elements such as channels and streams were also detected and employed during groundwater modeling the analysis was conducted on a 1 4000 scale the density of impervious surfaces e g roofs paved roads in urban areas was selected as the key parameter for this analysis additionally secondary parameters such as additional urban elements including streams channels and green spaces were also examined variations in the color tone and pattern of the images were assumed as criteria for manually discretizing the domain detected akin areas were controlled with field surveys and later grouped into four classes with expected similar hydrodynamic properties in addition to large and homogeneous infrastructures such as the airport airstrip and golf courses the analysis focused on the differences between the rich residential areas of the north and the poor neighborhoods of the south which can be considered the two end members of the analysis 2 4 three dimensional model construction the construction of the three dimensional geological model was based on stratigraphic boreholes and geoelectrical logs from literature data were processed using arcgis 10 4 and gms 10 1 5 graphic interfaces for data representation and analysis the borehole logs were interpreted according to the hydrogeological conceptual model described in the literature edet and okereke 2002 edet et al 2004 2012 ugbaja and edet 2004 amah et al 2012 cross sections were manually constructed considering the geological setting maximum minimum thickness of the deposits and surface morphology fig 3a a single cross section was built between the two boreholes in accordance with the gms software requirements the boundary between aquifers i and ii was traced following morphological variations a thickness between 10 and 15 m corresponding to the valleys and flat areas was reduced up to 5 m along the hillsides considering that shallow landslides contribute to thinning of laterites on the slopes the boundary between aquifers ii and iii was assumed to be continuous disregarding possible tectonic displacements boreholes cross sections and top surfaces from the digital elevation model aster global digital elevation model v003 with a resolution of 1 were interpolated using the inverse distance weighted idw method artificial boreholes with inferred stratigraphy were also introduced to simplify the interpolation procedures a six node prism mesh 90 m sided subdivided into hydrogeological solids i e volumes of subsoils was obtained the solids were further approximated using a numerical grid to determine the thickness of the layers within the modflow model fig 3b 2 5 numerical model reconstruction 2 5 1 numerical model structure numerical analysis was performed using usgs modflow with the support of the gms graphic interface the domain was schematized with a three dimensional grid of 214 053 active cells distributed in three layers of dimensions 50 m 50 m fig 3c the first layer corresponded to aquifer i and the second and third layers were introduced to represent aquifers ii and iii respectively the proposed model took advantage of the newton nwt solver combined with the upstream weighting upw flow package niswonger et al 2011 as only static groundwater level observations are available in the literature steady state conditions were selected the top elevation was reconstructed from the aster global digital elevation model the bottom elevation of the third layer was set at 100 masl and the intermediate horizons were reconstructed via interpolation analyses layers were set as convertible and the cells were considered either confined or unconfined depending on the difference between the simulated head and the cell top distances the model was manually calibrated and residual errors were further improved using the parameter estimation pest utility doherty 2021 2 5 2 boundary conditions the recharge inflow was set to the highest active cells of the model fig 3d in the first attempt the recharge was set at ten percent of the total rainfall and was later increased to calibrate each subsoil type and urban zone calibrated recharge also included leakage from pipes and other water infrastructures the drain package was set to simulate the ground to surface water discharge fig 3d the drain elevation was set 1 m below the cell top and the drain conductance was calculated starting from the alluvium hydraulic conductivity the data necessary to assess the conductance of rivers and streams were estimated from satellite images unfortunately in urban areas numerous streams receiving groundwater are lost in valueless channel systems to avoid this additional drains were added above ground surface in the case of anomalous simulated groundwater heads additional drain lines were traced according to the geomorphological criteria the contribution of water wells was also considered fig 3d beneath the traced urban areas groundwater pumping was simulated in layer 2 aquifer ii cells flow rates were indirectly estimated starting from public water company bulletins and other literature data ubugha et al 2017 3 results 3 1 recharge zone discretization the top surface had different aquifer recharge rates depending on the urban land use and subsoil characteristics in fact aquifer recharge of overpopulated districts with substandard housing can vary significantly from that in rich residential zones to distinguish the different degrees of urbanization for groundwater purposes urban land use parameters were discretized based on satellite image analysis the domain was discretized into four classes rural low average and high density urban areas as follows rural areas were characterized by forests with a homogeneous pattern and vivid green tones fig 4a dark green tones were present in swampy lowland sectors close to rivers and streams while hills with vegetated forests had lighter tones agricultural activities in urban areas showed a regular pattern with an alternation of colors from green to brown ochre typical of the crops in this region large crops were located on hill crests outside the study area low density urban areas were recognizable from the image by gray white and green blue pixels with a heterogeneous pattern green pixels representing gardens small crops and abandoned areas were also included in this class fig 4b this corresponded to the wealthy zones of the metropolises industrial and residential areas runoff from impervious infrastructure could easily infiltrate the surrounding green areas the potholes in the major paved roads represented preferential infiltration spots undeveloped areas were represented a green patch usually surrounded by urban infrastructure average density urban areas had patterns of pixels similar to those of low density urbanized areas green areas were limited and houses and other infrastructure were clustered fig 4c the distance between consecutive buildings was generally sufficient to allow rainfall to infiltrate through unpaved surfaces only major roads were paved this class characterized the central and northern sectors of calabar hill and represented average conditions in terms of infrastructure advancement high density urban areas had continuous small infrastructure represented by gray to reddish brown pixels fig 4d most buildings had tin rusted roofs without modern sewer systems and water supply pipes green areas were rare inside the urban clusters the distance between buildings was often not detectable and backwater after rainfall was likely only major roads were paved this zone extended throughout the calabar south municipality recharge zonation is mapped in fig 4e 3 2 groundwater consumption estimation the public water authority supplies water to the northern and central sectors of the study area calabar municipality whereas the calabar south municipality fig 4e has no access to pipe borne water communities with no access to the public water system drill water wells and sell the water groundwater pumping is not regulated and a water well census with flow rates is not available groundwater consumption was estimated based on literature data based on opinion surveys conducted in calabar municipality 53 of the population relies on private groundwater extraction 42 is supplied by the public water system and the remaining 5 draws water directly from streams and rivers ubugha et al 2017 the public water system supplies 4 0 million m3 y which roughly corresponds to a water demand of approximately 70 l day person this value is in line with international water reports unicef 2020 considering the same water demand 53 of the calabar metropolis extracts approximately 5 1 million m3 y of groundwater under the same conditions in calabar south where local groundwater is the sole source of water the consumption is estimated to be approximately 4 9 million m3 y the amount of estimated groundwater extraction was less than that from the abundant rainfall that occur during the prolonged wet season the pumped volume roughly corresponds to 2 of the total rainfall from a management point of view groundwater is sufficient for the current population but a full comprehension of groundwater dynamics is important to promote egalitarian access to safe drinking water table 1 3 3 model calibration model calibration provides an optimized dataset of recharge and hydraulic conductivity considering the difference between the computed and observed groundwater heads provided by amah et al 2012 residual errors mostly within 10 m are acceptable considering the simplified approach of the hydrogeological conceptual model fig 5 recharge is affected by both the hydraulic characteristics of the subsoil and urban land use rural areas underlying the benin formation fig 1c have an estimated recharge of 1070 mm y in the north similar rural areas overlying the nkporo formation have a lower recharge of approximately 790 mm y with increasing urban infrastructure density the benin formation areas showed a recharge of 820 700 and 570 mm y in the low average and highly urbanized areas respectively fig 4e simultaneously the calibrated dataset suggests a recharge rate of 690 and 620 mm y for the low and average urbanized areas throughout the nkporo formation fig 1c recharge depletion in low urbanized areas compared with that in highly urbanized areas is consistent with the observations in hydrogeological literature e g lerner 2002 in fact the increments of the impervious surface increases runoff as backwaters accumulate on the ground surface the shales and clays of the nkporo formation explain the lower recharge values throughout the northern sector hydraulic conductivity values from the pumping tests were set during calibration unfortunately the simulated groundwater heads were insufficient and did not match majority of the observed heads even with overestimated recharge rates in fact the main drains i e the calabar and great kwa rivers with elevations between 5 and 10 masl tightly bound the groundwater dynamics at the end of the calibration process hydraulic conductivity values of aquifers i ii and iii were 5 0 10 6 3 3 10 5 and 3 8 10 6 m s respectively corresponding to those of rivers and streams fig 3d the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer i increased to 1 1 10 4 m s to enhance numerical convergence and better simulate ground to surface water exchange the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values were in line with the poorly sorted sands and gravels described by essien and okon 2017 higher values from the pumping tests might be related to the well development procedures that remove the finer portion of the soil in fact pumping tests are generally short term to maintain costs ngah and eze 2017 and involve only limited aquifer volume the calibrated dataset is listed in table 2 small differences in the head solution among the three layers were related to the hydraulic conductivity variation which was higher in aquifer ii than in i and iii simulated groundwater head of aquifer ii is mapped in fig 6a the water table elevation ranged from 5 to 65 masl with three peaks distributed on the hill crest groundwater predominantly flowed from the east to the west toward the calabar and great kwa rivers representing basal discharge lines of the study area along the ridge two head peaks were simulated corresponding to the calabar airport and calabar south with head values reaching 50 and 25 masl respectively between these maxima the streams carving the sedimentary sequence of the hill increased ground to surface water discharge causing a local groundwater head drop in the north the maximum head simulated in bacoco was produced by the geological change between the benin and nkporo formations the location and intensity of the head maxima were consistent with those of previous hydrogeological studies compared with previous models based on geostatistical methods edet et al 2012 2004 obianuju and efiong 2015 the proposed numerical approach also provided a better reconstruction of the ground to surface water exchange from a quantitative perspective the current model estimated the total groundwater budget in addition the model distinguished between groundwater extracted by pumping and that discharged to rivers and streams based on simulated data the total groundwater flow was approximately 154 million m3 y groundwater flowing to the numerous streams and urban channels is approximately 100 million m3 y and 44 million m3 y was directly discharged into the calabar and great kwa rivers under the current boundary conditions simulated groundwater consumption was approximately 10 million m3 y 4 discussions 4 1 insights on aquifer protection negligent drilling wastewater mismanagement and improper waste disposal produce diffuse contamination in vulnerable aquifers i and ii edet and okereke 2002 edet et al 2012 vertical groundwater flows triggered by pumping increases seepage of contaminated water into the deeper sections of the groundwater system modernization of urban infrastructure may effectively contribute to the mitigation of pollution risk at the cost of reducing local recharge recharge loss can be avoided with low impact development lid or sponge city installations but these elements are expensive and difficult to retrofit in a built up area fletcher et al 2014 jin et al 2021 although infrastructure modernization is necessary in calabar south reduction in the local aquifer recharge can be simulated by zeroing the recharge in the numerical model from a management perspective lack of aquifer recharge represents the worst case scenario a new water table distribution was simulated under such extreme conditions fig 6b the high groundwater table compensates for the lack of infiltrated water in calabar south urban groundwater flux has a new ne sw trend as the northern sectors contribute to sustaining calabar south water demand during the simulation groundwater pumping triggered a piezometric cone with a minimum groundwater head at 6 masl just above the river stage of the calabar and great kwa rivers this solution may not be representative of future conditions considering the large annual population increment of calabar which will inevitably increase water demand thus a pumping rate increment of 80 that possibly corresponds to the area s water demand for the next decade was considered in a new simulation fig 6c new boundary conditions consisting of null recharge and increased groundwater pumping simulated a water table depression up to 11 masl fig 6c under these extreme conditions the calabar and great kwa rivers contributed to the extracted volume of water the simulated water regime is a major aspect that must be considered by town planners because these shallow water bodies serve as collectors of untreated wastewater to increase water recharge and simultaneously improve groundwater quality town planners can dedicate green areas within calabar south with sponge city features that must be protected from waste disposal and littering under the current conditions the large and consistent recharge during the prolonged wet season dilutes the fecal contaminants and contributes to acceptable groundwater quality throughout the study area low levels of coliform bacteria and other pathogens recorded in most of the water wells were related to fecal contamination and urban waste mismanagement fig 7 during the short dry season diminished aquifer recharge contributes to a higher concentration of pathogens in the aquifer occasional rainfall occurring during the dry months can temporarily increase the water table reducing the unsaturated zone and increasing contaminant input dysentery waves emerging during the driest months of the year require urgent action to improve groundwater quality sanitary conditions may improve if urban groundwater utilization was completely abandoned for pipe borne water collected from the abundant and pristine resources of the calabar flank additionally modern sewer systems and coordinated municipal waste collection can mitigate aquifer pollution risk this scenario is feasible on a long term scale when accompanied by sustained economic growth that supports investments with revenue from utility bills nevertheless extensive unauthorized construction and rapid population growth complicate the role of decision makers in taking effective actions 4 2 limitations of the model a three dimensional reconstruction of the subsoil setting is difficult if correlation among the stratigraphic facies is attempted the benin formation has strong lateral and vertical heterogeneity and characterization of the productive layers within the sequence could not be realized with the available data additionally the tropical climate that produces laterites masked the surface and geological data could only be collected in correspondence with fresh road cuts moreover the investigations were also uncertain in some aspects affordable geoelectrical boreholes and other shallow geophysical investigations could have been disturbed by urban infrastructure inevitably increasing the amount of uncertainty to optimize costs groundwater wells are drilled by the private sector with percussions and rotary techniques destroying the core without providing a chance to compile the stratigraphic logs negligent drilling also causes cross contamination among the productive layers of aquifers continuous monitoring systems were not available and only rain gauge stations are present hence the static water levels included in several reports and used as observation wells in the proposed steady state conditions had to be averaged and the data on groundwater variation during the short dry season were unavailable 5 conclusions the hydrogeological setting was reconstructed using the usgs modflow groundwater model of calabar south a major metropolis in the niger delta with a tropical climate urban aquifers supply 69 of the water demand and represent exclusive access to water in disadvantaged districts massive rainfall that occurs during the wet season is stored in coarse sand deposits and largely supports the water demand of the population urban aquifer resources are mostly underutilized and the estimated groundwater pumping approximately 10 million m3 y represents less than 6 of the entire groundwater renewable resources in the study area the remaining groundwater quota approximately 144 m3 y flows to the calabar and great kwa rivers as well as various other streams and channels of the metropolis unpaved roads and undeveloped water infrastructure are a threat to water safety throughout the shallow but productive aquifers literature reports low but diffuse levels of coliform bacteria in the groundwater nevertheless abundant rainfall disperse organic contaminants during the prolonged wet seasons modernization of the water infrastructure that reduces the local aquifer recharge would mitigate the pollution risk without compromising on the groundwater resources future scenarios pose emerging questions regarding the vulnerability of aquifers rapid population growth will surely increase groundwater consumption and simultaneously the contaminant load in the future actions to improve access to safe drinking water are essential in calabar south at a regional scale the described hydrogeological setting is a starting point for further investigations and assessment of pollution risk at the populous

7778,study region zhanjiang city district southwest of guangdong province china was selected as the case study area owing to its relatively frequent occurrence of droughts and groundwater overexploitation study focus this study presents a useful framework to characterize the propagation from meteorological drought md to groundwater drought gd in different aquifers from the perspective of multiple timescales two standardized drought indices i e standardized groundwater index and standardized precipitation index with different timescales 1 48 months were used to examine the propagation time from md to gd in different aquifers three clusters i e natural p natural human p h and human h induced drought were considered for revealing the potential driving mechanism of propagation four characteristic mechanisms of lag pooling lengthening and attenuation were used to analyze the propagation process from md to gd among which the lag characteristic showing the propagation time was discussed corresponding to varied clusters new hydrological insights for the region results indicate the following 1 the propagation time in different aquifers varied that is in the shallow aquifer the average propagation time showed 1 month for the p cluster and 3 months for the p h cluster while the propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers were found to be longer than that in the shallow layer though much uncertainty remained for the former 2 the influences from md obtained the decreasing order of p p h h the propagation time of the p h cluster was longer than that of the p cluster suggesting the negative influence of human activities this study can provide additional information for policymakers involved in groundwater management during a drought graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought propagation meteorological drought groundwater drought standardized drought index natural and human influenced condition data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is a complex and recurring issue wilhite 2016 which is mostly defined as a natural phenomenon across multiple timescales peters et al 2006 interestingly human and socioeconomically induced droughts are usually treated separately from the general definition of drought van loon and van lanen 2013 little evidence has shown that droughts are a natural risk exacerbated by climate change van loon et al 2016 sheffield et al 2012 bloomfield et al 2019 especially because groundwater pumping plays an important role in solving water shortage and relevant droughts the anthropocene drought was investigated by van loon et al 2016 and severe droughts in human dominated environments were redefined in many places such as china australia spain brazil and california environments altered by human activities e g land use change irrigation dam building and water abstraction change the hydrological processes including evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff and storage of water the mechanical processes of drought propagation can explain how precipitation deficits are transformed into hydrological and soil moisture drought however many aspects remain unknown as to how the transformations are affected by anthropogenic influences either positively or negatively studies were conducted on the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought under the influences of large reservoirs wu et al 2018 2021a b changes in land use and various water management strategies lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 2013 and propagation from md to gd under different aquifer exploitation levels lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 despite extensive work on the regional analysis of md and other hydrological droughts no systematic investigation and attributional analysis in gd has been conducted at the regional scale considering the whole possible influencing factors gd is not a simple function of md drivers bloomfield et al 2015 because the response of groundwater systems to mds is influenced by spatial variations in the aquifer characteristics and groundwater flow processes including nonlinear unsaturated zone processes recharge groundwater storage flow systems and discharge over spatial and temporal scales previous studies have presented evidence for the spatial heterogeneity response of gd to md i e groundwater recharge and discharge area bloomfield et al 2015 2013 peters et al 2006 peters et al 2006 studied drought propagation and its influencing factors including groundwater recharge and discharge area in the uk and found that droughts near streams were attenuated with distance from the streams and that droughts near groundwater discharge area were more attenuated in upstream and less attenuated in downstream in addition the large differences of the response to drought events are found between the groundwater recharge and discharge area where gd in the recharge area was found to cover a relatively small area but last longer than md tallaksen et al 2009 to study drought propagation the role of groundwater flows was emphatically analyzed using the water balance method to quantify estimates of groundwater gains or losses for a global set of catchments hellwig et al 2022 where groundwater flow direction in the catchment was not available the disturbed underground temperature depth profile tp can be used to infer groundwater flow direction directly and effectively li et al 2019 saar 2011 for example groundwater flow can perturb linear tps by infiltration of relatively cool water or upwelling of relatively warm water causing concave upward tps in the groundwater recharge areas and convex upward tps in the discharge areas in contrast to other hazards e g flooding droughts caused by multidimensional events cannot be directly analyzed using a single variable vicente serrano 2020 to address the complexity of droughts and the process of drought propagation many methods have been applied to analyze gd e g the application of satellite data rodell et al 2009 model estimations li and rodell 2015 and cluster analysis bloomfield et al 2015 groundwater level hydrographs were classified to characterize the spatial variability in groundwater recharge moon et al 2004 in addition groups or clusters of similar gd have been identified using cluster analysis to investigate the regional gd characteristics bloomfield et al 2015 furthermore several methods pertaining to drought propagation such as the pearson correlation coefficient pcc spearman correlation analysis kumar et al 2016 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 and nonlinear correlation between hydrological drought and meteorological drought md wu et al 2018 have been used to study the propagation from md to gd however increased anthropogenic activities have accelerated the changes in gd through various interactive pathways in recent years further studies are needed to explore the correlations between gd and md bloomfield et al 2015 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 here we presented the first systematic analysis of gd using the whole possible influencing factors and explored the drought propagation between md and gd under the natural influences and effects of human activities in leizhou peninsula to further enhance our understanding of the relationship between md and gd at varied layers from recharge area to discharge area using standardized precipitation index spi and standardized groundwater index sgi and their different drought characteristics under natural and anthropogenic conditions a methodology for quantifying the relationship between md and gd and propagation time of gd to md was adopted this study enable us to gain an improved understanding of the human influenced gd and revealed the potential driving mechanism of drought propagation the main objectives of this study are as follows to calculate spi and sgi at multiple timescales and their relationships under varied aquifers and analyze the drought characteristics duration and severity to cluster the different types of gd according to the potential driving mechanism of propagation and to explore the propagation time of gd in varied clusters 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area zhanjiang city district is located in the northern part of the leizhou peninsula southwest of guangdong province china fig 1 it has an area of 1460 km2 and annual average precipitation and air temperature of 1500 mm and 23 c respectively the land use types of zhanjiang city include mainly urban farmland and forestland li et al 2019 the study area is a production base for subtropical fruits and vegetables including bananas and pineapples liang et al 2016 which consume more than 50 of total water via irrigation sourcing mainly from the extraction of groundwater guangdong provincial people s government 2016 the peninsula comprises three geomorphological units volcanic topography erosion terrain and marine topography wen 2013 the unit of volcanic topography with volcanic rocks and pores located in the northwestern part of the study area has the highest elevations of luogangling 233 masl and it serves as the main recharge area for the regional groundwater flow system the unit of marine topography is located in the eastern part of the area and it includes seven islands the unit of the erosion terrain is located at the central part of the area where the intrusive volcanic lithology transits to marine loose rock on the basis of the occurrence and hydraulic features of the aquifers the aquifer system can be grouped into three subsystems shallow aquifer with a depth of less than 30 m middle aquifer with a depth ranging from 30 m to 200 m and deep aquifer with a depth ranging from 200 m to 500 m the thickness and characteristics of the aquifers were described in detail by xun et al 2007 recharge into the shallow aquifer system occurs mainly via infiltration from precipitation and local recharge from reservoirs and canals pumping rarely occurs in the shallow aquifer due to the limited water source in this layer and evapotranspiration and flowing into the sea are considered its dominant discharge the middle and deep aquifers are confined and they receive recharge mainly from the regional horizontal water circulation system and the downward leakage from the shallow aquifer system they discharge primarily by pumping and through the subterranean discharge into the sea several studies have been conducted on the changes in groundwater environment due to overexploitation in this area including sea water intrusion and changes in chemical composition zhou et al 2007 2003 wang et al 2017 2 2 dataset zhanjiang is an important area for groundwater use its groundwater level monitoring has been implemented since 1970 by the guangdong geological environment monitoring station as majority of the data series presented missing data in scattered years due to manual monitoring we selected 20 monitoring wells with long term complete data series from 1974 to 2020 for the groundwater level fig 1 furthermore we selected the precipitation data series whose period is the same as that of the groundwater level data series i e those acquired from three meteorological stations in the study area the original precipitation and groundwater level data after removing trend passed the stationarity test in which the augmented dickey fuller statistic dickey and fuller 1979 was less than 0 05 table 1 the trends of the groundwater data were likely influenced by human activities over a certain period in addition to a regular seasonal change thus we considered the 20 groundwater wells as temporally and spatially comparable and could be used to reveal the recharge discharge regime in addition to study the influencing factor the soil permeability data were experimented in study area through the method of field soil permeability experiment described in detail by liang et al 2016 and the soil permeability data of six wells in shallow aquifer were obtained 3 methodology we designed a framework comprising six steps first data on monthly groundwater level and precipitation were used to calculate the drought indices at multiple timescales 1 48 months then the gd characteristics were determined by basic theory third the recharge and discharge area were analyzed in accordance with the tp fourth the pccs between spi and sgi were calculated fifth the three types of droughts were clustered on the basis of the three factors and two constraints finally the propagation time of gd was calculated 3 1 definition of human influenced gd gd includes human influenced gd and climate influenced gd fig 3 shows the two curves of human influenced gd and climate influenced gd using sgi similar to md gd has multiple characteristics such as frequency f duration d and severity t the different causes influence the two influenced gd taylor et al 2013 divided two influences in groundwater systems directly through replenishment by recharge from climate change and indirectly through changes in groundwater use the difference between climate influenced gd and human influenced gd is the trend of continuous decline of groundwater level in human influenced gd when the pumpage is large than the supply humans have depleted groundwater storage in several semiarid and arid environments including the us high plains northwest india and the north china plain but also in humid environments in brazil and bangladesh where abstraction is especially intense thus severe droughts in human dominated environments were redefined in many places van loon et al 2016 3 2 framework design for analyzing propagation time of gd step 1 calculate spi and sgi the spi has been widely used as it can be calculated in multiple scales with only precipitation data required as the input for md monitoring and drought assessment mckee et al 1993 andreadis et al 2005 aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 hayes et al 2011 wu et al 2018 previous studies of spi showed that the three month scale can represent seasonal droughts on the basis of the calculation on the fit of precipitation series to the pearson iii function short spi timescales of 1 3 months can sufficiently describe short term drought e g soil moisture whereas the long spi timescales of 24 months can sufficiently reflect long term drought e g reservoir storages hayes et al 1999 vicente serrano et al 2005 mckee et al 1993 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 followed the calculation procedure of the standardized streamflow index to calculate the sgi and fit the data with the most suitable probability distribution usually spi and sgi are sensitive to the quantity and reliability of data i e 30 years of data are needed furthermore appropriate probability distribution functions are required to fit the monthly data of precipitation and groundwater level for spi wu et al 2018 and sgi respectively however the shortcoming of spi and sgi is that the water deficit of a drought event cannot be measured and quantified directly mishra and singh 2010 in this study we used spi and sgi to reflect the drought process from meteorology to groundwater in contrast to the data series of precipitation and streamflow the monthly groundwater level series including their negative values can be fitted to many suitable probability distributions previously lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 used five methods for the probability distribution of their 12 groundwater data series log logistic log normal generalized pareto pearson type iii and weibull distribution in this study seven cumulative probability distributions were used for groundwater level analysis table s1 normal gamma and logistic in addition to the aforementioned five distributions many factors affect the change of groundwater level leading to complex distribution types the best fitting distribution for groundwater level can provide for a more accurate calculation of gd for data series in this study the most suitable probability distributions for sgi are log normal weibull distribution gamma and log logistic fig s1 and table s1 furthermore the two important parameters used to select the most suitable probability distribution curve are as follows anderson darling ad value referring to the minimum vertical distance between empirical cumulative distribution and theoretical cumulative distribution and pd value with a significance level of α 0 01 among all aquifers the ad values are the smallest for the shallow aquifer subsequently four of the abovementioned functions would be applied to calculate the sgi of each well additionally the monthly sgi series were used to identify the gd propagation instead of daily because the gd is caused by long periods of cumulative precipitation shortage or human activities such as the simultaneous occurrence of three month md event and one month gd event representing the short term gd from the pooling of mds the advantage of the sgi at 1 48 month timescales is that different regions or wells can be easily compared the cycle speed of surface water is evidently faster than that of groundwater and especially for deep confined aquifers groundwater renewal may take years to thousands of years to study the propagation of drought in groundwater the cumulative timescale must be extended to 48 months thus to investigate the propagation of the gd the precipitation and groundwater level series from 1974 to 2020 were used to calculate the spi and sgi with the multiple timescale covering 1 48 months the spi sgi can be calculated as follows 1 f 1 x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β x 0 where x denotes precipitation or groundwater level value β and α represent the scale parameter and shape parameter of the gamma function 2 f 2 x e x μ γ γ 1 e x μ γ 2 where x denotes groundwater level value γ and μ represent the shape parameter and location parameter of the logistic function 3 f 3 x β φ β x β 1 e x φ β where x denotes groundwater level value β and φ represent the shape parameter and scale parameter of the weilbull function 4 f 4 x 1 σ 1 ε x μ σ 1 ε 1 where x denotes groundwater level value ε and μ represent the shape parameter and location parameter of the generalized pareto function 5 f 5 x 1 σ 2 π e 1 2 x μ σ 2 where x denotes groundwater level value σ and μ represent the scale parameter and location parameter of the normal function 6 p i x x 0 0 f i x dxi 1 2 3 4 5 7 p i x x 0 1 2 π 0 e spi sgi 2 2 dx where p i x x 0 is the probability value for each fi x function when x x 0 and function 7 is the normalized standard distribution function the spi and sgi are obtained from functions 6 and 7 step 2 basic theory for determining the gd characteristics the observed gd characteristics including duration d severity t and frequency were extracted using the basic theory method as shown in fig 3 and table 2 two curves of sgi were used to explain the different gd characteristics caused by human activities or md the hypothetical schematic was developed to distinguish among natural induced drought human induced drought and human modified drought van loon et al 2016 especially because knowing the causes of drought is crucial in studying gd the mechanism considered in this research involved the interactions between groundwater cycle and society which has become a recent research shift montanari et al 2013 according to basic theory fig 3 the duration of drought including the start and end time of a single drought is defined as the period during which the gd index has remained below a truncation level and the magnitude of drought namely severity is defined by the accumulated drought index during the drought duration drought magnitude is a standardized value reflecting the shortage of groundwater or precipitation step 3 determination of recharge and discharge area according to the tp the tp of five monitoring wells were collected using a compact td logger jfe advantech japan the temperature and depth resolutions of this equipment are 0 001 c and 0 008 m respectively which records water temperature and depth automatically and simultaneously groundwater flow can perturb linear tp profiles by infiltration of relatively cool water or upwelling of relatively warm water causing concave upward tp profiles in the groundwater recharge areas and convex upward tp profiles in the discharge areas the cross section was selected in the study area fig 1 on the basis of the monitoring well locations tp profile was projected to the nearby cross section and the isotherms along the cross section are shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 5 shows the tp under the influence of pumping from well d09 4 occurred just after pumping relatively cold and warm zones were identified along the cross section which corresponded to recharge and discharge areas respectively a cold zone was found under a topographically higher area and a warm zone was found under donghai island fig 4 indicating that the groundwater flow system was highly controlled by the local topography however a cold zone appeared around well d09 4 fig 5 consequently the underlying isotherms were influenced by groundwater discharge induced by this artificial pumping in the study area wells l02 1 and l03 1 with high elevation are recharge areas and wells d24 3 and d25 3 located in the donghai island are discharge areas which are consistent with the findings of li et al 2019 the groundwater flow system remains unchanged but small scale changes occurred around pumping wells step 4 calculate the pccs between spi and sgi the pcc was used to study the propagation from md to gd the pcc method is commonly applied to reflect the response time of the hydrological variable to precipitation at multiple timescales via the correlation between monthly streamflow series and precipitation series vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2013 the pcc can be calculated as follows 8 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x y denote spi and sgi x and y represent the mean values of spi and sgi and n is the number of samples step 5 cluster the three types of droughts on the basis of the three factors and two constraints we used the three factors and two constraints to cluster 20 groundwater wells into the three main types of droughts p p h and h drought the three factors are the varied aquifer ranges of groundwater fluctuations and pccs between spi and sgi the two constraints are recharge discharge area and gd events corresponding to no md events indicating gd events mainly caused by other accessible factors i e human pumping the identification of recharge and discharge areas are based on measured tps as showed in step 3 step 6 calculate propagation time of gd previously mishra and singh 2010 found a lag time in the propagation from md to gd we used the method of maximum correlation between spi and sgi to calculate the propagation time correlation analysis is a basic tool for understanding relationships between different types of drought for characterizing drought propagation zhang et al 2022 han et al 2019 the maximum correlations at different timescales were calculated in step 4 but it showed the different causes of drought propagation for example different timescales of the spi reflect different dry wet conditions hayes et al 1999 and short timescales of the spi better reflect the short term dry wet conditions i e soil moisture the long timescales of the spi better describe the long term dry wet conditions i e climate change or reservoir regulation time delay for 1 48 months corresponds with the propagation time of gd when the maximum correlation between spi and sgi happened 4 results 4 1 pccs in varied aquifers and drought characteristics 4 1 1 pccs in the shallow aquifer by calculating sgi the accumulated timescales can be quantified fig 6 shows the pccs between the sgis of the shallow aquifer and the spis derived from the nearest precipitation station calculated at the timescales from 1 month to 48 months the correlations in the bottom right corner red positive pccs of the figure are generally higher than those in the upper left corner blue negative pccs indicating that short sgi timescales correspond to long spi timescales the negative correlations between spi and sgi on some timescales were explained by the physical processes e g the changes of groundwater level were affected by other factors besides precipitation md always occurs before gd first the maximum pcc of well w2 located in the recharge area according to tp was found in short term timescales spi 7 and sgi 1 second the maximum pccs located in the discharge area were found in long term timescales such as pcc 0 75 for w9 spi 12 and sgi 24 pcc 0 73 for w17 spi 48 and sgi 24 pcc 0 7 for w20 spi 24 and sgi 24 pcc 0 45 for w18 spi 24 and sgi 9 and pcc 0 33 for w10 spi 24 and sgi 2 the gd in the recharge area responds to md quickly showing the physical processes by which groundwater levels quickly respond to precipitation in recharge areas the characteristics of md events with short duration and light severity attenuate after drought propagates to the discharge area along the groundwater flow system reflecting the weak pcc between spi and sgi in the discharge area at short term timescales 12 month fig 7 shows the seasonal differences after calculating the general relationships between sgi and spi as expected the pccs between spis and sgis change markedly on a monthly basis the shallow aquifer presents a certain regularity with the distribution of the relatively high pccs shaped like a moon in contrast to the relatively weak pccs in the central area surrounded by this moon shaped plot at the 1 4 month timescales weak relationships occur from february to july whereas high pccs occur from august to october the seasonal differences from august to october may be explained by the occurrence of heavy rain i e typhoon rain when the increased infiltration strengthens the interaction between groundwater level and precipitation at the 5 9 month timescales the trends indicate a much more complex monthly pcc including the band of high correlations from january to march and the secondary peaks of pccs from september to october the relatively high pccs from january to march may be related to land use change i e low rainfall during the dry season combined with the high level of evapotranspiration as demanded by vegetation and crops causing the drawdown of water table in the shallow aquifer via capillary rise in addition the pccs are weak from april to august at the 12 48 month timescales the seasonal difference is not evident 4 1 2 pccs in the middle and deep aquifers the pccs between the sgis of the middle and deep aquifers and the spis are shown in fig 8 four correlation patterns can be observed the first pattern corresponds to the middle aquifer in which the pccs between spis and sgis at the long timescales are better than those at the short and middle timescales for the three data series of l02 1 l25 1 and l35 1 reaching the highest values at spi 24 the second pattern encompasses the six data series of l04 1 d02 2 l09 2 d09 4 l24 2 and d24 3 whose pccs are slightly weaker than that in the first pattern reaching the highest values at spi 48 the third pattern corresponds to the pccs of the middle timescales whose values are better than those of the short and long timescales including the two pcc series of l03 1 and d35 2 the final pattern encompasses the three data series of d03 2 d04 2 and d25 3 whose pccs have the weakest correlation less than 0 1 at the 1 48 month timescales furthermore the pccs between spis and sgis are at the maximum for the 6 24 month timescales which is consistent with the findings of kumar et al 2016 as previously depicted in fig 4c the lowest groundwater level in the middle aquifer may correspond to months long accumulated rainfall deficits indicating that the maximum pccs are concentrated in long term timescales 4 1 3 drought characteristics of gd the distribution of the gd characteristics from recharge to discharge area at multiple scales was evaluated using box plots in the shallow and middle aquifer the average of the drought duration and severity increased with the increase in the timescales of the sgi but no considerable change in deep aquifer was observed fig 9 at 1 6 month timescales d and t were smaller in the recharge area than in the discharge area but at 9 24 month timescales d and t increases remarkably in the recharge area indicating the opposite result in the shallow aquifer in the middle aquifer d and t were smaller in the recharge area than in the discharge area at 1 24 month timescales in general d and t were larger in the discharge area than in the recharge area because a short term md may develop into gd in the recharge area but it cannot propagate to gd in the discharge area with the attenuation of the water flow system whereas a series of mds can merge to form a long lasting gd in the discharge area and the groundwater level would remain at a relatively low level for some time after the end of the gd 4 2 three typical clusters of gd the three typical clusters natural induced p drought natural human induced p h drought and human induced h drought as shown in fig 10 and table 3 were derived from three factors and two constraints as described in detail in step 5 of section 3 2 the first cluster p cluster representing the near natural condition that is not directly affected by human pumping was clustered by the three factors and two constraints i e groundwater levels fluctuate annually within the range of 3 m the maximum pcc between sgis and spis is greater than 0 6 all wells are located in the shallow aquifer every gd event correspond to the md event the division within the range of 3 m is supported by previous findings for instance annual groundwater levels fluctuated within the range of 2 5 m from 1974 to 1999 in the north china plain chen et al 2003 and the groundwater levels fluctuated within the range of 3 m in equatorial africa where no pumping activities were implemented mileham et al 2008 in this study area the water supply is mainly from groundwater in middle and deep aquifers thus the clustering result that all wells of p cluster are located in the shallow layer was consistent with actual investigation the second cluster h cluster representing the human influenced condition was clustered by three factors and two constraints i e the pccs between sgis and spis are lower than 0 1 all wells are located in the deep aquifer the range of groundwater fluctuations is larger than 3 m no md events correspond to the gd event when the pumpage is greater than the replenishment and the groundwater renewal rate in deep aquifer is much lower than other aquifers causing a continuous decline in groundwater levels the d and t of gd in the h cluster were larger than that of other clusters fig 9 the annual downward trend of the groundwater level for the h cluster is 0 36 m in this study area this finding is consistent with the severe droughts frequently occurring in the ghataprabha river basin india whose annual downward pattern for the groundwater level is 0 21 m due to the influences of overexploitation and precipitation deficit pathak and dodamani 2019 the remaining wells belong to the third cluster p h cluster influenced by precipitation and human activities together the range of maximum pcc value is from 0 1 to 0 6 and the range of groundwater fluctuations are larger than 3 m the constraint of the recharge discharge area had minimal influence in the clustering results because it changes in response to human pumping according to the tp analysis in step 3 of section 3 1 figs 4 and 5 respectively however the constraint of the recharge discharge area is a non negligible condition for analyzing the process of drought propagation 4 3 propagation time from md to gd the propagation time was quantified on the basis of the three typical droughts in varied aquifers fig 11 s2 respectively these figures can show how long md propagates to gd in the p cluster fig 11a the propagation time was 0 3 months with positive pccs at multiple timescales e g 0 1 month for well w20 0 3 months for w9 however for the p h cluster in the shallow layer the propagation time was 2 7 months with positive pccs at multiple timescales fig 11b e g 2 3 months for well w2 2 3 months for w18 2 7 months for well w10 and 2 5 months for w17 from the recharge area to the discharge area the average propagation time in the shallow aquifer was from 2 months to 3 months our findings suggest that human activities have a delaying influence on the propagation from md to gd differences in lag characteristics are apparent between the middle and deep aquifers under the influence of pumping events fig s2 in the middle aquifer the propagation time of the p h cluster with positive pccs at multiple timescales was 5 12 months and the average propagation time was from 7 months to 4 months from the recharge area to the discharge area fig s2 the average propagation time in the human pumping area was prolonged to 17 months e g 12 24 months for l09 2 and 9 24 months for l04 1 in the deep aquifer propagation time is longer than that in the middle aquifer because of the weaker connection between groundwater level fluctuations and precipitation and the slower renewal rate of groundwater corresponds to the deeper aquifer the propagation time with positive pccs at multiple timescales was 7 9 months for the p h cluster and 8 48 months for the h cluster from the recharge area to the discharge area in the h cluster fig s2 the average propagation time was from 22 months to 9 months however the average propagation time in the human pumping area was prolonged to 30 months e g 12 48 months for d09 4 and 12 48 months for d04 2 in this study area where the pumping events mainly occurred in middle and deep aquifers the same laws occurred in the middle and deep aquifer i e the average propagation time in human pumping area was prolonged the average propagation time in the recharge area was longer than that in the discharge area 5 discussion the three typical clusters of gd natural p natural human p h and human induced h drought were derived from the three factors and two constraints i e varied aquifer ranges of groundwater fluctuations pccs between spi and sgi recharge discharge area and gd events corresponding to no md events the three factors and two constraints showed an improved understanding of the causes of gd although the clusters of gd have been discussed in the previous studies bloomfield et al 2015 moon et al 2004 researchers only used a parameter i e the pccs between spis and sgis in multiple timescales or groundwater level hydrographs to cluster however other parameters related to human activities and physical mechanism were overlooked in these studies for example researchers usually used the aquifer characteristics lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 i e the percentage of clay and the percentage of permeable lithological strata and unsaturated zone thickness bloomfield and marchant 2013 to discuss the regional changes of gd which are important parameters affecting the development and propagation of gd in addition the groundwater flows were a main influencing factor to study drought propagation hellwig et al 2022 overall although many parameters have been used to discuss the causes of gd this is the first time these parameters have been systematically applied to cluster gds on the basis of the geological conditions mathematical statistics drought propagation analysis and groundwater flow systems nevertheless the resulting clusters have been shown to identify distinct regional gd responses effectively across the study area especially the identification of human induced drought bloomfield et al 2015 identified human induced drought by differentiating between clusters showing trends superimposed on the regional signals and clusters with anomalous phase relationships with the regional signal based on a set of heuristic rules however factors and constraints i e gd events corresponding to non md events and pccs 0 1 could be identified directly for the human induced cluster impacted by anthropogenic factors in our study based on the classification of groundwater hydrographs droughts leave a considerably more persistent signature on groundwater hydrology than floods because the discharge of groundwater to streams is an efficient dissipation mechanism for wet anomalies and this discharge is often strongly nonlinear eltahir and yeh 1999 indicating that the cluster classification of gd provides a good basis for analysis of the heterogeneous response of groundwater to droughts at the regional scale the results of the cluster analysis add to our current understanding of the development and propagation of droughts in addition to identifying the p cluster of sgi hydrographs that exhibit different characteristic responses to meteorological drivers the framework also identified the p h and h clusters of sgi hydrographs which have been variably affected by anthropogenic factors the presence of an evident trend in the h cluster may be indicative of an anthropogenic effect from sustainable abstraction of declining trend and the water level recovery in this aquifer is negligible even after the heavy rainfalls fig 12d bloomfield et al 2015 identified the cluster anthropogenically impacted groundwater through the remarkable downward trends in sgi hydrographs however the signal that the remarkable downward trends in spi time series also happened and led to the same trends in sgi time series were mistaken for human activity in other words the presence of two signals in the p h cluster i e the abstraction of declining trend or groundwater rebound of rising trend fig 12c cannot be identified the groundwater level in the p h cluster increases only in response to a heavy rainfall of more than 300 mm per month and the time when the highest or lowest groundwater level is reached during the year because of the groundwater withdrawals has no general rule many studies involving various methods have explored the relationship between the precipitation and groundwater level castle et al 2014 tallaksen et al 2006 2009 which explained the characteristics of the p cluster the monthly average water level in the p cluster presents a fluctuation trend similar to that of the trend of precipitation fig 12b reaching the lowest point during the dry period in december or january and then recovering gradually afterward to the highest point during the humid period of the next year in august or september the highest groundwater level occurs generally at the same time as that of the maximum monthly precipitation or one month later but the occurrence of the lowest groundwater level is complicated when the rainfall deficit lasts for 1 2 months indicating the accumulative time from md to gd in addition the precipitation across different months of the year varies greatly fig 12a i e the humidity period mainly occurs usually from april to october but is most prominent in august due to typhoons which are consistent with seasonal differences of the pccs between spi and sgi from august to october fig 7 where there is limited prior information regarding groundwater withdrawals across a region a common situation in areas where abstraction is not highly regulated cluster analysis could be used because it has been in the present study based on a framework to identify a suitable number of clusters bloomfield et al 2015 bloomfield and marchant 2013 found a positive relationship between the characteristics of unsaturated zone and the largest sgi autocorrelation in fractured aquifers the lithological characteristics that may influence the correlations between the aquifers and precipitation were considered klove et al 2014 and the response to md is relatively fast in permeable aquifers lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 this previously shared result is consistent with that found in this study i e the pccs between sgis and spis increase with the increase in soil permeability coefficients fig 13 for the similar soil permeability coefficient the pccs of the p cluster are higher than that of the p h cluster which indicates that the connection between groundwater and precipitation is weakened by the influences of human activities however lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 found the opposite result as they reported high pccs between aquifer level and precipitation are related to active human activities i e high level of exploitation during the tourist season this situation can be explained by the descending groundwater level and accumulated precipitation deficits during the dry season in this study the propagation times of the p h cluster are longer than that of the p cluster despite the similar soil permeability coefficient fig 11 clearly human activities have a negative effect on pccs and propagation times from the regular pumping event in this study area during whole year which showed an evident trend in the h cluster moreover amid global warming the propagation process of drought has also changed döll et al 2012 ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2017 russo and lall 2017 and this aspect must be further investigated the propagation time was 0 3 months in the p cluster which is consistent with the lag of 1 2 months for the groundwater level response to rainfalls in southern taiwan yu and chu 2012 shahid and hazarika 2010 determined the two month lag as a response of groundwater level to precipitation after comparing the peak value between rainfall and groundwater level for the p cluster in shallow aquifer the different regional soil environments e g unsaturated or saturated zones play an important role in the propagation time from md to gd cuthbert et al 2019 in this study the natural relationships between the propagation time and the soil permeability coefficients affected by human activities and longer propagation time have been found in the p h cluster compared with the p cluster fig 13 which was explained by induced groundwater recharge the induced recharge happened from rains rivers and aquifers by lowering of the groundwater level around the pumping well mojid et al 2021 chaturvedi and srivastava 1979 which was also found from the tp profiles of a cold zone around the pumping well d09 4 in the study area the groundwater level of the pumping well dropped however it would rise when the quantity of induced groundwater recharge is greater than the pumping rate and could explain the reason why human activities have a delay response of groundwater droughts to precipitation shortage certain severe droughts redefine the drought issue in human dominated environments and human activities remodify the processes of drought propagation van loon et al 2016 in addition the propagation time of the p h and h clusters was 5 12 months and 9 22 months respectively and the pumping activities mainly occurred in the middle and deep aquifers in the zhanjiang city in particular groundwater exploitation began in the 1960s and approximately 500 000 m3 day of groundwater has been pumped from the productive coastal aquifers zhou et al 2003 and the changes of groundwater exploitation from 1985 to 2014 were 1 68 2 43 108 m3 year fig s3 the results of the present study showed increasing depth of groundwater aquifer with increasing propagation time which was explained by different groundwater flux in different aquifers and human activities li et al 2019 found annual vertical groundwater flux to be about 0 15 m a 1 in this area based on the temperature depth profiles of the 24 monitoring wells in this study area they also found that the groundwater flux in the shallow aquifer was larger than those in the middle and deep layers furthermore in deep aquifer the apparent age of groundwater was found ranging from 1 037 40 310 abp with approximately half of sampling sites exceeding 10 000 abp and the horizontal groundwater flow velocity is about 1 m a 1 li et al 2022 the evidence of groundwater age revealed the slow groundwater flow indicating a potential longer propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers the propagation time obtained could thus be used in a relative manner e g real time could be much longer than the estimated 24 or 48 months if groundwater age and regional groundwater flow were taken into consideration the pumpage increased when md occurred making the propagation of md to gd slow down because of supply the propagation time is strongly influenced by site specific pumping processes as well chu 2018 however uncertainty of the propagation time for the middle and deep aquifers remains and new efforts with more groundwater age at each well and detailed research on infiltration and recharge processes are necessary drought propagation through catchments and through the groundwater compartment is well documented peters et al 2003 2005 2006 bloomfield 2015 and four characteristic mechanisms of drought propagation can be determined to analyze the propagation process from md to gd through a theoretical diagram fig 14 which is associated with modifications of drought signals van loon 2015 bloomfield 2015 pooling is defined as an accumulated signal in which a series of mds may develop into a long lasting gd furthermore gd may continue for a certain period after the end of the md which is the characteristic of the lengthening mechanism no response is found for the groundwater level after a precipitation event which is a characteristic of the attenuation mechanism further showing that gd may not occur after an md by considering fig 15 which summarized the three droughts with multitimescales p p h and h and by comparing pccs evidence of a general attenuation of the correlation signal from p to p h and to h cluster was found in addition the results demonstrate that lengthening is most pronounced following longer and deeper gd fig 9 which are associated with the results of the present studies strongly supporting the concept of lengthening gd relative to md van loon 2015 bloomfield 2015 during droughts some clusters temporarily are out of drought conditions whereas others continuously show deepening drought conditions over 2 or more years and some clusters stay in gd for many months after gd and md has ceased in other clusters a short term md may not develop into md whereas a series of mds may develop into gd with a longer duration drought characteristic which represents the characteristic of the pooling mechanism when md propagates to gd especially in the middle and deep layers the characteristics of the pooling mechanism from meteorological to hydrological drought were also found in other studies wu et al 2018 van loon et al 2012 but the gd showed a lower response to md compared with the surface streamflow drought in addition human activities play an important role in the process of propagation further explaining the weak pccs between spis and sgis in the p h and h clusters however human activities may modify the processes of drought propagation therefore we must understand and quantify how human activities affect the four characteristic mechanisms of drought propagation and whether the effect is positive or negative the results of analysis shown in fig 11 indicate that the propagation time of the p h cluster is longer than that of the p cluster and the influence is negative for the lag characteristic under the anthropogenic condition the other three characteristics must also be quantified and discussed in future studies using scientific methods 6 conclusions this study presented a useful framework to examine the influence of human activities during a drought and the propagation time from md to gd using two standardized drought indices spi and sgi the zhanjiang city district a typical groundwater pumping area located south of china was used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of our analytic methodology our conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 this study determined and offered explanations for the three typical clusters p p h and h clusters based on the framework revealing the potential driving mechanism of propagation the regularity of the pccs between sgis and spis varied across the clusters in the order of p p h h the four characteristic mechanisms lag pooling lengthening and attenuation were summarized to explain the drought propagation mechanisms among them the lag characteristic was elaborately utilized to explain propagation time and it showed a changing pattern across the clusters i e in the shallow aquifer 1 month of average propagation time for the p cluster and 3 months for the p h cluster while the propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers were found to be longer than that in the shallow layer though much uncertainty remained for the former 2 the regularity of the gd characteristics from the recharge area to the discharge area was summarized and revealed that d and t were smaller in recharge area than in discharge area the second regularity of seasonal differences showed that high pccs between spis and sgis occurred from august to october because of the occurrence of heavy rain the third regularity indicated that the pccs between sgis and spis increase with the increase in soil permeability coefficients and the propagation time of the p h cluster was longer than that of the p cluster suggesting the negative influence of human activities despite the similar soil permeability coefficient the presented framework and clusters enable us to gain an improved understanding of the gd especially human influenced gd future studies may consider the changes in temporal land use and future climate influenced gd in relation to the response of different clusters to md using the groundwater model credit

7778,study region zhanjiang city district southwest of guangdong province china was selected as the case study area owing to its relatively frequent occurrence of droughts and groundwater overexploitation study focus this study presents a useful framework to characterize the propagation from meteorological drought md to groundwater drought gd in different aquifers from the perspective of multiple timescales two standardized drought indices i e standardized groundwater index and standardized precipitation index with different timescales 1 48 months were used to examine the propagation time from md to gd in different aquifers three clusters i e natural p natural human p h and human h induced drought were considered for revealing the potential driving mechanism of propagation four characteristic mechanisms of lag pooling lengthening and attenuation were used to analyze the propagation process from md to gd among which the lag characteristic showing the propagation time was discussed corresponding to varied clusters new hydrological insights for the region results indicate the following 1 the propagation time in different aquifers varied that is in the shallow aquifer the average propagation time showed 1 month for the p cluster and 3 months for the p h cluster while the propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers were found to be longer than that in the shallow layer though much uncertainty remained for the former 2 the influences from md obtained the decreasing order of p p h h the propagation time of the p h cluster was longer than that of the p cluster suggesting the negative influence of human activities this study can provide additional information for policymakers involved in groundwater management during a drought graphical abstract ga1 keywords drought propagation meteorological drought groundwater drought standardized drought index natural and human influenced condition data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is a complex and recurring issue wilhite 2016 which is mostly defined as a natural phenomenon across multiple timescales peters et al 2006 interestingly human and socioeconomically induced droughts are usually treated separately from the general definition of drought van loon and van lanen 2013 little evidence has shown that droughts are a natural risk exacerbated by climate change van loon et al 2016 sheffield et al 2012 bloomfield et al 2019 especially because groundwater pumping plays an important role in solving water shortage and relevant droughts the anthropocene drought was investigated by van loon et al 2016 and severe droughts in human dominated environments were redefined in many places such as china australia spain brazil and california environments altered by human activities e g land use change irrigation dam building and water abstraction change the hydrological processes including evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff and storage of water the mechanical processes of drought propagation can explain how precipitation deficits are transformed into hydrological and soil moisture drought however many aspects remain unknown as to how the transformations are affected by anthropogenic influences either positively or negatively studies were conducted on the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought under the influences of large reservoirs wu et al 2018 2021a b changes in land use and various water management strategies lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 2013 and propagation from md to gd under different aquifer exploitation levels lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 despite extensive work on the regional analysis of md and other hydrological droughts no systematic investigation and attributional analysis in gd has been conducted at the regional scale considering the whole possible influencing factors gd is not a simple function of md drivers bloomfield et al 2015 because the response of groundwater systems to mds is influenced by spatial variations in the aquifer characteristics and groundwater flow processes including nonlinear unsaturated zone processes recharge groundwater storage flow systems and discharge over spatial and temporal scales previous studies have presented evidence for the spatial heterogeneity response of gd to md i e groundwater recharge and discharge area bloomfield et al 2015 2013 peters et al 2006 peters et al 2006 studied drought propagation and its influencing factors including groundwater recharge and discharge area in the uk and found that droughts near streams were attenuated with distance from the streams and that droughts near groundwater discharge area were more attenuated in upstream and less attenuated in downstream in addition the large differences of the response to drought events are found between the groundwater recharge and discharge area where gd in the recharge area was found to cover a relatively small area but last longer than md tallaksen et al 2009 to study drought propagation the role of groundwater flows was emphatically analyzed using the water balance method to quantify estimates of groundwater gains or losses for a global set of catchments hellwig et al 2022 where groundwater flow direction in the catchment was not available the disturbed underground temperature depth profile tp can be used to infer groundwater flow direction directly and effectively li et al 2019 saar 2011 for example groundwater flow can perturb linear tps by infiltration of relatively cool water or upwelling of relatively warm water causing concave upward tps in the groundwater recharge areas and convex upward tps in the discharge areas in contrast to other hazards e g flooding droughts caused by multidimensional events cannot be directly analyzed using a single variable vicente serrano 2020 to address the complexity of droughts and the process of drought propagation many methods have been applied to analyze gd e g the application of satellite data rodell et al 2009 model estimations li and rodell 2015 and cluster analysis bloomfield et al 2015 groundwater level hydrographs were classified to characterize the spatial variability in groundwater recharge moon et al 2004 in addition groups or clusters of similar gd have been identified using cluster analysis to investigate the regional gd characteristics bloomfield et al 2015 furthermore several methods pertaining to drought propagation such as the pearson correlation coefficient pcc spearman correlation analysis kumar et al 2016 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 and nonlinear correlation between hydrological drought and meteorological drought md wu et al 2018 have been used to study the propagation from md to gd however increased anthropogenic activities have accelerated the changes in gd through various interactive pathways in recent years further studies are needed to explore the correlations between gd and md bloomfield et al 2015 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 here we presented the first systematic analysis of gd using the whole possible influencing factors and explored the drought propagation between md and gd under the natural influences and effects of human activities in leizhou peninsula to further enhance our understanding of the relationship between md and gd at varied layers from recharge area to discharge area using standardized precipitation index spi and standardized groundwater index sgi and their different drought characteristics under natural and anthropogenic conditions a methodology for quantifying the relationship between md and gd and propagation time of gd to md was adopted this study enable us to gain an improved understanding of the human influenced gd and revealed the potential driving mechanism of drought propagation the main objectives of this study are as follows to calculate spi and sgi at multiple timescales and their relationships under varied aquifers and analyze the drought characteristics duration and severity to cluster the different types of gd according to the potential driving mechanism of propagation and to explore the propagation time of gd in varied clusters 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area zhanjiang city district is located in the northern part of the leizhou peninsula southwest of guangdong province china fig 1 it has an area of 1460 km2 and annual average precipitation and air temperature of 1500 mm and 23 c respectively the land use types of zhanjiang city include mainly urban farmland and forestland li et al 2019 the study area is a production base for subtropical fruits and vegetables including bananas and pineapples liang et al 2016 which consume more than 50 of total water via irrigation sourcing mainly from the extraction of groundwater guangdong provincial people s government 2016 the peninsula comprises three geomorphological units volcanic topography erosion terrain and marine topography wen 2013 the unit of volcanic topography with volcanic rocks and pores located in the northwestern part of the study area has the highest elevations of luogangling 233 masl and it serves as the main recharge area for the regional groundwater flow system the unit of marine topography is located in the eastern part of the area and it includes seven islands the unit of the erosion terrain is located at the central part of the area where the intrusive volcanic lithology transits to marine loose rock on the basis of the occurrence and hydraulic features of the aquifers the aquifer system can be grouped into three subsystems shallow aquifer with a depth of less than 30 m middle aquifer with a depth ranging from 30 m to 200 m and deep aquifer with a depth ranging from 200 m to 500 m the thickness and characteristics of the aquifers were described in detail by xun et al 2007 recharge into the shallow aquifer system occurs mainly via infiltration from precipitation and local recharge from reservoirs and canals pumping rarely occurs in the shallow aquifer due to the limited water source in this layer and evapotranspiration and flowing into the sea are considered its dominant discharge the middle and deep aquifers are confined and they receive recharge mainly from the regional horizontal water circulation system and the downward leakage from the shallow aquifer system they discharge primarily by pumping and through the subterranean discharge into the sea several studies have been conducted on the changes in groundwater environment due to overexploitation in this area including sea water intrusion and changes in chemical composition zhou et al 2007 2003 wang et al 2017 2 2 dataset zhanjiang is an important area for groundwater use its groundwater level monitoring has been implemented since 1970 by the guangdong geological environment monitoring station as majority of the data series presented missing data in scattered years due to manual monitoring we selected 20 monitoring wells with long term complete data series from 1974 to 2020 for the groundwater level fig 1 furthermore we selected the precipitation data series whose period is the same as that of the groundwater level data series i e those acquired from three meteorological stations in the study area the original precipitation and groundwater level data after removing trend passed the stationarity test in which the augmented dickey fuller statistic dickey and fuller 1979 was less than 0 05 table 1 the trends of the groundwater data were likely influenced by human activities over a certain period in addition to a regular seasonal change thus we considered the 20 groundwater wells as temporally and spatially comparable and could be used to reveal the recharge discharge regime in addition to study the influencing factor the soil permeability data were experimented in study area through the method of field soil permeability experiment described in detail by liang et al 2016 and the soil permeability data of six wells in shallow aquifer were obtained 3 methodology we designed a framework comprising six steps first data on monthly groundwater level and precipitation were used to calculate the drought indices at multiple timescales 1 48 months then the gd characteristics were determined by basic theory third the recharge and discharge area were analyzed in accordance with the tp fourth the pccs between spi and sgi were calculated fifth the three types of droughts were clustered on the basis of the three factors and two constraints finally the propagation time of gd was calculated 3 1 definition of human influenced gd gd includes human influenced gd and climate influenced gd fig 3 shows the two curves of human influenced gd and climate influenced gd using sgi similar to md gd has multiple characteristics such as frequency f duration d and severity t the different causes influence the two influenced gd taylor et al 2013 divided two influences in groundwater systems directly through replenishment by recharge from climate change and indirectly through changes in groundwater use the difference between climate influenced gd and human influenced gd is the trend of continuous decline of groundwater level in human influenced gd when the pumpage is large than the supply humans have depleted groundwater storage in several semiarid and arid environments including the us high plains northwest india and the north china plain but also in humid environments in brazil and bangladesh where abstraction is especially intense thus severe droughts in human dominated environments were redefined in many places van loon et al 2016 3 2 framework design for analyzing propagation time of gd step 1 calculate spi and sgi the spi has been widely used as it can be calculated in multiple scales with only precipitation data required as the input for md monitoring and drought assessment mckee et al 1993 andreadis et al 2005 aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 hayes et al 2011 wu et al 2018 previous studies of spi showed that the three month scale can represent seasonal droughts on the basis of the calculation on the fit of precipitation series to the pearson iii function short spi timescales of 1 3 months can sufficiently describe short term drought e g soil moisture whereas the long spi timescales of 24 months can sufficiently reflect long term drought e g reservoir storages hayes et al 1999 vicente serrano et al 2005 mckee et al 1993 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 followed the calculation procedure of the standardized streamflow index to calculate the sgi and fit the data with the most suitable probability distribution usually spi and sgi are sensitive to the quantity and reliability of data i e 30 years of data are needed furthermore appropriate probability distribution functions are required to fit the monthly data of precipitation and groundwater level for spi wu et al 2018 and sgi respectively however the shortcoming of spi and sgi is that the water deficit of a drought event cannot be measured and quantified directly mishra and singh 2010 in this study we used spi and sgi to reflect the drought process from meteorology to groundwater in contrast to the data series of precipitation and streamflow the monthly groundwater level series including their negative values can be fitted to many suitable probability distributions previously lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 used five methods for the probability distribution of their 12 groundwater data series log logistic log normal generalized pareto pearson type iii and weibull distribution in this study seven cumulative probability distributions were used for groundwater level analysis table s1 normal gamma and logistic in addition to the aforementioned five distributions many factors affect the change of groundwater level leading to complex distribution types the best fitting distribution for groundwater level can provide for a more accurate calculation of gd for data series in this study the most suitable probability distributions for sgi are log normal weibull distribution gamma and log logistic fig s1 and table s1 furthermore the two important parameters used to select the most suitable probability distribution curve are as follows anderson darling ad value referring to the minimum vertical distance between empirical cumulative distribution and theoretical cumulative distribution and pd value with a significance level of α 0 01 among all aquifers the ad values are the smallest for the shallow aquifer subsequently four of the abovementioned functions would be applied to calculate the sgi of each well additionally the monthly sgi series were used to identify the gd propagation instead of daily because the gd is caused by long periods of cumulative precipitation shortage or human activities such as the simultaneous occurrence of three month md event and one month gd event representing the short term gd from the pooling of mds the advantage of the sgi at 1 48 month timescales is that different regions or wells can be easily compared the cycle speed of surface water is evidently faster than that of groundwater and especially for deep confined aquifers groundwater renewal may take years to thousands of years to study the propagation of drought in groundwater the cumulative timescale must be extended to 48 months thus to investigate the propagation of the gd the precipitation and groundwater level series from 1974 to 2020 were used to calculate the spi and sgi with the multiple timescale covering 1 48 months the spi sgi can be calculated as follows 1 f 1 x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β x 0 where x denotes precipitation or groundwater level value β and α represent the scale parameter and shape parameter of the gamma function 2 f 2 x e x μ γ γ 1 e x μ γ 2 where x denotes groundwater level value γ and μ represent the shape parameter and location parameter of the logistic function 3 f 3 x β φ β x β 1 e x φ β where x denotes groundwater level value β and φ represent the shape parameter and scale parameter of the weilbull function 4 f 4 x 1 σ 1 ε x μ σ 1 ε 1 where x denotes groundwater level value ε and μ represent the shape parameter and location parameter of the generalized pareto function 5 f 5 x 1 σ 2 π e 1 2 x μ σ 2 where x denotes groundwater level value σ and μ represent the scale parameter and location parameter of the normal function 6 p i x x 0 0 f i x dxi 1 2 3 4 5 7 p i x x 0 1 2 π 0 e spi sgi 2 2 dx where p i x x 0 is the probability value for each fi x function when x x 0 and function 7 is the normalized standard distribution function the spi and sgi are obtained from functions 6 and 7 step 2 basic theory for determining the gd characteristics the observed gd characteristics including duration d severity t and frequency were extracted using the basic theory method as shown in fig 3 and table 2 two curves of sgi were used to explain the different gd characteristics caused by human activities or md the hypothetical schematic was developed to distinguish among natural induced drought human induced drought and human modified drought van loon et al 2016 especially because knowing the causes of drought is crucial in studying gd the mechanism considered in this research involved the interactions between groundwater cycle and society which has become a recent research shift montanari et al 2013 according to basic theory fig 3 the duration of drought including the start and end time of a single drought is defined as the period during which the gd index has remained below a truncation level and the magnitude of drought namely severity is defined by the accumulated drought index during the drought duration drought magnitude is a standardized value reflecting the shortage of groundwater or precipitation step 3 determination of recharge and discharge area according to the tp the tp of five monitoring wells were collected using a compact td logger jfe advantech japan the temperature and depth resolutions of this equipment are 0 001 c and 0 008 m respectively which records water temperature and depth automatically and simultaneously groundwater flow can perturb linear tp profiles by infiltration of relatively cool water or upwelling of relatively warm water causing concave upward tp profiles in the groundwater recharge areas and convex upward tp profiles in the discharge areas the cross section was selected in the study area fig 1 on the basis of the monitoring well locations tp profile was projected to the nearby cross section and the isotherms along the cross section are shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 5 shows the tp under the influence of pumping from well d09 4 occurred just after pumping relatively cold and warm zones were identified along the cross section which corresponded to recharge and discharge areas respectively a cold zone was found under a topographically higher area and a warm zone was found under donghai island fig 4 indicating that the groundwater flow system was highly controlled by the local topography however a cold zone appeared around well d09 4 fig 5 consequently the underlying isotherms were influenced by groundwater discharge induced by this artificial pumping in the study area wells l02 1 and l03 1 with high elevation are recharge areas and wells d24 3 and d25 3 located in the donghai island are discharge areas which are consistent with the findings of li et al 2019 the groundwater flow system remains unchanged but small scale changes occurred around pumping wells step 4 calculate the pccs between spi and sgi the pcc was used to study the propagation from md to gd the pcc method is commonly applied to reflect the response time of the hydrological variable to precipitation at multiple timescales via the correlation between monthly streamflow series and precipitation series vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2013 the pcc can be calculated as follows 8 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x y denote spi and sgi x and y represent the mean values of spi and sgi and n is the number of samples step 5 cluster the three types of droughts on the basis of the three factors and two constraints we used the three factors and two constraints to cluster 20 groundwater wells into the three main types of droughts p p h and h drought the three factors are the varied aquifer ranges of groundwater fluctuations and pccs between spi and sgi the two constraints are recharge discharge area and gd events corresponding to no md events indicating gd events mainly caused by other accessible factors i e human pumping the identification of recharge and discharge areas are based on measured tps as showed in step 3 step 6 calculate propagation time of gd previously mishra and singh 2010 found a lag time in the propagation from md to gd we used the method of maximum correlation between spi and sgi to calculate the propagation time correlation analysis is a basic tool for understanding relationships between different types of drought for characterizing drought propagation zhang et al 2022 han et al 2019 the maximum correlations at different timescales were calculated in step 4 but it showed the different causes of drought propagation for example different timescales of the spi reflect different dry wet conditions hayes et al 1999 and short timescales of the spi better reflect the short term dry wet conditions i e soil moisture the long timescales of the spi better describe the long term dry wet conditions i e climate change or reservoir regulation time delay for 1 48 months corresponds with the propagation time of gd when the maximum correlation between spi and sgi happened 4 results 4 1 pccs in varied aquifers and drought characteristics 4 1 1 pccs in the shallow aquifer by calculating sgi the accumulated timescales can be quantified fig 6 shows the pccs between the sgis of the shallow aquifer and the spis derived from the nearest precipitation station calculated at the timescales from 1 month to 48 months the correlations in the bottom right corner red positive pccs of the figure are generally higher than those in the upper left corner blue negative pccs indicating that short sgi timescales correspond to long spi timescales the negative correlations between spi and sgi on some timescales were explained by the physical processes e g the changes of groundwater level were affected by other factors besides precipitation md always occurs before gd first the maximum pcc of well w2 located in the recharge area according to tp was found in short term timescales spi 7 and sgi 1 second the maximum pccs located in the discharge area were found in long term timescales such as pcc 0 75 for w9 spi 12 and sgi 24 pcc 0 73 for w17 spi 48 and sgi 24 pcc 0 7 for w20 spi 24 and sgi 24 pcc 0 45 for w18 spi 24 and sgi 9 and pcc 0 33 for w10 spi 24 and sgi 2 the gd in the recharge area responds to md quickly showing the physical processes by which groundwater levels quickly respond to precipitation in recharge areas the characteristics of md events with short duration and light severity attenuate after drought propagates to the discharge area along the groundwater flow system reflecting the weak pcc between spi and sgi in the discharge area at short term timescales 12 month fig 7 shows the seasonal differences after calculating the general relationships between sgi and spi as expected the pccs between spis and sgis change markedly on a monthly basis the shallow aquifer presents a certain regularity with the distribution of the relatively high pccs shaped like a moon in contrast to the relatively weak pccs in the central area surrounded by this moon shaped plot at the 1 4 month timescales weak relationships occur from february to july whereas high pccs occur from august to october the seasonal differences from august to october may be explained by the occurrence of heavy rain i e typhoon rain when the increased infiltration strengthens the interaction between groundwater level and precipitation at the 5 9 month timescales the trends indicate a much more complex monthly pcc including the band of high correlations from january to march and the secondary peaks of pccs from september to october the relatively high pccs from january to march may be related to land use change i e low rainfall during the dry season combined with the high level of evapotranspiration as demanded by vegetation and crops causing the drawdown of water table in the shallow aquifer via capillary rise in addition the pccs are weak from april to august at the 12 48 month timescales the seasonal difference is not evident 4 1 2 pccs in the middle and deep aquifers the pccs between the sgis of the middle and deep aquifers and the spis are shown in fig 8 four correlation patterns can be observed the first pattern corresponds to the middle aquifer in which the pccs between spis and sgis at the long timescales are better than those at the short and middle timescales for the three data series of l02 1 l25 1 and l35 1 reaching the highest values at spi 24 the second pattern encompasses the six data series of l04 1 d02 2 l09 2 d09 4 l24 2 and d24 3 whose pccs are slightly weaker than that in the first pattern reaching the highest values at spi 48 the third pattern corresponds to the pccs of the middle timescales whose values are better than those of the short and long timescales including the two pcc series of l03 1 and d35 2 the final pattern encompasses the three data series of d03 2 d04 2 and d25 3 whose pccs have the weakest correlation less than 0 1 at the 1 48 month timescales furthermore the pccs between spis and sgis are at the maximum for the 6 24 month timescales which is consistent with the findings of kumar et al 2016 as previously depicted in fig 4c the lowest groundwater level in the middle aquifer may correspond to months long accumulated rainfall deficits indicating that the maximum pccs are concentrated in long term timescales 4 1 3 drought characteristics of gd the distribution of the gd characteristics from recharge to discharge area at multiple scales was evaluated using box plots in the shallow and middle aquifer the average of the drought duration and severity increased with the increase in the timescales of the sgi but no considerable change in deep aquifer was observed fig 9 at 1 6 month timescales d and t were smaller in the recharge area than in the discharge area but at 9 24 month timescales d and t increases remarkably in the recharge area indicating the opposite result in the shallow aquifer in the middle aquifer d and t were smaller in the recharge area than in the discharge area at 1 24 month timescales in general d and t were larger in the discharge area than in the recharge area because a short term md may develop into gd in the recharge area but it cannot propagate to gd in the discharge area with the attenuation of the water flow system whereas a series of mds can merge to form a long lasting gd in the discharge area and the groundwater level would remain at a relatively low level for some time after the end of the gd 4 2 three typical clusters of gd the three typical clusters natural induced p drought natural human induced p h drought and human induced h drought as shown in fig 10 and table 3 were derived from three factors and two constraints as described in detail in step 5 of section 3 2 the first cluster p cluster representing the near natural condition that is not directly affected by human pumping was clustered by the three factors and two constraints i e groundwater levels fluctuate annually within the range of 3 m the maximum pcc between sgis and spis is greater than 0 6 all wells are located in the shallow aquifer every gd event correspond to the md event the division within the range of 3 m is supported by previous findings for instance annual groundwater levels fluctuated within the range of 2 5 m from 1974 to 1999 in the north china plain chen et al 2003 and the groundwater levels fluctuated within the range of 3 m in equatorial africa where no pumping activities were implemented mileham et al 2008 in this study area the water supply is mainly from groundwater in middle and deep aquifers thus the clustering result that all wells of p cluster are located in the shallow layer was consistent with actual investigation the second cluster h cluster representing the human influenced condition was clustered by three factors and two constraints i e the pccs between sgis and spis are lower than 0 1 all wells are located in the deep aquifer the range of groundwater fluctuations is larger than 3 m no md events correspond to the gd event when the pumpage is greater than the replenishment and the groundwater renewal rate in deep aquifer is much lower than other aquifers causing a continuous decline in groundwater levels the d and t of gd in the h cluster were larger than that of other clusters fig 9 the annual downward trend of the groundwater level for the h cluster is 0 36 m in this study area this finding is consistent with the severe droughts frequently occurring in the ghataprabha river basin india whose annual downward pattern for the groundwater level is 0 21 m due to the influences of overexploitation and precipitation deficit pathak and dodamani 2019 the remaining wells belong to the third cluster p h cluster influenced by precipitation and human activities together the range of maximum pcc value is from 0 1 to 0 6 and the range of groundwater fluctuations are larger than 3 m the constraint of the recharge discharge area had minimal influence in the clustering results because it changes in response to human pumping according to the tp analysis in step 3 of section 3 1 figs 4 and 5 respectively however the constraint of the recharge discharge area is a non negligible condition for analyzing the process of drought propagation 4 3 propagation time from md to gd the propagation time was quantified on the basis of the three typical droughts in varied aquifers fig 11 s2 respectively these figures can show how long md propagates to gd in the p cluster fig 11a the propagation time was 0 3 months with positive pccs at multiple timescales e g 0 1 month for well w20 0 3 months for w9 however for the p h cluster in the shallow layer the propagation time was 2 7 months with positive pccs at multiple timescales fig 11b e g 2 3 months for well w2 2 3 months for w18 2 7 months for well w10 and 2 5 months for w17 from the recharge area to the discharge area the average propagation time in the shallow aquifer was from 2 months to 3 months our findings suggest that human activities have a delaying influence on the propagation from md to gd differences in lag characteristics are apparent between the middle and deep aquifers under the influence of pumping events fig s2 in the middle aquifer the propagation time of the p h cluster with positive pccs at multiple timescales was 5 12 months and the average propagation time was from 7 months to 4 months from the recharge area to the discharge area fig s2 the average propagation time in the human pumping area was prolonged to 17 months e g 12 24 months for l09 2 and 9 24 months for l04 1 in the deep aquifer propagation time is longer than that in the middle aquifer because of the weaker connection between groundwater level fluctuations and precipitation and the slower renewal rate of groundwater corresponds to the deeper aquifer the propagation time with positive pccs at multiple timescales was 7 9 months for the p h cluster and 8 48 months for the h cluster from the recharge area to the discharge area in the h cluster fig s2 the average propagation time was from 22 months to 9 months however the average propagation time in the human pumping area was prolonged to 30 months e g 12 48 months for d09 4 and 12 48 months for d04 2 in this study area where the pumping events mainly occurred in middle and deep aquifers the same laws occurred in the middle and deep aquifer i e the average propagation time in human pumping area was prolonged the average propagation time in the recharge area was longer than that in the discharge area 5 discussion the three typical clusters of gd natural p natural human p h and human induced h drought were derived from the three factors and two constraints i e varied aquifer ranges of groundwater fluctuations pccs between spi and sgi recharge discharge area and gd events corresponding to no md events the three factors and two constraints showed an improved understanding of the causes of gd although the clusters of gd have been discussed in the previous studies bloomfield et al 2015 moon et al 2004 researchers only used a parameter i e the pccs between spis and sgis in multiple timescales or groundwater level hydrographs to cluster however other parameters related to human activities and physical mechanism were overlooked in these studies for example researchers usually used the aquifer characteristics lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 i e the percentage of clay and the percentage of permeable lithological strata and unsaturated zone thickness bloomfield and marchant 2013 to discuss the regional changes of gd which are important parameters affecting the development and propagation of gd in addition the groundwater flows were a main influencing factor to study drought propagation hellwig et al 2022 overall although many parameters have been used to discuss the causes of gd this is the first time these parameters have been systematically applied to cluster gds on the basis of the geological conditions mathematical statistics drought propagation analysis and groundwater flow systems nevertheless the resulting clusters have been shown to identify distinct regional gd responses effectively across the study area especially the identification of human induced drought bloomfield et al 2015 identified human induced drought by differentiating between clusters showing trends superimposed on the regional signals and clusters with anomalous phase relationships with the regional signal based on a set of heuristic rules however factors and constraints i e gd events corresponding to non md events and pccs 0 1 could be identified directly for the human induced cluster impacted by anthropogenic factors in our study based on the classification of groundwater hydrographs droughts leave a considerably more persistent signature on groundwater hydrology than floods because the discharge of groundwater to streams is an efficient dissipation mechanism for wet anomalies and this discharge is often strongly nonlinear eltahir and yeh 1999 indicating that the cluster classification of gd provides a good basis for analysis of the heterogeneous response of groundwater to droughts at the regional scale the results of the cluster analysis add to our current understanding of the development and propagation of droughts in addition to identifying the p cluster of sgi hydrographs that exhibit different characteristic responses to meteorological drivers the framework also identified the p h and h clusters of sgi hydrographs which have been variably affected by anthropogenic factors the presence of an evident trend in the h cluster may be indicative of an anthropogenic effect from sustainable abstraction of declining trend and the water level recovery in this aquifer is negligible even after the heavy rainfalls fig 12d bloomfield et al 2015 identified the cluster anthropogenically impacted groundwater through the remarkable downward trends in sgi hydrographs however the signal that the remarkable downward trends in spi time series also happened and led to the same trends in sgi time series were mistaken for human activity in other words the presence of two signals in the p h cluster i e the abstraction of declining trend or groundwater rebound of rising trend fig 12c cannot be identified the groundwater level in the p h cluster increases only in response to a heavy rainfall of more than 300 mm per month and the time when the highest or lowest groundwater level is reached during the year because of the groundwater withdrawals has no general rule many studies involving various methods have explored the relationship between the precipitation and groundwater level castle et al 2014 tallaksen et al 2006 2009 which explained the characteristics of the p cluster the monthly average water level in the p cluster presents a fluctuation trend similar to that of the trend of precipitation fig 12b reaching the lowest point during the dry period in december or january and then recovering gradually afterward to the highest point during the humid period of the next year in august or september the highest groundwater level occurs generally at the same time as that of the maximum monthly precipitation or one month later but the occurrence of the lowest groundwater level is complicated when the rainfall deficit lasts for 1 2 months indicating the accumulative time from md to gd in addition the precipitation across different months of the year varies greatly fig 12a i e the humidity period mainly occurs usually from april to october but is most prominent in august due to typhoons which are consistent with seasonal differences of the pccs between spi and sgi from august to october fig 7 where there is limited prior information regarding groundwater withdrawals across a region a common situation in areas where abstraction is not highly regulated cluster analysis could be used because it has been in the present study based on a framework to identify a suitable number of clusters bloomfield et al 2015 bloomfield and marchant 2013 found a positive relationship between the characteristics of unsaturated zone and the largest sgi autocorrelation in fractured aquifers the lithological characteristics that may influence the correlations between the aquifers and precipitation were considered klove et al 2014 and the response to md is relatively fast in permeable aquifers lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 this previously shared result is consistent with that found in this study i e the pccs between sgis and spis increase with the increase in soil permeability coefficients fig 13 for the similar soil permeability coefficient the pccs of the p cluster are higher than that of the p h cluster which indicates that the connection between groundwater and precipitation is weakened by the influences of human activities however lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 found the opposite result as they reported high pccs between aquifer level and precipitation are related to active human activities i e high level of exploitation during the tourist season this situation can be explained by the descending groundwater level and accumulated precipitation deficits during the dry season in this study the propagation times of the p h cluster are longer than that of the p cluster despite the similar soil permeability coefficient fig 11 clearly human activities have a negative effect on pccs and propagation times from the regular pumping event in this study area during whole year which showed an evident trend in the h cluster moreover amid global warming the propagation process of drought has also changed döll et al 2012 ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2017 russo and lall 2017 and this aspect must be further investigated the propagation time was 0 3 months in the p cluster which is consistent with the lag of 1 2 months for the groundwater level response to rainfalls in southern taiwan yu and chu 2012 shahid and hazarika 2010 determined the two month lag as a response of groundwater level to precipitation after comparing the peak value between rainfall and groundwater level for the p cluster in shallow aquifer the different regional soil environments e g unsaturated or saturated zones play an important role in the propagation time from md to gd cuthbert et al 2019 in this study the natural relationships between the propagation time and the soil permeability coefficients affected by human activities and longer propagation time have been found in the p h cluster compared with the p cluster fig 13 which was explained by induced groundwater recharge the induced recharge happened from rains rivers and aquifers by lowering of the groundwater level around the pumping well mojid et al 2021 chaturvedi and srivastava 1979 which was also found from the tp profiles of a cold zone around the pumping well d09 4 in the study area the groundwater level of the pumping well dropped however it would rise when the quantity of induced groundwater recharge is greater than the pumping rate and could explain the reason why human activities have a delay response of groundwater droughts to precipitation shortage certain severe droughts redefine the drought issue in human dominated environments and human activities remodify the processes of drought propagation van loon et al 2016 in addition the propagation time of the p h and h clusters was 5 12 months and 9 22 months respectively and the pumping activities mainly occurred in the middle and deep aquifers in the zhanjiang city in particular groundwater exploitation began in the 1960s and approximately 500 000 m3 day of groundwater has been pumped from the productive coastal aquifers zhou et al 2003 and the changes of groundwater exploitation from 1985 to 2014 were 1 68 2 43 108 m3 year fig s3 the results of the present study showed increasing depth of groundwater aquifer with increasing propagation time which was explained by different groundwater flux in different aquifers and human activities li et al 2019 found annual vertical groundwater flux to be about 0 15 m a 1 in this area based on the temperature depth profiles of the 24 monitoring wells in this study area they also found that the groundwater flux in the shallow aquifer was larger than those in the middle and deep layers furthermore in deep aquifer the apparent age of groundwater was found ranging from 1 037 40 310 abp with approximately half of sampling sites exceeding 10 000 abp and the horizontal groundwater flow velocity is about 1 m a 1 li et al 2022 the evidence of groundwater age revealed the slow groundwater flow indicating a potential longer propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers the propagation time obtained could thus be used in a relative manner e g real time could be much longer than the estimated 24 or 48 months if groundwater age and regional groundwater flow were taken into consideration the pumpage increased when md occurred making the propagation of md to gd slow down because of supply the propagation time is strongly influenced by site specific pumping processes as well chu 2018 however uncertainty of the propagation time for the middle and deep aquifers remains and new efforts with more groundwater age at each well and detailed research on infiltration and recharge processes are necessary drought propagation through catchments and through the groundwater compartment is well documented peters et al 2003 2005 2006 bloomfield 2015 and four characteristic mechanisms of drought propagation can be determined to analyze the propagation process from md to gd through a theoretical diagram fig 14 which is associated with modifications of drought signals van loon 2015 bloomfield 2015 pooling is defined as an accumulated signal in which a series of mds may develop into a long lasting gd furthermore gd may continue for a certain period after the end of the md which is the characteristic of the lengthening mechanism no response is found for the groundwater level after a precipitation event which is a characteristic of the attenuation mechanism further showing that gd may not occur after an md by considering fig 15 which summarized the three droughts with multitimescales p p h and h and by comparing pccs evidence of a general attenuation of the correlation signal from p to p h and to h cluster was found in addition the results demonstrate that lengthening is most pronounced following longer and deeper gd fig 9 which are associated with the results of the present studies strongly supporting the concept of lengthening gd relative to md van loon 2015 bloomfield 2015 during droughts some clusters temporarily are out of drought conditions whereas others continuously show deepening drought conditions over 2 or more years and some clusters stay in gd for many months after gd and md has ceased in other clusters a short term md may not develop into md whereas a series of mds may develop into gd with a longer duration drought characteristic which represents the characteristic of the pooling mechanism when md propagates to gd especially in the middle and deep layers the characteristics of the pooling mechanism from meteorological to hydrological drought were also found in other studies wu et al 2018 van loon et al 2012 but the gd showed a lower response to md compared with the surface streamflow drought in addition human activities play an important role in the process of propagation further explaining the weak pccs between spis and sgis in the p h and h clusters however human activities may modify the processes of drought propagation therefore we must understand and quantify how human activities affect the four characteristic mechanisms of drought propagation and whether the effect is positive or negative the results of analysis shown in fig 11 indicate that the propagation time of the p h cluster is longer than that of the p cluster and the influence is negative for the lag characteristic under the anthropogenic condition the other three characteristics must also be quantified and discussed in future studies using scientific methods 6 conclusions this study presented a useful framework to examine the influence of human activities during a drought and the propagation time from md to gd using two standardized drought indices spi and sgi the zhanjiang city district a typical groundwater pumping area located south of china was used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of our analytic methodology our conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 this study determined and offered explanations for the three typical clusters p p h and h clusters based on the framework revealing the potential driving mechanism of propagation the regularity of the pccs between sgis and spis varied across the clusters in the order of p p h h the four characteristic mechanisms lag pooling lengthening and attenuation were summarized to explain the drought propagation mechanisms among them the lag characteristic was elaborately utilized to explain propagation time and it showed a changing pattern across the clusters i e in the shallow aquifer 1 month of average propagation time for the p cluster and 3 months for the p h cluster while the propagation time in the middle and deep aquifers were found to be longer than that in the shallow layer though much uncertainty remained for the former 2 the regularity of the gd characteristics from the recharge area to the discharge area was summarized and revealed that d and t were smaller in recharge area than in discharge area the second regularity of seasonal differences showed that high pccs between spis and sgis occurred from august to october because of the occurrence of heavy rain the third regularity indicated that the pccs between sgis and spis increase with the increase in soil permeability coefficients and the propagation time of the p h cluster was longer than that of the p cluster suggesting the negative influence of human activities despite the similar soil permeability coefficient the presented framework and clusters enable us to gain an improved understanding of the gd especially human influenced gd future studies may consider the changes in temporal land use and future climate influenced gd in relation to the response of different clusters to md using the groundwater model credit

7779,study region the upper reaches of jinsha river basin ujsb in the northeastern tibetan plateau study focus spring floods in the ujsb have posed increasingly severe challenges to reservoirs operation and water resources management due to increased climatic variability under global warming in this study spring floods in the region were investigated for 2001 2020 based on station data and multisource remote sensing products we seek to understand 1 the characteristics including the peaks the frequency and duration of spring floods 2 how snowfall and rainfall affect spring floods new hydrological insights for the region late may has seen most of the highest spring flood discharge while some springs have experienced multiple peaks extreme spring floods were identified in the years 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 with the highest peak discharge 1365 83 m3 s and longest flood duration 47 days in 2019 spring snowmelt dominated the extreme spring floods in most years while the floods in 2012 and 2020 were results of combined snowmelt and rainfall we defined snow water volume swv as an indicator of the precondition for high spring flood the key regions contributing to spring floods in the ujsb were concentrated around the tongtianhe sub basin and the northern parts of batang zhimenda sub basin where the swv was large the enhanced westerly jets in winters brought about large snowfall and extended snow cover in the ujsb which can be released as floods triggered by rapid increase in air temperature in the coming spring graphical abstract ga1 keywords spring floods snowmelt snow water equivalent snow water volume swv snowfall rainfall data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent decades the effects of global warming have been widely reported pörtner et al 2019 liu et al 2020a particularly in high mountainous regions where the frequency and intensity of snowmelt floods have changed in response to changes in hydrometeorological processes kundzewicz et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2017 floods induced by extreme rainfall or snowfall are projected to increase significantly in high mountain areas with the results very likely to increase the risk of loss of life and damage to infrastructure and cultural tourism and recreational assets pörtner et al 2019 thus a holistic understanding of flood generating processes and its influential factors is of vast practical interest and importance rainfall and snowmelt represent two of the main factors influencing flood regimes vormoor et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2017 in spring snowmelt typically plays a dominant role in flood generating processes worldwide especially in the upstream regions of major rivers nolin et al 2021 in mid latitude arid and semi arid mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere the contribution of spring snowmelt to river runoff can exceed 75 wang and li 1999 for example in the indus river basin snowmelt has a great impact on river runoff immerzeel et al 2009 where meltwater from snow and glaciers in its upper reaches comprises more than 70 of the total annual runoff immerzeel et al 2010 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 in the himalayas snowmelt water contributes about 50 of river runoff bookhagen and burbank 2010 koike et al 2012 in the upper yellow river basin meltwater from snow also performs a significant role in annual runoff wang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 which contributes to about 22 of total annual streamflow zhang et al 2013 snowmelt in spring is mainly generated through the melting of antecedent snow accumulation bavay et al 2009 2013 sun et al 2020 thus winter snow accumulation exerts a significant impact on spring flood volumes snow cover extent in major mountainous regions worldwide shows considerable differences in response to climate warming while precipitation in mid elevation areas has increased snow cover has decreased and snowmelt has started earlier stewart 2010 in high mountain asia climate change has caused spatial heterogeneity in snow cover variations and snowmelt onset dates specifically increasing temperatures have resulted in earlier snow cover end dates and fewer snow cover days in the karakoram mountains yi et al 2021b earlier spring snow melting has resulted in increased runoff in march and decreased runoff in april and may in source area of yellow river basin liu et al 2020b increased snow cover in winter and spring in the altay mountains has caused increasing spring runoff and as a result increased snowmelt floods yang et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 in central europe changes in snow cover have altered the runoff seasonality rottler et al 2020 significant increasing trends in spring runoff peak value and snowmelt season length were identified in the european alps bard et al 2019 in addition to antecedent snow accumulation spring rainfall also affects spring floods for example in the baltic region spring floods are often a combination of rainfall and snowmelt kolcova et al 2012 melting alpine snow cover superimposed with heavy rainfall has also resulted in flood events in central europe freudiger et al 2014 studies in canadian watersheds identified a decreasing trend in the snowmelt related spring runoff peak but an increase in rainfall related flood events burn et al 2010 as identified by previous studies antecedent soil moisture also influences spring floods wasko et al 2020 in most of the united states soil moisture accompanied by snowmelt can control flood response in the spring berghuijs et al 2016 sivapalan et al 2017 in atlantic canada and new england high antecedent soil moisture levels with low evapotranspiration exerted at least the same importance as snowmelt in generating spring floods collins et al 2014 findings from the northeastern united states further highlight the importance of antecedent soil moisture in spring flood generation collins 2019 due to the complexity and diversity of climate the yangtze river basin is a flood prone area sutcliffe 1987 the upper reaches of the jinsha river basin ujsb above batang accounting for 10 of the yangtze river basin represent the most important runoff producing area for the yangtze river located in the eastern tibetan plateau river runoff in this area is affected by snow and glacier meltwater liu et al 2009 yao et al 2014 qi et al 2019 especially in the spring when the runoff is dominated by snowmelt previous studies have found that spring snow meltwater contributes 32 9 of the total runoff in the upper reaches of the jinsha river above zhimenda hydrologic station han et al 2019 with river runoff increasing in response to rising air temperatures from 1962 to 2012 yi et al 2021a accelerating snow and glaciers melting due to climatic warming has also increased spring snowmelt runoff and advanced the runoff peaks in this region with considerable impacts on domestic use agriculture energy production and flood control han et al 2019 in recent years many reservoirs have been constructed on the trunk stream and tributaries of the jinsha river thus spring floods have posed a major challenge for reservoir scheduling yao et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 from 1960 to 2017 rising risk of floods was detected in the jinsha river basin chen et al 2019 studies on projection of future flood changes have found an increasing number of extreme floods in the jinsha river basin during the near future periods yuan et al 2018 in late april to early may 2019 for example the largest spring flood in the past 20 years occurred in the upper reaches of the jinsha river see section 4 1 although the hydrological modeling in the jinsha river basin has been studied in previous studies zhang et al 2013 tayyab et al 2017 qi et al 2019 the contributing factors for spring flood generation remain poorly understood in addition to adapt water management strategies and schedule reservoirs in the jinsha river it is urgent to know the key regions dominating spring floods and what factors driving the extreme spring floods in the jinsha river basin given the limited studies on this on this basis the specific objectives of this study are to understand the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb based on station data and multisource remote sensing products analyze their major influential factors and identify the key regions dominating spring floods in the ujsb where snow cover is mostly distributed at high altitudes in situ measurements where available are always collected on the slopes of deep valleys and are thus generally underrepresented however remote sensing data can be used to address this issue due to their broad spatial coverage high resolution and frequent repeat times thus multi source remotely sensed data combined with reanalysis datasets were employed in this study this paper is outlined as follows firstly an overview of the study area is presented in section 2 secondly the descriptions of the data including their processing and methods applied in this study are given in section 3 this includes the calibration of gridded air temperature and precipitation data derived from the era5 land reanalysis dataset the simulation of snowmelt based on a distributed temperature index snowmelt model and the evaluation of the model are also described in section 3 thirdly the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb and the contributing factors to spring floods are analyzed in section 4 section 5 discusses the drivers of spring floods in the ujsb and the key regions dominating the spring floods finally the main findings of this study are concluded in section 6 2 study area the jinsha river in the upper reaches of the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau and flows through

between shigu and panzhihua belong to the midstream the river from panzhihua to yibin is the downstream as one of the most important water sources the upper reaches of the jinsha river basin above batang hydrologic station i e ujsb were selected as the research area to study the characteristics of spring flood generating processes and their major influential factors the study area covers the area between 29 29 35 52 n and 90 13 99 59 e representing a total area of 181 984 25 km2 the topography is complex with higher elevations generally in the northwest and lower elevations in the

vast plateau with relatively flat terrain dominated by sparse grassland environments the river in this region are wide and shallow with low flow velocities in the south and southeast of the basin there are deep canyons with large elevation differences with land cover dominated by shrubs and forests the rivers in this area run through mountains and narrow valleys with large drops and high flow velocities affected by the basin s complex topography the study area s climate is also complex and diverse the source region of the jinsha river has a typical cold dry plateau climate with scarce precipitation and long sunshine durations generally snowfall in this region begins in august or september and the river is frozen in november and thaws in the following may in the hengduan shan vertical climates predominate influenced by the steep terrain in the winter and spring controlled by the westerlies the weather is often sunny and dry with low rainfall yi et al 2021a in contrast in the summer and autumn influenced by the east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon more high intensity rainfall occurs lin et al 2021 the temperature and precipitation in the ujsb typically increased in a northwest to southeast direction the annual mean temperature of the basin ranges from around 5 35 to 1 65 during the studied period while the annual precipitation is between 379 55 mm and 467 28 mm the upstream area of the jinsha river is an important section connecting the source region of the yangtze river with the trunk stream in this area the river is narrow with fewer tributaries and a dendritic river network structure there are around 1796 glaciers according to the second chinese glacier inventory liu et al 2015 and 15 244 72 km2 of snow cover area in winter during 2000 2001 2019 2020 which accounts for approximately 8 38 of the ujsb affected by snow and glacier melting from the source region and downstream precipitation xiong et al 2020 snowmelt runoff and glacier runoff contribute respectively roughly 7 and 5 of the total runoff volume upstream of zhimenda hydrologic station han et al 2019 generally similar characteristics of intraannual variation in runoff were exhibited upstream of zhimenda gangtuo and batang hydrologic stations with more than one runoff peak occurring in spring and the maximum peak in july august the mean runoff in spring is in the range of 330 04 713 5 m3 s during 2001 2020 in some winters with heavy snowfall large spring floods would occur in following springs in addition evaporation in the basin is substantial with the annual evaporation above zhimenda ranging from 1340 mm to 1700 mm li et al 2020 3 materials and methods 3 1 data and processing 3 1 1 snow cover datasets the daily cloud free snow cover product for the

meteorological and hydrological data the era5 land reanalysis dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmrwf https cds climate copernicus eu was used to extract the study area s air temperature daily minimum temperature t max daily maximum temperature t min and daily average temperature tmp soil moisture sm and precipitation pre in addition the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center was employed to correct the data yang and he 2019 based on the observed data and physical principles the era5 land reanalysis dataset with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0 1 was generated by model data assimilation the cmfd was constructed by integrating conventional meteorological observation data from china meteorological administration with a variety of reanalysis datasets as the background field and its accuracy is better than the reanalysis datasets he et al 2020 the air temperature and precipitation data derived from the era5 land reanalysis dataset exhibit consistent change trends with the cmfd fig 2 thus the stl seasonal trend decomposition based on loess time series decomposition method can be used cleveland et al 1990 rojo et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 firstly time series decomposition was performed followed by the least squares method to calibrate the data from the seasonal and trend components to evaluate the accuracy of the calibrated data station observation data from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn were used in this study correlation analysis was applied between station observations and the calibrated data in the corresponding pixel as shown in fig 3 the air temperature and precipitation values from the

70 and 3 14 mm for precipitation runoff data from the batang hydrological station situated at the outlet of the ujsb were used to represent the total runoff of the basin in this study 3 1 3 auxiliary data data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model v 3 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were employed to assist with in analyzing snow cover variations in different elevation zones this void filled version of the srtm dataset was provided by the united states geological survey https lpdaac usgs gov products srtmgl1v003 monthly averaged 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa wind speed data from european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 era5 were used to analyze atmospheric circulation during the study period in addition to explore the influence of north atlantic oscillation nao on snow cover change the nao index from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service s climate prediction center was employed in this study 3 2 methods as outlined in fig 4 to acquire the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb extreme spring flood events were identified by using pearson type iii method based on daily runoff data at the batang hydrological station to divide spring snowmelt runoff periods the baseflow was separated using the method proposed by eckhardt 2005 further to explore the influential factors to spring flood events in the ujsb rainfall and snowfall was separated from the calibrated era5 land precipitation dataset by employing a thresholding method snowmelt was simulated using a distributed temperature index snowmelt model snow accumulation was calculated based on remotely sensed swe and sca products 3 2 1 rain and snow separation we used the following equation to separate rainfall and snowfall from calibrated era5 land precipitation dataset kang 1992 1 p s 0 t t l p t l t t l t s p t t s t l t t s where p s is the solid precipitation p is the daily total precipitation t is the daily average air temperature and t l and t s represent the temperature thresholds for rainfall and snowfall respectively the two temperature thresholds were calibrated using the snowmelt model introduced in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 snowmelt simulation and its evaluation to simulate snowmelt in the ujsb a distributed temperature index snowmelt model based on the degree day factor was employed in this study hock 2003 chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 based on the relationship between snow melting and air temperature degree day models have been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for snowmelt modeling and perform better than energy balance models at a basin scale hock 2003 this snowmelt model used in this study adopted a distributed method for snowmelt calculation to account for spatial variability as described in the following equation 2 sm t min sm t mlt swe t where sm t is the snowmelt in a grid at t th time period this value would not be greater than swe t which is the swe in the grid at t th time period sm t mlt is the potential snowmelt in the grid at t th time period which is calculated as 3 sm t mlt d mlt t t t mlt δ t where d mlt is the degree day factor t t is the daily average air temperature t mlt is the threshold temperature for snow melting and δ t is the calculation time step t t was derived from the corrected era5 land reanalysis dataset see section 3 1 2 and δ t was set equal to 1 in this study d mlt varies daily and can be calculated according to a sinusoidal equation fontaine et al 2002 as shown in the following equation 4 d mlt d mlt 6 d mlt 12 2 d mlt 6 d mlt 12 2 sin 2 π 365 doy 81 where d mlt 6 is the maximum degree day factor on june 21st the summer solstice d mlt 12 is the minimum degree day factor on december 21st the winter solstice and doy is the day of year swe t is updated based on the law of mass conservation as follows 5 swe t swe t sm t p s t rs where p s t is the solid precipitation at t th time period which was acquired using the rain and snow separation method introduced in section 3 2 1 the rs parameter represents the ratio of remaining snow after snow sublimation in this study we used the remotely sensed snow cover area sca this was derived from the daily cloud free snow cover product introduced in section 3 1 1 and used as a reference to calibrate the snowmelt model accordingly the simulated swe should be converted into sca using a parameter swe 2 sca i e 6 sca 1 swe swe 2 sca 0 swe swe 2 sca if the swe value in a grid is greater than swe 2 sca this grid is regarded as snow covered and vice versa finally the parameters for the model table 1 were calibrated by comparing the simulated and remotely sensed sca in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse pearson correlation coefficient cc and relative difference rd metrics were used to evaluate the snowmelt model s accuracy these values were calculated as follows 7 nse sca 1 i 1 n sca sml i sca rms i 2 i 1 n sca rms i sca rms 2 8 cc sca i 1 n sca rms i sca rms sca sml i sca sml i 1 n sca rms i sca rms 2 i 1 n sca sml i sca sml 2 9 rd sca i 1 n sca sml i i 1 n sca rms i i 1 n sca rms i where sca sml i and sca rms i are the sca of the ujsb at t th time period as simulated by the snowmelt model and as obtained from the remotely sensed sca product respectively as shown in fig 5 the simulated sca was equivalent in magnitude to the remotely sensed sca both exhibited consistent seasonal trends with cc values as high as 0 86 in addition the nse value between these parameters was 0 72 and the rd was 0 13 3 2 3 extract of snow metrics the snow cover percentage scp representing snow covered area as a percentage of the total area was calculated at a basin scale using the following equation 10 scp a s a 100 where a s is the snow covered area in the ujsb and a is the total area of the basin to estimate the antecedent snow accumulation before spring flooding the snow cover and swe products described in section 3 1 1 were combined to calculate the winter accumulated snow which was defined as the snow water volume swv as shown in fig 6 the pixel values in the snow cover product were first converted to values representing the snow covered area each pixel in the snow cover product was then multiplied by the corresponding swe value with the result corresponding to the swv pixel value accordingly the spatial resolution of the swv dataset was the same as that of the snow cover product 3 2 4 baseflow separation to obtain the baseflow of the ujsb the method first proposed by eckhardt 2005 was employed in this study this method is a digital filter method that estimates baseflow through signal analysis assuming that the baseflow is the low frequency part of the runoff eckhardt 2008 this approach achieves good performance in baseflow estimation and is independent of basin characteristics xie et al 2020 the equation for this method is as follows 11 b t 1 rbr max α b t 1 1 α rbr max y t 1 α rbr max where b t and y t are the baseflow and total runoff at t th time period respectively α is the recession constant rbr max denotes the maximum value of the ratio of baseflow to total runoff rbr and was determined using a backward filter method proposed by collischonn and fan 2013 12 b t 1 b t α b t y t as shown in eq 12 this method uses the recession constant to calculate r br max by conducting a backward iterative operation on the daily runoff 3 2 5 division of spring snowmelt runoff period the start date sdsr and end date edsr of spring snowmelt runoff period were defined according to change in rbr as the climate becomes warmer in spring accumulated snow begins to melt then the snowmelt runoff starts to generate and changed the rbr through the analysis of change in daily runoff and rbr during 2001 2020 we found that in march april when spring snowmelt runoff began to generate the rbr started to decrease while in april may when spring snowmelt runoff ended the rbr began to increase the first last and middle years of 2001 2020 were chosen as the examples to show the changes in daily runoff and rbr fig 7a d thus the date when the maxima of the rbr between march 1st and april 30th appeared was selected as sdsr and the date when the minima of the rbr between april 1st and may 31st occurred was determined as edsr 3 2 6 extreme spring flood events identification to estimate the spring flood frequency pearson type iii vogel and mcmartin 1991 was used to fit the distribution sequence of the highest discharge in spring at batang hydrological station during 2001 2020 pearson type iii is a probability distribution method which has been widely used for flood frequency analysis he et al 2021 this method has been found to perform well in many applications particularly for flood peak data liu et al 2020c in this study extreme spring flood events were defined according to the probability of the highest discharge in spring if the probability of the highest discharge in a spring is less than 20 then it is regarded as an extreme spring flood event 4 results 4 1 spring floods in the ujsb from 2001 to 2020 spring floods in the ujsb were characterized by multiple peaks fig 8 the highest spring flood discharge in the studied years occurred in late may in most of the studied years 70 only two of the years 2009 and 2019 having the highest spring flood discharge in late april fig 9b fig 7e illustrated the sdsr and edsr between 2001 and 2020 the sdsr was mostly in early march 55 of these years only 25 of these years started the spring snowmelt runoff period in april whereas the edsr was in may in 70 of these years 20 in early may 15 in mid may and 35 in late may the mean duration of the spring snowmelt runoff period was 53 5 days with the range from 25 to 86 days under the definition described in section 3 2 6 four extreme spring flood events in the year of 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 were identified during 2001 2020 fig 9a and b in the ujsb a detail analysis of the daily runoff processes in these four years was performed fig 10a d in 2012 the spring flood period started on april 30th ended on may 31st and lasted for around 32 days during which the runoff peak occurred on may 13rd and the highest flood discharge occurred on may 30th fig 10a generally the spring snowmelt runoff period began earlier than spring flood period during 2001 2020 for example it started on march 23rd in 2012 in 2013 the spring flood period began on may 13rd later than that in 2012 in the early period the runoff increased slowly whereas in the late spring runoff increased rapidly and peaked on may 23rd subsequently the runoff continued to increase and the highest spring flood discharge occurred on may 31st the whole spring flood period lasted for 18 days in 2019 the spring runoff increased dramatically from approximately april 15th peaking on april 29th with another increase of runoff in late may this spring flood period lasted for 47 days in total the spring snowmelt runoff period was as long as 84 days in 2020 the spring flood period started from around april 17th later than that in 2019 three flood peaks were recorded in the spring of 2020 which occurred on april 23rd may 8th and may 23rd the spring flood period ended at the end of may having lasted for around 45 days in these four studied years the maximum spring flood discharge in 2019 was the highest 1365 83 m3 s followed by 2012 1353 33 m3 s 2013 1281 67 m3 s and then 2020 1116 80 m3 s table 2 the flood duration showed a different trend with the longest duration in 2019 47 days followed by 2020 45 days 2012 32 days and 2013 18 days only 2019 had the maximum spring flood discharge occurring in late april the other three years all had the maximum discharges in late may 4 2 contributions of snowmelt and rainfall to spring floods snowmelt and rainfall are the main contributors to spring floods in high altitude basins to study the contributions of snowmelt and rainfall in spring flood generating process the daily runoff snowmelt rainfall and air temperature of the ujsb were analyzed for the spring periods of the four years fig 10 in 2012 before the first spring flood peak occurred snowmelt increased in response to the significantly increasing air temperature whereas no obvious increase of rainfall was identified before the occurrence of the first spring flood peak in order to further study the contribution of snowmelt and rainfall at different altitudes to the spring floods the total volume of snowmelt and rainfall at different elevation zones were calculated fig 11 it was clearly shown that the total volume of snowmelt was largest between 4453 and 4953 m a s l before early may of 2012 indicating snowmelt at 4453 4953 m a s l elevation zone of the ujsb made a major contribution to the generation of the first spring flood peak from mid may onwards an increase of rainfall between 3953 and 4953 m a s l fig 11b along with the snowmelt between 4453 and 5453 m a s l fig 11a resulted in the extreme spring flood event at late may it is worthy of note that a time lag existed between the snowmelt peak and flood peak fig 10 which was related to the time of concentration in large basin with multiple elevation zones jung et al 2017 in 2013 an obvious increase of snowmelt was observed from mid april fig 10b which mainly occurred at 4453 4953 m a s l elevation zone fig 11c meanwhile the rainfall increased significantly between 3953 and 4953 m a s l fig 11d as a result the snowmelt and rainfall combined to contribute to the first spring flood peak on may 23rd in late may rainfall between 3953 and 5453 m a s l resulted in the extreme spring flood event in the spring of 2019 rapid air temperature rises from mid april caused a clear increase in snowmelt fig 10c leading to the generation of the highest spring flood peak on april 29th spatially snow melting mainly occurred between 4453 and 4953 m a s l at this stage fig 11e from early may onward a significant increase of rainfall was observed between 3953 and 4953 m a s l which was the major contribution to the increase of runoff in mid and late may in 2020 the spring flood process was characterized by three continuous flood peaks from mid april fig 10d before the first flood peak appeared on april 23rd snowmelt between 4453 and 4953 m a s l increased dramatically in response to the rising air temperature from mid april fig 11g meanwhile rainfall increased obviously between 3953 and 4953 m a s l fig 11h subsequently increased snowmelt between 3953 and 4953 m a s l caused by the rising air temperature since late april along with increased rainfall at the elevation of 4453 4953 m led to the second flood peak on may 8th in mid to late may snow melting occurring between 4453 and 5453 m a s l and rainfall between 3453 and 4953 m a s l combined to contribute the flood events on may 23rd 5 discussions 5 1 uncertainty analysis overall the snowmelt model employed in this study performed well in terms of the general consistency between the simulated and remotely sensed sca cc 0 86 nse 0 72 rd 0 13 however some uncertainties still existed in this study it was noted that the simulated sca did not match the remotely sensed sca extremely well in peak values in some years the bias was probably attributed to uncertainties in meteorological forcing data especially the precipitation data although the air temperature and precipitation data were calibrated by the cmfd and validated by the station observations the limited number of meteorological stations due to the complexity of terrain would impose restrictions on the validation as in previous studies they found that bias in precipitation data may lead to significant uncertainty rather than parameter uncertainty in hydrological modeling sperna weiland et al 2015 which consequently led to the overall uncertainty in snowmelt simulation in addition the uncertainties in remotely sensed snow cover product can also introduce uncertainties in snowmelt simulation according to previous studies the overall accuracy of the remotely sensed snow cover product used in this study can reach 93 15 zhao et al 2022 so the uncertainty in the snow cover product is within 10 as mentioned in section 3 2 3 the calculation of swv was based on the remotely sensed snow cover product and snow water equivalent product thus the uncertainties in the two snow products can influence uncertainty in swv calculation validated by the weather station measurements the bias of the swe product was 0 65 cm and the correlation coefficient was 0 84 jiang et al 2022 although the inversion uncertainty in the swe product caused by the atmosphere was reduced by utilizing an atmospheric model and the uncertainty caused by forests was reduced by fitting the forest parameters the product still tended to underestimate swe for deep snow cover jiang et al 2022 which may lead to the underestimation of winter swv 5 2 drivers of spring floods previous studies have identified that winter snow cover can influence spring runoff through snow melting in spring meng et al 2016 li et al 2021 with sufficient snow accumulation in winter being a precondition for extreme spring flood events as shown in fig 12a the same trend directions were observed in both spring runoff and winter sca moreover a significant correlation was found between these two factors to further quantify winter snow accumulation winter swv was calculated from the snow cover product and snow water equivalent product as presented in fig 12c the winter mean swv in 2012 3 35 108 m3 2019 4 22 108 m3 and 2020 6 48 108 m3 were notably much larger than the winter average swv 2 25 108 m3 during 2001 2020 thus large swv in winter was a precondition for extreme spring flood events in the ujsb moreover spring rainfall can affect spring floods by changing flood volumes and spring air temperature also has an important impact on spring flood processes in addition to winter snow spring flood volume is also affected by antecedent soil moisture berghuijs et al 2016 collins 2019 wasko et al 2020 accordingly in this study a comparative analysis of soil moisture sm in winter was conducted for 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 the winter soil moisture in 2020 was found to be the lowest in the four studied years fig 12c this might account for the smaller spring flood volume in 2020 compared to 2012 and 2019 despite 2020 having larger winter swv and spring rainfall variation in snow cover rainfall and temperature are all driven by large scale atmospheric circulation such as the westerlies monsoon north atlantic oscillation and el niño southern oscillation birsan and dumitrescu 2014 ye and lau 2017 maclennan and lenaerts 2021 szyga pluta 2021 the ujsb located at the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau is affected by the westerlies during the winter and spring kang et al 2010 bao and you 2019 song et al 2021 thus spring floods in the ujsb are driven by the westerlies to some extent to explore the impact of the westerlies on spring floods in the ujsb the relationship between spring runoff and maximum scp and minimum scp in winter half year was investigated as shown in fig 12d the minimum scp of the winter half year typically occurred between late september and early october however the maximum scp dates of the winter half year varied dramatically notably in years with extreme spring floods the maximum scp occurred later and its magnitudes were larger compared with those from years with low spring runoff specifically in the winter half years of 2011 2012 2018 and 2019 the maximum scp appeared later than in most of the other years and its magnitude was also greater fig 12d resulting in extreme floods when triggered by rapidly increasing air temperature in the following springs however in the winter half years of 2002 and 2006 although maximum scp magnitudes were large the dates when they appeared were early fig 12d consequently they brought less runoff in the following spring periods fig 12a on this basis it was concluded that the maximum scp magnitude in winter half year and the date when it appears may both affect the intensity of floods during the following spring as snow cover is driven by large scale atmospheric circulation the dates when the maximum and minimum scps of the winter half year occur are linked to atmospheric circulation changes hence the characteristics of winter atmospheric circulation in the years with extreme spring floods 2011 2012 december 2011 january 2012 and february 2012 2012 2013 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 were compared with those with small spring floods i e 2002 2003 and 2006 2007 as shown in fig 13c the difference in winter mean 500hpa wind speed between the years with extreme spring floods and those with less spring runoff is shown by the west wind direction in the south of the tibetan plateau this finding demonstrates that the intensity of the westerlies was higher in the winters of the years with extreme spring floods in contrast to winters of the years with less spring runoff meridional perturbations in the 500 hpa airflow over mid to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere were stronger in the winters of the years with extreme spring floods fig 13a and b in addition the trough over mid to high latitude areas of the north atlantic appeared in a more easterly location and the trough over europe was deeper in the winters of the years during which extreme spring floods occurred the ridge over the urals also appeared in a more easterly location and its intensity was stronger consequently changes in the position and strength of the troughs and ridges caused a disturbance in the flow of the westerlies while the deeper trough over europe increased the strength of the westerlies the stronger westerlies in the winters of 2011 2012 2012 2013 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 resulted in larger scp and later maximum scp dates in the winter half year which in turn caused extreme spring floods in the coming spring the nao is the simultaneous strengthening or weakening of the iceland low and the azores high over the north atlantic hurrell et al 2001 li and zhang 2004 from a planetary scale circulation perspective the nao is a regional disturbance of the westerlies in the northern hemisphere that occurs over the atlantic frauenfeld 2005 the oscillation phase of the nao is closely related to the intensity of the westerlies diao et al 2007 woollings and blackburn 2012 thus strengthening of the nao would enhance the westerlies in the northern hemisphere given the impacts of the westerlies on snow cover change the nao s impact on variations in winter snow cover in the ujsb was explored in this paper as shown in fig 12b winter sca changes in the ujsb displayed similar characteristics to those of the nao from 2000 2001 to 2019 2020 both exhibited an increasing trend the intensity of the nao was stronger than the previous year in 11 of the studied years and the winter sca in the ujsb also increased in eight of these years similarly the intensity of the nao was weaker than the previous year in eight of the studied years and the winter sca in the ujsb also decreased in five of these years this demonstrates that a strong nao implying strong westerlies would result in a favorable atmospheric circulation pattern for snow accumulation in the ujsb whereas a weak nao would produce a pattern that is not conducive to snow accumulation as discussed above abundant winter snow accumulation is a precondition for subsequent extreme spring flood events 5 3 key regions dominating spring floods as discussed in section 4 2 spring floods in the ujsb were found to be largely influenced by snow melting heterogeneous distributions of antecedent snow accumulation before spring floods and spatiotemporal variations in spring air temperature both determine regional flooding variations qi et al 2021 to identify the key regions contributing to spring floods in the ujsb changes in the swv and isotherm in 2019 were used as an example for analysis as shown in fig 14 in the early part of the spring flood season march 8th to march 16th which was also the first period of decreasing swv recorded in spring the threshold snow melting temperature isotherm 4 7 moved from the south of the batang zhimenda sub basin to the middle corresponding to decrease in swv in the south of the ujsb during this period about 7 69 108 m3 swv melted out in response to the rapidly increasing air temperature fig 14c a concurrent marked decrease in swv was identified in the chumaerhe tongtianhe tuotuohe and dangqu sub basins fig 14a and e which may have been caused by snow sublimation notably a period of swv increase occurred from march 16th onwards this period lasted until april 5th during which time the swv increased by around 1 17 109 m3 due to the snowfall events fig 14c from april 5th to april 29th the air temperature rose rapidly fig 14c consequently the swv decreased significantly fig 14c while the flood flow increased dramatically resulting the extreme spring flood event on april 29th nearly 1 32 109 m3 of swv melted out during this period at the same time the isotherm of 4 7 moved from the south of batang zhimenda sub basin to the northern edge of the ujsb almost consistent with the recorded spatial variations in the swv fig 14b and f in the late stage of the spring flood season april 29th may 29th during which approximately 6 78 107 m3 swv melted out and only 1 28 107 m3 remained fig 14c snow melting mainly occurred in the northwest of batang zhimenda sub basin and some areas in the southeast of the tongtianhe sub basin and the southwestern edge of the dangqu sub basin fig 14d and f overall based on this analysis we conclude that in the early part of spring flood season the regions dominating flooding were mainly concentrated around the southern and middle parts of the batang zhimenda sub basin where the altitudes were relatively low and swv was small subsequently snowfall events occurring in the basin increased snow accumulation in the subsequent rapidly rising stage of the spring floods the predominant regions determining flood flow were mostly those in the upper and middle reaches of the ujsb especially in the tongtianhe sub basin and the northern parts of the batang zhimenda sub basin with high altitudes and large swv in the late stages of spring flood season when rainfall became the main contributor to flooding the snow in much of the study area had melted snow remained only in the northwestern area of the batang zhimenda sub basin and in some areas in the southeast of the tongtianhe sub basin and the southwestern edge of the dangqu sub basin which had a limited effect on flooding 6 conclusions understanding spring flood variability and their major influential factors under changing climates is crucial to improving water management agricultural irrigation reservoir operation and flood prevention in this study we have investigated the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb the impacts of snowmelt and rainfall on spring floods were quantified by using a distributed temperature index snowmelt model the main findings are as follows 1 during 2001 2020 the spring floods in the ujsb were characterized by more than one peak and the highest discharge in spring was found to occur in late may in most of these years extreme spring flood events occurred in 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 with the highest spring flood discharge 1365 83 m3 s and longest flood duration 47 days recorded in 2019 generally the spring snowmelt runoff period began earlier than spring flood period during 2001 2020 2 it was found that in 2019 the extreme spring flood event in late april was mainly contributed by the snowmelt approximately between 4500 and 5000 m a s l whereas in 2012 and 2020 snowmelt between 4500 and 5500 m a s l and rainfall below 5000 m a s l combined to contribute to the extreme spring flood events in late may in 2013 although snowmelt between 4500 and 5500 m a s l made a contribution to the first spring flood peak the flood event at the end of may was primarily contributed by rainfall between 4000 and 5500 m a s l 3 the large winter swv values were preconditions for the subsequent extreme spring flood events antecedent soil moisture was also one of the factors with an impact on spring floods the smaller winter soil moisture recorded in 2020 may be the cause for the smaller spring flood volume compared with those in 2012 and 2019 although it had larger winter swv and spring rainfall weather pattern analysis showed that stronger westerlies in winter would result in larger maximum scp magnitudes in the winter half year later appearance dates and more abundant winter snowfall which can cause the extreme spring floods when triggered by rising air temperature in the coming spring 4 regional differences in antecedent snow accumulation and spring snow melting determined the key regions dominating spring floods based on spatiotemporal variations in spring swv and the threshold snow melting temperature isotherm it was found that the key regions contributing to spring floods were concentrated around the tongtianhe sub basin and the northern parts of batang zhimenda sub basin where the swv was large the findings in this study are valuable for management of hydropower dispatching at the low reaches of the jinsha river despite the spring floods generation processes have been caught and analyzed the scheme in the study is highly relied on discharge observation which is unavailable at most situations therefore a more completed method that is less dependent on observation

7779,study region the upper reaches of jinsha river basin ujsb in the northeastern tibetan plateau study focus spring floods in the ujsb have posed increasingly severe challenges to reservoirs operation and water resources management due to increased climatic variability under global warming in this study spring floods in the region were investigated for 2001 2020 based on station data and multisource remote sensing products we seek to understand 1 the characteristics including the peaks the frequency and duration of spring floods 2 how snowfall and rainfall affect spring floods new hydrological insights for the region late may has seen most of the highest spring flood discharge while some springs have experienced multiple peaks extreme spring floods were identified in the years 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 with the highest peak discharge 1365 83 m3 s and longest flood duration 47 days in 2019 spring snowmelt dominated the extreme spring floods in most years while the floods in 2012 and 2020 were results of combined snowmelt and rainfall we defined snow water volume swv as an indicator of the precondition for high spring flood the key regions contributing to spring floods in the ujsb were concentrated around the tongtianhe sub basin and the northern parts of batang zhimenda sub basin where the swv was large the enhanced westerly jets in winters brought about large snowfall and extended snow cover in the ujsb which can be released as floods triggered by rapid increase in air temperature in the coming spring graphical abstract ga1 keywords spring floods snowmelt snow water equivalent snow water volume swv snowfall rainfall data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent decades the effects of global warming have been widely reported pörtner et al 2019 liu et al 2020a particularly in high mountainous regions where the frequency and intensity of snowmelt floods have changed in response to changes in hydrometeorological processes kundzewicz et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2017 floods induced by extreme rainfall or snowfall are projected to increase significantly in high mountain areas with the results very likely to increase the risk of loss of life and damage to infrastructure and cultural tourism and recreational assets pörtner et al 2019 thus a holistic understanding of flood generating processes and its influential factors is of vast practical interest and importance rainfall and snowmelt represent two of the main factors influencing flood regimes vormoor et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2017 in spring snowmelt typically plays a dominant role in flood generating processes worldwide especially in the upstream regions of major rivers nolin et al 2021 in mid latitude arid and semi arid mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere the contribution of spring snowmelt to river runoff can exceed 75 wang and li 1999 for example in the indus river basin snowmelt has a great impact on river runoff immerzeel et al 2009 where meltwater from snow and glaciers in its upper reaches comprises more than 70 of the total annual runoff immerzeel et al 2010 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 in the himalayas snowmelt water contributes about 50 of river runoff bookhagen and burbank 2010 koike et al 2012 in the upper yellow river basin meltwater from snow also performs a significant role in annual runoff wang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 which contributes to about 22 of total annual streamflow zhang et al 2013 snowmelt in spring is mainly generated through the melting of antecedent snow accumulation bavay et al 2009 2013 sun et al 2020 thus winter snow accumulation exerts a significant impact on spring flood volumes snow cover extent in major mountainous regions worldwide shows considerable differences in response to climate warming while precipitation in mid elevation areas has increased snow cover has decreased and snowmelt has started earlier stewart 2010 in high mountain asia climate change has caused spatial heterogeneity in snow cover variations and snowmelt onset dates specifically increasing temperatures have resulted in earlier snow cover end dates and fewer snow cover days in the karakoram mountains yi et al 2021b earlier spring snow melting has resulted in increased runoff in march and decreased runoff in april and may in source area of yellow river basin liu et al 2020b increased snow cover in winter and spring in the altay mountains has caused increasing spring runoff and as a result increased snowmelt floods yang et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 in central europe changes in snow cover have altered the runoff seasonality rottler et al 2020 significant increasing trends in spring runoff peak value and snowmelt season length were identified in the european alps bard et al 2019 in addition to antecedent snow accumulation spring rainfall also affects spring floods for example in the baltic region spring floods are often a combination of rainfall and snowmelt kolcova et al 2012 melting alpine snow cover superimposed with heavy rainfall has also resulted in flood events in central europe freudiger et al 2014 studies in canadian watersheds identified a decreasing trend in the snowmelt related spring runoff peak but an increase in rainfall related flood events burn et al 2010 as identified by previous studies antecedent soil moisture also influences spring floods wasko et al 2020 in most of the united states soil moisture accompanied by snowmelt can control flood response in the spring berghuijs et al 2016 sivapalan et al 2017 in atlantic canada and new england high antecedent soil moisture levels with low evapotranspiration exerted at least the same importance as snowmelt in generating spring floods collins et al 2014 findings from the northeastern united states further highlight the importance of antecedent soil moisture in spring flood generation collins 2019 due to the complexity and diversity of climate the yangtze river basin is a flood prone area sutcliffe 1987 the upper reaches of the jinsha river basin ujsb above batang accounting for 10 of the yangtze river basin represent the most important runoff producing area for the yangtze river located in the eastern tibetan plateau river runoff in this area is affected by snow and glacier meltwater liu et al 2009 yao et al 2014 qi et al 2019 especially in the spring when the runoff is dominated by snowmelt previous studies have found that spring snow meltwater contributes 32 9 of the total runoff in the upper reaches of the jinsha river above zhimenda hydrologic station han et al 2019 with river runoff increasing in response to rising air temperatures from 1962 to 2012 yi et al 2021a accelerating snow and glaciers melting due to climatic warming has also increased spring snowmelt runoff and advanced the runoff peaks in this region with considerable impacts on domestic use agriculture energy production and flood control han et al 2019 in recent years many reservoirs have been constructed on the trunk stream and tributaries of the jinsha river thus spring floods have posed a major challenge for reservoir scheduling yao et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 from 1960 to 2017 rising risk of floods was detected in the jinsha river basin chen et al 2019 studies on projection of future flood changes have found an increasing number of extreme floods in the jinsha river basin during the near future periods yuan et al 2018 in late april to early may 2019 for example the largest spring flood in the past 20 years occurred in the upper reaches of the jinsha river see section 4 1 although the hydrological modeling in the jinsha river basin has been studied in previous studies zhang et al 2013 tayyab et al 2017 qi et al 2019 the contributing factors for spring flood generation remain poorly understood in addition to adapt water management strategies and schedule reservoirs in the jinsha river it is urgent to know the key regions dominating spring floods and what factors driving the extreme spring floods in the jinsha river basin given the limited studies on this on this basis the specific objectives of this study are to understand the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb based on station data and multisource remote sensing products analyze their major influential factors and identify the key regions dominating spring floods in the ujsb where snow cover is mostly distributed at high altitudes in situ measurements where available are always collected on the slopes of deep valleys and are thus generally underrepresented however remote sensing data can be used to address this issue due to their broad spatial coverage high resolution and frequent repeat times thus multi source remotely sensed data combined with reanalysis datasets were employed in this study this paper is outlined as follows firstly an overview of the study area is presented in section 2 secondly the descriptions of the data including their processing and methods applied in this study are given in section 3 this includes the calibration of gridded air temperature and precipitation data derived from the era5 land reanalysis dataset the simulation of snowmelt based on a distributed temperature index snowmelt model and the evaluation of the model are also described in section 3 thirdly the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb and the contributing factors to spring floods are analyzed in section 4 section 5 discusses the drivers of spring floods in the ujsb and the key regions dominating the spring floods finally the main findings of this study are concluded in section 6 2 study area the jinsha river in the upper reaches of the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau and flows through the chuanxibei plateau the hengduan shan the yunnan guizhou plateau and the mountainous areas of the southwest sichuan province fig 1 the river above shigu is the upstream of the jinsha river that between shigu and panzhihua belong to the midstream the river from panzhihua to yibin is the downstream as one of the most important water sources the upper reaches of the jinsha river basin above batang hydrologic station i e ujsb were selected as the research area to study the characteristics of spring flood generating processes and their major influential factors the study area covers the area between 29 29 35 52 n and 90 13 99 59 e representing a total area of 181 984 25 km2 the topography is complex with higher elevations generally in the northwest and lower elevations in the southeast it is one of the highest basins in the world with an altitude range of from 2453 to 6438 m and an average altitude of 4651 4 m the source region in the north and northwest of the basin is a vast plateau with relatively flat terrain dominated by sparse grassland environments the river in this region are wide and shallow with low flow velocities in the south and southeast of the basin there are deep canyons with large elevation differences with land cover dominated by shrubs and forests the rivers in this area run through mountains and narrow valleys with large drops and high flow velocities affected by the basin s complex topography the study area s climate is also complex and diverse the source region of the jinsha river has a typical cold dry plateau climate with scarce precipitation and long sunshine durations generally snowfall in this region begins in august or september and the river is frozen in november and thaws in the following may in the hengduan shan vertical climates predominate influenced by the steep terrain in the winter and spring controlled by the westerlies the weather is often sunny and dry with low rainfall yi et al 2021a in contrast in the summer and autumn influenced by the east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon more high intensity rainfall occurs lin et al 2021 the temperature and precipitation in the ujsb typically increased in a northwest to southeast direction the annual mean temperature of the basin ranges from around 5 35 to 1 65 during the studied period while the annual precipitation is between 379 55 mm and 467 28 mm the upstream area of the jinsha river is an important section connecting the source region of the yangtze river with the trunk stream in this area the river is narrow with fewer tributaries and a dendritic river network structure there are around 1796 glaciers according to the second chinese glacier inventory liu et al 2015 and 15 244 72 km2 of snow cover area in winter during 2000 2001 2019 2020 which accounts for approximately 8 38 of the ujsb affected by snow and glacier melting from the source region and downstream precipitation xiong et al 2020 snowmelt runoff and glacier runoff contribute respectively roughly 7 and 5 of the total runoff volume upstream of zhimenda hydrologic station han et al 2019 generally similar characteristics of intraannual variation in runoff were exhibited upstream of zhimenda gangtuo and batang hydrologic stations with more than one runoff peak occurring in spring and the maximum peak in july august the mean runoff in spring is in the range of 330 04 713 5 m3 s during 2001 2020 in some winters with heavy snowfall large spring floods would occur in following springs in addition evaporation in the basin is substantial with the annual evaporation above zhimenda ranging from 1340 mm to 1700 mm li et al 2020 3 materials and methods 3 1 data and processing 3 1 1 snow cover datasets the daily cloud free snow cover product for the

with a spatial resolution of 500 m based on the characteristics of snow cover in china the algorithm used in this product includes the effects of different land cover types on snow cover detection in addition a multi index snow discrimination algorithm was developed to improve the accuracy of snow cover detection in forested and mountainous areas and the hidden markov algorithm and multi source data fusion method were combined to remove clouds completely the daily snow water equivalent swe product during 1980 2020 jiang et al 2020 derived from the national cryosphere desert data center http

pixels on swe extraction based on china s snow cover characteristics the impacts of topography atmosphere and land cover types on swe retrieval were included in the algorithm jiang et al 2022 in addition the band combination method was applied to remove topography effects the shallow snow deep snow dry snow and wet snow across china were also taken into consideration in the product 3 1 2 meteorological and hydrological data the era5 land reanalysis dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmrwf https cds climate copernicus eu was used to extract the study area s air temperature daily minimum temperature t max daily maximum temperature t min and daily average temperature tmp soil moisture sm and precipitation pre in addition the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center was employed to correct the data yang and he 2019 based on the observed data and physical principles the era5 land reanalysis dataset with a temporal resolution of one hour and a spatial resolution of 0 1 was generated by model data assimilation the cmfd was constructed by integrating conventional meteorological observation data from china meteorological administration with a variety of reanalysis datasets as the background field and its accuracy is better than the reanalysis datasets he et al 2020 the air temperature and precipitation data derived from the era5 land reanalysis dataset exhibit consistent change trends with the cmfd fig 2 thus the stl seasonal trend decomposition based on loess time series decomposition method can be used cleveland et al 1990 rojo et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 firstly time series decomposition was performed followed by the least squares method to calibrate the data from the seasonal and trend components to evaluate the accuracy of the calibrated data station observation data from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn were used in this study correlation analysis was applied between station observations and the calibrated data in the corresponding pixel as shown in fig 3 the air temperature and precipitation values from the calibrated data agreed well with those from stations with an average correlation coefficient of 0 93 and a root mean square error rmse value of 2 83 for air temperature and corresponding values of 0 70 and 3 14 mm for precipitation runoff data from the batang hydrological station situated at the outlet of the ujsb were used to represent the total runoff of the basin in this study 3 1 3 auxiliary data data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model v 3 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were employed to assist with in analyzing snow cover variations in different elevation zones this void filled version of the srtm dataset was provided by the united states geological survey https lpdaac usgs gov products srtmgl1v003 monthly averaged 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa wind speed data from european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 era5 were used to analyze atmospheric circulation during the study period in addition to explore the influence of north atlantic oscillation nao on snow cover change the nao index from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service s climate prediction center was employed in this study 3 2 methods as outlined in fig 4 to acquire the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb extreme spring flood events were identified by using pearson type iii method based on daily runoff data at the batang hydrological station to divide spring snowmelt runoff periods the baseflow was separated using the method proposed by eckhardt 2005 further to explore the influential factors to spring flood events in the ujsb rainfall and snowfall was separated from the calibrated era5 land precipitation dataset by employing a thresholding method snowmelt was simulated using a distributed temperature index snowmelt model snow accumulation was calculated based on remotely sensed swe and sca products 3 2 1 rain and snow separation we used the following equation to separate rainfall and snowfall from calibrated era5 land precipitation dataset kang 1992 1 p s 0 t t l p t l t t l t s p t t s t l t t s where p s is the solid precipitation p is the daily total precipitation t is the daily average air temperature and t l and t s represent the temperature thresholds for rainfall and snowfall respectively the two temperature thresholds were calibrated using the snowmelt model introduced in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 snowmelt simulation and its evaluation to simulate snowmelt in the ujsb a distributed temperature index snowmelt model based on the degree day factor was employed in this study hock 2003 chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 based on the relationship between snow melting and air temperature degree day models have been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for snowmelt modeling and perform better than energy balance models at a basin scale hock 2003 this snowmelt model used in this study adopted a distributed method for snowmelt calculation to account for spatial variability as described in the following equation 2 sm t min sm t mlt swe t where sm t is the snowmelt in a grid at t th time period this value would not be greater than swe t which is the swe in the grid at t th time period sm t mlt is the potential snowmelt in the grid at t th time period which is calculated as 3 sm t mlt d mlt t t t mlt δ t where d mlt is the degree day factor t t is the daily average air temperature t mlt is the threshold temperature for snow melting and δ t is the calculation time step t t was derived from the corrected era5 land reanalysis dataset see section 3 1 2 and δ t was set equal to 1 in this study d mlt varies daily and can be calculated according to a sinusoidal equation fontaine et al 2002 as shown in the following equation 4 d mlt d mlt 6 d mlt 12 2 d mlt 6 d mlt 12 2 sin 2 π 365 doy 81 where d mlt 6 is the maximum degree day factor on june 21st the summer solstice d mlt 12 is the minimum degree day factor on december 21st the winter solstice and doy is the day of year swe t is updated based on the law of mass conservation as follows 5 swe t swe t sm t p s t rs where p s t is the solid precipitation at t th time period which was acquired using the rain and snow separation method introduced in section 3 2 1 the rs parameter represents the ratio of remaining snow after snow sublimation in this study we used the remotely sensed snow cover area sca this was derived from the daily cloud free snow cover product introduced in section 3 1 1 and used as a reference to calibrate the snowmelt model accordingly the simulated swe should be converted into sca using a parameter swe 2 sca i e 6 sca 1 swe swe 2 sca 0 swe swe 2 sca if the swe value in a grid is greater than swe 2 sca this grid is regarded as snow covered and vice versa finally the parameters for the model table 1 were calibrated by comparing the simulated and remotely sensed sca in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse pearson correlation coefficient cc and relative difference rd metrics were used to evaluate the snowmelt model s accuracy these values were calculated as follows 7 nse sca 1 i 1 n sca sml i sca rms i 2 i 1 n sca rms i sca rms 2 8 cc sca i 1 n sca rms i sca rms sca sml i sca sml i 1 n sca rms i sca rms 2 i 1 n sca sml i sca sml 2 9 rd sca i 1 n sca sml i i 1 n sca rms i i 1 n sca rms i where sca sml i and sca rms i are the sca of the ujsb at t th time period as simulated by the snowmelt model and as obtained from the remotely sensed sca product respectively as shown in fig 5 the simulated sca was equivalent in magnitude to the remotely sensed sca both exhibited consistent seasonal trends with cc values as high as 0 86 in addition the nse value between these parameters was 0 72 and the rd was 0 13 3 2 3 extract of snow metrics the snow cover percentage scp representing snow covered area as a percentage of the total area was calculated at a basin scale using the following equation 10 scp a s a 100 where a s is the snow covered area in the ujsb and a is the total area of the basin to estimate the antecedent snow accumulation before spring flooding the snow cover and swe products described in section 3 1 1 were combined to calculate the winter accumulated snow which was defined as the snow water volume swv as shown in fig 6 the pixel values in the snow cover product were first converted to values representing the snow covered area each pixel in the snow cover product was then multiplied by the corresponding swe value with the result corresponding to the swv pixel value accordingly the spatial resolution of the swv dataset was the same as that of the snow cover product 3 2 4 baseflow separation to obtain the baseflow of the ujsb the method first proposed by eckhardt 2005 was employed in this study this method is a digital filter method that estimates baseflow through signal analysis assuming that the baseflow is the low frequency part of the runoff eckhardt 2008 this approach achieves good performance in baseflow estimation and is independent of basin characteristics xie et al 2020 the equation for this method is as follows 11 b t 1 rbr max α b t 1 1 α rbr max y t 1 α rbr max where b t and y t are the baseflow and total runoff at t th time period respectively α is the recession constant rbr max denotes the maximum value of the ratio of baseflow to total runoff rbr and was determined using a backward filter method proposed by collischonn and fan 2013 12 b t 1 b t α b t y t as shown in eq 12 this method uses the recession constant to calculate r br max by conducting a backward iterative operation on the daily runoff 3 2 5 division of spring snowmelt runoff period the start date sdsr and end date edsr of spring snowmelt runoff period were defined according to change in rbr as the climate becomes warmer in spring accumulated snow begins to melt then the snowmelt runoff starts to generate and changed the rbr through the analysis of change in daily runoff and rbr during 2001 2020 we found that in march april when spring snowmelt runoff began to generate the rbr started to decrease while in april may when spring snowmelt runoff ended the rbr began to increase the first last and middle years of 2001 2020 were chosen as the examples to show the changes in daily runoff and rbr fig 7a d thus the date when the maxima of the rbr between march 1st and april 30th appeared was selected as sdsr and the date when the minima of the rbr between april 1st and may 31st occurred was determined as edsr 3 2 6 extreme spring flood events identification to estimate the spring flood frequency pearson type iii vogel and mcmartin 1991 was used to fit the distribution sequence of the highest discharge in spring at batang hydrological station during 2001 2020 pearson type iii is a probability distribution method which has been widely used for flood frequency analysis he et al 2021 this method has been found to perform well in many applications particularly for flood peak data liu et al 2020c in this study extreme spring flood events were defined according to the probability of the highest discharge in spring if the probability of the highest discharge in a spring is less than 20 then it is regarded as an extreme spring flood event 4 results 4 1 spring floods in the ujsb from 2001 to 2020 spring floods in the ujsb were characterized by multiple peaks fig 8 the highest spring flood discharge in the studied years occurred in late may in most of the studied years 70 only two of the years 2009 and 2019 having the highest spring flood discharge in late april fig 9b fig 7e illustrated the sdsr and edsr between 2001 and 2020 the sdsr was mostly in early march 55 of these years only 25 of these years started the spring snowmelt runoff period in april whereas the edsr was in may in 70 of these years 20 in early may 15 in mid may and 35 in late may the mean duration of the spring snowmelt runoff period was 53 5 days with the range from 25 to 86 days under the definition described in section 3 2 6 four extreme spring flood events in the year of 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 were identified during 2001 2020 fig 9a and b in the ujsb a detail analysis of the daily runoff processes in these four years was performed fig 10a d in 2012 the spring flood period started on april 30th ended on may 31st and lasted for around 32 days during which the runoff peak occurred on may 13rd and the highest flood discharge occurred on may 30th fig 10a generally the spring snowmelt runoff period began earlier than spring flood period during 2001 2020 for example it started on march 23rd in 2012 in 2013 the spring flood period began on may 13rd later than that in 2012 in the early period the runoff increased slowly whereas in the late spring runoff increased rapidly and peaked on may 23rd subsequently the runoff continued to increase and the highest spring flood discharge occurred on may 31st the whole spring flood period lasted for 18 days in 2019 the spring runoff increased dramatically from approximately april 15th peaking on april 29th with another increase of runoff in late may this spring flood period lasted for 47 days in total the spring snowmelt runoff period was as long as 84 days in 2020 the spring flood period started from around april 17th later than that in 2019 three flood peaks were recorded in the spring of 2020 which occurred on april 23rd may 8th and may 23rd the spring flood period ended at the end of may having lasted for around 45 days in these four studied years the maximum spring flood discharge in 2019 was the highest 1365 83 m3 s followed by 2012 1353 33 m3 s 2013 1281 67 m3 s and then 2020 1116 80 m3 s table 2 the flood duration showed a different trend with the longest duration in 2019 47 days followed by 2020 45 days 2012 32 days and 2013 18 days only 2019 had the maximum spring flood discharge occurring in late april the other three years all had the maximum discharges in late may 4 2 contributions of snowmelt and rainfall to spring floods snowmelt and rainfall are the main contributors to spring floods in high altitude basins to study the contributions of snowmelt and rainfall in spring flood generating process the daily runoff snowmelt rainfall and air temperature of the ujsb were analyzed for the spring periods of the four years fig 10 in 2012 before the first spring flood peak occurred snowmelt increased in response to the significantly increasing air temperature whereas no obvious increase of rainfall was identified before the occurrence of the first spring flood peak in order to further study the contribution of snowmelt and rainfall at different altitudes to the spring floods the total volume of snowmelt and rainfall at different elevation zones were calculated fig 11 it was clearly shown that the total volume of snowmelt was largest between 4453 and 4953 m a s l before early may of 2012 indicating snowmelt at 4453 4953 m a s l elevation zone of the ujsb made a major contribution to the generation of the first spring flood peak from mid may onwards an increase of rainfall between 3953 and 4953 m a s l fig 11b along with the snowmelt between 4453 and 5453 m a s l fig 11a resulted in the extreme spring flood event at late may it is worthy of note that a time lag existed between the snowmelt peak and flood peak fig 10 which was related to the time of concentration in large basin with multiple elevation zones jung et al 2017 in 2013 an obvious increase of snowmelt was observed from mid april fig 10b which mainly occurred at 4453 4953 m a s l elevation zone fig 11c meanwhile the rainfall increased significantly between 3953 and 4953 m a s l fig 11d as a result the snowmelt and rainfall combined to contribute to the first spring flood peak on may 23rd in late may rainfall between 3953 and 5453 m a s l resulted in the extreme spring flood event in the spring of 2019 rapid air temperature rises from mid april caused a clear increase in snowmelt fig 10c leading to the generation of the highest spring flood peak on april 29th spatially snow melting mainly occurred between 4453 and 4953 m a s l at this stage fig 11e from early may onward a significant increase of rainfall was observed between 3953 and 4953 m a s l which was the major contribution to the increase of runoff in mid and late may in 2020 the spring flood process was characterized by three continuous flood peaks from mid april fig 10d before the first flood peak appeared on april 23rd snowmelt between 4453 and 4953 m a s l increased dramatically in response to the rising air temperature from mid april fig 11g meanwhile rainfall increased obviously between 3953 and 4953 m a s l fig 11h subsequently increased snowmelt between 3953 and 4953 m a s l caused by the rising air temperature since late april along with increased rainfall at the elevation of 4453 4953 m led to the second flood peak on may 8th in mid to late may snow melting occurring between 4453 and 5453 m a s l and rainfall between 3453 and 4953 m a s l combined to contribute the flood events on may 23rd 5 discussions 5 1 uncertainty analysis overall the snowmelt model employed in this study performed well in terms of the general consistency between the simulated and remotely sensed sca cc 0 86 nse 0 72 rd 0 13 however some uncertainties still existed in this study it was noted that the simulated sca did not match the remotely sensed sca extremely well in peak values in some years the bias was probably attributed to uncertainties in meteorological forcing data especially the precipitation data although the air temperature and precipitation data were calibrated by the cmfd and validated by the station observations the limited number of meteorological stations due to the complexity of terrain would impose restrictions on the validation as in previous studies they found that bias in precipitation data may lead to significant uncertainty rather than parameter uncertainty in hydrological modeling sperna weiland et al 2015 which consequently led to the overall uncertainty in snowmelt simulation in addition the uncertainties in remotely sensed snow cover product can also introduce uncertainties in snowmelt simulation according to previous studies the overall accuracy of the remotely sensed snow cover product used in this study can reach 93 15 zhao et al 2022 so the uncertainty in the snow cover product is within 10 as mentioned in section 3 2 3 the calculation of swv was based on the remotely sensed snow cover product and snow water equivalent product thus the uncertainties in the two snow products can influence uncertainty in swv calculation validated by the weather station measurements the bias of the swe product was 0 65 cm and the correlation coefficient was 0 84 jiang et al 2022 although the inversion uncertainty in the swe product caused by the atmosphere was reduced by utilizing an atmospheric model and the uncertainty caused by forests was reduced by fitting the forest parameters the product still tended to underestimate swe for deep snow cover jiang et al 2022 which may lead to the underestimation of winter swv 5 2 drivers of spring floods previous studies have identified that winter snow cover can influence spring runoff through snow melting in spring meng et al 2016 li et al 2021 with sufficient snow accumulation in winter being a precondition for extreme spring flood events as shown in fig 12a the same trend directions were observed in both spring runoff and winter sca moreover a significant correlation was found between these two factors to further quantify winter snow accumulation winter swv was calculated from the snow cover product and snow water equivalent product as presented in fig 12c the winter mean swv in 2012 3 35 108 m3 2019 4 22 108 m3 and 2020 6 48 108 m3 were notably much larger than the winter average swv 2 25 108 m3 during 2001 2020 thus large swv in winter was a precondition for extreme spring flood events in the ujsb moreover spring rainfall can affect spring floods by changing flood volumes and spring air temperature also has an important impact on spring flood processes in addition to winter snow spring flood volume is also affected by antecedent soil moisture berghuijs et al 2016 collins 2019 wasko et al 2020 accordingly in this study a comparative analysis of soil moisture sm in winter was conducted for 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 the winter soil moisture in 2020 was found to be the lowest in the four studied years fig 12c this might account for the smaller spring flood volume in 2020 compared to 2012 and 2019 despite 2020 having larger winter swv and spring rainfall variation in snow cover rainfall and temperature are all driven by large scale atmospheric circulation such as the westerlies monsoon north atlantic oscillation and el niño southern oscillation birsan and dumitrescu 2014 ye and lau 2017 maclennan and lenaerts 2021 szyga pluta 2021 the ujsb located at the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau is affected by the westerlies during the winter and spring kang et al 2010 bao and you 2019 song et al 2021 thus spring floods in the ujsb are driven by the westerlies to some extent to explore the impact of the westerlies on spring floods in the ujsb the relationship between spring runoff and maximum scp and minimum scp in winter half year was investigated as shown in fig 12d the minimum scp of the winter half year typically occurred between late september and early october however the maximum scp dates of the winter half year varied dramatically notably in years with extreme spring floods the maximum scp occurred later and its magnitudes were larger compared with those from years with low spring runoff specifically in the winter half years of 2011 2012 2018 and 2019 the maximum scp appeared later than in most of the other years and its magnitude was also greater fig 12d resulting in extreme floods when triggered by rapidly increasing air temperature in the following springs however in the winter half years of 2002 and 2006 although maximum scp magnitudes were large the dates when they appeared were early fig 12d consequently they brought less runoff in the following spring periods fig 12a on this basis it was concluded that the maximum scp magnitude in winter half year and the date when it appears may both affect the intensity of floods during the following spring as snow cover is driven by large scale atmospheric circulation the dates when the maximum and minimum scps of the winter half year occur are linked to atmospheric circulation changes hence the characteristics of winter atmospheric circulation in the years with extreme spring floods 2011 2012 december 2011 january 2012 and february 2012 2012 2013 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 were compared with those with small spring floods i e 2002 2003 and 2006 2007 as shown in fig 13c the difference in winter mean 500hpa wind speed between the years with extreme spring floods and those with less spring runoff is shown by the west wind direction in the south of the tibetan plateau this finding demonstrates that the intensity of the westerlies was higher in the winters of the years with extreme spring floods in contrast to winters of the years with less spring runoff meridional perturbations in the 500 hpa airflow over mid to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere were stronger in the winters of the years with extreme spring floods fig 13a and b in addition the trough over mid to high latitude areas of the north atlantic appeared in a more easterly location and the trough over europe was deeper in the winters of the years during which extreme spring floods occurred the ridge over the urals also appeared in a more easterly location and its intensity was stronger consequently changes in the position and strength of the troughs and ridges caused a disturbance in the flow of the westerlies while the deeper trough over europe increased the strength of the westerlies the stronger westerlies in the winters of 2011 2012 2012 2013 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 resulted in larger scp and later maximum scp dates in the winter half year which in turn caused extreme spring floods in the coming spring the nao is the simultaneous strengthening or weakening of the iceland low and the azores high over the north atlantic hurrell et al 2001 li and zhang 2004 from a planetary scale circulation perspective the nao is a regional disturbance of the westerlies in the northern hemisphere that occurs over the atlantic frauenfeld 2005 the oscillation phase of the nao is closely related to the intensity of the westerlies diao et al 2007 woollings and blackburn 2012 thus strengthening of the nao would enhance the westerlies in the northern hemisphere given the impacts of the westerlies on snow cover change the nao s impact on variations in winter snow cover in the ujsb was explored in this paper as shown in fig 12b winter sca changes in the ujsb displayed similar characteristics to those of the nao from 2000 2001 to 2019 2020 both exhibited an increasing trend the intensity of the nao was stronger than the previous year in 11 of the studied years and the winter sca in the ujsb also increased in eight of these years similarly the intensity of the nao was weaker than the previous year in eight of the studied years and the winter sca in the ujsb also decreased in five of these years this demonstrates that a strong nao implying strong westerlies would result in a favorable atmospheric circulation pattern for snow accumulation in the ujsb whereas a weak nao would produce a pattern that is not conducive to snow accumulation as discussed above abundant winter snow accumulation is a precondition for subsequent extreme spring flood events 5 3 key regions dominating spring floods as discussed in section 4 2 spring floods in the ujsb were found to be largely influenced by snow melting heterogeneous distributions of antecedent snow accumulation before spring floods and spatiotemporal variations in spring air temperature both determine regional flooding variations qi et al 2021 to identify the key regions contributing to spring floods in the ujsb changes in the swv and isotherm in 2019 were used as an example for analysis as shown in fig 14 in the early part of the spring flood season march 8th to march 16th which was also the first period of decreasing swv recorded in spring the threshold snow melting temperature isotherm 4 7 moved from the south of the batang zhimenda sub basin to the middle corresponding to decrease in swv in the south of the ujsb during this period about 7 69 108 m3 swv melted out in response to the rapidly increasing air temperature fig 14c a concurrent marked decrease in swv was identified in the chumaerhe tongtianhe tuotuohe and dangqu sub basins fig 14a and e which may have been caused by snow sublimation notably a period of swv increase occurred from march 16th onwards this period lasted until april 5th during which time the swv increased by around 1 17 109 m3 due to the snowfall events fig 14c from april 5th to april 29th the air temperature rose rapidly fig 14c consequently the swv decreased significantly fig 14c while the flood flow increased dramatically resulting the extreme spring flood event on april 29th nearly 1 32 109 m3 of swv melted out during this period at the same time the isotherm of 4 7 moved from the south of batang zhimenda sub basin to the northern edge of the ujsb almost consistent with the recorded spatial variations in the swv fig 14b and f in the late stage of the spring flood season april 29th may 29th during which approximately 6 78 107 m3 swv melted out and only 1 28 107 m3 remained fig 14c snow melting mainly occurred in the northwest of batang zhimenda sub basin and some areas in the southeast of the tongtianhe sub basin and the southwestern edge of the dangqu sub basin fig 14d and f overall based on this analysis we conclude that in the early part of spring flood season the regions dominating flooding were mainly concentrated around the southern and middle parts of the batang zhimenda sub basin where the altitudes were relatively low and swv was small subsequently snowfall events occurring in the basin increased snow accumulation in the subsequent rapidly rising stage of the spring floods the predominant regions determining flood flow were mostly those in the upper and middle reaches of the ujsb especially in the tongtianhe sub basin and the northern parts of the batang zhimenda sub basin with high altitudes and large swv in the late stages of spring flood season when rainfall became the main contributor to flooding the snow in much of the study area had melted snow remained only in the northwestern area of the batang zhimenda sub basin and in some areas in the southeast of the tongtianhe sub basin and the southwestern edge of the dangqu sub basin which had a limited effect on flooding 6 conclusions understanding spring flood variability and their major influential factors under changing climates is crucial to improving water management agricultural irrigation reservoir operation and flood prevention in this study we have investigated the characteristics of spring floods in the ujsb the impacts of snowmelt and rainfall on spring floods were quantified by using a distributed temperature index snowmelt model the main findings are as follows 1 during 2001 2020 the spring floods in the ujsb were characterized by more than one peak and the highest discharge in spring was found to occur in late may in most of these years extreme spring flood events occurred in 2012 2013 2019 and 2020 with the highest spring flood discharge 1365 83 m3 s and longest flood duration 47 days recorded in 2019 generally the spring snowmelt runoff period began earlier than spring flood period during 2001 2020 2 it was found that in 2019 the extreme spring flood event in late april was mainly contributed by the snowmelt approximately between 4500 and 5000 m a s l whereas in 2012 and 2020 snowmelt between 4500 and 5500 m a s l and rainfall below 5000 m a s l combined to contribute to the extreme spring flood events in late may in 2013 although snowmelt between 4500 and 5500 m a s l made a contribution to the first spring flood peak the flood event at the end of may was primarily contributed by rainfall between 4000 and 5500 m a s l 3 the large winter swv values were preconditions for the subsequent extreme spring flood events antecedent soil moisture was also one of the factors with an impact on spring floods the smaller winter soil moisture recorded in 2020 may be the cause for the smaller spring flood volume compared with those in 2012 and 2019 although it had larger winter swv and spring rainfall weather pattern analysis showed that stronger westerlies in winter would result in larger maximum scp magnitudes in the winter half year later appearance dates and more abundant winter snowfall which can cause the extreme spring floods when triggered by rising air temperature in the coming spring 4 regional differences in antecedent snow accumulation and spring snow melting determined the key regions dominating spring floods based on spatiotemporal variations in spring swv and the threshold snow melting temperature isotherm it was found that the key regions contributing to spring floods were concentrated around the tongtianhe sub basin and the northern parts of batang zhimenda sub basin where the swv was large the findings in this study are valuable for management of hydropower dispatching at the low reaches of the jinsha river despite the spring floods generation processes have been caught and analyzed the scheme in the study is highly relied on discharge observation which is unavailable at most situations therefore a more completed method that is less dependent on observation
