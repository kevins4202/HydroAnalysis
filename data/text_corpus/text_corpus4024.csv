20120,globally increasing intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events demand reliable early warning systems despite significant improvements in the skills of weather models the state of art extreme rainfall forecasts at a sufficient lead time still suffer from high biases high uncertainties low hit rates and high false alarms bias correction methods often improve the performances of the models but still the skills remain moderate here we propose a new methodology to forecast extreme rainfall events in terms of hazard instead of rainfall amount at a weather scale we define hazard as the probability of occurrence of an extreme rainfall event given a forecasted rainfall for a day with sufficient lead time the conditional probability is obtained from the past observed data and the hindcast the method is applied to india with observations from the india meteorological department imd and hindcasts from the global ensemble forecast system gefs reforecast version 2 for 1985 2015 extreme days at a grid level are defined as the days with observed rainfall exceeding the 95th percentile accordingly we calculate the hazard for all the lead days till 15 days for most of the extremes in each grid the model can predict an extreme showing a high hazard value greater than 0 6 from lead day 7 this high hit rate may give the stakeholders adequate time to plan mitigation strategies comparing the proposed method with traditional methods we find a significant improvement in terms of hit rate and the uncertainty across the ensembles keywords extreme rainfall hazard probabilistic forecast weather forecast 1 introduction extreme rainfall often results in disasters like landslides and floods which lead to the death of thousands of people and affect billions every year 12 disaster management planning and preparedness based on good forecasts well in advance are crucial to minimizing the losses 16 however the forecasts of these rainfall events are generally associated with large uncertainties because of the complexity of the atmospheric system 7 due to anthropogenic activities in the past decade extreme rainfall events have shown significant intensification with an increase in frequency while the total rainfall has shown a decreasing trend in the tropics 14 31 with the current and projected increasing trend of these extremes in the indian subcontinent 2 9 18 28 30 it is crucial to have an efficient and reliable early warning system so that losses can be minimized even with the recent advancement in weather and medium range rainfall forecasting state of the art models both statistical and dynamical struggle to predict extreme events accurately in terms of magnitude location and time of the event efficiently india due to its geographical location and socio economic conditions is very vulnerable to these extreme events for better mitigation planning accurate and timely forecast of these extremes are very important forecasting can be broadly classified into two categories namely deterministic and probabilistic deterministic forecasts give a single estimate of occurrence and or magnitude 35 whereas the probabilistic forecasts provide the probability of occurrence and or assigns a probability to each forecasted magnitude of an event with more ensemble members the probabilistic forecast based on ensemble techniques is more useful for extreme event forecasting 4 15 34 since uncertainty information plays an important role in mitigation planning forecast value with an associated probability is generally preferred by the end users 29 the probabilistic forecasts are more scientifically reliable enable risk based warnings and rational decision making 17 despite the wide implementation of probabilistic prediction systems for rainfall forecasting an improved approach is still required to improve extreme rainfall forecasts and early flood warning generation 3 6 20 some studies have applied probabilistic methods for predicting specific events at specific locations 11 33 however there remains the need for a more generic method which can identify extreme events efficiently well in advance here we have proposed a methodology to generate probabilistic forecasts for extreme events using the past forecast hindcast data from a model and the observed rainfall we define hazard at a weather scale defined as the probability of extreme given a forecast such a probabilistic hazard value can also be generated with a single ensemble and we also compute the uncertainty in hazard across multiple ensembles the methodology is applied to entire india 7 5 n to 37 5 n and 67 5 e to 97 5 e to evaluate its efficiency in predicting extreme events 2 data and study area in order to evaluate the skill of the existing and proposed extremes forecast technique we have used the ensemble rainfall hindcasts from global ensemble forecast system gefs reforecast version 2 the data considered is at a spatial resolution of 1 1 and 6 hourly temporal resolution for a period 1985 2015 is used 10 the reforecast data is the forecast done for a past period hindcast using the same model configuration that is now being used for real time forecasting an 11 member ensemble system is used to generate the dataset at 3 hourly time step up to 8 days lead time at a spatial resolution t254 50 km the same model for lead days 9 16 is at 6 hourly time scale with a spatial resolution of t190 50 km at 42 vertical levels the total period of hindcast is from1st december 1984 00 utc to the present day the 6 hourly data obtained is converted into daily accumulated and used observational rainfall dataset is obtained from india meteorological department imd for the same duration as the hindcast data set 1985 2015 the daily gridded rainfall data is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 for a period of 1901 2015 22 the dataset is generated using an inverse distance weighing scheme using the observational dataset from 6995 stations at various locations to match the spatial resolution of the used hindcast dataset this dataset is re gridded to a spatial resolution of 1 1 both these datasets for the whole indian landmass i e 7 5 0n to 37 5 0n and 67 5 0 e to 97 5 0 e are considered in the present analysis 3 methodology 3 1 hazard traditionally hazard in general refers to the probability of occurrence of any event ipcc 2012 13 defines hazard as the potential occurrence of a natural or human induced physical event that may cause loss of life injury or other health impacts as well as damage and loss to property infrastructure livelihoods service provision and environmental resources in simpler terms the likelihood of an extreme event is termed as the hazard associated with the event the concept was used at climate scale and previous studies have calculated hazard based on climatological rainfall data tripathy et al 2020 26 have proposed a methodology to consider hazard at a weather scale for forecasting purposes in a recent study the approach takes care of both the current forecast and the model efficiency hazard for any event was defined as the probability of occurrence of an extreme given a forecast at a location for example for a grid hazard h for a 95th percentile event is given as 1 h p o o 95 f f where o observed rainfall o 95 95th percentile of rainfall observations f forecasted rainfall f rainfall value forecasted for the event following the methodology proposed by tripathy et al 2020 26 gumbel copula was used to generate a bivariate distribution of the observed and forecasted rainfall the conditional probability was calculated using the copula based bivariate distribution to fit a copula we have first fitted the marginal distributions to the observed and forecasted rainfall 4 8 to get the probability mass function of both the non zero and zero rainfall bernoulli trials were used a gamma distribution was used for the non zero rainfall and the cdf of the variables x is given by 2 f x x p 1 p g x x x 0 p x 0 where p probability of getting zero rainfall n 1 n n total no of days n 1 no of zero rainfall days g x x cdf of nonzero rainfall obtained by fitting a gamma distribution x can be either observed o or forecasted f rainfall the model forecasts are often associated with large spatial biases a 3 3 box containing 9 grids around each grid is considered to address the spatial bias with the grid of interest at the centre for the grid of interest for a specific day the maximum rainfall forecasted at these 9 grids is considered as the rainfall forecasted favre et al 2004 5 suggested that the choice of copula plays an important role in fitting a copula based on akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic scores and upper tail coefficient values the gumbel copula was selected for study to fit the copula to the cdf of o and f we have considered two uniformly distributed random variables u f o o and v f f f with values u and v respectively a single parametric bivariate copula is given by 8 21 36 3 c θ u v 1 u v where c θ single parametric copula with parameter θ a convex decreasing function the conditional probability is generated using equation 1 after fitting the best copula to the rainfall time series 3 2 hit rate and false alarm to evaluate both the traditional and proposed methodology of the extreme event forecasting hit rate and false alarms were calculated by definition the hit rate is the indicator of how efficiently the model predicts an extreme the false alarm denotes the number of times the model forecasts an extreme on a non extreme day mathematically hit rate and false alarm are given as 19 24 4 hitrate f o r e c a s t e x t r e m e observation e x t r e m e o b s e r v a t i o n e x t r e m e s 5 falsealarm f o r e c a s t e x t r e m e observation e x t r e m e o b s e r v a t i o n 3 3 relative uncertainty range to quantify the uncertainty across the ensembles we introduce a term relative uncertainty range for both forecasted rainfall and hazard values the relative uncertainty range is calculated at different lead days uncertainty in the forecasted rainfall for an extreme event across the ensembles at any grid k is given as 6 uncertainty k mean j max i f ij min i f ij mean i f ij 100 f ij forecasted rainfall by ensemble i for event j similarly uncertainty between the ensembles in terms of the hazard at any grid k is given as 7 uncertainty k mean j max i h ij min i h ij mean i h ij 100 h i j forecasted hazard by ensemble i for event j 4 results and discussion traditionally extreme rainfall early warnings are generated based on the exceedances of rainfall above a threshold extreme rainfall forecasts are often associated with substantial spatio temporal biases very high false alarms and very low hit rate making the forecasts unreliable here we have defined extreme for each grid as the 95th percentile of observed rainfall o95 i e we consider a forecast as a hit when the forecasted rainfall value is above o95 fig 1 to calculate the hit rate we have used the mean forecast value of all the 11 ensembles grid wise extremes are identified and the hit rates are computed using equation 4 fig 1 shows that the hit rates till lead day 3 in most parts of india are below 0 1 such a low hit rate value makes the forecast significantly less reliable for extreme events several studies have shown that bias correction often improves forecasting skills 1 27 32 34 to eliminate the impacts of model bias we have set the 95th percentile of the forecast f95 as the threshold for defining a forecasted extreme the forecast is said to be a hit if it is above f95 value for a given day when an observation is above o95 fig 2 shows the hit rate calculated for all the grids over india at lead days 1 3 5 and 7 though there are improvements in the forecasting compared to the previous case the value does not exceed 0 2 until lead day 3 these plots state that bias correction may not always help to improve the forecast we have computed the hazard values at individual grids when the observed rainfall was greater than o95 and have presented the composite hazard for all the extreme days rainfall o95 in fig 3 at lead days 1 3 5 and 7 we followed the classification done in our pervious study 26 where hazard between 0 6 and 0 8 is termed as high hazard and values above 0 8 as very high hazard from lead day 5 most parts of india shows a mean hazard value above 0 6 for extreme days at some of the grids the values go above 0 6 starting from lead day 7 and above 0 7 from lead day 5 hence using the concept of hazard using conditional distribution and extreme events could be identified seven days in advance with high hazard values predicted for most of the events the hazard values generated for each event and each grid with this method can overcome the inability of the weather model to predict the magnitude of an extreme rainfall correctly all the 11 ensembles in gefs are generated by perturbing the initial conditions the uncertainty across all the ensembles are quantified with relative uncertainty range equation 6 the daily accumulated rainfall forecasted for extreme days display very high uncertainty across all the ensembles fig 4 the relative uncertainty range goes up to 500 on lead day 5 and more than 300 on lead day 3 in most parts of india even at lead day 1 the uncertainty is more than 100 at most of the grids because of this high uncertainty it is not possible to directly use anyone of the ensembles to make the forecasts fig 5 on the other hand this uncertainty between the ensembles has been reduced significantly when we have considered hazard instead of the corresponding forecasted rainfall except for a very few regions in india the relative uncertainty range at lead day 7 are below 25 these values further reduce with a reduction in lead days thus with any of the available ensembles the extreme event can be forecasted well in advance this is probably one of the most significant advantages of using the concept of hazard at a weather scale hence we can generate reliable forecasts using a single ensemble which obviates the need for multiple ensembles which are computationally expensive after generating hazard values a threshold is to be set for identifying an extreme event the threshold should be optimised so that the hit rate will be maximized and the false alarm will be minimized as per the classification provided in tripathy et al 26 whenever the hazard value goes above 0 6 the hazard value is classified as high hazard we have kept the same threshold of 0 6 for defining extremes and calculated the hit rate using equation 4 fig 6 a1 d1 from lead day 5 at most of the grids in india 100 of the extremes could be forecasted at lead day 7 at many parts in the country the hit rates are 1 this suggests that all the extremes can be forecasted at those grids to understand the sensitivity of the model performance to the threshold values of hazard we have performed the same analysis by setting the threshold as 0 7 fig 6 a2 d2 the western ghats region and the northern india regions show 100 hit rate from lead day 5 the eastern and central regions show a lower hit rate this is in agreement with fig 3 where it can be seen that the mean hazard value in those areas are also low and are in the range of 0 55 0 6 till lead day 7 with the decrease in the threshold value the false alarm also increases with the increase in hit rates to understand the trade off between hit rate and false alarm values we have considered 6 grids randomly from different parts of india fig 7 a in each grid the extreme days were identified and for those days the hit rate and the false alarm values are calculated using equations 4 and 5 respectively by setting the threshold at 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 fig 7 b1 b6 for almost all the 6 grids the hit rate is nearly 100 from lead day 7 at a threshold of 0 5 with the increase in the threshold value the hit rates and the false alarms decrease for grids 4 and 5 the hit rates are comparatively lower at higher thresholds this performance may be due to the poor model skill in these parts also seen in figs 3 and 6 selection of threshold specific to grid point and lead days will further improve the overall model performance in identifying an event with adequate lead time the model efficiently identifies most of the extremes and shows a high hazard as per our classification it is noteworthy that the selection of threshold depends on the requirement of the end users and their mitigation approach even if the false alarm is high in a conservative approach we are not missing out on any events reducing enormous loss of lives and property weather forecasts will have a future extreme event signature irrespective of being local or large scale such a signature gets reflected in the conditional probability defined as hazard we may not find a localized hazard value using the proposed approach but overall a high hazard value over the region can be observed as we have applied the model at a spatial resolution of 10 the differences in rainfall at locations within a city cannot be detected this is also impossible to forecast even with the existing forecast system at even 12 km resolution unless the model has a coupled urban canopy model 23 we have tested our approach with two events extreme rainfall in uttarakhand during 15 18 june 2013 and in mumbai on 26th july 2005 supplementary figs s1 and s2 we find a good model performance for both the cases with high hazard values over the grid to which the regions belong even at more than 10 days lead time 5 conclusion significant advances in weather modeling have been made in recent years however even the latest methods lack efficiency in forecasting derived parameters such as rainfall the effectiveness of models reduces for extremes due to the complex atmospheric process involved in forming such events we have experienced a colossal loss of life and property due to the failure of the state of art early warning generation systems in various instances to perform mitigation and evacuation planning in advance precise and low error prediction of extreme events with ample lead time is essential we have proposed a methodology to compute hazard based on the forecasted rainfall value hindcast data from the same model to predict extremes we summarize our contributions here i conventional approaches of extreme forecasts have a low hit rate and high false alarm associated with them we find that the hit rate is low for india with values below 0 1 for most parts of india at lead day 3 even on lead day 1 the hit rate is below 0 25 ii to accommodate the model bias we defined a forecast as a hit when the forecasted rainfall for an extreme is above the 95th percentile of forecast value f95 on a specific lead day in this case the model performance did not improve significantly and up to lead day 3 the hit rate remains below 0 1 iii we have proposed a methodology to forecast extreme in terms of hazard which is defined as the probability of observing an extreme given a forecast value instead of using the rainfall amount this method uses a probability value that includes the model s past performance end users especially the policymakers can use this hazard information for needful measures iv by setting the threshold of hazard at 0 6 we were able to identify most of the extremes at most of the grids this high hit rate decreases with the increase in the threshold value of hazard v we have calculated the hit rates and false alarms using the thresholds 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 for a few of the selected grids as anticipated for a lower threshold both hit rate and false alarm show a high value which decreases with an increase in the threshold vi the uncertainty across the 11 ensembles when forecasted rainfall was used conventional range up to 500 even at a lead day 5 in the proposed approach the uncertainty range across the ensembles is reduced to less than 25 in most of the grids at lead day 7 the lower relative uncertainty range indicates that individual ensembles can also be used in identifying extremes vii stakeholders and policymakers can decide the threshold to identify an extreme based on their requirement and region of interest for further improvement in the hit rates and false alarms grid and lead day specific thresholds can be decided by optimizing the hit rate and false alarm viii a typical forecasted rainfall map highlights the possible regions that may receive extreme rainfall however such an outcome has significant uncertainty due to low probability of detection and high false alarm conventional bias correction improves the same but does not estimate the probability of extremes given such a forecast a policy maker or a disaster mitigation agency will be interested in getting a forecast that will have minimum uncertainty and at the same time addresses the model deficiencies the conditional probability of extreme rainfall given a forecast learns from the hindcasts about the model performance hence it considers forecasted rainfall and past performances together in a single framework value the hazard value can also be easily converted to risk at the weather scale with vulnerability information 26 a hazard map or risk map given a forecast at a district or granular level helps disaster mitigation agencies set priorities for the evacuation operation when needed for a large region 25 most importantly the proposed hazard values have lower uncertainty and give the administration more confidence to use them credit authorship contribution statement shrabani sailaja

for the whole indian landmass i e 7 5 0n to 37 5 0n and 67 5 0 e to 97 5 0 e are considered in the present analysis 3 methodology 3 1 hazard traditionally hazard in general refers to the probability of occurrence of any event ipcc 2012 13 defines hazard as the potential occurrence of a natural or human induced physical event that may cause loss of life injury or other health impacts as well as

weather scale for forecasting purposes in a recent study the approach takes care of both the current forecast and the model efficiency hazard for any event was defined as the probability of occurrence of an extreme given a forecast at a location for example for a grid hazard h for a 95th percentile event is given as 1 h p o o 95 f f where o observed rainfall o 95 95th percentile of rainfall observations f forecasted rainfall f rainfall value forecasted for the event following the methodology proposed by tripathy et al 2020 26 gumbel copula was used to generate a bivariate distribution of the observed and forecasted rainfall the conditional probability was calculated using the copula based bivariate distribution to fit a copula we have first fitted the marginal distributions to the

results and discussion traditionally extreme rainfall early warnings are generated based on the exceedances of rainfall above a threshold extreme rainfall forecasts are often associated with substantial spatio temporal biases very high false alarms and very low hit rate making the forecasts unreliable here we have defined extreme for each grid as the 95th percentile of observed rainfall o95 i e we consider a forecast as a hit when the forecasted rainfall value is above o95 fig 1 to calculate the hit rate we have used the mean forecast value of all the 11 ensembles grid wise extremes are identified and the hit rates are computed using equation 4 fig 1 shows that the hit rates till lead day 3 in most parts of india are below 0 1 such a low hit rate value makes the forecast significantly less reliable for extreme events several studies have shown that bias correction often improves forecasting skills 1 27 32 34 to eliminate the impacts of model bias we have set the 95th percentile of the forecast f95 as the threshold for defining a forecasted extreme the forecast is said to be a hit if it is above f95 value for a given day when an observation is above o95 fig 2 shows the hit rate calculated for all the grids over india at lead days 1 3 5 and 7 though there are improvements in the forecasting compared to the previous case the value does not exceed 0 2 until lead day 3 these plots state that bias correction may not always help to improve the forecast we have computed the hazard values at individual grids when the observed rainfall was greater than o95 and have presented the composite hazard for all the extreme days rainfall o95 in fig 3 at lead days 1 3 5 and 7 we followed the classification done in our pervious study 26 where hazard between 0 6 and 0 8 is termed as high hazard and values above 0 8 as very high hazard from lead day 5 most parts of india shows a mean hazard value above 0 6 for extreme days at some of the grids the values go above 0 6 starting from lead day 7 and above 0 7 from lead day 5 hence using the concept of hazard using conditional distribution and extreme events could be identified seven days in advance with high hazard values predicted for most of the events the hazard values generated for each event and each grid with this method can overcome the inability of the weather model to predict the magnitude of an extreme rainfall correctly all the 11 ensembles in gefs are generated by perturbing the initial conditions the uncertainty across all the ensembles are quantified with relative uncertainty range equation 6 the daily accumulated rainfall forecasted for extreme days display very high uncertainty across all the ensembles fig 4 the relative uncertainty range goes up to 500 on lead day 5 and more than 300 on lead day 3 in most parts of india even at lead day 1 the uncertainty is more than 100 at most of the grids because of this high uncertainty it is not possible to directly use anyone of the ensembles to make the forecasts fig 5 on the other hand this uncertainty between the ensembles has been reduced significantly when we have considered hazard instead of the corresponding forecasted rainfall except for a very few regions in india the relative uncertainty range at lead day 7 are below 25 these values further reduce with a reduction in lead days thus with any of the available ensembles the extreme event can be forecasted well in advance this is probably one of the most significant advantages of using the concept of hazard at a weather scale hence we can generate reliable forecasts using a single ensemble which obviates the need for multiple ensembles which are computationally expensive after generating hazard values a threshold is to be set for identifying an extreme event the threshold should be optimised so that the hit rate will be maximized and the false alarm will be minimized as per the classification provided in tripathy et al 26 whenever the hazard value goes above 0 6 the hazard value is classified as high hazard we have kept the same threshold of 0 6 for defining extremes and calculated the hit rate using equation 4 fig 6 a1 d1 from lead day 5 at most of the grids in india 100 of the extremes could be forecasted at lead day 7 at many parts in the country the hit rates are 1 this suggests that all the extremes can be forecasted at those grids to understand the sensitivity of the model performance to the threshold values of hazard we have performed the same analysis by setting the threshold as 0 7 fig 6 a2 d2 the western ghats region and the northern india regions show 100 hit rate from lead day 5 the eastern and central regions show a lower hit rate this is in agreement with fig 3 where it can be seen that the mean hazard value in those areas are also low and are in the range of 0 55 0 6 till lead day 7 with the decrease in the threshold value the false alarm also increases with the increase in hit rates to understand the trade off between hit rate and false alarm values we have considered 6 grids randomly from different parts of india fig 7 a in each grid the extreme days were identified and for those days the hit rate and the false alarm values are calculated using equations 4 and 5 respectively by setting the threshold at 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 fig 7 b1 b6 for almost all the 6 grids the hit rate is nearly 100 from lead day 7 at a threshold of 0 5 with the increase in the threshold value the hit rates and the false alarms decrease for grids 4 and 5 the hit rates are comparatively lower at higher thresholds this performance may be due to the poor model skill in these parts also seen in figs 3 and 6 selection of threshold specific to grid point and lead days will further improve the overall model performance in identifying an event with adequate lead time the model efficiently identifies most of the extremes and shows a high hazard as per our classification it is noteworthy that the selection of threshold depends on the requirement of the end users and their mitigation approach even if the false alarm is high in a conservative approach we are not missing out on any events reducing enormous loss of lives and property weather forecasts will have a future extreme event signature irrespective of being local or large scale such a signature gets reflected in the conditional probability defined as hazard we may not find a localized hazard value using the proposed approach but overall a high hazard value over the region can be observed as we have applied the model at a spatial resolution of 10 the differences in rainfall at locations within a city cannot be detected this is also impossible to forecast even with the existing forecast system at even 12 km resolution unless the model has a coupled urban canopy model 23 we have tested our approach with two events extreme rainfall in uttarakhand during 15 18 june 2013 and in mumbai on 26th july 2005 supplementary figs s1 and s2 we find a good model performance for both the cases with high hazard values over the grid to which the regions belong even at more than 10 days lead time 5 conclusion significant advances in weather modeling have been made in recent years however even the latest methods lack efficiency in forecasting derived parameters such as rainfall the effectiveness of models reduces for extremes due to the complex atmospheric process involved in forming such events we have experienced a colossal loss of life and property due to the failure of the state of art early warning generation systems in various instances to perform mitigation and evacuation planning in advance precise and low error prediction of extreme events with ample lead time is essential we have proposed a methodology to compute hazard based on the forecasted rainfall value hindcast data from the same model to predict extremes we summarize our contributions here i conventional approaches of extreme forecasts have a low hit rate and high false alarm associated with them we find that the hit rate is low for india with values below 0 1 for most parts of india at lead day 3 even on lead day 1 the hit rate is below 0 25 ii to accommodate the model bias we defined a forecast as a hit when the forecasted rainfall for an extreme is above the 95th percentile of forecast value f95 on a specific lead day in this case the model performance did not improve significantly and up to lead day 3 the hit rate remains below 0 1 iii we have proposed a methodology to forecast extreme in terms of hazard which is defined as the probability of observing an extreme given a forecast value instead of using the rainfall amount this method uses a probability value that includes the model s past performance end users especially the policymakers can use this hazard information for needful measures iv by setting the threshold of hazard at 0 6 we were able to identify most of the extremes at most of the grids this high hit rate decreases with the increase in the threshold value of hazard v we have calculated the hit rates and false alarms using the thresholds 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 for a few of the selected grids as anticipated for a lower threshold both hit rate and false alarm show a high value which decreases with an increase in the threshold vi the uncertainty across the 11 ensembles when forecasted rainfall was used conventional range up to 500 even at a lead day 5 in the proposed approach the uncertainty range across the ensembles is reduced to less than 25 in most of the grids at lead day 7 the lower relative uncertainty range indicates that individual ensembles can also be used in identifying extremes vii stakeholders and policymakers can decide the threshold to identify an extreme based on their requirement and region of interest for further improvement in the hit rates and false alarms grid and lead day specific thresholds can be decided by optimizing the hit rate and false alarm viii a typical forecasted rainfall map highlights the possible regions that may receive extreme rainfall however such an outcome has significant uncertainty due to low probability of detection and high false alarm conventional bias correction improves the same but does not estimate the probability of extremes given such a forecast a policy maker or a disaster mitigation agency will be interested in getting a forecast that will have minimum uncertainty and at the same time addresses the model deficiencies the conditional probability of extreme rainfall given a forecast learns from the hindcasts about the model performance hence it considers forecasted rainfall and past performances together in a single framework value the hazard value can also be easily converted to risk at the weather scale with vulnerability information 26 a hazard map or risk map given a forecast at a district or granular level helps disaster mitigation agencies set priorities for the evacuation operation when needed for a large region 25 most importantly the proposed hazard values have lower uncertainty and give the administration more confidence to use them credit authorship contribution statement shrabani sailaja

access to basic drinking water services 1 however nearly 2 2 billion people still lack reliable access to safe water 2 this lack of access takes a toll every year nearly 485 000 people die due to diarrheal diseases 3 in india 73 million workdays are lost annually to water borne diseases which translates to a loss of 600 million usd 4 the world health organization develops guidelines for drinking water quality through a robust process accounting for multiple aspects of risk assessment for contaminants known to occur in drinking water these remain guidelines until a national government decides which guidelines apply to their specific conditions and writes them into law while the rigor of national drinking water standards can vary widely in their depth breadth testing and enforcement virtually all countries wield some level of control over the safety of drinking water for their populace hence there is a need to design water treatment systems appropriate to local conditions to produce safe drinking water of sufficient quantity and acceptable quality the goal then is to ensure that the treatment is robustly designed operated and monitored to ensure water safety for all regardless of socioeconomic status the traditional model of large expensive water infrastructure is increasingly being reconsidered particularly for providing sustainable water services to remote communities in developed and developing economies in a recent report card of water infrastructure in the united states the american society of civil engineers assigned a grade of d for the existing drinking water infrastructure one million miles of pipe with an estimated 240 000 water mains breaks per year resulting in 2 1 trillion gallons of treated water wastage the same report estimated that 1 trillion us is needed to expand and maintain these pipes over the next 25 years 5 in recent years decentralized safe water enterprises swes have tried to step into the gap between large scale government managed water utilities and the stand posts and wells in marginalized rural and peri urban communities swes encompass the complete value chain from water extraction to treatment and dispensing of affordably priced safe drinking water to underserved communities 6 the water treatment systems at the center of these swes need to be custom designed for the local conditions giving consideration to source water quality the capacity required and available resources different treatment systems have diverse capabilities and drawbacks and some may have an additional environmental burden acknowledging this fact it is still essential to treat water for drinking because safe water is a non negotiable right of all communities indeed water sits at the foundation of maslow s hierarchy of needs being among the most fundamental along with food warmth and rest 7 nevertheless it is good practice to build environmental considerations into the system at the design stage itself to the extent feasible rather than correcting for them later the authors have broad ranging experience in the management and oversight of a widely distributed network of swes the following sections describe the considerations applicable worldwide when designing treatment systems for swes 2 know the water to be treated since the advent of the covid 19 pandemic a ubiquitous cry heard the world over was of data data and more data recognizing that public health decisions are best made when sufficiently informed this is equally valid for water treatment systems before embarking upon system design designers need to arm themselves with source water quality tests to inform the design process however it is also a fact that source water quality may change due to seasonality pollution or changing water sources accommodating these variables into a system s design is challenging while also maintaining the economy of operations for sustainability these considerations are discussed in detail in the next sections many national water quality standards prescribe desirable as well as permissible concentrations of contaminants in drinking water 8 9 the authors recommend targeting the more rigorous desirable levels for treated water parameters instead of accepting the more flexible limits in order to safeguard the well being of all sections of the populace including the vulnerable the old the very young and the chronically ill or immunocompromised regardless of their ability to pay contaminants with acute immediate versus those with chronic long term health effects the public health community has for decades focused on the microbiological quality of drinking water notably because pathogens cause immediate adverse health impacts by precipitating diseases such as jaundice typhoid diarrhea etc however many chemical contaminants also present public health risks but symptoms generally manifest in the long term via chronic exposure for example in the relatively low concentrations typically found in contaminated groundwaters the effects of arsenic or fluoride toxicity manifest after several years as arsenicosis 10 or fluorosis 11 in the exposed population in the absence of water testing they may remain unsuspected because they do not cause acute toxicity at low concentrations and are imperceptible based on the taste and odour of the water with the technology available today and based on findings of the initial source water quality tests the design should appropriately treat the water for both kinds of contaminants for long term good health microbial contamination especially in surface water is prevalent due to contamination from run off with human animal fecal content and untreated wastewater discharge according to the world health organization globally at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with feces 12 therefore any surface water treatment system must have elaborate multistage microbial safety elements built into its design at a minimum surface water treatment plants should follow the 6 4 3 reduction guideline i e 6 lrv log reduction value for bacteria 4 lrv for viruses and 3 lrv for cysts tested using indicator species at prescribed challenge levels multistage microbiological safety of water is achievable through membrane filtration followed by primary disinfection and or secondary disinfection this is in addition to prefiltration stages such as sediment filter for removal of particulates and activated carbon for odour colour and organic contaminants endemic contaminants are groundwater contaminants particular to many geographies arsenic fluoride and heavy metals are common and local government monitoring data is valuable for mapping the endemicity of such contaminants one may consider addressing these contaminants in the regions where their endemicity is known even if initial testing does not indicate their presence such preemptive design consideration could help offset the effects of seasonal temporal or water depth variations in the source water alternatively the design may incorporate the scope to accommodate treatment capability for such a contaminant in the case that the presence is detected during routine water quality monitoring at a future time emerging trace and persistent contaminants are chemicals of anthropogenic origin that have found their way into water sources at trace levels these include pharmaceuticals including antibiotics personal care products pesticides and herbicides etc for many of these contaminants the quantitative risks to human health are unknown or under research 13 therefore such contaminants are neither regulated nor tested while designing a system a designer should assume the presence of such contaminants in their infinitesimally low concentrations and add polishing stages to address them contaminants such as pesticides radioactive elements volatile organics arsenic heavy metals such as lead cadmium mercury etc could have adverse health effects at extremely low parts per billion ppb concentrations poly and perfluoroalkyl substances or pfas sometimes known as forever chemicals owing to their persistence in the environment are dissolved contaminants that are regulated at even lower parts per trillion ppt concentrations 14 testing for many of these compounds is expensive and technically complex and requires sophisticated laboratory capability often out of reach for many communities hence controlling these contaminants is not done by testing and monitoring but instead by designing treatment to manage them microplastics are plastic fragments smaller than 5 mm 5000 µm in size whereas particles with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm are referred to as nano plastics 15 microplastics pollution in water from aging and abrading plastics already present in the environment is widespread and detected in piped and bottled water samples and even ground water samples 16 17 the world health organization recently called for more research about the potential human health impacts of microplastics in the environment particularly drinking water current research indicates that the human body may not absorb particles above 150 µm however absorption may be higher for smaller particles in the nano size range 18 although some conventional drinking water treatments can remove sub micron sized particles from the water the membrane filtration technologies ensure reliable removal of both micro and nano plastics it is therefore prudent to include such physical barriers in the treatment design biomagnification is the concentration of a chemical substance in organisms from water and food exposure at successively higher levels in the food chain substances that metabolize slowly or are difficult to excrete accumulate in animals and humans that consume the contaminated food or water resulting in increasing concentrations within their bodies rice is widely cultivated in west bengal india and bangladesh two regions that face high arsenic endemicity rice plants are known to accumulate arsenic in the grains much more efficiently than other staple cereals and the problem is exacerbated when arsenic contaminated groundwater is use to irrigate the crops 19 biomagnification impact in humans is also a result of diets rich in meat milk and milk based foods if milch cattle consume pesticide contaminated fodder the milk they produce may contain such contamination too 20 therefore to protect communities from the adverse health effects of biomagnification one needs to secure water safety for the entire food chain this concept underscores the need beyond water treatment design for a holistic approach to the way we live within our shared ecosystem variability in source water quality the source water quality varies with the change of seasons and over time groundwater can become more polluted as the water table declines due to overuse rainwater run offs often carry microbial contamination of anthropogenic and animal origin as well as fertilizer or pesticide residues and pollute aquifers by infiltration through damaged or inadequately protected wells surface water typically becomes more turbid during rains with so much variability a single sampling event cannot reveal all possible contaminants but is at best an indicator additionally knowing the mix of incoming raw water is essential in many households only one pipeline alternatingly supplies municipal water for potable use and groundwater for other applications if the feed water quality changes in characteristic so drastically the treatment will need to be robust or flexible enough to handle the variation of challenge contaminants residual disinfection residual disinfection plays a critical role in ensuring water security until consumption for decades public health engineers have relied heavily on introducing some free chlorine residual in the treated water for residual protection 1 1 in the presence of organic matter chlorine compounds may form hazardous byproducts to avoid this chlorination should only be done in clean treated water however consumers may dislike the taste or odor of chlorine and resist its presence in the water creating awareness about the critical role of chlorine residual in water safety and disease prevention can counter this mindset in communities alternatively water utilities could use chlorinated cyanurates with less perceptible sensory outcomes at our water stations in india safe water network trialed chlorine dosing of treated drinking water with sodium dichloroisocyanurate nadcc in place of sodium hypochlorite and discovered there is higher acceptability among consumers because of the low perceptibility taste and odour from nadcc compared to hypochlorite solution this has resulted in better dosing compliance by operators and has been especially important for residual water safety in the current covid 19 pandemic here it may be noted that the conventional methods of free chlorine measurement overestimate the free chlorine level in the case of chlorinated cyanurates dpd colorimetry and amperometric titrations effectively measure total chlorine therefore chlorine dosing calculations must be guided by this knowledge when targeting a minimum free chlorine level 21 3 technology specific considerations designing a drinking water system is challenging due to the diversity of competing technical and commercial demands selecting the right technology or combination of technologies for a given set of conditions will result in a reliable treatment process for this judgement borne out of experience and knowledge of available treatment options and their limitations is essential the best treatment design is a combination of art and science understanding the removal capability of each technology alone and in combination for physical chemical radiological microbiological and aesthetic contaminants primary treatment technologies include coagulation ceramic and polymeric membrane filtration viz reverse osmosis nano ultra and micro filtration ion exchange and emerging technologies like electrodialysis and capacitive deionization particle filtration activated carbon mixed media and a range of disinfection strategies such as chlorination ozone and uv irradiation are standard in polishing steps for targeting a desired level of protection the selection of technologies should be guided by the following considerations know the limits of the treatment system we must inform ourselves of the contaminant reduction capability of each component for instance it should be known that ultrafiltration uf ultraviolet light uv µm filters or slow sand filters will not eliminate dissolved contaminants ro membranes will but are vulnerable to fouling from dissolved iron and silica also ro membranes are easily damaged by chlorine in the feed water leading to lower salt rejection and poor quality product water therefore ro raw water feed should be adequately dechlorinated using an activated carbon prefilter viruses are too small 20 250 nm to be removed by conventional filtration technologies but chlorine disinfection can be effective for viruses and bacteria and many protozoa as well however chlorination is ineffectual against the cyst stage in protozoans life cycle for which nano or ultra filtration should be used for chemical disinfection the effectiveness depends on the concentration and contact time with the water other factors including temperature dissolved and suspended solids turbidity and ph also have an effect for uv disinfection the dosage is a function of the uv transmissivity in the reaction chamber duration of exposure water clarity and the lamp sleeves cleanness additional monitoring is required when the feed water is hard exposure to uv light generates heat leading to scale formation on the walls of the disinfection chamber diminishing uv transmissivity all these considerations and others will guide the selection of treatment components for effective purification of feed water the sequence of components in the treatment scheme determines efficacy for instance for effective disinfection the uv chamber must precede the chlorination stage as uv light is known to destroy chlorine in the water and in this configuration the residual disinfection will be reduced additionally uv irradiation done after chlorination may result in formation of disinfection by products from uv catalysed oxidation of chlorine to chlorites and chlorates 22 some special considerations need to be kept in mind when designing ion exchange systems for removal of endemic chemical contaminants resin regeneration is critically important for the reliable performance of the system in the removal of target contaminants the designer needs to ensure that either an automatic shutdown of the system or sounding of alarm occurs once the capacity of the media to remove the contaminant is exhausted also introduce rigorous operator training so the operator is cognizant of the dangers of operating the system after the resin is spent the resin could be adding the contaminant to the water instead of removing it awareness of competing ions in the source water is essential as they directly impact the media or resin s capacity to remove target contaminants the issue is magnified when the competing ions are present at much higher concentrations say parts per million than the target contaminant which may be present and harmful at very low parts per billion levels for example phosphate nitrate and sulphate ions compete with arsenate which is weakly ionic and not selectively adsorbed for resin adsorption sites 23 these competing ions would then exhaust the resin at a faster rate than anticipated from calculations therefore a thorough understanding of the source water chemistry is necessary for selecting the appropriate resin and introducing suitable pretreatment for removal of competing ions the danger of a treatment process adding contamination exists in technologies like electrocoagulation or ion exchange these technologies are positioned as alternatives to reverse osmosis for low tds feed water however electrocoagulation may add an unacceptable level of aluminum to the treated water if the designer uses aluminum as a sacrificial anode similarly the use of alum as a flocculant in municipal systems may lead to increased aluminum in the treated water above the prescribed limits unless careful dosing is maintained similarly ion exchange resins risk adding the very contaminants they are supposed to remove if used beyond the saturation point a physical barrier to stop contaminants is better than the hope for robust operation membranes and filters act as physical barriers to contaminants in some ways providing higher confidence in their effectiveness when their capacity for water filtration is exhausted they choke and will not yield contaminated water on the other hand technologies such as uv ion exchange resins or electrocoagulation require a higher degree of operational diligence and embedded fail safe controls such as automatic cut off or flow diversion when their capacity to treat water is diminished automation is essential in many applications for example ultrafiltration requires periodic backwashing to prevent fouling with the frequency depending upon the quality of feed water similarly auto power off is essential to protect systems against grid fluctuations lightning high temperatures etc designing for once in a lifetime risk allowance for contamination spike drinking water suppliers have enormous communal responsibility and often regulatory and legal obligations to protect public health through the reliable delivery of safe water to ensure reliability and system resilience design for the worst conditions even though such situations may arise only occasionally at the design stage factor in the attendant costs of building this capability if the costs appear high consider the damage to brand credibility and loss of goodwill for the entire chain of stakeholders in case of failure future proofing the design is possible by investing marginally more upfront rather than retrofitting a system later inevitably not all the elements in a system will work to design efficiencies therefore it is prudent to build a certain margin of safety to account for less than ideal component performance one can build in redundancy of critical components for water security designers often make claims for system capabilities as determined at beginning of life bol in practice however systems deteriorate over time hence consideration of end of life eol performance is essential for example in ultraviolet disinfection consider the lamp s end of life uv dosage rather than the bol dosage which could be twice the eol dose 4 operational considerations ease of operation and maintenance is integral to system design a well designed system would require minimal intervention by the operator on a day to day basis the design must permit easy access to all the components for repairs and servicing reliable high quality parts though initially expensive pay for themselves in savings through reduced downtime and maintenance requirements maintaining a local inventory of essential spares minimizes downtime due to procurement delays such measures build resilience while ensuring uninterrupted water supply in emergencies and crises as in the current covid 19 outbreak preventative maintenance can extend the useful life of components and is often underrated depth filters and sand filters require timely backwashing and changeovers to maintain their dirt holding capacity ultrafiltration membranes need backwashing on schedule to prevent biofouling while ro membranes need periodic clean in place cip clear instructions on chemical cleaning or replacement frequency will be part of a good preventative maintenance program operator training and diligence in routine preventative maintenance is a critical ingredient for reliable long term operation evaluate power supply options based on the availability of grid power hours of supply and quality many rural grid supplies do not have an adequate neutral phase increasing the risk of equipment damage and may require power conditioning equipment some treatment technologies are sensitive to disruptions in power and therefore need a backup power supply for systematic shutdown solar energy offers an alternative for powering off grid treatment systems however solar power is prone to the challenges of a theft of high value components b lithium batteries needing to be sent to service centers for maintenance which may involve complicated logistics and c inverter manufacturers often may not have the service capacity infrastructure spares and engineers to provide timely and affordable service at remote locations these challenges entail high costs and outages and in many remote rural installations currently solar power may not offer a dependable power solution although governments and private sector entities are working to build the infrastructure for large scale adoption of solar technology remote monitoring system rms helps virtual supervision of a spread out water supply infrastructure or cluster of water treatment systems it helps diagnose and troubleshoot maintenance needs using sensors and cloud based servers to track critical water quality tds ph chlorine residual or technical performance parameters such as flows pressures production volumes and sales etc such ability helps reduce costs with timely warnings for maintenance and spares requirements considering the physical space constraints for housing the water treatment system components both initially and for expansion is important a good design should be compact and yet provide easy access for serviceability and allow some scope for future expansion safeguard against vandalism theft and sabotage by securing the treated water tanks and other critical components under lock and key 5 water quality control the world health organization defines a water safety plan wsp as a comprehensive risk assessment and risk management approach for ensuring water safety that encompasses all the steps of water supply from catchment to consumer 24 it is easy to overlook a requirement while designing a system but maintaining a checklist ensures that due consideration is given to all critical design aspects the documentation of the treatment operations and control points are critical elements of a wsp keep the intent of a water safety plan in mind even at the design stage of water treatment selection in particular identify all the hazards and hazardous events that can affect the water safety from the source through treatment and distribution to the consumers handling assess the risk presented by each hazard consider if the controls in place for each significant hazard are adequate validate the effectiveness of these controls water quality control entails regular diligent in house monitoring while water quality assurance requires a neutral external evaluation of quality at some specified frequency periodically testing at an external nationally accredited laboratory must be done to validate the water quality available to the consumers making such results available for scrutiny onsite inspires consumer trust and eases regulatory oversight simultaneous testing of both raw and treated water helps monitor the functioning of the treatment systems testing of additional samples from stages along the treatment chain might also be necessary the seasonal variability may inform the frequency of testing of source water quality 6 environmental considerations responsible disposal of components such as spent filters and membranes plan for appropriate handling and responsible disposal of activated carbon lamps from uv systems exhausted ion exchange resins as well as waste from treatment operations such as sludge from electrocoagulation responsible disposal of reject water concentrate in ro brine from capacitive deionization or from regeneration of ion exchange resins must be done following the prescribed environmental norms based on the design technology and water chemistry there may be a three to five fold concentration of contaminants in the waste stream plan for its responsible disposal governments prescribe guidelines contaminant limits for the disposal of reject waters in ponds or rivers sewage lines discharge wells or into the sea these must be followed untreated effluent or reject water should never be let into unlined discharge wells as it could contaminate the groundwater coastal nations use multistage flash evaporation or reverse osmosis for seawater desalination the concentrate from desalination referred to as brine is continuously released back into the sea in order to minimize the impact of high salt concentrations and temperature on the coastal ecology the discharge is done at prescribed flow rates at a considerable distance from the shoreline which may be up to 22 km the territorial sea limits 7 financial considerations capital versus operational expenditure most at scale implementations have a significant capital outlay hence governments deploy open competitive bids to discover the lowest initial price inviting technically qualified bidders however subsequent high operating costs and lack of asset renewal funds result in failures some technologies have high initial capital but their longer performance life and lower operational and maintenance costs lead to a lower lifecycle cost 25 therefore weigh operating costs in addition to initial costs at the time of technology selection water pricing the fixing of water pricing should be done factoring in the consumers ability to pay but should be enough to sustain the local operating costs and discourage water wastage 25 8 macro considerations plan for the vagaries of weather a raised platform on which to install the treatment plant is a simple device to protect against seasonal flooding additional treated water storage ensures uninterrupted supply during raw water supply disruptions or power outages source protection is critical for water safety communities should ensure that water bodies used as drinking water source are designated separate from those for livestock use washing and bathing the effluent disposal site must be downstream from the community to prevent drinking water contamination 9 key messages to the designers fig 1 depicts the considerations that drive the sustainability of swes and the outcomes from delivering a reliable supply of safe drinking water to communities to summarize a designer may consider the following key points while designing drinking water treatment systems for the swes know the raw water quality and the available treatment options for an informed decision on treatment technology selection consider the variations in raw water quality profile due to changing seasonality or ingress of contaminants in the supply pipelines prioritize design based on the predominant challenge dissolved chemical contaminants or the potential of microbiological contamination with reasonable protections against both kinds of contaminants based on risk assessment secure the availability of essential resources that are key to sustainable operations source water supply power space building infrastructure chemicals and consumables and competent manpower eliminate or minimize the human factor with automated alarms controls and monitoring build redundancy into the treatment design by introducing multiple stages to bridge the failure of any one critical component invest in high quality components that pay for themselves over an operational lifetime through savings in repair and replacement costs especially in a remote distributed

the old the very young and the chronically ill or immunocompromised regardless of their ability to pay contaminants with acute immediate versus those with chronic long term health effects the public health community has for decades focused on the microbiological quality of drinking water notably because pathogens cause immediate adverse health impacts by precipitating diseases such as jaundice typhoid diarrhea etc however many chemical contaminants also present public health risks but symptoms generally manifest in the long term via chronic exposure for example in the relatively low concentrations typically found in contaminated groundwaters the effects of arsenic or fluoride toxicity manifest after several years as arsenicosis 10 or fluorosis 11 in the exposed population in the absence of water testing they may remain unsuspected because they do not cause acute toxicity at low concentrations and are imperceptible based on the taste and odour of the water with the technology available today and based on findings of the initial source water quality tests the design should appropriately treat the water for both kinds of contaminants for long term good health microbial contamination especially in surface water is prevalent due to contamination from run off with human animal fecal content and untreated wastewater discharge according to the world health organization globally at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with feces 12 therefore any surface water treatment system must have elaborate multistage microbial safety elements built into its design at a minimum surface water treatment plants should follow the 6 4 3 reduction guideline i e 6 lrv log reduction value for bacteria 4 lrv for viruses and 3 lrv for cysts tested using indicator species at prescribed challenge levels multistage microbiological safety of water is achievable through membrane filtration followed by primary disinfection and or secondary disinfection this is in addition to prefiltration stages such as sediment filter for removal of particulates and activated carbon for odour colour and organic contaminants endemic contaminants are groundwater contaminants particular to many geographies arsenic fluoride and heavy metals are common and local government monitoring data is valuable for mapping the endemicity of such contaminants one may consider addressing these contaminants in the regions where their endemicity is known even if initial testing does not indicate their presence such preemptive design consideration could help offset the effects of seasonal temporal or water depth variations in the source water alternatively the design may incorporate the scope to accommodate treatment capability for such a contaminant in the case that the presence is detected during routine water quality monitoring at a future time emerging trace and persistent contaminants are chemicals of anthropogenic origin that have found their way into water sources at trace levels these include pharmaceuticals including antibiotics personal care products pesticides and herbicides etc for many of these contaminants the quantitative risks to human health are unknown or under research 13 therefore such contaminants are neither regulated nor tested while designing a system a designer should assume the presence of such contaminants in their infinitesimally low concentrations and add polishing stages to address them contaminants such as pesticides radioactive elements volatile organics arsenic heavy metals such as lead cadmium mercury etc could have adverse health effects at extremely low parts per billion ppb concentrations poly and perfluoroalkyl substances or pfas sometimes known as forever chemicals owing to their persistence in the environment are dissolved contaminants that are regulated at even lower parts per trillion ppt concentrations 14 testing for many of these compounds is expensive and technically complex and requires sophisticated laboratory capability often out of reach for many communities hence controlling these contaminants is not done by testing and monitoring but instead by designing treatment to manage them microplastics are plastic fragments smaller than 5 mm 5000 µm in size whereas particles with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm are referred to as nano plastics 15 microplastics pollution in water from aging and abrading plastics already present in the environment is widespread and detected in piped and bottled water samples and even ground water samples 16 17 the world health organization recently called for more research about the potential human health impacts of microplastics in the environment particularly drinking water current research indicates that the human body may not absorb particles above 150 µm however absorption may be higher for smaller particles in the nano size range 18 although some conventional drinking water treatments can remove sub micron sized particles from the water the membrane filtration technologies ensure reliable removal of both micro and nano plastics it is therefore prudent to include such physical barriers in the treatment design biomagnification is the concentration of a chemical substance in organisms from water and food exposure at successively higher levels in the food chain substances that metabolize slowly or are difficult to excrete accumulate in animals and humans that consume the contaminated food or water resulting in increasing concentrations within their bodies rice is widely cultivated in west bengal india and bangladesh two regions that face high arsenic endemicity rice plants are known to accumulate arsenic in the grains much more efficiently than other staple cereals and the problem is exacerbated when arsenic contaminated groundwater is use to irrigate the crops 19 biomagnification impact in humans is also a result of diets rich in meat milk and milk based foods if milch cattle consume pesticide contaminated fodder the milk they produce may contain such contamination too 20 therefore to protect communities from the adverse health effects of biomagnification one needs to secure water safety for the entire food chain this concept underscores the need beyond water treatment design for a holistic approach to the way we live within our shared ecosystem variability in source water quality the source water quality varies with the change of seasons and over time groundwater can become more polluted as the water table declines due to overuse rainwater run offs often carry microbial contamination of anthropogenic and animal origin as well as fertilizer or pesticide residues and pollute aquifers by infiltration through damaged or inadequately protected wells surface water typically becomes more turbid during rains with so much variability a single sampling event cannot reveal all possible contaminants but is at best an indicator additionally knowing the mix of incoming raw water is essential in many households only one pipeline alternatingly supplies municipal water for potable use and groundwater for other applications if the feed water quality changes in characteristic so drastically the treatment will need to be robust or flexible enough to handle the variation of challenge contaminants residual disinfection residual disinfection plays a critical role in ensuring water security until consumption for decades public health engineers have relied heavily on introducing some free chlorine residual in the treated water for residual protection 1 1 in the presence of organic matter chlorine compounds may form hazardous byproducts to avoid this chlorination should only be done in clean treated water however consumers may dislike the taste or odor of chlorine and resist its presence in the water creating awareness about the critical role of chlorine residual in water safety and disease prevention can counter this mindset in communities alternatively water utilities could use chlorinated cyanurates with less perceptible sensory outcomes at our water stations in india safe water network trialed chlorine dosing of treated drinking water with sodium dichloroisocyanurate nadcc in place of sodium hypochlorite and discovered there is higher acceptability among consumers because of the low perceptibility taste and odour from nadcc compared to hypochlorite solution this has resulted in better dosing compliance by operators and has been especially important for residual water safety in the current covid 19 pandemic here it may be noted that the conventional methods of free chlorine measurement overestimate the free chlorine level in the case of chlorinated cyanurates dpd colorimetry and amperometric titrations effectively measure total chlorine therefore chlorine dosing calculations must be guided by this knowledge when targeting a minimum free chlorine level 21 3 technology specific considerations designing a drinking water system is challenging due to the diversity of competing technical and commercial demands selecting the right technology or combination of technologies for a given set of conditions will result in a reliable treatment process for this judgement borne out of experience and knowledge of available treatment options and their limitations is essential the best treatment design is a combination of art and science understanding the removal capability of each technology alone and in combination for physical chemical radiological microbiological and aesthetic contaminants primary treatment technologies include coagulation ceramic and polymeric membrane filtration viz reverse osmosis nano ultra and micro filtration ion exchange and emerging technologies like electrodialysis and capacitive deionization particle filtration activated carbon mixed media and a range of disinfection strategies such as chlorination ozone and uv irradiation are standard in polishing steps for targeting a desired level of protection the selection of technologies should be guided by the following considerations know the limits of the treatment system we must inform ourselves of the contaminant reduction capability of each component for instance it should be known that ultrafiltration uf ultraviolet light uv µm filters or slow sand filters will not eliminate dissolved contaminants ro membranes will but are vulnerable to fouling from dissolved iron and silica also ro membranes are easily damaged by chlorine in the feed water leading to lower salt rejection and poor quality product water therefore ro raw water feed should be adequately dechlorinated using an activated carbon prefilter viruses are too small 20 250 nm to be removed by conventional filtration technologies but chlorine disinfection can be effective for viruses and bacteria and many protozoa as well however chlorination is ineffectual against the cyst stage in protozoans life cycle for which nano or ultra filtration should be used for chemical disinfection the effectiveness depends on the concentration and contact time with the water other factors including temperature dissolved and suspended solids turbidity and ph also have an effect for uv disinfection the dosage is a function of the uv transmissivity in the reaction chamber duration of exposure water clarity and the lamp sleeves cleanness additional monitoring is required when the feed water is hard exposure to uv light generates heat leading to scale formation on the walls of the disinfection chamber diminishing uv transmissivity all these considerations and others will guide the selection of treatment components for effective purification of feed water the sequence of components in the treatment scheme determines efficacy for instance for effective disinfection the uv chamber must precede the chlorination stage as uv light is known to destroy chlorine in the water and in this configuration the residual disinfection will be reduced additionally uv irradiation done after chlorination may result in formation of disinfection by products from uv catalysed oxidation of chlorine to chlorites and chlorates 22 some special considerations need to be kept in mind when designing ion exchange systems for removal of endemic chemical contaminants resin regeneration is critically important for the reliable performance of the system in the removal of target contaminants the designer needs to ensure that either an automatic shutdown of the system or sounding of alarm occurs once the capacity of the media to remove the contaminant is exhausted also introduce rigorous operator training so the operator is cognizant of the dangers of operating the system after the resin is spent the resin could be adding the contaminant to the water instead of removing it awareness of competing ions in the source water is essential as they directly impact the media or resin s capacity to remove target contaminants the issue is magnified when the competing ions are present at much higher concentrations say parts per million than the target contaminant which may be present and harmful at very low parts per billion levels for example phosphate nitrate and sulphate ions compete with arsenate which is weakly ionic and not selectively adsorbed for resin adsorption sites 23 these competing ions would then exhaust the resin at a faster rate than anticipated from calculations therefore a thorough understanding of the source water chemistry is necessary for selecting the appropriate resin and introducing suitable pretreatment for removal of competing ions the danger of a treatment process adding contamination exists in technologies like electrocoagulation or ion exchange these technologies are positioned as alternatives to reverse osmosis for low tds feed water however electrocoagulation may add an unacceptable level of aluminum to the treated water if the designer uses aluminum as a sacrificial anode similarly the use of alum as a flocculant in municipal systems may lead to increased aluminum in the treated water above the prescribed limits unless careful dosing is maintained similarly ion exchange resins risk adding the very contaminants they are supposed to remove if used beyond the saturation point a physical barrier to stop contaminants is better than the hope for robust operation membranes and filters act as physical barriers to contaminants in some ways providing higher confidence in their effectiveness when their capacity for water filtration is exhausted they choke and will not yield contaminated water on the other hand technologies such as uv ion exchange resins or electrocoagulation require a higher degree of operational diligence and embedded fail safe controls such as automatic cut off or flow diversion when their capacity to treat water is diminished automation is essential in many applications for example ultrafiltration requires periodic backwashing to prevent fouling with the frequency depending upon the quality of feed water similarly auto power off is essential to protect systems against grid fluctuations lightning high temperatures etc designing for once in a lifetime risk allowance for contamination spike drinking water suppliers have enormous communal responsibility and often regulatory and legal obligations to protect public health through the reliable delivery of safe water to ensure reliability and system resilience design for the worst conditions even though such situations may arise only occasionally at the design stage factor in the attendant costs of building this capability if the costs appear high consider the damage to brand credibility and loss of goodwill for the entire chain of stakeholders in case of failure future proofing the design is possible by investing marginally more upfront rather than retrofitting a system later inevitably not all the elements in a system will work to design efficiencies therefore it is prudent to build a certain margin of safety to account for less than ideal component performance one can build in redundancy of critical components for water security designers often make claims for system capabilities as determined at beginning of life bol in practice however systems deteriorate over time hence consideration of end of life eol performance is essential for example in ultraviolet disinfection consider the lamp s end of life uv dosage rather than the bol dosage which could be twice the eol dose 4 operational considerations ease of operation and maintenance is integral to system design a well designed system would require minimal intervention by the operator on a day to day basis the design must permit easy access to all the components for repairs and servicing reliable high quality parts though initially expensive pay for themselves in savings through reduced downtime and maintenance requirements maintaining a local inventory of essential spares minimizes downtime due to procurement delays such measures build resilience while ensuring uninterrupted water supply in emergencies and crises as in the current covid 19 outbreak preventative maintenance can extend the useful life of components and is often underrated depth filters and sand filters require timely backwashing and changeovers to maintain their dirt holding capacity ultrafiltration membranes need backwashing on schedule to prevent biofouling while ro membranes need periodic clean in place cip clear instructions on chemical cleaning or replacement frequency will be part of a good preventative maintenance program operator training and diligence in routine preventative maintenance is a critical ingredient for reliable long term operation evaluate power supply options based on the availability of grid power hours of supply and quality many rural grid supplies do not have an adequate neutral phase increasing the risk of equipment damage and may require power conditioning equipment some treatment technologies are sensitive to disruptions in power and therefore need a backup power supply for systematic shutdown solar energy offers an alternative for powering off grid treatment systems however solar power is prone to the challenges of a theft of high value components b lithium batteries needing to be sent to service centers for maintenance which may involve complicated logistics and c inverter manufacturers often may not have the service capacity infrastructure spares and engineers to provide timely and affordable service at remote locations these challenges entail high costs and outages and in many remote rural installations currently solar power may not offer a dependable power solution although governments and private sector entities are working to build the infrastructure for large scale adoption of solar technology remote monitoring system rms helps virtual supervision of a spread out water supply infrastructure or cluster of water treatment systems it helps diagnose and troubleshoot maintenance needs using sensors and cloud based servers to track critical water quality tds ph chlorine residual or technical performance parameters such as flows pressures production volumes and sales etc such ability helps reduce costs with timely warnings for maintenance and spares requirements considering the physical space constraints for housing the water treatment system components both initially and for expansion is important a good design should be compact and yet provide easy access for serviceability and allow some scope for future expansion safeguard against vandalism theft and sabotage by securing the treated water tanks and other critical components under lock and key 5 water quality control the world health organization defines a water safety plan wsp as a comprehensive risk assessment and risk management approach for ensuring water safety that encompasses all the steps of water supply from catchment to consumer 24 it is easy to overlook a requirement while designing a system but maintaining a checklist ensures that due consideration is given to all critical design aspects the documentation of the treatment operations and control points are critical elements of a wsp keep the intent of a water safety plan in mind even at the design stage of water treatment selection in particular identify all the hazards and hazardous events that can affect the water safety from the source through treatment and distribution to the consumers handling assess the risk presented by each hazard consider if the controls in place for each significant hazard are adequate validate the effectiveness of these controls water quality control entails regular diligent in house monitoring while water quality assurance requires a neutral external evaluation of quality at some specified frequency periodically testing at an external nationally accredited laboratory must be done to validate the water quality available to the consumers making such results available for scrutiny onsite inspires consumer trust and eases regulatory oversight simultaneous testing of both raw and treated water helps monitor the functioning of the treatment systems testing of additional samples from stages along the treatment chain might also be necessary the seasonal variability may inform the frequency of testing of source water quality 6 environmental considerations responsible disposal of components such as spent filters and membranes plan for appropriate handling and responsible disposal of activated carbon lamps from uv systems exhausted ion exchange resins as well as waste from treatment operations such as sludge from electrocoagulation responsible disposal of reject water concentrate in ro brine from capacitive deionization or from regeneration of ion exchange resins must be done following the prescribed environmental norms based on the design technology and water chemistry there may be a three to five fold concentration of contaminants in the waste stream plan for its responsible disposal governments prescribe guidelines contaminant limits for the disposal of reject waters in ponds or rivers sewage lines discharge wells or into the sea these must be followed untreated effluent or reject water should never be let into unlined discharge wells as it could contaminate the groundwater coastal nations use multistage flash evaporation or reverse osmosis for seawater desalination the concentrate from desalination referred to as brine is continuously released back into the sea in order to minimize the impact of high salt concentrations and temperature on the coastal ecology the discharge is done at prescribed flow rates at a considerable distance from the shoreline which may be up to 22 km the territorial sea limits 7 financial considerations capital versus operational expenditure most at scale implementations have a significant capital outlay hence governments deploy open competitive bids to discover the lowest initial price inviting technically qualified bidders however subsequent high operating costs and lack of asset renewal funds result in failures some technologies have high initial capital but their longer performance life and lower operational and maintenance costs lead to a lower lifecycle cost 25 therefore weigh operating costs in addition to initial costs at the time of technology selection water pricing the fixing of water pricing should be done factoring in the consumers ability to pay but should be enough to sustain the local operating costs and discourage water wastage 25 8 macro considerations plan for the vagaries of weather a raised platform on which to install the treatment plant is a simple device to protect against seasonal flooding additional treated water storage ensures uninterrupted supply during raw water supply disruptions or power outages source protection is critical for water safety communities should ensure that water bodies used as drinking water source are designated separate from those for livestock use washing and bathing the effluent disposal site must be downstream from the community to prevent drinking water contamination 9 key messages to the designers fig 1 depicts the considerations that drive the sustainability of swes and the outcomes from delivering a reliable supply of safe drinking water to communities to summarize a designer may consider the following key points while designing drinking water treatment systems for the swes know the raw water quality and the available treatment options for an informed decision on treatment technology selection consider the variations in raw water quality profile due to changing seasonality or ingress of contaminants in the supply pipelines prioritize design based on the predominant challenge dissolved chemical contaminants or the potential of microbiological contamination with reasonable protections against both kinds of contaminants based on risk assessment secure the availability of essential resources that are key to sustainable operations source water supply power space building infrastructure chemicals and consumables and competent manpower eliminate or minimize the human factor with automated alarms controls and monitoring build redundancy into the treatment design by introducing multiple stages to bridge the failure of any one critical component invest in high quality components that pay for themselves over an operational lifetime through savings in repair and replacement costs especially in a remote distributed

20122,water scarcity is increasing across the globe we discuss how the private sector and private investment can assist in the fight against water scarcity especially in advanced and middle income economies we first lay out from an economic perspective why local regional and national governments have traditionally played an outsized role in providing water security we next describe a whole set of possible roles for the private sector ranging from a fully privatized water sector to more limited public private partnerships ppps corporate social responsibility csr and impact investment that may take place independent of the public sector the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of an argument for greater private involvement emerge from reassessing the traditional view of the water sector as a natural monopoly with increasing returns to scale as well as from contract theory that emphasizes how carefully written contracts imply control but do not require public ownership at all times rising water scarcity and water infrastructures badly in need of an upgrade in many places point to public institutions and societies not meeting the social and environmental challenge which opens the door for private initiatives in the form of corporate social responsibility and impact investing keywords water scarcity contract theory natural monopoly public good water infrastructure 1 introduction water scarcity is a growing concern due to a changing climate an ever growing world population and world economy and changing diets while water scarcity has many facets indicators of water stress and shortage highlight the environmental and social dimensions that are our focus 52 49 1 1 see footnote in supplementary material water stress captures the lower levels of major aquifers 60 the depletion of rivers that may no longer reach the oceans 6 and the diminished environmental flows that adversely affect water quality ecosystems services and aquatic life 61 water shortage measures on the other hand reveal decreasing water availability per person and signal a lack of access to water for basic human needs 2 2 see footnote in supplementary material ownership and investment figures underscore that ensuring water security and providing and regulating water have been the purview of the public sector in recent history 23 a 2011 worldwide survey of the water services of 330 major cities reveals that 85 were publicly owned and publicly run see gwi 32 in terms of investment private sector involvement in the water sector is also limited certainly more so than for other public services burger and hawkesworth 7 surveyed mostly oecd countries and found that for nine of them only 5 or less of their public infrastructure investment spending since 1985 was private for seven it was up to 10 and for only four countries was it higher of this private investment in infrastructure typically 10 went to the water sector see table 1 and 38 there is however a growing interest in more private sector involvement and investment this reflects the need to adapt and innovate in light of climate change and increased water scarcity evolving societal views on pressing environmental and social questions and the private sector s growing role in other critical network infrastructures such as gas electricity transportation and telecommunication also fueling the interest is the current state of the public water infrastructure which in many places badly needs an upgrade and the realization that government entities can be beholden to special interests rather than focused on the public interest 66 finally budgetary shortfalls motivate the call for private investment 27 to be clear however the interest in more private sector involvement is not universal in france for example there has been a push to remunicipalize water utilities and right2water is a european citizens initiative to keep water services in public hands 3 3 see footnote in supplementary material using economic theory as a guide we suggest where private sector involvement in the water supply chain may help and complement government actions and where its benefits are less obvious we choose this angle since debates about private sector involvement are sometimes informed by ideology and insufficient systematic empirical evidence is available to assess its overall effectiveness whenever possible we refer to cases and the emerging empirical literature see 53 we primarily focus on the for profit private sector in advanced and middle income countries we first lay out why governments have been traditionally favored and why governments overwhelmingly own the entire water supply chain we spell out the economic characteristics of water the cost structure of public water provision and the economic conditions necessary to successfully combat water scarcity all of which call for a coordinating entity such as the government from an economic point of view involving the private sector typically stems from the desire to harness its efficiency and flexibility as well as expertise and innovation that follow from competition the private sector may well be ready to play a more active role in fighting water scarcity in advanced and middle income economies because of the reassessment of the role of the price of water a more realistic water price is not only an essential component of any credible strategy to fight water scarcity but also a critical precondition for private sector involvement private sector involvement hinges upon a realistic return on investment for which more realistic water prices are necessary similarly institutional and policy clarity and an independent regulatory entity that minimizes the possibility of regulatory takings or expropriation are key to guarantee a return on investment as well as to enforce proper conduct by private companies such a setting tends to be available in more advanced economies as a matter of fact engel et al 27 leigland 53 and kumar 51 question the effectiveness of public private partnerships in lower income countries and discourage them there as we lay out the role for the private sector we first ask which components of the long supply chain are more amenable to competition and hence to private involvement we next turn to the lessons of contract theory that provide a nuanced view of private sector involvement between the extremes of a fully public and entirely private water sector we identify a whole range of partnership options between governments and companies or nongovernmental organizations ngos in addition we describe private initiatives geared toward fighting the social and environmental dimension of water scarcity despite or independent of government activity they relate to corporate social responsibility and from the financial investment side impact investment in this article we focus especially on the water sector even though water scarcity often originates outside that sector without a direct link to water policies consider the remarkable path of water use in the united states since the 1970s in spite of a tripling of real gross domestic product gdp since the 1970s overall water use has not increased a key factor behind this water neutral growth is structural change the share in gdp of services whose average productivity of water is much higher than that of agriculture has steadily increased whereas that of agriculture and manufacturing has shrunk this shift has raised overall water productivity and limited water use in spite of economic growth see 19 to be clear the structural change is primarily driven by capital accumulation and technological change and affected only marginally if at all by water and water policy in other words however important governmental and private involvement are in the water sector a holistic approach to fighting water scarcity across all sectors is essential 2 governments role in fighting water scarcity to understand the dominant role of the public sector and how to position the private sector we first consider the economic characteristics of water the cost structure of water infrastructure and three critical dimensions that garrick et al 31 identify in the fight against water scarcity 2 1 economic characteristics of water water is a complex good with many overlapping uses 39 when we drink a bottle of water the benefits are entirely private and hence distribution is best organized through markets with a specific price for water many properties of water are however non rival my use does not reduce yours and non exclusionary when water is left in situ for all people to enjoy or as an aquatic habitat it functions like a public good 4 4 see footnote in supplementary material because of this public good dimension coordination and rules need to guarantee water s continued availability and shield at least some water from private ownership this coordinating role tends to fall on local regional or central governments water also moves with gravity and returns to the environment after its use after irrigation water seeps into the soil or flows to a river and is prone to create positive or negative externalities for others as its quantity or quality is altered in such instances the social and private costs and benefits of water may differ and coordination is again called for 5 5 see footnote in supplementary material 11 ostrom 59 has documented how community traditions may preserve and regulate natural resources because of the many stakeholders in modern societies decentralized coordination is difficult and costly and the role of water s arbitrator falls on the government moreover because water is intimately linked to public health equity and all economic activity its infrastructure is critical and so government intervention is warranted it is in everybody s interest to avoid an outbreak of waterborne diseases a breakdown in the water supply or a threat to a region s water security 2 2 cost structure of water infrastructure the particular cost structure of water supply limits competition and invites government intervention water is heavy and local water infrastructures are elaborate long lived and capital intensive in the united states for example the water industry is more than twice as capital intensive value of assets relative to annual revenue as the telecommunications and electricity sector 55 dams reservoirs distribution nets of canals and pumping stations are needed when ground or surface water is not readily available supplying residents and businesses with drinking water requires a network infrastructure that is intermediated by utilities and includes abstraction of ground and surface water or ocean water in the case of desalination mains and pumping stations and treatment plants where contaminants and pollutants are removed after treatment water is stored in reservoirs and service lines deliver metered water to retail or bulk users the wastewater cycle then collects used water sewage and trade effluent from sewers drains and manholes and transports it to treatment plants where solids are separated from effluent that is released into the environment or reenters the water supply through recycling as for the sludge it is incinerated deposited in landfills or mined for biological properties the high upfront costs of such elaborate network infrastructures and the low marginal costs of providing water once the structures are in place suggest economies of scale long term rates of return and decreasing average costs as more water is supplied over time the large fixed costs are spread over more users 68 chapter 6 not only are high upfront costs an impediment to entry but to exploit scale economies local regional or central governments may be inclined to centralize and limit entry which turns the water sector into a natural monopoly par excellence that leaves consumers with few options this monopoly position calls for proper pricing regulation in order to make sure that enough water is provided at reasonable prices this regulated price is typically a function of the average costs companies face to make sure the water operation is viable and covers total cost the price regulation is put in place to counterbalance two forces on the one hand because of their monopoly positions water utilities are inclined to use their market power and charge too high a price on the other hand the price of water has to be higher than the marginal cost the cost of the last liter produced is lower than the average cost due to increasing returns to be profitable the aqua america case below will discuss current water price regulation 6 6 see footnote in supplementary material 2 3 key aspects of fighting water scarcity if water abundance implies there is sufficient water for all uses and the environment water scarcity indicates too much demand for the available supply because water has an open access dimension overuse may trigger the tragedy of the commons 40 hence fighting water scarcity requires at least three major actions limiting use to match the sustainable water supply pricing water properly and massively investing in water infrastructure see 31 in a situation of scarcity it is desirable that all private and public sources of water be metered and accounted for which only a few countries e g singapore and israel manage ideally the sum of water property rights and permits is equal to the sustainable water use see debaere et al 17 the crudest way to limit use is to apply command and control assign water to all users and the environment and then reduce everybody s use by a preestablished metric in case of scarcity because of water s public dimension some command and control measures are inevitable relying only on them however is not desirable from an economic point of view they are prone to inefficiency and may not provide water to those who can use it most effectively instead they may provide water to the most politically connected or they may impose similar restrictions on wasteful and efficient users an essential component of any successful program to fight water scarcity is a more realistic price for obtaining water permits or for water from the tap water prices worldwide tend to be too low see 64 25 even in very arid saudi arabia water has been virtually free for a long time see 14 a realistic water price limits demand can rectify the mismatch between supply and demand discourages waste and incentivizes saving it also ensures a more efficient allocation for the water in private hands as only those activities are undertaken that warrant the cost price of water the add on effects of proper water pricing are essential for private sector involvement a price of water not only encourages water saving it also makes investing in water saving technology irrigation systems appliances etc or alternative water supplies recycling or desalination worthwhile and guarantees a rate of return for private investment in addition a realistic price encourages innovation which lags behind other sectors because of the historically low price of water see ajami et al 2 8 in the same way that determining and enforcing a sustainable level is not trivial neither is pricing water particular care is in order when regulating the water price utilities charge improper pricing is at the heart of many challenges to water infrastructure when it is in public hands as well due to low water rates for example revenues for water utilities are often not sufficient to maintain the water infrastructure let alone upgrade it at the same time as noted water utilities are natural monopolies and when left to their own devices they would be inclined to charge too high a price and provide too little water as in the aqua america case below note also that there are many water pricing schemes possible and that charging a higher price does not necessarily mean limiting access to water for example a public utility can make liters available for consumption or hygiene to everyone for free and price water for use beyond the initial level alternatively it could specifically target those with lesser means finally the sheer size of the financial challenge of fighting water scarcity puts it in the purview of the government to make effective progress across the globe it is necessary to decrease water losses increase water quality build reservoirs and dams ensure better storage of water and bring online desalination and recycling facilities in addition funds may be needed to buy back water rights or permits estimates vary but to meet the united nations sustainable development goal of access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030 some scholars estimate 1 7 trillion is needed 48 3 the role of private investment in fighting water scarcity the dominance of governments in the water sector does not mean that there is no room for private initiatives especially as infrastructure investments tend to be determined by tradition and history 58 we first revisit the natural monopoly argument and describe the parts of the water supply network that are potentially open for private investment from an economic point of view next we consider water provision from the angle of recent developments in contract theory we finally focus on private initiatives such as corporate social responsibility and impact investing that sometimes operate in spite of government actions 3 1 breaking up the water supply chain even though water infrastructures are considered natural monopolies it is an open question whether economies of scale apply to their entire supply chain including extraction treatment distribution and discharge 9 1 it is also not clear that there are economies of scope or that combining all stages in one vertically integrated entity necessarily reduces average costs in the absence of economies of scope and scale for all components however there is less need for a monopoly vertical integration or for that matter centralization and there should be room for more entry and competition hence the provision of water may well be more complex than the simple dichotomy of all private or all public while there is little doubt that huge sunk costs for mains and pipes result in scale economies it is not clear that they are present in water extraction 23 chap 11 limited entry in water extraction likely stems from concerns that too much water could be withdrawn tragedy of the commons rather than from scale economies as water markets illustrate however there are ways to open up extraction to competition while honoring water use limits this requires a well defined system of permits and rights and an overall cap water markets are after all cap and trade systems in water markets private buyers and sellers exchange the right to use water at prices determined by supply and demand see chong and sunding 10 grafton et al 33 easter and huang 26 and debaere et al 17 a farmer may be willing to sell water to a buyer who employs water more productively and hence can pay a higher price than what the farmer s own use justifies in such a scenario water markets would allocate water more productively leading to higher value crop production while markets flexibility and decentralized allocation are treasured in an uncertain world it is important to note that they are complex in order for these markets to function properly it is necessary to satisfy conditions that limit asymmetric information and transaction costs and that ensure good governance and enforcement see debaere 20 and debaere and li 21 markets also evolve with changes in human behavior in response to price incentives growth in scientific understanding and changes in the sociopolitical context including especially questions of equity and trade offs between agriculture and cities an important advantage of water trading at the upstream extraction stage is that it forces a realistic water price on all downstream private activities and as such may help fight water scarcity as noted a realistic price is an essential precondition for private sector involvement because it provides an incentive a return on investment that will attract private investment and innovation 7 7 see footnote in supplementary material water markets also open a window of opportunity for water saving beyond the cap imposed by the government as in csr and impact investment note that while organizing a full fledged water market may not be politically or logistically feasible more limited bilateral trading is also possible for example along the colorado river well off cities such as san diego have struck generous deals with farming communities in which the cities pay farmers to save water through fallowing such programs limit water use transfer water to more productive city uses and shift agricultural production toward more valuable and less wasteful crops see 63 next to water extraction economics of scale of other components in the supply chain are not obvious take the treatment of water and wastewater 23 for smaller water and wastewater treatment units at the level of a household or a cluster of buildings for example there may be diseconomies of scale beyond a certain level of output as sedlak 65 argues these diseconomies allow for more decentralized water provision and such local treatment facilities could help overcome people s reluctance to drink treated sewage water or offer an incentive to use recycled water for non potable water uses in principle the absence of economies of scale opens the door to competition among treatment operators and this competition could harness private sector innovation along the same line is the push for sewage mining in water scarce countries such as australia while a lawsuit that tried to open wastewater lines to third parties in the same way that at t gave competitors access to its infrastructure has not been adopted around the world it does illustrate how water scarce countries realize they cannot waste a drop of water they are looking for ways to foster competition risk taking and innovation in the water infrastructure that has typically been publicly owned and publicly managed 3 1 1 case water markets in the murray darling basin australia s markets in the murray darling basin and the efforts to cap overall water use in the wake of the millennium drought have received ample attention for a short history see national water commission 56 for good overviews see grafton et al 33 wheeler et al 71 and tisdell 70 for a discussion of the big dry see herberger 45 see also richter 62 garrick 30 and most recently horne and grafton 47 australia is the driest continent in terms of precipitation per hectare its breadbasket the murray darling basin extends over more than a million square kilometers while covering southern and eastern states unlike the united states australia has a nonpriority permitting system at the discretion of the government that is open to non riparian users see 70 water rights can be traded independently of the land title and are defined in terms of a fraction of the available water not as an absolute volume of water the murray darling basin is where 80 or 90 of water trading takes place amounting to 2billion australian dollars in 2018 19 waterfind 2019 australian water markets annual report the water markets of the murray darling basin across state territory boundaries by the 1980s it was clear that australia s surface and groundwater systems were overdeveloped 71 in the first phase of the water markets 1980 94 water and land rights were legally separated trading took off in the mid 1990s and grew throughout the second phase 1994 2007 and third phase after 2007 with continued efforts to integrate water markets across states bring in urban centers improve logistics lower trading costs and emphasize sustainable development there has been some contention over how to reduce the outstanding water rights it has been difficult to have all states agree under the murray darling basin plan to a sustainable cap on water use that meets environmental needs underscoring how essential a societal consensus for water reforms is young 72 has stressed that it is best to have a water abstraction regime with an agreed upon cap and generous water allocations for the environment in place before trading takes off while this is preferable it may not be feasible water markets change people s incentives in unexpected ways and the dynamics between cities and agriculture can change 34 agricultural communities in victoria for example opposed the use of a water pipeline to melbourne after it had been built at considerable expense with increased urbanization and the average and likely also marginal value of water in industry and services higher than in agriculture theory predicts that rich cities will acquire farmers water such potential inter sectoral transfers stoke fears that agricultural communities will disappear and that remaining irrigators will face higher irrigation infrastructure costs the stranded assets phenomenon in this context financial transfer to farmers may be necessary to get their buy in with water management reforms in the end a region s particular political economy plays a key role in whether water markets materialize and how horne and grafton 47 point out that the access of indigenous communities is an important and as of yet unresolved issue 3 2 public private partnerships water infrastructure through the lens of contracting water infrastructures are long lived and their installation often predates contract theory which recasts governments involvement in the economy in a more business friendly role while the public dimension of water the cost structure of its infrastructure and the fight against water scarcity all call for the public sector to play a key role contract theory s main insight is that public control does not imply public ownership all the time because a government can write contracts as long as there is an independent regulatory agency to oversee how the private entity executes the private government contract a government does not need to own the infrastructure to achieve social and environmental objectives it can incorporate provisions for underprivileged communities in the contract it invites companies to bid on see 66 or it can specify the water quality levels it desires and how to test for it contracting and competition open the door for the private sector and invite reforms of the public sector 69 chapter 17 in extreme cases they make full fledged private ownership possible as in england scotland and wales see below more often contracts pave the way for a whole array of more limited private participations that may well be more effective than 100 privatization arguments in favor of more limited private sector involvement stem from the realization that contracts are incomplete because of the long term nature of water infrastructure extending beyond the political cycle it is impossible to specify all details contingencies and changing circumstances which may make these contracts less attractive to both the government and the private sector especially when large costs have to be sunk up front see grossman and hart 35 and hart and moore 41 8 8 see footnote in supplementary material also questions about the effectiveness of courts to litigate complex contracts 67 may limit the appetite for private sector involvement as well as for governments who may see increase the cost of preparing projects with private involvement increase 53 finally the ultimately asymmetric nature of the cooperation can play a role in the end the public entity sets the rules and can also change the rules see ménard 54 public private partnerships or ppps are fashionable labels for more limited forms of public private engagement these partnerships involve relatively long term contracts between the government and the private sector in which governments share some of their decision making authority and property rights with private companies which receive as compensation for the duration of the contract an income stream and often temporary ownership of the assets ppps thus go beyond a supplier model where governments just buy from the market what they need but they stop short of an enterprise model where the government produces the goods or services without private involvement ppps define the roles of both parties with regard to the basic tasks necessary to provide any good or service 22 task 1 defining and designing a project task 2 financing the capital cost of a project task 3 building or repairing a project task 4 operating and maintaining the asset in order to deliver the product service to be explicit in the end the particular incentives on the part of the government and the private sector as they relate to the specific task will be critical for the success of ppps governments have long engaged the private sector in more ways than just purchasing its goods and services they have often contracted out especially task 3 when building or repairing bridges or water treatment stations for example they have specified what they wished to acquire collected bids and selected a winner and at their core ppps are a way of contracting out while at the same time bundling multiple tasks 9 9 see footnote in supplementary material note that as tasks are transferred to private partners in the bundling process public authorities usually keep control over key decisions in our delineation of ppps the infrastructure asset ultimately remains in public hands even when private partners make significant investments the asset eventually returns to the government when the infrastructure remains in private hands we label this private ownership and discuss it in the next section the flaws of publicly provided goods are well known there are pork barrel projects undertaken to benefit certain representatives and local districts white elephants impractical expensive projects and public goods that suffer substandard maintenance and low quality of service in the case of water the poor quality and insufficient maintenance of the infrastructure has attracted much attention although expensive desalination plants that stand idle after construction are worth considering as well in theory ppps should reduce costs increase the quality of service and harness innovation the private sector is believed to deliver those benefits because of ex ante competition in the bidding process as opposed to ex post competition in which only one private supplier wins the contract and provides the service see 24 incentives are key they make sure risks are allocated to the entity that can best handle them according to that entity s expertise for example a government may not build enough 10 10 see footnote in supplementary material moreover in the specific case of water private involvement and less political interference may lead to a more realistic price for water as companies need to cover their costs and fund maintenance and innovation through water revenue note that the fine print of how contracts are specifically set up matters for their success incomplete contracts may result in inefficient outcomes after initial investments new contingencies may arise that cannot be recuperated which may lead to renegotiations and terms different from those initially envisioned in the ppp and there is evidence of early and extensive negotiations see engel et al 27 guasch et al 36 guasch and straub 37 and leigland 53 11 11 see footnote in supplementary material when contracts cannot be fully specified concerns arise that companies desires to minimize costs may reduce quality in other words the private sector may cut corners to reduce costs see 42 it is here that bundling tasks in ppps can provide a solution by combining building task 3 or designing task 1 with service and maintenance task 4 private companies have an incentive to build in ways that minimize the lifetime maintenance costs 43 of course if performance standards are observable they can be included in the contract to solve the quality problem needless to say with piping and mains underground and not smart it is hard to carefully monitor all components of the water infrastructure financing task 2 and building task 3 may also be complementary having the private sector finance a project before transferring it to the government shifts the construction risk and any costs associated with delays to the private sector since the private sector is in charge of building it is in the best position to flexibly respond to incentives cost of borrowing hence combining financing and construction makes for speedier projects and fewer delays many combinations of tasks are possible in ppps according to the world bank long term concessions are common in the water sector these include especially rehabilitate operate transfer rot rehabilitate lease rent transfer rlrt and build rehabilitate operate transfer brot concessions among advanced economies europe leads the united states in the use of ppps france home to major water multinationals commonly uses long term concessions 12 12 see footnote in supplementary material in some instances such as the carlsbad build finance operate bfo of a desalination plant discussed below the asset transfer to the government at the end can be optional in one of the few systematic empirical studies of ppps engel et al 27 emphasize that ppps save maintenance costs which speaks to the water sector and its poor maintenance private companies tend to continuously maintain operations thereby avoiding the massive repair costs of delayed maintenance that are characteristic of the public sector what drives this favorable behavior is the eventual transfer of the assets to the government as well as the steady income stream typically water user fees that pays for private involvement fees directed toward a private company generate expectations of maintenance and quality to be explicit these user fees are companies return on investment in the particular case of the water sector however unlike electricity and telecommunications where cost effective tariffs are more common subsidies may still be necessary in ppps or renegotiated ppps if customers expect low water tariffs see leigland 53 engel et al 27 emphasize another advantage of having user fees pay for private involvement they weed out white elephants or wasteful projects without real use that would not generate sufficient income because private companies will not agree to them 3 2 1 case carlsbad desalination plant san diego county lies in the semiarid southwest of the united states it is home to the largest desalination plant in the western hemisphere 13 13 see footnote in supplementary material building the plant was an attempt to secure a steady water supply and fight water stress in an area that imported 85 of its water supply the carlsbad desalination plant was a cooperation between the san diego water authority sdcwa and poseidon water it reveals new ways in which public entities and private companies can work together through a ppp sharing risks funding and expertise including innovative technology in 1998 sdcwa sought to develop a desalination plant and had the regulatory green light by 2008 in 2009 poseidon water was chosen as the private partner sdcwa committed to buying a minimum of 48 000 acre feet per year and possibly up to 56 000 acre feet or enough to supply 400 000 people thus reducing any future water demand risk for the private partner moreover to address citizens concerns and uncertainty the two entities agreed on the initial water price the factors that would justify price increases and an overall cap on future price increases 13 poseidon had to design finance build operate and maintain the carlsbad facility and sdcwa had the option to buy the project for 1million after 30 years poseidon would also design and build a new 10 mile pipeline to convey desalinated water to sdcwa s regional water delivery system which sdcwa would own and operate however to protect against the risk of a stranded asset under the contract poseidon could be liable for up to the full cost of the pipeline if it fell short of producing the water 13 sdcwa would reline 5 5 miles of aqueduct pipeline and make improvements to water treatment plants to accommodate desalinated water flows 13 construction was finished and operations began ahead of schedule which was helpful as california was suffering from a drought it also underscored the incentives of a ppp it is in the self interest of a private company that finances a project and bears the construction and design risk to deliver water and thus earn revenue as early as possible the carlsbad project has won the sdcwa accolades for innovation and water management at the time the carlsbad desalination plant which removes salt from water through reverse osmosis pushing water through a membrane was the most energy efficient operation in the country in addition the project involved commitments to restore coastal wetlands and the promise of carbon neutrality through offsets over the 30 year period the financing aspect task 3 of ppps has attracted scrutiny since governments that traditionally fund public projects have been eager in recent years to attract private partners as financiers as a matter of fact as hammami et al 38 point out more financially strapped countries have attracted ppps engel et al 27 worry that many ppps might be established for the wrong reasons since ppps with financing are not explicitly counted as government debt see below they can be a tool to evade the regular fiscal checks and balances engel et al 27 primarily see the advantages of ppps in how they ascertain lower costs and result in better maintained infrastructures that address a need no white elephants more generally engel et al 27 argue against ppps in the context of developing countries since they require a regulatory framework that is often absent favorable interest rates for governments or cheaper funding options may stand in the way of ppps for example municipal bonds have a favorable tax status in the united states and under the clean water act of 1971 government grants are available to construct water and wastewater treatment plants they may explain why water ppps in the united states are focused on maintenance and operations rather than on financing and ownership see 12 3 2 2 case the wrong reason for ppps while private financing allows for risk sharing between the government and the private sector engel et al 27 emphasize that governments view ppps as costless means of releasing resources from infrastructure investment to other programs in this way governments improperly use ppps to hide financial outlays from the public or to defer expenses to their successors in office 14 14 see footnote in supplementary material table 2 explains the argument for a concession that has a company build a 100 infrastructure operate it for a while and transfer ownership to the government at the end of the concession period the first column describes the traditional public provision where a government issues 100 in debt to buy a new water infrastructure over time it pays its lenders 100 in discounted terms it can do so for example by raising taxes in the second column we consider a ppp in which a private company takes out a loan under a concession builds the infrastructure and ultimately passes ownership to the government in this case the government does not initially spend 100 it saves 100 still it will use 100 in discounted tax revenue to reward the private company during the concession so it in turn can reimburse its bondholders a water project that generates its own income stream follows the same logic if the project generates 100 in revenue say through water tariffs the government could use this revenue to pay back its own debt and fully own the project in the case of a ppp the government does not have to raise taxes however it foregoes the tariff revenue and passes it on to the private company while ignoring e g the maintenance costs this example clarifies how the two cases are identical over time and why ppps should be in the official budget 3 3 private ownership of water infrastructure the most far reaching private sector involvement is full private ownership ranging from greenfield investment in a new facility to privatization when a public entity divests its infrastructure to private equity which raises funds from wealthy individuals or to a private company 15 15 see footnote in supplementary material due to water s special public dimension fully privately owned infrastructures are not common the most prominent and wide ranging private restructuring of the public water and wastewater sector happened in the united kingdom and wales in 1989 in fact now a privately owned water sector is sometimes referred to as the english model in most instances with privatization comes an independent regulator which is very much a precondition for private sector involvement 16 16 see footnote in supplementary material an independent agency should guarantee transparency and make sure that companies are not expropriated or subject to regulatory takings discretionary changes of rules and regulations in response to special interests conversely an independent regulator protects consumer interests making sure enough water is provided and at reasonable prices enforces standards and prevents regulatory capture regulation or its enforcement unduly influenced by private company interests bosio et al 5 emphasize especially the practice of such a bureaucracy as opposed to just the laws and regulations on the books by themselves better laws and regulations do not guarantee better outcomes see also 37 as bosio et al 5 put it only in countries with low public sector expertise is more regulation effective in getting better outcomes while in countries with enough public sector capacity too much regulation may inhibit the optimal exercise of bureaucratic discretion it is difficult to credibly benchmark and evaluate the privatization efforts in the united kingdom since it is almost impossible to find a proper comparison or to disentangle the effects of private ownership from those of good or bad regulation the water sector remains heavily regulated 44 existing reports and studies reveal that while prices for water users have risen in the united kingdom they are probably in line with prices in other countries there also have been compliance with eu standards and significant investments in infrastructure which have increased quality and environmental standards while utilities initially saw an increase in productivity this has not persisted and there is quite some variation in productivity across the private water companies 29 since water utilities after privatization remain natural monopolies creating competition in the water sector through privatization is difficult 23 there is consensus that the british water and wastewater industries have weak incentives for innovation perhaps private sector involvements that are more limited in scope and time than full privatization say through ppps offer better prospects for efficient behavior cost reductions risk sharing and innovation in new technologies that water utilities may not own such as desalination or water recycling note that private ownership is also prevalent in chile and to a far lesser extent in the united states 3 3 1 case aqua america and the rate of return aqua america since 2020 renamed essential utilities is the second largest publicly traded investor owned water utility in the united states that is listed on the new york stock exchange the company serves approximately 3million people across eight states with more than 53 000 water systems the u s water industry is very fragmented in the last twenty years aqua america has acquired more than 300 systems in doing so it has counted on economies of scales e g by merging billing across systems much needed water infrastructure investments u s infrastructure needs upgrading improving managerial expertise management is challenged especially in smaller systems and not least the willingness and or necessity of communities to monetize their water assets due to financial hardships or changing public expenditure priorities 17 17 see footnote in supplementary material while aqua america s heaviest footprint is in pennsylvania it has systems in other states the acquired systems are carefully vetted with regard to their future profitability from a public policy point of view they are not necessarily the systems most in need of upgrading the particular regulatory framework that specifies the price of water is critical for private sector involvement and its return on investment as noted water price regulation is in order on the one hand water utilities are natural monopolies and hence prone to reduce quantity and increase price on the other hand due to scale economies the price of water has to be larger than the marginal cost of water cost of providing the last unit of water which is lower than the average cost and hence not profitable in the united states rate of return regulation prevails it guarantees full cost recovery plus a fair return often 10 which creates an incentive to invest and upgrade 23 chapter 5 4 however this regulation does not encourage cost reduction or innovation since its benefits are passed directly on to water user private companies seek the return that comes with each new investment which allows for tariff increases while this setup biases toward investment which earns a return in the current environment of much needed upgrades this is probably not a primary concern with new investments however do come frequent water price increases 18 18 see footnote in supplementary material the u s rate of return regulation contrasts with the approach in the united kingdom and europe where an explicit cap is put on an average of the price increases across all services that the utility provides for a number of years oftentimes in step with inflation minus an efficiency factor the united states setup is thought to be more conducive to efficiency improvements and in principle to innovation if there is enough competition 69 chapter 17 ultimately the particulars determine the outcome including for example what exact cost trajectory is allowed for the time horizon and how the regulator assesses the efficiency gains in the sector 4 3 4 corporate social responsibility and impact investment even though water and water scarcity have a public dimension that in theory would call for benevolent welfare improving government investment and regulation the poor state of public infrastructure and rising water stress in many regions indicate that the government does not deliver the optimal level of the public goods the reason for this shortcoming goes beyond the traditional argument of free riding not everyone pays for public goods governments may lack the expertise or the funds or they may be corrupt and beholden to special interests alternatively in the uncertain environment of a changing climate evolving science and technological change there may simply not be a political consensus that would allow decisive action to fight water scarcity for all those reasons there is ample room for private initiatives to fight water scarcity without explicit government involvement a whole range of private activities are possible from developing and producing water efficient appliances that may reduce overall water use to fighting water scarcity as part of a company s corporate social responsibility csr and finally to full fledged social entrepreneurship entirely focused on societal and environmental objectives similarly from the angle of financial investment private sector involvement covers not only individuals buying water company shares or investing in water mutual funds but also venture capital funding for water innovations and impact investment that may be most directly linked to combating water scarcity to be explicit it is not always clear that the private voluntary initiatives or investments grouped here achieve their lofty objectives however important they are they tend to be of limited scale and scope they are an imperfect substitute for a holistic well executed government initiative based on proper regulation and cooperation with the private sector which may be desirable but not attainable because of a lack of coordination the private initiatives may even have unintended consequences investments and improvements in water saving such as drip irrigation can increase overall water use in the absence of a proper regulatory framework to the extent that initiatives in the water sphere are for profit and hinge on a return on investment a proper water price will be key here also 3 4 1 corporate social responsibility csr is a widespread business practice that refers to a company s internal or external voluntary actions to contribute to a public good and increase fairness or distributional equity see kitzmueller and shimshack 50 debaere and shimshack 18 19 19 see footnote in supplementary material to be clear complying with existing laws is not csr policy csr surpasses existing standards and laws reporting nonfinancial social and environmental activities in annual reports dates from the 1970 s and the practice grew in the 1990 s as sustainable development emerged csr covers the middle space between at one end social entrepreneurship whose main mission is a social environmental objective and at the other end companies whose products may have positive social or environmental benefits but that do not focus explicitly on such goals an example of social entrepreneurship in the water sphere is the indian company jain which is focused on bringing drip irrigation to indian farmers see 16 even if csr enhances social welfare it must be profitable to be sustained while saving properly priced water may reduce costs in many instances water conservation requires extra outlays investments therefore csr s environmental social objectives will likely have to be part of a company s profit maximizing strategy that is supported by stakeholders and shareholders 20 20 see footnote in supplementary material in an environment of perfect competition where a homogenous product like water is offered csr survives only if consumers care about the issue in this case water conservation enhanced water quality or how water is treated enough that they are willing to pay more even when that product does not easily reveal its particular treatment under imperfect competition with differentiated instead of homogenous goods csr is more easily introduced in such a setting a company s csr policy may help position or brand a product as sustainable enabling the company to target particular customers this works especially in customer facing transactions as opposed to business to business deals beverage companies like the coca cola company or nestlé may want to associate their water bottles with conservation efforts and therefore fund a wetland restoration project in a basin in which they are active or simply push internal water efficiency sometimes stakeholders other than consumers value csr it can be a form of nonmonetary compensation that helps retain employees who value working in a socially responsible company to the extent that csr improves a company s relationship with communities activists or regulators it reduces reputational and regulatory risks in addition to operational risks that investors worry about larger companies are often guided in their csr policies by ngos that keep track of societies and science s changing standards as to what is socially and environmentally acceptable with increasing water stress ngos such as the carbon disclosure project which helps financial investors and companies understand their environmental impact encourage the disclosure of metrics like companies water footprints however the quality of the water data that companies reveal is generally poor and of limited use as it is often very aggregate at the multinational level and not tied to particular locations where there may be a drought 3 4 2 case rio tinto making hay from water mining takes place in increasingly water stressed areas even though it requires a lot of water water is needed in extraction and mineral processing to suppress dust and to transport slurry after mine closings the danger of runoff and seepage of contaminated water remains rio tinto is a multinational mining company headquartered in london in 2012 the company planned to expand its activities in australia s arid pilbara region with below the water table mining which presented challenges of excess water dewatering the mine while dealing with falling groundwater pressure and possible contamination due to inter aquifer leakage see debaere 13 rio tinto needed only 2 5 to 7 megaliters ml of water per day for its operations but it had more water to dispose of its hydrologists and engineers designed an ambitious plan that they hoped would be a template for the future the proposal which was approved by local authorities was to use existing pipelines to supply up to 18 ml of surplus water per day to the nearby town of tom price and reinject 12 ml per day into a nearby aquifer whose level was receding the company would accommodate another surplus of 40 ml in winter to 120 ml in summer by growing hay on idle property in the area since crops consume vast amounts of water in addition the company planned a buffer dam and had license to discharge water in a nearby creek in case of emergency rio tinto s ambitious plan blurred the line between csr and government policy the local government did not have the expertise to help rio tinto design its plan the company worked closely with the authorities to get its plans approved since obtaining a mining permit was a precondition for its operations at the same time the proposal aimed to create goodwill in the local communities by injecting water into a depressed aquifer and providing water to a nearby town rio tinto also hoped to strengthen its reputation as a sophisticated mining company with deep hydrological knowledge to attract high skilled workers note that a recent scandal involving rio tinto underscores how csr can never be a substitute for good policies 21 21 see footnote in supplementary material 3 4 3 impact investing with increased water stress there is growing interest in financial investment in water while some mutual funds market themselves as water funds and seek private resources for portfolios of securities from water related companies it is not always clear which if any sustainable objectives they achieve especially objectives that specifically fight water scarcity the criteria for inclusion in a water mutual fund are often vague for example a certain percentage of company revenue from water related business and varied moreover since preexisting securities are bought no new physical investment is made at the margin the financial investment helps companies raise capital more easily in the future the case of venture capital investments differs slightly from mutual funds venture capital firms tend to fund risky early stage water technologies and thus make available new resources that otherwise are not so easily tapped into 3 at the same time how the new technology eventually alleviates water stress may not yet be clear leaving some uncertainty as to what water objective will be achieved impact investment tends to be more focused and specifically geared toward environmentally beneficial projects in addition it directly affects the amount of funding when it unlocks private capital for environmentally and socially beneficial projects that tend to be without private financiers impact investing is a relatively recent term that refers to actions by investors seeking both a private return and a social impact and in some instances a private return below the market return 46 in the water sphere impact investing predominantly covers the acquisition of real assets like real estate or water rights water related impact investment tends to be relatively small compared to climate change and food related investments 57 recent additions to impact investments are green bonds water blue bonds and pay for success bonds all those relatively new instruments hinge on proper certification to ensure that the professed goals are indeed attained 3 4 4 case the nature conservancy australia fund the nature conservancy tnc is one of the largest conservation organizations in the world and the second largest private landowner in the united states see debaere and richter 15 tnc has gradually adapted how it fulfills its mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends as an increasingly global nonprofit organization tnc has gone beyond setting aside critical lands and habitats to addressing wider areas and protecting freshwater ecosystems and species including advocating for sustainable water management practices in 2016 its impact investment unit naturevest along with the murray darling wetlands working group launched an impact investment fund called the australian balanced water fund in the wake of the great recession tnc sought to leverage more funds for environmental purposes as acquiring water is expensive and focused on australia s water markets there are more than 30 000 individual wetland areas scattered across the murray darling basin and tnc sought to protect a portfolio of treasured wetlands and secure water to flood them tnc raised private funds to buy permanent water rights for its trust it would lease the majority of those funds short term and earn a return with which to pay its investors a fraction of the permanent rights would not be leased but used instead to flood wetlands the beauty of the plan was that wetlands have to be watered only once every few years which could presumably happen in wetter periods when water is less scarce and its price not so high by investing in permanent water rights investors earned a private return somewhat under the market return while at the same time making it possible to flood wetlands in an arid area the hope was that the water fund would fit tnc s theory of change and act as a pilot to demonstrate the wider applicability of the approach 4 conclusion in this article we have offered an economic perspective on many potential roles that the private sector can play in securing water there are many different ways in which the private and the public sector can work together too often the discussion about the provision of water is phrased in terms of a simple dichotomy between fully public and fully private initiatives similarly too often we assume that what is desirable is also feasible as water scarcity and water stress are increasing and as the current water provision in some places is failing it may be worthwhile to reconsider or enrich some of the existing institutional setups even though the very nature of water and the particular cost structure of water infrastructure have traditionally accounted for the outsize role of public institutions in providing water security a fresh look reveals a much more complex and nuanced role for the private sector in interaction with the public sector not all stages of the water supply network suggest increasing returns and natural monopolies hence some stages may benefit from more competition and increased efficiency especially when they are not operating properly contract theory shows that social and environmental objectives do not necessarily require public ownership operation of the water infrastructures at all times which opens the door for a whole range of partnerships between the public and private sectors here again especially when the current institutions are not functioning optimally as evidenced by water scarcity or lacking water quality it may be advisable to consider other institutional setups it is increasingly clear that the interactions between the sectors are complex and unique they depend on the specifics of the cooperation and the specifics of the existing institutional and societal context in the end the incentives for both private companies and governments determine the success of their cooperation one size does not fit all calling for private involvement purely to evade fiscal checks and balances is not advisable nor is having private companies assume public roles in the absence of a regulatory framework at the same time harnessing private sector r d technical knowledge and innovation may require more than just arms length transactions and may motivate longer term contracts with shared risk and temporary ownership private sector involvement is no deus ex machina however its operation will hinge on an independent regulatory authority and the particular ways in which competent bureaucracies engage the private sector remain critically important for this reason alone private sector involvement should perhaps not be the go to solution in less advanced countries it bears repeating that a critical factor that will determine the ability of the private sector to engage the public sector is its return on investment the fact that there is a growing acknowledgment that water prices worldwide tend to be too low and that solving water crises will also involve pricing properly opens the door for more private sector involvement in the end the price of water is a key determinant of its return on investment we encourage a pragmatic approach there is no size that fits all and what is desirable may not be feasible csr does not trump good policy but in the absence of societal agreements on better policies they may be a worthwhile alternative the same is true for impact investment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10

20122,water scarcity is increasing across the globe we discuss how the private sector and private investment can assist in the fight against water scarcity especially in advanced and middle income economies we first lay out from an economic perspective why local regional and national governments have traditionally played an outsized role in providing water security we next describe a whole set of possible roles for the private sector ranging from a fully privatized water sector to more limited public private partnerships ppps corporate social responsibility csr and impact investment that may take place independent of the public sector the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of an argument for greater private involvement emerge from reassessing the traditional view of the water sector as a natural monopoly with increasing returns to scale as well as from contract theory that emphasizes how carefully written contracts imply control but do not require public ownership at all times rising water scarcity and water infrastructures badly in need of an upgrade in many places point to public institutions and societies not meeting the social and environmental challenge which opens the door for private initiatives in the form of corporate social responsibility and impact investing keywords water scarcity contract theory natural monopoly public good water infrastructure 1 introduction water scarcity is a growing concern due to a changing climate an ever growing world population and world economy and changing diets while water scarcity has many facets indicators of water stress and shortage highlight the environmental and social dimensions that are our focus 52 49 1 1 see footnote in supplementary material water stress captures the lower levels of major aquifers 60 the depletion of rivers that may no longer reach the oceans 6 and the diminished environmental flows that adversely affect water quality ecosystems services and aquatic life 61 water shortage measures on the other hand reveal decreasing water availability per person and signal a lack of access to water for basic human needs 2 2 see footnote in supplementary material ownership and investment figures underscore that ensuring water security and providing and regulating water have been the purview of the public sector in recent history 23 a 2011 worldwide survey of the water services of 330 major cities reveals that 85 were publicly owned and publicly run see gwi 32 in terms of investment private sector involvement in the water sector is also limited certainly more so than for other public services burger and hawkesworth 7 surveyed mostly oecd countries and found that for nine of them only 5 or less of their public infrastructure investment spending since 1985 was private for seven it was up to 10 and for only four countries was it higher of this private investment in infrastructure typically 10 went to the water sector see table 1 and 38 there is however a growing interest in more private sector involvement and investment this reflects the need to adapt and innovate in light of climate change and increased water scarcity evolving societal views on pressing environmental and social questions and the private sector s growing role in other critical network infrastructures such as gas electricity transportation and telecommunication also fueling the interest is the current state of the public water infrastructure which in many places badly needs an upgrade and the realization that government entities can be beholden to special interests rather than focused on the public interest 66 finally budgetary shortfalls motivate the call for private investment 27 to be clear however the interest in more private sector involvement is not universal in france for example there has been a push to remunicipalize water utilities and right2water is a european citizens initiative to keep water services in public hands 3 3 see footnote in supplementary material using economic theory as a guide we suggest where private sector involvement in the water supply chain may help and complement government actions and where its benefits are less obvious we choose this angle since debates about private sector involvement are sometimes informed by ideology and insufficient systematic empirical evidence is available to assess its overall effectiveness whenever possible we refer to cases and the emerging empirical literature see 53 we primarily focus on the for profit private sector in advanced and middle income countries we first lay out why governments have been traditionally favored and why governments overwhelmingly own the entire water supply chain we spell out the economic characteristics of water the cost structure of public water provision and the economic conditions necessary to successfully combat water scarcity all of which call for a coordinating entity such as the government from an economic point of view involving the private sector typically stems from the desire to harness its efficiency and flexibility as well as expertise and innovation that follow from competition the private sector may well be ready to play a more active role in fighting water scarcity in advanced and middle income economies because of the reassessment of the role of the price of water a more realistic water price is not only an essential component of any credible strategy to fight water scarcity but also a critical precondition for private sector involvement private sector involvement hinges upon a realistic return on investment for which more realistic water prices are necessary similarly institutional and policy clarity and an independent regulatory entity that minimizes the possibility of regulatory takings or expropriation are key to guarantee a return on investment as well as to enforce proper conduct by private companies such a setting tends to be available in more advanced economies as a matter of fact engel et al 27 leigland 53 and kumar 51 question the effectiveness of public private partnerships in lower income countries and discourage them there as we lay out the role for the private sector we first ask which components of the long supply chain are more amenable to competition and hence to private involvement we next turn to the lessons of contract theory that provide a nuanced view of private sector involvement between the extremes of a fully public and entirely private water sector we identify a whole range of partnership options between governments and companies or nongovernmental organizations ngos in addition we describe private initiatives geared toward fighting the social and environmental dimension of water scarcity despite or independent of government activity they relate to corporate social responsibility and from the financial investment side impact investment in this article we focus especially on the water sector even though water scarcity often originates outside that sector without a direct link to water policies consider the remarkable path of water use in the united states since the 1970s in spite of a tripling of real gross domestic product gdp since the 1970s overall water use has not increased a key factor behind this water neutral growth is structural change the share in gdp of services whose average productivity of water is much higher than that of agriculture has steadily increased whereas that of agriculture and manufacturing has shrunk this shift has raised overall water productivity and limited water use in spite of economic growth see 19 to be clear the structural change is primarily driven by capital accumulation and technological change and affected only marginally if at all by water and water policy in other words however important governmental and private involvement are in the water sector a holistic approach to fighting water scarcity across all sectors is essential 2 governments role in fighting water scarcity to understand the dominant role of the public sector and how to position the private sector we first consider the economic characteristics of water the cost structure of water infrastructure and three critical dimensions that garrick et al 31 identify in the fight against water scarcity 2 1 economic characteristics of water water is a complex good with many overlapping uses 39 when we drink a bottle of water the benefits are entirely private and hence distribution is best organized through markets with a specific price for water many properties of water are however non rival my use does not reduce yours and non exclusionary when water is left in situ for all people to enjoy or as an aquatic habitat it functions like a public good 4 4 see footnote in supplementary material because of this public good dimension coordination and rules need to guarantee water s continued availability and shield at least some water from private ownership this coordinating role tends to fall on local regional or central governments water also moves with gravity and returns to the environment after its use after irrigation water seeps into the soil or flows to a river and is prone to create positive or negative externalities for others as its quantity or quality is altered in such instances the social and private costs and benefits of water may differ and coordination is again called for 5 5 see footnote in supplementary material 11 ostrom 59 has documented how community traditions may preserve and regulate natural resources because of the many stakeholders in modern societies decentralized coordination is difficult and costly and the role of water s arbitrator falls on the government moreover because water is intimately linked to public health equity and all economic activity its infrastructure is critical and so government intervention is warranted it is in everybody s interest to avoid an outbreak of waterborne diseases a breakdown in the water supply or a threat to a region s water security 2 2 cost structure of water infrastructure the particular cost structure of water supply limits competition and invites government intervention water is heavy and local water infrastructures are elaborate long lived and capital intensive in the united states for example the water industry is more than twice as capital intensive value of assets relative to annual revenue as the telecommunications and electricity sector 55 dams reservoirs distribution nets of canals and pumping stations are needed when ground or surface water is not readily available supplying residents and businesses with drinking water requires a network infrastructure that is intermediated by utilities and includes abstraction of ground and surface water or ocean water in the case of desalination mains and pumping stations and treatment plants where contaminants and pollutants are removed after treatment water is stored in reservoirs and service lines deliver metered water to retail or bulk users the wastewater cycle then collects used water sewage and trade effluent from sewers drains and manholes and transports it to treatment plants where solids are separated from effluent that is released into the environment or reenters the water supply through recycling as for the sludge it is incinerated deposited in landfills or mined for biological properties the high upfront costs of such elaborate network infrastructures and the low marginal costs of providing water once the structures are in place suggest economies of scale long term rates of return and decreasing average costs as more water is supplied over time the large fixed costs are spread over more users 68 chapter 6 not only are high upfront costs an impediment to entry but to exploit scale economies local regional or central governments may be inclined to centralize and limit entry which turns the water sector into a natural monopoly par excellence that leaves consumers with few options this monopoly position calls for proper pricing regulation in order to make sure that enough water is provided at reasonable prices this regulated price is typically a function of the average costs companies face to make sure the water operation is viable and covers total cost the price regulation is put in place to counterbalance two forces on the one hand because of their monopoly positions water utilities are inclined to use their market power and charge too high a price on the other hand the price of water has to be higher than the marginal cost the cost of the last liter produced is lower than the average cost due to increasing returns to be profitable the aqua america case below will discuss current water price regulation 6 6 see footnote in supplementary material 2 3 key aspects of fighting water scarcity if water abundance implies there is sufficient water for all uses and the environment water scarcity indicates too much demand for the available supply because water has an open access dimension overuse may trigger the tragedy of the commons 40 hence fighting water scarcity requires at least three major actions limiting use to match the sustainable water supply pricing water properly and massively investing in water infrastructure see 31 in a situation of scarcity it is desirable that all private and public sources of water be metered and accounted for which only a few countries e g singapore and israel manage ideally the sum of water property rights and permits is equal to the sustainable water use see debaere et al 17 the crudest way to limit use is to apply command and control assign water to all users and the environment and then reduce everybody s use by a preestablished metric in case of scarcity because of water s public dimension some command and control measures are inevitable relying only on them however is not desirable from an economic point of view they are prone to inefficiency and may not provide water to those who can use it most effectively instead they may provide water to the most politically connected or they may impose similar restrictions on wasteful and efficient users an essential component of any successful program to fight water scarcity is a more realistic price for obtaining water permits or for water from the tap water prices worldwide tend to be too low see 64 25 even in very arid saudi arabia water has been virtually free for a long time see 14 a realistic water price limits demand can rectify the mismatch between supply and demand discourages waste and incentivizes saving it also ensures a more efficient allocation for the water in private hands as only those activities are undertaken that warrant the cost price of water the add on effects of proper water pricing are essential for private sector involvement a price of water not only encourages water saving it also makes investing in water saving technology irrigation systems appliances etc or alternative water supplies recycling or desalination worthwhile and guarantees a rate of return for private investment in addition a realistic price encourages innovation which lags behind other sectors because of the historically low price of water see ajami et al 2 8 in the same way that determining and enforcing a sustainable level is not trivial neither is pricing water particular care is in order when regulating the water price utilities charge improper pricing is at the heart of many challenges to water infrastructure when it is in public hands as well due to low water rates for example revenues for water utilities are often not sufficient to maintain the water infrastructure let alone upgrade it at the same time as noted water utilities are natural monopolies and when left to their own devices they would be inclined to charge too high a price and provide too little water as in the aqua america case below note also that there are many water pricing schemes possible and that charging a higher price does not necessarily mean limiting access to water for example a public utility can make liters available for consumption or hygiene to everyone for free and price water for use beyond the initial level alternatively it could specifically target those with lesser means finally the sheer size of the financial challenge of fighting water scarcity puts it in the purview of the government to make effective progress across the globe it is necessary to decrease water losses increase water quality build reservoirs and dams ensure better storage of water and bring online desalination and recycling facilities in addition funds may be needed to buy back water rights or permits estimates vary but to meet the united nations sustainable development goal of access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030 some scholars estimate 1 7 trillion is needed 48 3 the role of private investment in fighting water scarcity the dominance of governments in the water sector does not mean that there is no room for private initiatives especially as infrastructure investments tend to be determined by tradition and history 58 we first revisit the natural monopoly argument and describe the parts of the water supply network that are potentially open for private investment from an economic point of view next we consider water provision from the angle of recent developments in contract theory we finally focus on private initiatives such as corporate social responsibility and impact investing that sometimes operate in spite of government actions 3 1 breaking up the water supply chain even though water infrastructures are considered natural monopolies it is an open question whether economies of scale apply to their entire supply chain including extraction treatment distribution and discharge 9 1 it is also not clear that there are economies of scope or that combining all stages in one vertically integrated entity necessarily reduces average costs in the absence of economies of scope and scale for all components however there is less need for a monopoly vertical integration or for that matter centralization and there should be room for more entry and competition hence the provision of water may well be more complex than the simple dichotomy of all private or all public while there is little doubt that huge sunk costs for mains and pipes result in scale economies it is not clear that they are present in water extraction 23 chap 11 limited entry in water extraction likely stems from concerns that too much water could be withdrawn tragedy of the commons rather than from scale economies as water markets illustrate however there are ways to open up extraction to competition while honoring water use limits this requires a well defined system of permits and rights and an overall cap water markets are after all cap and trade systems in water markets private buyers and sellers exchange the right to use water at prices determined by supply and demand see chong and sunding 10 grafton et al 33 easter and huang 26 and debaere et al 17 a farmer may be willing to sell water to a buyer who employs water more productively and hence can pay a higher price than what the farmer s own use justifies in such a scenario water markets would allocate water more productively leading to higher value crop production while markets flexibility and decentralized allocation are treasured in an uncertain world it is important to note that they are complex in order for these markets to function properly it is necessary to satisfy conditions that limit asymmetric information and transaction costs and that ensure good governance and enforcement see debaere 20 and debaere and li 21 markets also evolve with changes in human behavior in response to price incentives growth in scientific understanding and changes in the sociopolitical context including especially questions of equity and trade offs between agriculture and cities an important advantage of water trading at the upstream extraction stage is that it forces a realistic water price on all downstream private activities and as such may help fight water scarcity as noted a realistic price is an essential precondition for private sector involvement because it provides an incentive a return on investment that will attract private investment and innovation 7 7 see footnote in supplementary material water markets also open a window of opportunity for water saving beyond the cap imposed by the government as in csr and impact investment note that while organizing a full fledged water market may not be politically or logistically feasible more limited bilateral trading is also possible for example along the colorado river well off cities such as san diego have struck generous deals with farming communities in which the cities pay farmers to save water through fallowing such programs limit water use transfer water to more productive city uses and shift agricultural production toward more valuable and less wasteful crops see 63 next to water extraction economics of scale of other components in the supply chain are not obvious take the treatment of water and wastewater 23 for smaller water and wastewater treatment units at the level of a household or a cluster of buildings for example there may be diseconomies of scale beyond a certain level of output as sedlak 65 argues these diseconomies allow for more decentralized water provision and such local treatment facilities could help overcome people s reluctance to drink treated sewage water or offer an incentive to use recycled water for non potable water uses in principle the absence of economies of scale opens the door to competition among treatment operators and this competition could harness private sector innovation along the same line is the push for sewage mining in water scarce countries such as australia while a lawsuit that tried to open wastewater lines to third parties in the same way that at t gave competitors access to its infrastructure has not been adopted around the world it does illustrate how water scarce countries realize they cannot waste a drop of water they are looking for ways to foster competition risk taking and innovation in the water infrastructure that has typically been publicly owned and publicly managed 3 1 1 case water markets in the murray darling basin australia s markets in the murray darling basin and the efforts to cap overall water use in the wake of the millennium drought have received ample attention for a short history see national water commission 56 for good overviews see grafton et al 33 wheeler et al 71 and tisdell 70 for a discussion of the big dry see herberger 45 see also richter 62 garrick 30 and most recently horne and grafton 47 australia is the driest continent in terms of precipitation per hectare its breadbasket the murray darling basin extends over more than a million square kilometers while covering southern and eastern states unlike the united states australia has a nonpriority permitting system at the discretion of the government that is open to non riparian users see 70 water rights can be traded independently of the land title and are defined in terms of a fraction of the available water not as an absolute volume of water the murray darling basin is where 80 or 90 of water trading takes place amounting to 2billion australian dollars in 2018 19 waterfind 2019 australian water markets annual report the water markets of the murray darling basin across state territory boundaries by the 1980s it was clear that australia s surface and groundwater systems were overdeveloped 71 in the first phase of the water markets 1980 94 water and land rights were legally separated trading took off in the mid 1990s and grew throughout the second phase 1994 2007 and third phase after 2007 with continued efforts to integrate water markets across states bring in urban centers improve logistics lower trading costs and emphasize sustainable development there has been some contention over how to reduce the outstanding water rights it has been difficult to have all states agree under the murray darling basin plan to a sustainable cap on water use that meets environmental needs underscoring how essential a societal consensus for water reforms is young 72 has stressed that it is best to have a water abstraction regime with an agreed upon cap and generous water allocations for the environment in place before trading takes off while this is preferable it may not be feasible water markets change people s incentives in unexpected ways and the dynamics between cities and agriculture can change 34 agricultural communities in victoria for example opposed the use of a water pipeline to melbourne after it had been built at considerable expense with increased urbanization and the average and likely also marginal value of water in industry and services higher than in agriculture theory predicts that rich cities will acquire farmers water such potential inter sectoral transfers stoke fears that agricultural communities will disappear and that remaining irrigators will face higher irrigation infrastructure costs the stranded assets phenomenon in this context financial transfer to farmers may be necessary to get their buy in with water management reforms in the end a region s particular political economy plays a key role in whether water markets materialize and how horne and grafton 47 point out that the access of indigenous communities is an important and as of yet unresolved issue 3 2 public private partnerships water infrastructure through the lens of contracting water infrastructures are long lived and their installation often predates contract theory which recasts governments involvement in the economy in a more business friendly role while the public dimension of water the cost structure of its infrastructure and the fight against water scarcity all call for the public sector to play a key role contract theory s main insight is that public control does not imply public ownership all the time because a government can write contracts as long as there is an independent regulatory agency to oversee how the private entity executes the private government contract a government does not need to own the infrastructure to achieve social and environmental objectives it can incorporate provisions for underprivileged communities in the contract it invites companies to bid on see 66 or it can specify the water quality levels it desires and how to test for it contracting and competition open the door for the private sector and invite reforms of the public sector 69 chapter 17 in extreme cases they make full fledged private ownership possible as in england scotland and wales see below more often contracts pave the way for a whole array of more limited private participations that may well be more effective than 100 privatization arguments in favor of more limited private sector involvement stem from the realization that contracts are incomplete because of the long term nature of water infrastructure extending beyond the political cycle it is impossible to specify all details contingencies and changing circumstances which may make these contracts less attractive to both the government and the private sector especially when large costs have to be sunk up front see grossman and hart 35 and hart and moore 41 8 8 see footnote in supplementary material also questions about the effectiveness of courts to litigate complex contracts 67 may limit the appetite for private sector involvement as well as for governments who may see increase the cost of preparing projects with private involvement increase 53 finally the ultimately asymmetric nature of the cooperation can play a role in the end the public entity sets the rules and can also change the rules see ménard 54 public private partnerships or ppps are fashionable labels for more limited forms of public private engagement these partnerships involve relatively long term contracts between the government and the private sector in which governments share some of their decision making authority and property rights with private companies which receive as compensation for the duration of the contract an income stream and often temporary ownership of the assets ppps thus go beyond a supplier model where governments just buy from the market what they need but they stop short of an enterprise model where the government produces the goods or services without private involvement ppps define the roles of both parties with regard to the basic tasks necessary to provide any good or service 22 task 1 defining and designing a project task 2 financing the capital cost of a project task 3 building or repairing a project task 4 operating and maintaining the asset in order to deliver the product service to be explicit in the end the particular incentives on the part of the government and the private sector as they relate to the specific task will be critical for the success of ppps governments have long engaged the private sector in more ways than just purchasing its goods and services they have often contracted out especially task 3 when building or repairing bridges or water treatment stations for example they have specified what they wished to acquire collected bids and selected a winner and at their core ppps are a way of contracting out while at the same time bundling multiple tasks 9 9 see footnote in supplementary material note that as tasks are transferred to private partners in the bundling process public authorities usually keep control over key decisions in our delineation of ppps the infrastructure asset ultimately remains in public hands even when private partners make significant investments the asset eventually returns to the government when the infrastructure remains in private hands we label this private ownership and discuss it in the next section the flaws of publicly provided goods are well known there are pork barrel projects undertaken to benefit certain representatives and local districts white elephants impractical expensive projects and public goods that suffer substandard maintenance and low quality of service in the case of water the poor quality and insufficient maintenance of the infrastructure has attracted much attention although expensive desalination plants that stand idle after construction are worth considering as well in theory ppps should reduce costs increase the quality of service and harness innovation the private sector is believed to deliver those benefits because of ex ante competition in the bidding process as opposed to ex post competition in which only one private supplier wins the contract and provides the service see 24 incentives are key they make sure risks are allocated to the entity that can best handle them according to that entity s expertise for example a government may not build enough 10 10 see footnote in supplementary material moreover in the specific case of water private involvement and less political interference may lead to a more realistic price for water as companies need to cover their costs and fund maintenance and innovation through water revenue note that the fine print of how contracts are specifically set up matters for their success incomplete contracts may result in inefficient outcomes after initial investments new contingencies may arise that cannot be recuperated which may lead to renegotiations and terms different from those initially envisioned in the ppp and there is evidence of early and extensive negotiations see engel et al 27 guasch et al 36 guasch and straub 37 and leigland 53 11 11 see footnote in supplementary material when contracts cannot be fully specified concerns arise that companies desires to minimize costs may reduce quality in other words the private sector may cut corners to reduce costs see 42 it is here that bundling tasks in ppps can provide a solution by combining building task 3 or designing task 1 with service and maintenance task 4 private companies have an incentive to build in ways that minimize the lifetime maintenance costs 43 of course if performance standards are observable they can be included in the contract to solve the quality problem needless to say with piping and mains underground and not smart it is hard to carefully monitor all components of the water infrastructure financing task 2 and building task 3 may also be complementary having the private sector finance a project before transferring it to the government shifts the construction risk and any costs associated with delays to the private sector since the private sector is in charge of building it is in the best position to flexibly respond to incentives cost of borrowing hence combining financing and construction makes for speedier projects and fewer delays many combinations of tasks are possible in ppps according to the world bank long term concessions are common in the water sector these include especially rehabilitate operate transfer rot rehabilitate lease rent transfer rlrt and build rehabilitate operate transfer brot concessions among advanced economies europe leads the united states in the use of ppps france home to major water multinationals commonly uses long term concessions 12 12 see footnote in supplementary material in some instances such as the carlsbad build finance operate bfo of a desalination plant discussed below the asset transfer to the government at the end can be optional in one of the few systematic empirical studies of ppps engel et al 27 emphasize that ppps save maintenance costs which speaks to the water sector and its poor maintenance private companies tend to continuously maintain operations thereby avoiding the massive repair costs of delayed maintenance that are characteristic of the public sector what drives this favorable behavior is the eventual transfer of the assets to the government as well as the steady income stream typically water user fees that pays for private involvement fees directed toward a private company generate expectations of maintenance and quality to be explicit these user fees are companies return on investment in the particular case of the water sector however unlike electricity and telecommunications where cost effective tariffs are more common subsidies may still be necessary in ppps or renegotiated ppps if customers expect low water tariffs see leigland 53 engel et al 27 emphasize another advantage of having user fees pay for private involvement they weed out white elephants or wasteful projects without real use that would not generate sufficient income because private companies will not agree to them 3 2 1 case carlsbad desalination plant san diego county lies in the semiarid southwest of the united states it is home to the largest desalination plant in the western hemisphere 13 13 see footnote in supplementary material building the plant was an attempt to secure a steady water supply and fight water stress in an area that imported 85 of its water supply the carlsbad desalination plant was a cooperation between the san diego water authority sdcwa and poseidon water it reveals new ways in which public entities and private companies can work together through a ppp sharing risks funding and expertise including innovative technology in 1998 sdcwa sought to develop a desalination plant and had the regulatory green light by 2008 in 2009 poseidon water was chosen as the private partner sdcwa committed to buying a minimum of 48 000 acre feet per year and possibly up to 56 000 acre feet or enough to supply 400 000 people thus reducing any future water demand risk for the private partner moreover to address citizens concerns and uncertainty the two entities agreed on the initial water price the factors that would justify price increases and an overall cap on future price increases 13 poseidon had to design finance build operate and maintain the carlsbad facility and sdcwa had the option to buy the project for 1million after 30 years poseidon would also design and build a new 10 mile pipeline to convey desalinated water to sdcwa s regional water delivery system which sdcwa would own and operate however to protect against the risk of a stranded asset under the contract poseidon could be liable for up to the full cost of the pipeline if it fell short of producing the water 13 sdcwa would reline 5 5 miles of aqueduct pipeline and make improvements to water treatment plants to accommodate desalinated water flows 13 construction was finished and operations began ahead of schedule which was helpful as california was suffering from a drought it also underscored the incentives of a ppp it is in the self interest of a private company that finances a project and bears the construction and design risk to deliver water and thus earn revenue as early as possible the carlsbad project has won the sdcwa accolades for innovation and water management at the time the carlsbad desalination plant which removes salt from water through reverse osmosis pushing water through a membrane was the most energy efficient operation in the country in addition the project involved commitments to restore coastal wetlands and the promise of carbon neutrality through offsets over the 30 year period the financing aspect task 3 of ppps has attracted scrutiny since governments that traditionally fund public projects have been eager in recent years to attract private partners as financiers as a matter of fact as hammami et al 38 point out more financially strapped countries have attracted ppps engel et al 27 worry that many ppps might be established for the wrong reasons since ppps with financing are not explicitly counted as government debt see below they can be a tool to evade the regular fiscal checks and balances engel et al 27 primarily see the advantages of ppps in how they ascertain lower costs and result in better maintained infrastructures that address a need no white elephants more generally engel et al 27 argue against ppps in the context of developing countries since they require a regulatory framework that is often absent favorable interest rates for governments or cheaper funding options may stand in the way of ppps for example municipal bonds have a favorable tax status in the united states and under the clean water act of 1971 government grants are available to construct water and wastewater treatment plants they may explain why water ppps in the united states are focused on maintenance and operations rather than on financing and ownership see 12 3 2 2 case the wrong reason for ppps while private financing allows for risk sharing between the government and the private sector engel et al 27 emphasize that governments view ppps as costless means of releasing resources from infrastructure investment to other programs in this way governments improperly use ppps to hide financial outlays from the public or to defer expenses to their successors in office 14 14 see footnote in supplementary material table 2 explains the argument for a concession that has a company build a 100 infrastructure operate it for a while and transfer ownership to the government at the end of the concession period the first column describes the traditional public provision where a government issues 100 in debt to buy a new water infrastructure over time it pays its lenders 100 in discounted terms it can do so for example by raising taxes in the second column we consider a ppp in which a private company takes out a loan under a concession builds the infrastructure and ultimately passes ownership to the government in this case the government does not initially spend 100 it saves 100 still it will use 100 in discounted tax revenue to reward the private company during the concession so it in turn can reimburse its bondholders a water project that generates its own income stream follows the same logic if the project generates 100 in revenue say through water tariffs the government could use this revenue to pay back its own debt and fully own the project in the case of a ppp the government does not have to raise taxes however it foregoes the tariff revenue and passes it on to the private company while ignoring e g the maintenance costs this example clarifies how the two cases are identical over time and why ppps should be in the official budget 3 3 private ownership of water infrastructure the most far reaching private sector involvement is full private ownership ranging from greenfield investment in a new facility to privatization when a public entity divests its infrastructure to private equity which raises funds from wealthy individuals or to a private company 15 15 see footnote in supplementary material due to water s special public dimension fully privately owned infrastructures are not common the most prominent and wide ranging private restructuring of the public water and wastewater sector happened in the united kingdom and wales in 1989 in fact now a privately owned water sector is sometimes referred to as the english model in most instances with privatization comes an independent regulator which is very much a precondition for private sector involvement 16 16 see footnote in supplementary material an independent agency should guarantee transparency and make sure that companies are not expropriated or subject to regulatory takings discretionary changes of rules and regulations in response to special interests conversely an independent regulator protects consumer interests making sure enough water is provided and at reasonable prices enforces standards and prevents regulatory capture regulation or its enforcement unduly influenced by private company interests bosio et al 5 emphasize especially the practice of such a bureaucracy as opposed to just the laws and regulations on the books by themselves better laws and regulations do not guarantee better outcomes see also 37 as bosio et al 5 put it only in countries with low public sector expertise is more regulation effective in getting better outcomes while in countries with enough public sector capacity too much regulation may inhibit the optimal exercise of bureaucratic discretion it is difficult to credibly benchmark and evaluate the privatization efforts in the united kingdom since it is almost impossible to find a proper comparison or to disentangle the effects of private ownership from those of good or bad regulation the water sector remains heavily regulated 44 existing reports and studies reveal that while prices for water users have risen in the united kingdom they are probably in line with prices in other countries there also have been compliance with eu standards and significant investments in infrastructure which have increased quality and environmental standards while utilities initially saw an increase in productivity this has not persisted and there is quite some variation in productivity across the private water companies 29 since water utilities after privatization remain natural monopolies creating competition in the water sector through privatization is difficult 23 there is consensus that the british water and wastewater industries have weak incentives for innovation perhaps private sector involvements that are more limited in scope and time than full privatization say through ppps offer better prospects for efficient behavior cost reductions risk sharing and innovation in new technologies that water utilities may not own such as desalination or water recycling note that private ownership is also prevalent in chile and to a far lesser extent in the united states 3 3 1 case aqua america and the rate of return aqua america since 2020 renamed essential utilities is the second largest publicly traded investor owned water utility in the united states that is listed on the new york stock exchange the company serves approximately 3million people across eight states with more than 53 000 water systems the u s water industry is very fragmented in the last twenty years aqua america has acquired more than 300 systems in doing so it has counted on economies of scales e g by merging billing across systems much needed water infrastructure investments u s infrastructure needs upgrading improving managerial expertise management is challenged especially in smaller systems and not least the willingness and or necessity of communities to monetize their water assets due to financial hardships or changing public expenditure priorities 17 17 see footnote in supplementary material while aqua america s heaviest footprint is in pennsylvania it has systems in other states the acquired systems are carefully vetted with regard to their future profitability from a public policy point of view they are not necessarily the systems most in need of upgrading the particular regulatory framework that specifies the price of water is critical for private sector involvement and its return on investment as noted water price regulation is in order on the one hand water utilities are natural monopolies and hence prone to reduce quantity and increase price on the other hand due to scale economies the price of water has to be larger than the marginal cost of water cost of providing the last unit of water which is lower than the average cost and hence not profitable in the united states rate of return regulation prevails it guarantees full cost recovery plus a fair return often 10 which creates an incentive to invest and upgrade 23 chapter 5 4 however this regulation does not encourage cost reduction or innovation since its benefits are passed directly on to water user private companies seek the return that comes with each new investment which allows for tariff increases while this setup biases toward investment which earns a return in the current environment of much needed upgrades this is probably not a primary concern with new investments however do come frequent water price increases 18 18 see footnote in supplementary material the u s rate of return regulation contrasts with the approach in the united kingdom and europe where an explicit cap is put on an average of the price increases across all services that the utility provides for a number of years oftentimes in step with inflation minus an efficiency factor the united states setup is thought to be more conducive to efficiency improvements and in principle to innovation if there is enough competition 69 chapter 17 ultimately the particulars determine the outcome including for example what exact cost trajectory is allowed for the time horizon and how the regulator assesses the efficiency gains in the sector 4 3 4 corporate social responsibility and impact investment even though water and water scarcity have a public dimension that in theory would call for benevolent welfare improving government investment and regulation the poor state of public infrastructure and rising water stress in many regions indicate that the government does not deliver the optimal level of the public goods the reason for this shortcoming goes beyond the traditional argument of free riding not everyone pays for public goods governments may lack the expertise or the funds or they may be corrupt and beholden to special interests alternatively in the uncertain environment of a changing climate evolving science and technological change there may simply not be a political consensus that would allow decisive action to fight water scarcity for all those reasons there is ample room for private initiatives to fight water scarcity without explicit government involvement a whole range of private activities are possible from developing and producing water efficient appliances that may reduce overall water use to fighting water scarcity as part of a company s corporate social responsibility csr and finally to full fledged social entrepreneurship entirely focused on societal and environmental objectives similarly from the angle of financial investment private sector involvement covers not only individuals buying water company shares or investing in water mutual funds but also venture capital funding for water innovations and impact investment that may be most directly linked to combating water scarcity to be explicit it is not always clear that the private voluntary initiatives or investments grouped here achieve their lofty objectives however important they are they tend to be of limited scale and scope they are an imperfect substitute for a holistic well executed government initiative based on proper regulation and cooperation with the private sector which may be desirable but not attainable because of a lack of coordination the private initiatives may even have unintended consequences investments and improvements in water saving such as drip irrigation can increase overall water use in the absence of a proper regulatory framework to the extent that initiatives in the water sphere are for profit and hinge on a return on investment a proper water price will be key here also 3 4 1 corporate social responsibility csr is a widespread business practice that refers to a company s internal or external voluntary actions to contribute to a public good and increase fairness or distributional equity see kitzmueller and shimshack 50 debaere and shimshack 18 19 19 see footnote in supplementary material to be clear complying with existing laws is not csr policy csr surpasses existing standards and laws reporting nonfinancial social and environmental activities in annual reports dates from the 1970 s and the practice grew in the 1990 s as sustainable development emerged csr covers the middle space between at one end social entrepreneurship whose main mission is a social environmental objective and at the other end companies whose products may have positive social or environmental benefits but that do not focus explicitly on such goals an example of social entrepreneurship in the water sphere is the indian company jain which is focused on bringing drip irrigation to indian farmers see 16 even if csr enhances social welfare it must be profitable to be sustained while saving properly priced water may reduce costs in many instances water conservation requires extra outlays investments therefore csr s environmental social objectives will likely have to be part of a company s profit maximizing strategy that is supported by stakeholders and shareholders 20 20 see footnote in supplementary material in an environment of perfect competition where a homogenous product like water is offered csr survives only if consumers care about the issue in this case water conservation enhanced water quality or how water is treated enough that they are willing to pay more even when that product does not easily reveal its particular treatment under imperfect competition with differentiated instead of homogenous goods csr is more easily introduced in such a setting a company s csr policy may help position or brand a product as sustainable enabling the company to target particular customers this works especially in customer facing transactions as opposed to business to business deals beverage companies like the coca cola company or nestlé may want to associate their water bottles with conservation efforts and therefore fund a wetland restoration project in a basin in which they are active or simply push internal water efficiency sometimes stakeholders other than consumers value csr it can be a form of nonmonetary compensation that helps retain employees who value working in a socially responsible company to the extent that csr improves a company s relationship with communities activists or regulators it reduces reputational and regulatory risks in addition to operational risks that investors worry about larger companies are often guided in their csr policies by ngos that keep track of societies and science s changing standards as to what is socially and environmentally acceptable with increasing water stress ngos such as the carbon disclosure project which helps financial investors and companies understand their environmental impact encourage the disclosure of metrics like companies water footprints however the quality of the water data that companies reveal is generally poor and of limited use as it is often very aggregate at the multinational level and not tied to particular locations where there may be a drought 3 4 2 case rio tinto making hay from water mining takes place in increasingly water stressed areas even though it requires a lot of water water is needed in extraction and mineral processing to suppress dust and to transport slurry after mine closings the danger of runoff and seepage of contaminated water remains rio tinto is a multinational mining company headquartered in london in 2012 the company planned to expand its activities in australia s arid pilbara region with below the water table mining which presented challenges of excess water dewatering the mine while dealing with falling groundwater pressure and possible contamination due to inter aquifer leakage see debaere 13 rio tinto needed only 2 5 to 7 megaliters ml of water per day for its operations but it had more water to dispose of its hydrologists and engineers designed an ambitious plan that they hoped would be a template for the future the proposal which was approved by local authorities was to use existing pipelines to supply up to 18 ml of surplus water per day to the nearby town of tom price and reinject 12 ml per day into a nearby aquifer whose level was receding the company would accommodate another surplus of 40 ml in winter to 120 ml in summer by growing hay on idle property in the area since crops consume vast amounts of water in addition the company planned a buffer dam and had license to discharge water in a nearby creek in case of emergency rio tinto s ambitious plan blurred the line between csr and government policy the local government did not have the expertise to help rio tinto design its plan the company worked closely with the authorities to get its plans approved since obtaining a mining permit was a precondition for its operations at the same time the proposal aimed to create goodwill in the local communities by injecting water into a depressed aquifer and providing water to a nearby town rio tinto also hoped to strengthen its reputation as a sophisticated mining company with deep hydrological knowledge to attract high skilled workers note that a recent scandal involving rio tinto underscores how csr can never be a substitute for good policies 21 21 see footnote in supplementary material 3 4 3 impact investing with increased water stress there is growing interest in financial investment in water while some mutual funds market themselves as water funds and seek private resources for portfolios of securities from water related companies it is not always clear which if any sustainable objectives they achieve especially objectives that specifically fight water scarcity the criteria for inclusion in a water mutual fund are often vague for example a certain percentage of company revenue from water related business and varied moreover since preexisting securities are bought no new physical investment is made at the margin the financial investment helps companies raise capital more easily in the future the case of venture capital investments differs slightly from mutual funds venture capital firms tend to fund risky early stage water technologies and thus make available new resources that otherwise are not so easily tapped into 3 at the same time how the new technology eventually alleviates water stress may not yet be clear leaving some uncertainty as to what water objective will be achieved impact investment tends to be more focused and specifically geared toward environmentally beneficial projects in addition it directly affects the amount of funding when it unlocks private capital for environmentally and socially beneficial projects that tend to be without private financiers impact investing is a relatively recent term that refers to actions by investors seeking both a private return and a social impact and in some instances a private return below the market return 46 in the water sphere impact investing predominantly covers the acquisition of real assets like real estate or water rights water related impact investment tends to be relatively small compared to climate change and food related investments 57 recent additions to impact investments are green bonds water blue bonds and pay for success bonds all those relatively new instruments hinge on proper certification to ensure that the professed goals are indeed attained 3 4 4 case the nature conservancy australia fund the nature conservancy tnc is one of the largest conservation organizations in the world and the second largest private landowner in the united states see debaere and richter 15 tnc has gradually adapted how it fulfills its mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends as an increasingly global nonprofit organization tnc has gone beyond setting aside critical lands and habitats to addressing wider areas and protecting freshwater ecosystems and species including advocating for sustainable water management practices in 2016 its impact investment unit naturevest along with the murray darling wetlands working group launched an impact investment fund called the australian balanced water fund in the wake of the great recession tnc sought to leverage more funds for environmental purposes as acquiring water is expensive and focused on australia s water markets there are more than 30 000 individual wetland areas scattered across the murray darling basin and tnc sought to protect a portfolio of treasured wetlands and secure water to flood them tnc raised private funds to buy permanent water rights for its trust it would lease the majority of those funds short term and earn a return with which to pay its investors a fraction of the permanent rights would not be leased but used instead to flood wetlands the beauty of the plan was that wetlands have to be watered only once every few years which could presumably happen in wetter periods when water is less scarce and its price not so high by investing in permanent water rights investors earned a private return somewhat under the market return while at the same time making it possible to flood wetlands in an arid area the hope was that the water fund would fit tnc s theory of change and act as a pilot to demonstrate the wider applicability of the approach 4 conclusion in this article we have offered an economic perspective on many potential roles that the private sector can play in securing water there are many different ways in which the private and the public sector can work together too often the discussion about the provision of water is phrased in terms of a simple dichotomy between fully public and fully private initiatives similarly too often we assume that what is desirable is also feasible as water scarcity and water stress are increasing and as the current water provision in some places is failing it may be worthwhile to reconsider or enrich some of the existing institutional setups even though the very nature of water and the particular cost structure of water infrastructure have traditionally accounted for the outsize role of public institutions in providing water security a fresh look reveals a much more complex and nuanced role for the private sector in interaction with the public sector not all stages of the water supply network suggest increasing returns and natural monopolies hence some stages may benefit from more competition and increased efficiency especially when they are not operating properly contract theory shows that social and environmental objectives do not necessarily require public ownership operation of the water infrastructures at all times which opens the door for a whole range of partnerships between the public and private sectors here again especially when the current institutions are not functioning optimally as evidenced by water scarcity or lacking water quality it may be advisable to consider other institutional setups it is increasingly clear that the interactions between the sectors are complex and unique they depend on the specifics of the cooperation and the specifics of the existing institutional and societal context in the end the incentives for both private companies and governments determine the success of their cooperation one size does not fit all calling for private involvement purely to evade fiscal checks and balances is not advisable nor is having private companies assume public roles in the absence of a regulatory framework at the same time harnessing private sector r d technical knowledge and innovation may require more than just arms length transactions and may motivate longer term contracts with shared risk and temporary ownership private sector involvement is no deus ex machina however its operation will hinge on an independent regulatory authority and the particular ways in which competent bureaucracies engage the private sector remain critically important for this reason alone private sector involvement should perhaps not be the go to solution in less advanced countries it bears repeating that a critical factor that will determine the ability of the private sector to engage the public sector is its return on investment the fact that there is a growing acknowledgment that water prices worldwide tend to be too low and that solving water crises will also involve pricing properly opens the door for more private sector involvement in the end the price of water is a key determinant of its return on investment we encourage a pragmatic approach there is no size that fits all and what is desirable may not be feasible csr does not trump good policy but in the absence of societal agreements on better policies they may be a worthwhile alternative the same is true for impact investment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

add value to address the interface of water security and global health in research policy and practice has not yet been comprehensively framed 1 1 conceptualizing water security water connects not only rivers and tributaries springs and estuaries coastlines and oceans ports and places but every aspect of life water the lifeline that covers 71 of our planet is at the core of sustainable development critical for socio economic development energy and food production healthy ecosystems and human health and well being serving as the crucial link between society and the environment 5 water security is a broad concept that is being used across disciplines emphasizing sustainability infrastructure human capabilities ecosystem health governance production and agricultural needs and sociocultural relations with water 6 9 the ministerial declaration of the hague on water security in the 21st century issued at the world water forum in 2000 10 expanded global interest in and uptake of water security in global policy development and science agendas it describes the water security challenge as ensuring that ecosystems are protected and improved that sustainable development and political stability are promoted that every person has access to enough safe water at an affordable cost to lead a healthy and productive life and that the vulnerable are protected from the risks of water related hazards 11 water security definitions differ in their level of analysis with emphasis ranging from the national to individual and water source level 12 gleick and iceland 13 classify water and security pathways under three broad categories diminished water supply or quality increased water demand and extreme flood events according to the authors no single strategy is sufficient to reduce water risk but instead multifaceted approaches are needed in this paper gleick and iceland s categories are adopted to frame water security matters in the context of human health including both household and non household levels 1 2 linking water security with global health and exposure to water related diseases the united nations call for looking at water and the water cycle in its entirety

institute for international law of peace and armed conflict 14 interactions between water security and human health are subject to spatiotemporal dynamics and differ between different locations between neighbourhoods urban peri urban and rural areas and informal settlements with socio economic disparities between low middle and high income countries in different cultural contexts at different scales ranging from local to national to regional to continental they are strongly determined by geography with place and environmental climatic and hydrological factors exposures to natural and water related disasters available health systems and services in terms of prevention treatment and care and access to education and different levels of health related knowledge risk perceptions and behaviours 4 determining communities and individuals water related health risks and exposure to diseases the so called bradley classification 15 classifies water related infectious diseases showing entry points towards disease prevention related to the provision of safe water sanitation and hygiene wash 16 accordingly waterborne diseases are caused by the ingestion of diverse viral bacterial protozoal and helminthic pathogens in drinking water and are thus determined by the water quality at the point of use 17 18 water washed disease transmission is driven by the availability access and use of water for hygiene referring to water as a preventative factor of person to person transmission when sufficient water quantities are available water based diseases cover those pathogens that spend a necessary part of their life cycle in water water related insect vector transmission involves insects that breed in or bite near water acting as transmission vector 16 diseases entirely or partially attributable to or linked with inadequate wash infrastructure and behaviours 19 20 mainly affect rural informal and indigenous communities in low and middle income countries as well as minority populations and low socio economic and other groups in high income countries 21 who carry the greatest disease burden 22 1 3 contextualizing links between water security and global health with medical geography considerations the linkages between water security and global health underly spatiotemporal dynamics and vary in space and time just like water connects every aspect of life geography according to waldo tobler relates everything to everything else 23 therefore in order to address challenges at the interface of water security and global health the use and application of medical geography a sub discipline of geography is helpful in research policy and practice the interconnections of health and geography trace back more than 2000 years when hippocrates 460 377 bce stated in his work on airs waters and places that whoever wishes to investigate human health properly should not only consider the geographical peculiarities of each locality seasons of the year characteristics of water such as quality and quantity but also human behaviour different lifestyles and habits 24 25 the classic modern example of linking water security human health or disease and geography was john snow identifying the london broad street pump as the source of a major cholera outbreak in 1854 with individuals using the pump as main water sources exposing themselves to cholera

extreme weather events and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development its sustainable development goals and targets 48 as a frame this paper shows the contribution of the individual case studies to addressing and helping to achieve some of these goals related to water security and global health building on the consideration that no single strategy is sufficient to reduce water risk but instead multifaceted approaches are needed 13 all included studies follow the concept of triangulation a method which serves to analyze a phenomenon by combining data from different sources and levels on the same research topic data triangulation applying different methods methodological triangulation applying different theories or hypotheses theory triangulation and employing different people for the collection and analysis of the data investigator triangulation 49 51 building on the consideration that geography relates everything to everything else 23 cross cutting topics and contextualizations beyond water security and global health are highlighted including climate and weather related extreme events inequality health and water related education risk perceptions and behaviour and the cultural context of water and health implications 2 1 assessing health risks and recommending health promoting wetland management across sub saharan africa wetlands often constitute the only accessible water resources in otherwise uninhabitable landscapes which is why they are being used extensively for domestic and agricultural purposes 52 the resulting degradation and contamination of water has the potential to spread disease causing microorganisms and provide increased breeding habitats for disease vectors 53 knowledge gaps remained about whether and how different kinds of wetland use influence the exposure to health risks and transmission of infectious diseases 2 1 1 research approach and methodology a study on water related infectious disease exposure in a wetland in semiarid kenya 2013 2017 funded by the german federal ministry of education as part of the project globe wetlands in east africa reconciling future food production with environmental protection aimed at a identifying health risks and water related infectious diseases that can be present in wetlands and associating them with wetland uses b assessing health risks arising from wetland use and linking them to the wetland users health related behaviour c estimating health risk perceptions of the wetland users towards these identified and assessed health risks and diseases this study involved different disciplines such as medical geography epidemiology public health social science water resources management wash agriculture environmental sciences and others a mix of quantitative and qualitative empirical research was conducted with different respondent groups commercial farmers smallholder farmers pastoralists service sector workers that represented differing cultural contexts and community versus service provider perspectives information on water related diseases previously associated with wetland use was retrieved through an extensive narrative review of peer reviewed academic literature 54 the information was used to develop the data collection tools both quantitative and qualitative for the empirical part of this study which involved different wetland user groups farmers nomadic pastoralists and service sector workers a syndromic surveillance or self reporting of disease approach 55 and an observational spot check 56 were used for the quantitative assessment of health risks 55 arising from wetland use in the surveyed population health risk perceptions were captured through in depth interviews 57 and health seeking behaviour was analyzed based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods 58 what was taught on wash and related health risks in schools was analyzed as well 59 moreover expert interviews with representatives from the health water education sectors and others were included to capture a service provider perspective besides the community perspective 58 table 2 2 1 2 main findings and contextualization with geography the study revealed that the literature base available on use related disease exposure does not reflect real risks the community is facing these real risks differ between different occupational groups and are perceived differently in different cultural contexts and with varying prevailing health beliefs while the farmers live in close proximity to the swamp and interact closely with the water it provides pastoralists live in the drier more remote and distant surroundings of the swamp pastoralists face and perceive greater challenges related to water scarcity and the use of predominately unimproved and unsafely stored water sources lack of environmental hygiene lack of sanitation facilities open defecation 56 and related diseases as compared to the majority population 55 social and cultural factors as well as traditional semi nomadic lifestyle in close proximity to their livestock mattered in terms of awareness and understanding of the meaning of health and ill health their risk perception and related uptake of health related protective measures interactions with water and the wetland exposure transmission prevention and treatment 57 compared to the other groups the pastoralists were also less likely to consult a healthcare provider for cure from disease major determinants included distance and access to healthcare facilities cost educational background and health beliefs that drive health choices among pastoralists 58 disease exposure health related perceptions and behaviours varied in the proximity to the water body in the wetter areas breeding sites are vastly available favouring the reproduction of mosquito vectors and thus potentially increasing vector related diseases such as malaria the accumulation of wastewater sewage faecal matter and other disease causing agents in the swamp contaminates the wetlands water a decrease of water quality is accelerated by poor sanitation and sewage infrastructure and leads to the spread of waterborne diseases like diarrhoea cholera and typhoid fever all of these adverse health effects are significantly accelerated during heavy rains and flooding as not only contaminants from the surrounding areas but also from higher grounds accumulate in the low lying swamp in the drier areas the most pressing health challenge that the people are facing is the shortage of water the resulting lack of hygiene along with a lack of sanitation facilities and limited water supply makes such arid areas conducive environments for the spread of water washed diseases such as trachoma and for waterborne diarrhoeal diseases while also malnutrition and food insecurity are more widespread too 55 57 2 1 3 implications for policy and practice this study underpinned the vital role of wetland users as key informants and demonstrated that risk perception studies and resulting recommendations from the grassroots level serve as helpful supportive tools for health promoting wetland management which requires a sensitive integrative approach that takes into consideration any and all of the humans ecology and animals affected 57 the resulting recommendations for wetland and health managers entail a list of detailed practical measures at the policy and implementation level to adopt for an improved locally informed health promoting wetland management they are relevant on the national and international level for global policy making and for achieving progress towards the sdg including targets 3 3 on malaria neglected tropical diseases water borne diseases and other communicable diseases 6 1 safe drinking water 6 2 adequate sanitation and hygiene 6 4 water use and scarcity 6 5 water resources management and 6 6 ecosystems 2 2 directing health interventions in a protracted emergency globally a large number of protracted and complex humanitarian crisis combined with acute public health emergencies have evolved over the last years forcibly displacing millions of people and stretching the humanitarian system at its edge 60 where health and political systems collapse the humanitarian system has taken over the role of providing life saving and life improvement measures the lake chad region for example has become the location of one of the world s most complex humanitarian protracted crisis exacerbated by violent extremism a weak health care system with regular multiple disease outbreaks as well as social and environmental challenges including food insecurity water scarcity demographic challenges and widespread poverty affecting about 17 million people in the region 61 2 2 1 research approach and methodology in order to study public health matters in a protracted emergency in an arid area this study was conducted in north east nigeria in collaboration with the emergency management unit of the world health organization nigeria 2018 funded by the world health organization it aimed at a understanding health related determinants in a protracted crisis in north east nigeria b harmonizing and directing future humanitarian and health interventions in the conflict area this study involved different disciplines cross cutting with water scarcity and public health in the context of a humanitarian crisis such as epidemiology nutrition food security gender climate change hydrology conflict management and peacekeeping information was collected through a comprehensive review of peer reviewed academic literature and grey literature including reports briefs and secondary data from humanitarian databases fewsnet reliefweb unocha who etc based on the review results in depth key informant interviews were carried out with strategic stakeholders operating in the area these included i representatives of the regional government of borno state from different sectors including health water wash environmental and agricultural sector and ii representatives of humanitarian and united nations organizations active in the area including médecins sans frontières msf world health organization who united nations children s emergency fund unicef international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifcrc world food programme wfp food and agricultural organization fao and malteser international table 2 2 2 2 main findings and contextualization with geography addressing different health and water related topics making use of mixed methods and their triangulation resulted in the identification of risks for the local and internally displaced population and lead to a robust understanding on the magnitude of the effects of the situation in its complexity comprehensive of all environmental political and social aspects context specific feasible measures and recommendations were identified for different actors policy makers humanitarian aid and other organizations and donors on how they should respond to such crisis and develop interventions that are efficient effective and sustainable such recommendation should guide the work towards mitigating the challenges which lie ahead to keep the region safe from emerging diseases the resulting roadmap will be used direct future humanitarian practice health interventions and policies in the protracted emergency area 61 2 2 3 implications for policy and practice the recommendations related to the different topics covered in the assessment and included among others integrated risk monitoring and early warning system that integrates data on climate sensitive environmental risks and epidemiological trends application of early detection tools i e rapid diagnostics to identify changing disease incidence geographic and seasonal risk mapping and climate informed early warning systems establishment of capacity systems to facilitate monitoring evaluation and reporting on medium and long term climate and health co benefits associated with the climate mitigation measures introduced in the health sector they inform several sdg targets such as targets 3 8 universal health coverage 6 4 water use and scarcity 6a international cooperation 6b stakeholder participation 16 1 reduce all forms of violence and related deaths 2 3 understanding the impact of flooding on health sector response floods are a disaster situation for all affected populations and especially for vulnerable groups within communities such as children orphans women and people with chronic diseases such as hiv and aids 62 63 they need functioning health care sanitation and hygiene safe water and healthy food supply and are critically dependent on their social care and support networks 64 2 3 1 research approach and methodology to study the impact of flooding on people living with hiv and aids in a floodplain in northern namibia 2012 research funded by the german development agency gesellschaft fuer internationale zusammenarbeit in collaboration with the ohangwena ministry of health and social services aimed at a understanding the impact of flooding on hiv service providers andpeople living with hiv and aids b identifying constraints with regard to hiv care provision c using the outcome for future management of hiv response in flood prone regions in order to improve access to services and medication during floods a broad review of peer reviewed academic literature was conducted to approach the implications of flooding on people living with hiv aids plwhiv it covered literature on hiv aids in emergencies hiv aids and the environment flooding and human health the results of the literature reviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach the outcomes facilitated the development of qualitative data collection tools for the empirical part of this study including key informant interviews and focus group discussions the empirical study involved different study populations at different levels local level plwhiv regional level service providers including representatives of governments and civil society organizations as well as national and international level government bodies and international and un organizations working on hiv aids the empirical results and recommendations were discussed as part of a national feedback meeting in the

and health behaviour theories 64 2 3 2 main findings and contextualization with geography flooding poses major challenges to plwhiv in terms of their everyday lives affecting livelihoods work income and living conditions what is threatening them under normal conditions poverty malnutrition unsafe wash limited access to healthcare facilities a weak health status and stigma is intensified by flood related breakdown of infrastructure insecurity malnutrition and diseases evolving over the course of a flood a potential dual risk exists for their health the increased risk both of infection and disease due to the inaccessibility of health services and antiretroviral treatment vulnerabilities and health risks of plwhiv will increase in a disaster situation like flooding if access to hiv prevention treatment care and support are not addressed and ensured 2 3 3 implications for policy and practice this study brought all relevant stakeholders i e emergency and flood management public health water infrastructure safety and security gender together to discuss grassroots challenges of people living with hiv and aids in the flood prone ohangwena region the triangulation of results from different levels and perspectives facilitated a detailed understanding of the situation and of the challenges that the population is facing measures and recommendations to reduce the negative impact that floods cause on hiv and aids care and to facilitate the future continuation of care during flooding as well as improved disaster response were identified pre active clarification of responsibilities improved communication and coordination of all sectors involved inclusion of detailed capacity and vulnerability assessment of flood affected populations in disaster response plans application of lessons learned from previous floods to strengthen capacity and identify potential gaps reduction of flood related risks for plwhiv and other chronically ill and vulnerable groups through integrated disaster preparedness measures for future floods and improvement of disaster preparedness by applying the resulting hiv and flooding framework 64 considerations and recommendations from this research inform several sdg targets such as targets 3 3 related to aids 3 8 universal health coverage 11 5 water related disasters 2 4 using data to strengthen national water sanitation hygiene and health systems the ability of small island developing states in the pacific to effectively manage wash and waste management is constrained by their small size geographical isolation and expansion environmental fragility small and predominantly rural but rapidly urbanizing populations and limited human and financial resource bases wash research monitoring and global action are still lagging behind the necessary efforts to achieve health promoting sustainable development 65 fiji kiribati and the solomon islands like other pacific island countries are often not able to provide adequate wash services to their populations besides these countries are facing significant challenges from a changing climate and the effect of extreme weather events such as tropical storms drought heavy rainfall and flooding as well as hardships related to rising sea levels 66 2 4 1 research approach and methodology a water sanitation and hygiene sector monitoring project in pacific island countries 2016 2019 funded by the unicef pacific aimed at a assessing the wash situation through analysis of baseline and census data from rural and urban households schools and health care facilities b strengthening national wash systems including monitoring in fiji kiribati and the solomon islands quantitative baseline and census data of water sanitation hygiene and waste management services in households schools and health care facilities were collected the data were analyzed and mapped with a focus on uncovering service coverage inequalities and discussed with wash sector stakeholders at national and international level government bodies and international and un organizations working on wash the results were then contextualized with rainfall data and extreme weather events through geospatial data analysis table 2 2 4 2 main findings and contextualization with geography inequalities in access to adequate wash and waste management were widespread and included urban rural provincial and centre periphery inequalities of drinking water services in households in the solomon islands international inequalities were uncovered as well with the solomon islands lagging behind

minority their history has been shaped by marginalization stigmatization and discrimination and to date they continue to face prejudice and social exclusion the roma population is generally poor living in crowded and low quality housing in segregated communities on the outskirts of cities often lacking basic physical infrastructure including wash 73 74 2 5 1 research approach and methodology considering wash and health related inequalities in high income countries a project on water sanitation and hygiene among roma communities 2019 2020 aimed at a assessing the wash situation among roma in europe b identifying wash related health risks associated with the wash situation c understanding obstacles to improvement a systematic review and meta analysis of peer reviewed academic literature on wash and environmental health risks in roma households and communities was conducted the data were analyzed with geospatial methods and contextualized with a focus on uncovering service coverage inequalities and discussed in the cultural context of health table 2 2 5 2 main findings and contextualization with geography the study shows that across europe roma communities face more challenges than the majority population with respect to access to wash waste management and environmental hygiene appropriate housing and hygienic living environments prominent themes in the literature to describe wash conditions among european roma populations include limited access affordability and quality of services self management of wash as response and adaptive tactic unsafe wash as a reason for eviction and health risks associated with substandard wash services the same factors determining the poor quality of wash services and environmental health impede their improvement major barriers to wash and healthcare access affordability and improvement among the roma exist living marginalized and distant from roads where public transport is absent access to healthcare providers to health systems comes with additional hurdles and at a higher cost discrimination is still widespread leading to potential neglect by medical professionals the low levels of formal education low socio economic status and poverty and limited access to health insurance are adding extra risks and challenges to disease prevention and health promotion legal barriers include statelessness lack of identification documents illegal tenure and housing social barriers include lack of a formal decision making structure or social hierarchy distrust in authorities reluctance to accept interventions and the variable commitment by roma community leaders and members cultural perceptions of health risks pose another barrier as they impact on the choice of water source and the attitude towards disease combined with a widespread distrust in non traditional health practices in authorities and health professionals they ultimately impact on health seeking behaviour besides prejudices towards roma lack of political will to engage political top down approaches absence of advocacy on behalf of the roma and lack of involvement of the roma community in planning pose barriers to improvement of both wash and health besides roma are not well represented in national statistics with data collection being complicated not only by difficulties of access and underfunding but also by distrust and culturally distinctive health beliefs 21 2 5 3 implications for policy and practice the context of wash among roma is challenging and complex and demonstrates not only the urgent need for action for roma communities in particular but may have broader applicability to ethnic and social minorities in other parts of the world 21 the success of interventions depends on the buy in from decision makers and good relations between natural leaders of ethnic minority communities and outsiders 75 and on the involvement support commitment and participation of roma community members 74 future research to overcome obstacles to improvement needs to be inclusive and involve community members as key informants with their participation enhancing the reliability of data contributing to social justice and solidarity disseminating information contributing to feasible recommendations and implementation of interventions 21 findings of this research shall inform efforts to achieve sdg targets 3 3 tuberculosis hepatitis water borne diseases and other communicable diseases 6 1 safe drinking water 6 2 adequate sanitation and hygiene 6 3 water quality and wastewater 10 2 social economic and political inclusion of all 3 triangulation and contextualization global environmental change increasingly frequent and unpredictable extreme weather events water scarcity food insecurity conflict migration urbanization and other processes have been impacting the interface of water security and global health at global regional national and local levels over the past decades the contexts are complex and this will further challenge practice and policy making not only in low and middle income countries but also among minority populations and low socio economic and other vulnerable groups in high income countries the presented studies sought to understand drivers recommend actionable contextualized measures direct practice and interventions and inform policy making in the context of water security 13 and global health by drawing on medical geography approaches they were conducted in very diverse geographical climatological and sociocultural settings and had different objectives table 3 but used similar research approaches that allowed to consider the settings as complex systems in their entirety cross cutting topics and contextualizations beyond water security and global health including climate and weather related extreme events inequality risk perceptions behaviour and the cultural context of water and health implications could only be identified based on the broad approach variety of methods scales and respondents used in the presented studies 3 1 extreme weather events extreme weather events such as major floods droughts and tropical cyclones may have detrimental effects on the overall health and security of population groups and on healthcare and wash infrastructure evidence from the solomon islands showed that domestic sanitation infrastructure is highly vulnerable and little adaptable under extreme rainfall scenarios drought and flooding leading to overflow of sewers and non usability of sanitation facilities this entails increased health risks 71 in nigeria drought and water scarcity exacerbate health challenges that internally displaced people in a humanitarian protracted crisis are facing putting an extra strain on overburdened or even inexistent health services 61 health care facilities in fiji are very vulnerable towards tropical cyclones and also they are not prepared to respond to the increased disease burden that cyclones causeministry of health and medical services of the government of fiji and unicef pacific water sanitation hygiene and waste management in health care facilities in fiji census report prepared by the water institute at unc 69 in northern namibia where extensive seasonal flooding is prevalent flood related breakdown of health and wash infrastructure lead to increased health risks and reduced treatment opportunities for vulnerable populations such as people living with hiv and aids 64 thus while increasing the risk of exposure towards water related infectious diseases and accelerating the progression of disease extreme weather events at the same time hamper access to healthcare facilities and treatment and thus the opportunity to receive care creating a dual health risk 3 2 inequality inequality persists in terms of access to safe water sanitation hygiene and healthcare not only between continents regions and countries but also at a sub national level evidence from the solomon islands shows that at a household level drinking water access differs according to province between centre and periphery and between urban and rural areas with central provinces using piped water and remote provinces use rain and surface water as main source drinking water inequality is also related to precipitation 67 inequalities also persist among marginalized minority populations as found among roma communities in europe roma populations living in informal settlements distant from roads cities and infrastructure also have unequal access to safe wash wash inequalities in these communities persist at local national and regional levels 21 at a non household level wash inequalities in healthcare facilities were found to be related to geography too differing according to region and medical division in fiji and kiribati likewise systemic inequalities at non household level persist in different types of healthcare facilities 69 70 and in different types of schools in the solomon islands 68 besides inequalities persist in terms of health promotion and exposures to disease based on location proximity to and interaction with water body e g through occupation as found in kenya where farmers who live near wetlands and closely interact with water are at higher risk of contracting malaria and where pastoralists who live distant from the wetland in drier environments are at higher risk of contracting trachoma 55 57 finally inequalities in terms of disease exposure access to healthcare and health seeking behaviour are prevalent among ethnic minorities as compared to majority populations as found among roma communities in europe 21 and among nomadic pastoralists in kenya 58 3 3 cultural context cultural contexts may determine health related perceptions behaviours and as a consequence health promotion and disease exposure convictions health beliefs social stigma and mis conceptions about health and healthcare can be decisive factors for health seeking behaviour treatment and cure as found in a kenyan wetland the level of health risk perception is high with exposure to water related infectious diseases understood as being driven by users physical contact to water during wetland use characteristics of pathogens and vectors of disease both in domestic and occupational environments different user groups i e farmers and nomadic pastoralists perceive risks differently and different occupational risks are attributed to different groups while many perceptions well reflect the real causes of disease numerous misconceived health beliefs are manifested especially among the pastoral nomads such include malaria being caused by rain pesticides and elephants or diseases caused by witchcraft 57 some roma communities in europe believing that this practice increases water safety may use salt or lime to treat drinking water from personal wells despite the lack of evidence of this practice removing contaminants and pathogens from the water 21 in terms of health seeking the cultural context matters as well roma populations for example commonly have a very distinct understanding of the meaning of health and health risks and therefore also perform different health related behaviours as compared to the majority population a spiritual base exists for certain kinds of illness and belief in traditional curative remedies such as the power of spittle to treat wounds perception acceptance or rejection of certain diseases may determine the willingness to seek medical help or support from the communities affecting rehabilitation 21 in kenya some illnesses are simply perceived as not for hospital are treated by traditional healers or herbalists by self treatment or not treated at all 55 thus while the overall risk perception may be high and accurate this does not necessarily allow for assumptions about the local ways to deal with ill health and health seeking 58 3 4 policy practice and triangulation based on all studies presented in this paper policy and practice was informed adopting holistic and interdisciplinary approaches combinations of risk assessments syndromic surveillance behavioural studies perception studies using mixed methods literature review grounded theory quantitative survey observational spot checks qualitative interviews focus group discussions stakeholder meetings mapping different perspectives within and outside of the community different sociocultural groups stakeholders and community versus health care providers at different implementation and geographical levels local regional national international in the presented studies the use of a single method or assessment would have been insufficient to draw a comprehensive picture and thus to create an understanding of the situation and its implications the studies set a major focus on triangulation of the results which allowed to fully display the context and complexity by using and discussing results from different data sources against each other 4 takeaways diverse actors see water security related global health challenges from different and partly even contradicting perspectives it is therefore vital to look at challenges from different angles and at the challenge under investigation from a holistic perspective using the 2030 agenda for sustainable development its sustainable development goals and targets 48 as well as gleick and iceland s water and security pathway classification diminished water supply or quality increased water demand and extreme flood events 13 as a frame this paper with case studies from the south pacific wetlands floodplains and a protracted emergency setting in sub saharan africa and living environments of roma communities in europe medical geography offers great potential in contributing to achieve the goals related to water security and global health medical geography can bridge different health and health system contexts local regional national and global perspectives

add value to address the interface of water security and global health in research policy and practice has not yet been comprehensively framed 1 1 conceptualizing water security water connects not only rivers and tributaries springs and estuaries coastlines and oceans ports and places but every aspect of life water the lifeline that covers 71 of our planet is at the core of sustainable development critical for socio economic development energy and food production healthy ecosystems and human health and well being serving as the crucial link between society and the environment 5 water security is a broad concept that is being used across disciplines emphasizing sustainability infrastructure human capabilities ecosystem health governance production and agricultural needs and sociocultural relations with water 6 9 the ministerial declaration of the hague on water security in the 21st century issued at the world water forum in 2000 10 expanded global interest in and uptake of water security in global policy development and science agendas it describes the water security challenge as ensuring that ecosystems are protected and improved that sustainable development and political stability are promoted that every person has access to enough safe water at an affordable cost to lead a healthy and productive life and that the vulnerable are protected from the risks of water related hazards 11 water security definitions differ in their level of analysis with emphasis ranging from the national to individual and water source level 12 gleick and iceland 13 classify water and security pathways under three broad categories diminished water supply or quality increased water demand and extreme flood events according to the authors no single strategy is sufficient to reduce water risk but instead multifaceted approaches are needed in this paper gleick and iceland s categories are adopted to frame water security matters in the context of human health including both household and non household levels 1 2 linking water security with global health and exposure to water related diseases the united nations call for looking at water and the water cycle in its entirety

institute for international law of peace and armed conflict 14 interactions between water security and human health are subject to spatiotemporal dynamics and differ between different locations between neighbourhoods urban peri urban and rural areas and informal settlements with socio economic disparities between low middle and high income countries in different cultural contexts at different scales ranging from local to national to regional to continental they are strongly determined by geography with place and environmental climatic and hydrological factors exposures to natural and water related disasters available health systems and services in terms of prevention treatment and care and access to education and different levels of health related knowledge risk perceptions and behaviours 4 determining communities and individuals water related health risks and exposure to diseases the so called bradley classification 15 classifies water related infectious diseases showing entry points towards disease prevention related to the provision of safe water sanitation and hygiene wash 16 accordingly waterborne diseases are caused by the ingestion of diverse viral bacterial protozoal and helminthic pathogens in drinking water and are thus determined by the water quality at the point of use 17 18 water washed disease transmission is driven by the availability access and use of water for hygiene referring to water as a preventative factor of person to person transmission when sufficient water quantities are available water based diseases cover those pathogens that spend a necessary part of their life cycle in water water related insect vector transmission involves insects that breed in or bite near water acting as transmission vector 16 diseases entirely or partially attributable to or linked with inadequate wash infrastructure and behaviours 19 20 mainly affect rural informal and indigenous communities in low and middle income countries as well as minority populations and low socio economic and other groups in high income countries 21 who carry the greatest disease burden 22 1 3 contextualizing links between water security and global health with medical geography considerations the linkages between water security and global health underly spatiotemporal dynamics and vary in space and time just like water connects every aspect of life geography according to waldo tobler relates everything to everything else 23 therefore in order to address challenges at the interface of water security and global health the use and application of medical geography a sub discipline of geography is helpful in research policy and practice the interconnections of health and geography trace back more than 2000 years when hippocrates 460 377 bce stated in his work on airs waters and places that whoever wishes to investigate human health properly should not only consider the geographical peculiarities of each locality seasons of the year characteristics of water such as quality and quantity but also human behaviour different lifestyles and habits 24 25 the classic modern example of linking water security human health or disease and geography was john snow identifying the london broad street pump as the source of a major cholera outbreak in 1854 with individuals using the pump as main water sources exposing themselves to cholera 26 27 the investigation of relationships between health and diseases in space and time the application of geographical concepts and methods to water related health problems and diseases 28 links

visualization on maps associating the health challenges of interest with topographical hydrological climatological population infrastructure cultural context policy and economy involves disease ecology or geographic epidemiology health system and services research 28 30 the focus of medical geography on spatio temporal disease patterns and disease mapping was thematically and methodologically developed further to a geography of health 2 31 34 multi interdisciplinary and holistic approaches through adaptation of public health epidemiological and sociological methodologies are gaining increasing attention 29 35 corresponding to the call for multifaceted approaches to address water security issues by gleick and iceland 13 traditional mapping and quantitative approaches are complemented by additional research methods including mixed methods more qualitative and participatory research 36 subjective feelings towards places health beliefs and health related behaviour 37

marginalized ethnic minority populations in europe fig 2 table 2 using gleick and iceland s 13 classification of water security pathways diminished water supply or quality increased water demand extreme weather events and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development its sustainable development goals and targets 48 as a frame this paper shows the contribution of the individual case studies to addressing and helping to achieve some of these goals related to water security and global health building on the consideration that no single strategy is sufficient to reduce water risk but instead multifaceted approaches are needed 13 all included studies follow the concept of triangulation a method which serves to analyze a phenomenon by combining data from different sources and levels on the same research topic data triangulation applying different methods methodological triangulation applying different theories or hypotheses theory triangulation and employing different people for the collection and analysis of the data investigator triangulation 49 51 building on the consideration that geography relates everything to everything else 23 cross cutting topics and contextualizations beyond water security and global health are highlighted including climate and weather related extreme events inequality health and water related education risk perceptions and behaviour and the cultural context of water and health implications 2 1 assessing health risks and recommending health promoting wetland management across sub saharan africa wetlands often constitute the only accessible water resources in otherwise uninhabitable landscapes which is why they are being used extensively for domestic and agricultural purposes 52 the resulting degradation and contamination of water has the potential to spread disease causing microorganisms and provide increased breeding habitats for disease vectors 53 knowledge gaps remained about whether and how different kinds of wetland use influence the exposure to health risks and transmission of infectious diseases 2 1 1 research approach and methodology a study on water related infectious disease exposure in a wetland in semiarid kenya 2013 2017 funded by the german federal ministry of education as part of the project globe wetlands in east africa reconciling future food production with environmental protection aimed at a identifying health risks and water related infectious diseases that can be present in wetlands and associating them with wetland uses b assessing health risks arising from wetland use and linking them to the wetland users health related behaviour c estimating health risk perceptions of the wetland users towards these identified and assessed health risks and diseases this study involved different disciplines such as medical geography epidemiology public health social science water resources management wash agriculture environmental sciences and others a mix of quantitative and qualitative empirical research was conducted with different respondent groups commercial farmers smallholder farmers pastoralists service sector workers that represented differing cultural contexts and community versus service provider perspectives information on water related diseases previously associated with wetland use was retrieved through an extensive narrative review of peer reviewed academic literature 54 the information was used to develop the data collection tools both quantitative and qualitative for the empirical part of this study which involved different wetland user groups farmers nomadic pastoralists and service sector workers a syndromic surveillance or self reporting of disease approach 55 and an observational spot check 56 were used for the quantitative assessment of health risks 55 arising from wetland use in the surveyed population health risk perceptions were captured through in depth interviews 57 and health seeking behaviour was analyzed based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods 58 what was taught on wash and related health risks in schools was analyzed as well 59 moreover expert interviews with representatives from the health water education sectors and others were included to capture a service provider perspective besides the community perspective 58 table 2 2 1 2 main findings and contextualization with geography the study revealed that the literature base available on use related disease exposure does not reflect real risks the community is facing these real risks differ between different occupational groups and are perceived differently in different cultural contexts and with varying prevailing health beliefs while the farmers live in close proximity to the swamp and interact closely with the water it provides pastoralists live in the drier more remote and distant surroundings of the swamp pastoralists face and perceive greater challenges related to water scarcity and the use of predominately unimproved and unsafely stored water sources lack of environmental hygiene lack of sanitation facilities open defecation 56 and related diseases as compared to the majority population 55 social and cultural factors as well as traditional semi nomadic lifestyle in close proximity to their livestock mattered in terms of awareness and understanding of the meaning of health and ill health their risk perception and related uptake of health related protective measures interactions with water and the wetland exposure transmission prevention and treatment 57 compared to the other groups the pastoralists were also less likely to consult a healthcare provider for cure from disease major determinants included distance and access to healthcare facilities cost educational background and health beliefs that drive health choices among pastoralists 58 disease exposure health related perceptions and behaviours varied in the proximity to the water body in the wetter areas breeding sites are vastly available favouring the reproduction of mosquito vectors and thus potentially increasing vector related diseases such as malaria the accumulation of wastewater sewage faecal matter and other disease causing agents in the swamp contaminates the wetlands water a decrease of water quality is accelerated by poor sanitation and sewage infrastructure and leads to the spread of waterborne diseases like diarrhoea cholera and typhoid fever all of these adverse health effects are significantly accelerated during heavy rains and flooding as not only contaminants from the surrounding areas but also from higher grounds accumulate in the low lying swamp in the drier areas the most pressing health challenge that the people are facing is the shortage of water the resulting lack of hygiene along with a lack of sanitation facilities and limited water supply makes such arid areas conducive environments for the spread of water washed diseases such as trachoma and for waterborne diarrhoeal diseases while also malnutrition and food insecurity are more widespread too 55 57 2 1 3 implications for policy and practice this study underpinned the vital role of wetland users as key informants and demonstrated that risk perception studies and resulting recommendations from the grassroots level serve as helpful supportive tools for health promoting wetland management which requires a sensitive integrative approach that takes into consideration any and all of the humans ecology and animals affected 57 the resulting recommendations for wetland and health managers entail a list of detailed practical measures at the policy and implementation level to adopt for an improved locally informed health promoting wetland management they are relevant on the national and international level for global policy making and for achieving progress towards the sdg including targets 3 3 on malaria neglected tropical diseases water borne diseases and other communicable diseases 6 1 safe drinking water 6 2 adequate sanitation and hygiene 6 4 water use and scarcity 6 5 water resources management and 6 6 ecosystems 2 2 directing health interventions in a protracted emergency globally a large number of protracted and complex humanitarian crisis combined with acute public health emergencies have evolved over the last years forcibly displacing millions of people and stretching the humanitarian system at its edge 60 where health and political systems collapse the humanitarian system has taken over the role of providing life saving and life improvement measures the lake chad region for example has become the location of one of the world s most complex humanitarian protracted crisis exacerbated by violent extremism a weak health care system with regular multiple disease outbreaks as well as social and environmental challenges including food insecurity water scarcity demographic challenges and widespread poverty affecting about 17 million people in the region 61 2 2 1 research approach and methodology in order to study public health matters in a protracted emergency in an arid area this study was conducted in north east nigeria in collaboration with the emergency management unit of the world health organization nigeria 2018 funded by the world health organization it aimed at a understanding health related determinants in a protracted crisis in north east nigeria b harmonizing and directing future humanitarian and health interventions in the conflict area this study involved different disciplines cross cutting with water scarcity and public health in the context of a humanitarian crisis such as epidemiology nutrition food security gender climate change hydrology conflict management and peacekeeping information was collected through a comprehensive review of peer reviewed academic literature and grey literature including reports briefs and secondary data from humanitarian databases fewsnet reliefweb unocha who etc based on the review results in depth key informant interviews were carried out with strategic stakeholders operating in the area these included i representatives of the regional government of borno state from different sectors including health water wash environmental and agricultural sector and ii representatives of humanitarian and united nations organizations active in the area including médecins sans frontières msf world health organization who united nations children s emergency fund unicef international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifcrc world food programme wfp food and agricultural organization fao and malteser international table 2 2 2 2 main findings and contextualization with geography addressing different health and water related topics making use of mixed methods and their triangulation resulted in the identification of risks for the local and internally displaced population and lead to a robust understanding on the magnitude of the effects of the situation in its complexity comprehensive of all environmental political and social aspects context specific feasible measures and recommendations were identified for different actors policy makers humanitarian aid and other organizations and donors on how they should respond to such crisis and develop interventions that are efficient effective and sustainable such recommendation should guide the work towards mitigating the challenges which lie ahead to keep the region safe from emerging diseases the resulting roadmap will be used direct future humanitarian practice health interventions and policies in the protracted emergency area 61 2 2 3 implications for policy and practice the recommendations related to the different topics covered in the assessment and included among others integrated risk monitoring and early warning system that integrates data on climate sensitive environmental risks and epidemiological trends application of early detection tools i e rapid diagnostics to identify changing disease incidence geographic and seasonal risk mapping and climate informed early warning systems establishment of capacity systems to facilitate monitoring evaluation and reporting on medium and long term climate and health co benefits associated with the climate mitigation measures introduced in the health sector they inform several sdg targets such as targets 3 8 universal health coverage 6 4 water use and scarcity 6a international cooperation 6b stakeholder participation 16 1 reduce all forms of violence and related deaths 2 3 understanding the impact of flooding on health sector response floods are a disaster situation for all affected populations and especially for vulnerable groups within communities such as children orphans women and people with chronic diseases such as hiv and aids 62 63 they need functioning health care sanitation and hygiene safe water and healthy food supply and are critically dependent on their social care and support networks 64 2 3 1 research approach and methodology to study the impact of flooding on people living with hiv and aids in a floodplain in northern namibia 2012 research funded by the german development agency gesellschaft fuer internationale zusammenarbeit in collaboration with the ohangwena ministry of health and social services aimed at a understanding the impact of flooding on hiv service providers andpeople living with hiv and aids b identifying constraints with regard to hiv care provision c using the outcome for future management of hiv response in flood prone regions in order to improve access to services and medication during floods a broad review of peer reviewed academic literature was conducted to approach the implications of flooding on people living with hiv aids plwhiv it covered literature on hiv aids in emergencies hiv aids and the environment flooding and human health the results of the literature reviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach the outcomes facilitated the development of qualitative data collection tools for the empirical part of this study including key informant interviews and focus group discussions the empirical study involved different study populations at different levels local level plwhiv regional level service providers including representatives of governments and civil society organizations as well as national and international level government bodies and international and un organizations working on hiv aids the empirical results and recommendations were discussed as part of a national feedback meeting in the namibian ministry of health and the resulting changes were included in the study table 2 the findings were interpreted using the sustainable livelihoods framework the natural hazard research approach and health behaviour theories 64 2 3 2 main findings and contextualization with geography flooding poses major challenges to plwhiv in terms of their everyday lives affecting livelihoods work income and living conditions what is threatening them under normal conditions poverty malnutrition unsafe wash limited access to healthcare facilities a weak health status and stigma is intensified by flood related breakdown of infrastructure insecurity malnutrition and diseases evolving over the course of a flood a potential dual risk exists for their health the increased risk both of infection and disease due to the inaccessibility of health services and antiretroviral treatment vulnerabilities and health risks of plwhiv will increase in a disaster situation like flooding if access to hiv prevention treatment care and support are not addressed and ensured 2 3 3 implications for policy and practice this study brought all relevant stakeholders i e emergency and flood management public health water infrastructure safety and security gender together to discuss grassroots challenges of people living with hiv and aids in the flood prone ohangwena region the triangulation of results from different levels and perspectives facilitated a detailed understanding of the situation and of the challenges that the population is facing measures and recommendations to reduce the negative impact that floods cause on hiv and aids care and to facilitate the future continuation of care during flooding as well as improved disaster response were identified pre active clarification of responsibilities improved communication and coordination of all sectors involved inclusion of detailed capacity and vulnerability assessment of flood affected populations in disaster response plans application of lessons learned from previous floods to strengthen capacity and identify potential gaps reduction of flood related risks for plwhiv and other chronically ill and vulnerable groups through integrated disaster preparedness measures for future floods and improvement of disaster preparedness by applying the resulting hiv and flooding framework 64 considerations and recommendations from this research inform several sdg targets such as targets 3 3 related to aids 3 8 universal health coverage 11 5 water related disasters 2 4 using data to strengthen national water sanitation hygiene and health systems the ability of small island developing states in the pacific to effectively manage wash and waste management is constrained by their small size geographical isolation and expansion environmental fragility small and predominantly rural but rapidly urbanizing populations and limited human and financial resource bases wash research monitoring and global action are still lagging behind the necessary efforts to achieve health promoting sustainable development 65 fiji kiribati and the solomon islands like other pacific island countries are often not able to provide adequate wash services to their populations besides these countries are facing significant challenges from a changing climate and the effect of extreme weather events such as tropical storms drought heavy rainfall and flooding as well as hardships related to rising sea levels 66 2 4 1 research approach and methodology a water sanitation and hygiene sector monitoring project in pacific island countries 2016 2019 funded by the unicef pacific aimed at a assessing the wash situation through analysis of baseline and census data from rural and urban households schools and health care facilities b strengthening national wash systems including monitoring in fiji kiribati and the solomon islands quantitative baseline and census data of water sanitation hygiene and waste management services in households schools and health care facilities were collected the data were analyzed and mapped with a focus on uncovering service coverage inequalities and discussed with wash sector stakeholders at national and international level government bodies and international and un organizations working on wash the results were then contextualized with rainfall data and extreme weather events through geospatial data analysis table 2 2 4 2 main findings and contextualization with geography inequalities in access to adequate wash and waste management were widespread and included urban rural provincial and centre periphery inequalities of drinking water services in households in the solomon islands international inequalities were uncovered as well with the solomon islands lagging behind

minority their history has been shaped by marginalization stigmatization and discrimination and to date they continue to face prejudice and social exclusion the roma population is generally poor living in crowded and low quality housing in segregated communities on the outskirts of cities often lacking basic physical infrastructure including wash 73 74 2 5 1 research approach and methodology considering wash and health related inequalities in high income countries a project on water sanitation and hygiene among roma communities 2019 2020 aimed at a assessing the wash situation among roma in europe b identifying wash related health risks associated with the wash situation c understanding obstacles to improvement a systematic review and meta analysis of peer reviewed academic literature on wash and environmental health risks in roma households and communities was conducted the data were analyzed with geospatial methods and contextualized with a focus on uncovering service coverage inequalities and discussed in the cultural context of health table 2 2 5 2 main findings and contextualization with geography the study shows that across europe roma communities face more challenges than the majority population with respect to access to wash waste management and environmental hygiene appropriate housing and hygienic living environments prominent themes in the literature to describe wash conditions among european roma populations include limited access affordability and quality of services self management of wash as response and adaptive tactic unsafe wash as a reason for eviction and health risks associated with substandard wash services the same factors determining the poor quality of wash services and environmental health impede their improvement major barriers to wash and healthcare access affordability and improvement among the roma exist living marginalized and distant from roads where public transport is absent access to healthcare providers to health systems comes with additional hurdles and at a higher cost discrimination is still widespread leading to potential neglect by medical professionals the low levels of formal education low socio economic status and poverty and limited access to health insurance are adding extra risks and challenges to disease prevention and health promotion legal barriers include statelessness lack of identification documents illegal tenure and housing social barriers include lack of a formal decision making structure or social hierarchy distrust in authorities reluctance to accept interventions and the variable commitment by roma community leaders and members cultural perceptions of health risks pose another barrier as they impact on the choice of water source and the attitude towards disease combined with a widespread distrust in non traditional health practices in authorities and health professionals they ultimately impact on health seeking behaviour besides prejudices towards roma lack of political will to engage political top down approaches absence of advocacy on behalf of the roma and lack of involvement of the roma community in planning pose barriers to improvement of both wash and health besides roma are not well represented in national statistics with data collection being complicated not only by difficulties of access and underfunding but also by distrust and culturally distinctive health beliefs 21 2 5 3 implications for policy and practice the context of wash among roma is challenging and complex and demonstrates not only the urgent need for action for roma communities in particular but may have broader applicability to ethnic and social minorities in other parts of the world 21 the success of interventions depends on the buy in from decision makers and good relations between natural leaders of ethnic minority communities and outsiders 75 and on the involvement support commitment and participation of roma community members 74 future research to overcome obstacles to improvement needs to be inclusive and involve community members as key informants with their participation enhancing the reliability of data contributing to social justice and solidarity disseminating information contributing to feasible recommendations and implementation of interventions 21 findings of this research shall inform efforts to achieve sdg targets 3 3 tuberculosis hepatitis water borne diseases and other communicable diseases 6 1 safe drinking water 6 2 adequate sanitation and hygiene 6 3 water quality and wastewater 10 2 social economic and political inclusion of all 3 triangulation and contextualization global environmental change increasingly frequent and unpredictable extreme weather events water scarcity food insecurity conflict migration urbanization and other processes have been impacting the interface of water security and global health at global regional national and local levels over the past decades the contexts are complex and this will further challenge practice and policy making not only in low and middle income countries but also among minority populations and low socio economic and other vulnerable groups in high income countries the presented studies sought to understand drivers recommend actionable contextualized measures direct practice and interventions and inform policy making in the context of water security 13 and global health by drawing on medical geography approaches they were conducted in very diverse geographical climatological and sociocultural settings and had different objectives table 3 but used similar research approaches that allowed to consider the settings as complex systems in their entirety cross cutting topics and contextualizations beyond water security and global health including climate and weather related extreme events inequality risk perceptions behaviour and the cultural context of water and health implications could only be identified based on the broad approach variety of methods scales and respondents used in the presented studies 3 1 extreme weather events extreme weather events such as major floods droughts and tropical cyclones may have detrimental effects on the overall health and security of population groups and on healthcare and wash infrastructure evidence from the solomon islands showed that domestic sanitation infrastructure is highly vulnerable and little adaptable under extreme rainfall scenarios drought and flooding leading to overflow of sewers and non usability of sanitation facilities this entails increased health risks 71 in nigeria drought and water scarcity exacerbate health challenges that internally displaced people in a humanitarian protracted crisis are facing putting an extra strain on overburdened or even inexistent health services 61 health care facilities in fiji are very vulnerable towards tropical cyclones and also they are not prepared to respond to the increased disease burden that cyclones causeministry of health and medical services of the government of fiji and unicef pacific water sanitation hygiene and waste management in health care facilities in fiji census report prepared by the water institute at unc 69 in northern namibia where extensive seasonal flooding is prevalent flood related breakdown of health and wash infrastructure lead to increased health risks and reduced treatment opportunities for vulnerable populations such as people living with hiv and aids 64 thus while increasing the risk of exposure towards water related infectious diseases and accelerating the progression of disease extreme weather events at the same time hamper access to healthcare facilities and treatment and thus the opportunity to receive care creating a dual health risk 3 2 inequality inequality persists in terms of access to safe water sanitation hygiene and healthcare not only between continents regions and countries but also at a sub national level evidence from the solomon islands shows that at a household level drinking water access differs according to province between centre and periphery and between urban and rural areas with central provinces using piped water and remote provinces use rain and surface water as main source drinking water inequality is also related to precipitation 67 inequalities also persist among marginalized minority populations as found among roma communities in europe roma populations living in informal settlements distant from roads cities and infrastructure also have unequal access to safe wash wash inequalities in these communities persist at local national and regional levels 21 at a non household level wash inequalities in healthcare facilities were found to be related to geography too differing according to region and medical division in fiji and kiribati likewise systemic inequalities at non household level persist in different types of healthcare facilities 69 70 and in different types of schools in the solomon islands 68 besides inequalities persist in terms of health promotion and exposures to disease based on location proximity to and interaction with water body e g through occupation as found in kenya where farmers who live near wetlands and closely interact with water are at higher risk of contracting malaria and where pastoralists who live distant from the wetland in drier environments are at higher risk of contracting trachoma 55 57 finally inequalities in terms of disease exposure access to healthcare and health seeking behaviour are prevalent among ethnic minorities as compared to majority populations as found among roma communities in europe 21 and among nomadic pastoralists in kenya 58 3 3 cultural context cultural contexts may determine health related perceptions behaviours and as a consequence health promotion and disease exposure convictions health beliefs social stigma and mis conceptions about health and healthcare can be decisive factors for health seeking behaviour treatment and cure as found in a kenyan wetland the level of health risk perception is high with exposure to water related infectious diseases understood as being driven by users physical contact to water during wetland use characteristics of pathogens and vectors of disease both in domestic and occupational environments different user groups i e farmers and nomadic pastoralists perceive risks differently and different occupational risks are attributed to different groups while many perceptions well reflect the real causes of disease numerous misconceived health beliefs are manifested especially among the pastoral nomads such include malaria being caused by rain pesticides and elephants or diseases caused by witchcraft 57 some roma communities in europe believing that this practice increases water safety may use salt or lime to treat drinking water from personal wells despite the lack of evidence of this practice removing contaminants and pathogens from the water 21 in terms of health seeking the cultural context matters as well roma populations for example commonly have a very distinct understanding of the meaning of health and health risks and therefore also perform different health related behaviours as compared to the majority population a spiritual base exists for certain kinds of illness and belief in traditional curative remedies such as the power of spittle to treat wounds perception acceptance or rejection of certain diseases may determine the willingness to seek medical help or support from the communities affecting rehabilitation 21 in kenya some illnesses are simply perceived as not for hospital are treated by traditional healers or herbalists by self treatment or not treated at all 55 thus while the overall risk perception may be high and accurate this does not necessarily allow for assumptions about the local ways to deal with ill health and health seeking 58 3 4 policy practice and triangulation based on all studies presented in this paper policy and practice was informed adopting holistic and interdisciplinary approaches combinations of risk assessments syndromic surveillance behavioural studies perception studies using mixed methods literature review grounded theory quantitative survey observational spot checks qualitative interviews focus group discussions stakeholder meetings mapping different perspectives within and outside of the community different sociocultural groups stakeholders and community versus health care providers at different implementation and geographical levels local regional national international in the presented studies the use of a single method or assessment would have been insufficient to draw a comprehensive picture and thus to create an understanding of the situation and its implications the studies set a major focus on triangulation of the results which allowed to fully display the context and complexity by using and discussing results from different data sources against each other 4 takeaways diverse actors see water security related global health challenges from different and partly even contradicting perspectives it is therefore vital to look at challenges from different angles and at the challenge under investigation from a holistic perspective using the 2030 agenda for sustainable development its sustainable development goals and targets 48 as well as gleick and iceland s water and security pathway classification diminished water supply or quality increased water demand and extreme flood events 13 as a frame this paper with case studies from the south pacific wetlands floodplains and a protracted emergency setting in sub saharan africa and living environments of roma communities in europe medical geography offers great potential in contributing to achieve the goals related to water security and global health medical geography can bridge different health and health system contexts local regional national and global perspectives and priorities and research policy and field practice involving the target population s as key informants it can assist policy makers and practitioners to understand the key drivers barriers and bottlenecks in complex situations recommend actionable and contextualized measures to address these challenges direct programming and interventions and inform policy making to tackle and solve these challenges future research relating to water security and global health could consider also water society interactions e g the hydrosocial cycle 76 future research could apply and integrate remote

20124,this paper provides a review of collective action for safe water provision and management in rural sub saharan africa water related collective action is largely premised on norms of trust and reciprocity institutional arrangements that prescribe and enforce appropriate rules and sanctions and ecological threats and conditions that favour cooperation a central argument of this paper is that while community based water management and collective action are important institutional mechanisms for achieving water security researchers and practitioners need to pay attention to the social ingredients ecological variables and governance structures that easily render them ineffective and counterproductive for rural water provision and management the critical role of the state mainstreaming the human right to water and addressing structural inequalities at all levels should form the foundation of rural water policies and programs keywords collective action water security sub saharan africa rural 1 introduction nearly 90 of the world s population are estimated to use basic drinking water services defined as water from an improved source with a collection time of less than 30 min for a round trip unicef who 2017 this number is expected to reach 96 by 2030 if current trends continue thereby falling short of meeting the sustainable developments goals sdgs target of global universal access in 2017 of the 785 million people who were estimated to have limited services or unimproved sources or surface water 51 20 and 18 were in sub sahara africa ssa south eastern asia and central and south asia respectively in these regions the urban poor and populations in rural areas are the most affected a confluence of factors including lack of funding climate change population growth and governance challenges account for the access gaps in most regions unicef jmp 2017 18 while the number of people without access to basic services in ssa might sound alarming significant gains were made with respect to achieving water targets under the millennium development goals mdgs for example a quarter of the population gained access to at least basic drinking services during the mdg era the largest percentage point change compared to other regions with similar coverage gaps however rural urban disparities remain across the region rural coverage for safely managed services defined as sources that are on site on demand and most importantly free of microbial contamination is around 12 while urban coverage is around 50 unicef jmp 2017 the rural urban gap in safely managed water services means that most rural residents with access to improved water services in ssa are served by standalone boreholes and protected springs outside the household premises while the most ideal situation is to provide safely managed or piped water services for all persons and communities rural communities in ssa for the most part do not have the demand finance and institutional regulations to support piped water delivery systems akin to what is found in urban municipalities 18 in terms of demand rural communities that are frequently made up of a few hundred households for the most part may not be able to support piped water infrastructure in terms of economies of scale with regards to finance the average annual capital cost of providing basic universal water services in rural areas was estimated at 1 4 billion globally and around 931 million for ssa in 2016 20 this is a daunting challenge for many governments in ssa considering the competing demands and development challenges governments are confronted with in terms of cost recovery water tariffs and fiscal arrangements that are used for revenue collection by municipal water service providers in urban areas are often somewhat straightforward to administer in rural areas a plurality of payment schemes exist including pay per use daily weekly or monthly payments pay when broken one time payment schemes in kind payments and no payments 14 18 these payment schemes may fail to generate the needed revenue to maintain water systems are premised on what is locally acceptable or what people can pay and have limited legal prescriptions to penalize defaulters 14 18 24 36 to address rural water challenges post independence community based management cbm was promoted and has been used as an institutional vehicle to implement and manage rural water supplies in ssa while this can take many forms the most popular arrangement involves donors governments and ngos providing water infrastructure while communities take charge of managing and funding on going maintenance and operations 7 34 community members are sometimes required to 1 contribute to the cost of installation mostly through labour and locally available materials such as stones and sand 2 pay user fees to enhance sustainability 3 volunteer through user committees to manage the system and 4 volunteer time to clean around the water source the assumption is that cbm provides opportunities for informed choice and a sense of ownership for communities cbm is also seen as a mechanism for governments to mobilise local resources provide water at a relative lower cost and empower rural communities with technical skills to monitor and undertake repairs of rural water infrastructure however these assumptions and the viability of cbm have been challenge by many researchers in part due to the high rate of handpump malfunction under cmb initiatives financial uncertainty due to low payment of user fees operational burden and inefficiencies and high dependence on social cohesion 4 15 19 36 further cbm to a large extent relies on collective action defined as resident s ability to achieve mutually beneficial cooperative ways of meeting their set expectations 8 30 relying on the romanticized notions of community 1 residents are expected to participate from project implementation to on going maintenance and management with their eyes set on the end goal i e safe drinking water building on the foundation of cbm this paper provides a review of collective action for safe water provision and management in rural ssa in the sections that follow i will first discuss the facilitators and predictors of collective action for the provision governance and sustainability of rural drinking water services in ssa a central argument of this review is that while cbm and collective action are important institutional mechanisms for achieving water security we need to critically examine the social ingredients ecological variables and governance structures that easily render them ineffective and counterproductive for rural water provision and management the review draws on examples published in a wide array of disciplines including economics development studies rural studies sociology and geography i recognise that the review does not provide a comprehensive overview of collective action theory and all the inherent principles relevant for water governance because of space constraints i have chosen some themes principles and examples but not many others in doing so i have tried to focus on themes that i feel are most dominant and relevant to current discourse and debates around rural water provision and management in ssa 2 collective action water related collective action largely focuses on the importance of common interests and values for initiating managing and governing water projects and water governance research on collective action and water have been conducted across various scales of governance from neighbourhood to transnational governance process water bodies e g from springs to transnational basins and on various forms of water issues e g drinking water interventions irrigation schemes and hydroelectric projects in general collective action dilemmas arise when individual actors exhibit uncooperative behaviours because their individual interests do not align with common group interest 29 41 the most common collective action dilemma is found in shared common pool resources such as forest and irrigation schemes where individuals who overexploit or fail to cooperate with the larger group are better off in the short run 40 6 while early collective action theories emphasised external regulation privatization and provision of selective incentive to avoid tragedy of the commons there is compelling evidence that collective action can be achieved through pre existing social institutions and structures 30 31 over the years a number of researchers have identified conditions that support or characterize the success of institutions in managing common pool resources the most popular being the eight elements of successful and stable local common pool resource 30 12 with regards to rural water resources van den broek and brown 34 argue that the effectiveness of communities to undertake collective action is contingent on formal and informal relationships that 1 restrain water users from freeriding 2 motivate people to participate in the management of the water source and 3 aid water users to craft and enforce rules that govern the water system in the sections that follow i will discuss the role of trust institutions and mutual vulnerability in fostering formal and informal relationships and rural water related collective action 2 1 trust trust is a critical determinant of collective action and the associated success in common pool resource management gambetta 2000 pg 218 defines trust as a particular level of the subjective probability with which an agent assesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action both before he can monitor such action or independently of his capacity ever to be able to monitor it and in a context in which it affects his own action in water related collective action trust allows actors to take an action that involves some form of sacrifice or cost e g financial contribution without being certain of reciprocal behaviour or contributions from other members of the community in rural communities frequent interactions among members create opportunities to verify the behaviour of the trusted thus long term collective action in such communities can be ruined if many people build a reputation of untrustworthiness for example users of borehole systems in southern senegal act i e pay their water tariffs in response to others current behavior when deciding whether or not to cooperate in collective action 17 that is people who assumed that other users of the system will contribute financially were more likely to make their own contribution in this example water tariff contribution was used as a measure of collective action necessary for management of community motorized borehole systems in our research with lakeshore rural residents in kenya we investigated the relationship between different forms of social capital including trust and formal and informal networks and participation in collective action 8 in this setting collective action was mostly in the form of contributing labour cash for the construction of a village water facility and attending village water committee meetings we found that people who trust others were more likely to participate in collective action compared to those with low levels of trust similarly findings from studies conducted in kenya zambia and ghana by kelly et al 22 show that high levels of trust influenced the ability of local water committees to mobilize financial resources including organizing fundraisers collaborating with other community institutions and soliciting labuor from community members naiga et al 26 also found that mistrust reduced the likelihood of participation in communal water projects in rural uganda in malawi distrust in water committees largely due to misuse of community funds led to insufficient financial contributions to adequately maintain water points 11 across these case studies willingness to contribute money or labour was influenced by trust in their local water committee particularly the committee treasurer or financial secretary trust was equally premised on certain in actions of the water committees such as presence of a bank account and transparent money use 26 22 further dense networks such as youth groups women groups and local cooperatives are important for developing trust nurturing trustworthiness and building norms of reciprocity in rural areas though the evidence above might sound encouraging the association between trust and water related collective action should be interpreted with caution in most cross sectional quantitative studies bisung et al 8 hanatani and fuse 17 the direction of causality is difficult to ascertain further quantitative studies often involve ahistorical analyses of trust which fails to consider broader inequalities and structural determinants of mistrust hence while trust is an important ingredient for collective action there is very little empirical evidence on how to build or sustain it over the long term 2 2 institutions i use institutions to broadly describe prescriptions of human actions and outcomes structured by rules norms and shared strategies 39 these prescriptions specify actions that are needed allowed or prohibited and the sanctions authorized if the rules or norms are not followed 32 40 with regards to safe water written laws municipal by laws and administrative decisions constitute formal rules enforced by public authorities and formalized institutional structures that can facilitate collective action formal rules and laws can motivate or discourage individuals and groups voluntary participation in water related collective action for example fear of retribution from municipal authorities weakened collective action by residents to demand municipal services in new mpima a suburb of kabwe in zambia 10 residents felt that municipal authorities could disproportionately apply existing building regulations and sanctions against them if they initiate any community mobilization activities thus misapplication of formal rules and laws could inhibit voluntary participation in collective action particularly in instances where there is low confidence in local government structures formal and informal rules can equally facilitate local collective actions particularly under transparent and accountable political regimes for example in ewaso ng iro basin of kenya local actors created water user s associations to address collective action dilemmas related to water allocation among upstream and downstream water users policy makers at the national level subsequently created rules and regulations to support the operations of these associations 3 these regulations provided policy backing conflict resolution mechanisms and greater coordination among actors at different levels to achieve collective action 3 in some contexts however top down policy changes to promote collective action can destabilise past community initiatives if clear roles rules and responsibilities are not well established see naiga et al 27 for an example in rural uganda similarly cbm rules that are externally initiated by government agencies and ngo can easily disappear after such agencies leave the community in rural namibia schnegg and kaika 36 observed that communities began to change cbm rules and regimes for water systems governance immediately government officials left pay per consumption rules were altered to diesel contribution based on a monthly rotation this led to noncompliance and conflicts because some households failed to contribute their share of diesel when it got to their turn thus water points shifted from being spaces of collective action to conflictive spaces 36 self governance of systems e g ponds and cisterns governed by rural communities that rely on locally generated informal rules tend to facilitate collective action because the norms networks and workings rules are self generated among pastoralists in ethiopia beyene 6 observed that collective action in the form of volunteer labour toward communal ponds was strictly observed and enforced with fines applied to individuals who fail to contribute fines were set and agreed in advance based on income levels however informal norms and rules that prescribed sanctions on uncooperative behaviour were sometimes difficult to monitor interpreted differently or applied disproportionately in many rural communities in ssa elders chiefs other traditional leaders and elected or appointed leaders are important custodians of rules and sanctions and facilitate most decision making processes the effectiveness of such leaders to enforce rules and sanction members depends on many compositional e g leadership skills and capabilities and contextual factors e g local political environment incentive to participate in collective action is reduced in communities where elders decisions run counter to or override the interest of group members further where cultural norms promote collective livelihood activities and living arrangements e g collective herding shared farm plots application of sanctions can become impractical or difficult to enforce in addition evidence points to widespread non application of sanctions and penalties under communally manage water systems in malawi laid down penalties or sanctions such as exclusion from water use were seldom applied to people with uncooperative behaviour 21 instead water system managers used moral appeals to encourage cooperative behaviours for example defaulters of water fees were often asked to pay in fulfillment of a public good or to reciprocate the good gesture of others these institutional arrangements did not adversely affect communal management or sustainability of water pumps on the contrary van den broek and brown 34 found that weak enforcement of sanctions for non payment of water fees in masindi and kiryandongo districts of uganda led to collective non payment of fees by other members in some cases water committees are reluctant to apply formal sanctions because strict enforcement can destabilise family connections exclude people who genuinely do not have money to contribute affect social cohesion in the community exacerbate existing tensions and divisions promote commodification of water and defeat the moral and ethical imperatives of a human right to water based on extensive field work in uganda brown and van den broek 9 found widespread social norms that consider individual advancement and interest a greater offense than free riding these conundrums around application of sanctions imply that water practitioners need to reconcile the implications of sanctions e g exclusions disconnections monetary penalties under cbm with the social realities of rural communities 2 3 mutual vulnerability to water insecurity risks in some settings socio political and ecological vulnerabilities and interdependence encourage collective action studies among irrigation farmers have found that environmental constraints and ecological repercussions of not following collective management decisions see 13 28 3 for examples in sri lanka pakistan and kenya respectively as wells as dependence on farm income or shared water resources see 34 35 for examples from japan and china respectively influence participation in collective action similar observations have been made with regards to drinking water in our work in kenya we found that residents who relied on surface water lake victoria for cooking and other domestic uses were more likely to participate in collective action in the form of cash and labour contributions toward a future community water project compared to those who had access to relatively improved sources e g boreholes and wells 8 based on this finding we argued that exposure to unsafe sources and other environmental risks could be a major reason for engagement in water related collective action in addition sex disaggregated models from our analysis showed that concerns over water security i e using water from the lake were significantly associated with collective action among women but not men this is largely because women were more exposed to health risks associated with collecting water from the lake compared to men indeed varying levels of risk and vulnerabilities to water insecurity can undermine collective action as the less exposed or those with resources to cope or adapt are likely to be less motivated to contribute toward collective solutions in other settings seasonality affects contributions toward sustainability of water pumps because people depend on other sources e g rain water and reservoirs during the wet season see 23 for examples in ghana kenya and zambia thus increased vulnerability to water insecurity during the dry season motivates people to contribute toward communal pumps while reduced vulnerability during the wet season creates a disincentive to contribute however it is possible that collective action could be more difficult to achieve during dry season if competition for water or the need for rationing increases thus the links between seasonality and underlying socioecological conditions that facilitate collective action warrant further in depth analysis 2 4 social heterogeneity and inequality it is well recognized that local communities are not homogenous and unified organic units with shared norms and institutions to facilitate collective action 1 any given community is internally differentiated has strategic alliances among different heterogeneous groups and creates spaces of inclusion and exclusion that might be invisible through the objective gaze of researchers the relationship between heterogeneity and collective action is complicated and sometimes ignored for example social and cultural heterogeneity within a community could increase the coordination cost of forming and enforcing common rules among members 33 on the other hand heterogeneity may help promote cooperation and inclusion if the abilities and unique capacities of all different groups are duly recognized based their work in senegal hanatani and fuse 17 argue that social homogeneity in terms of ethnic diversity may not deter participation in collective action if there is some level of trust within user groups contextual understanding of how trust develops in ethnically diverse societies in ssa should be a critical line of investigation in future studies inequalities affect collective action in many ways for example income inequalities can create opportunities for economic elites to undermine collective action in order to further their own objectives in kebribeyah ethiopia wealthy private cistern owners opposed the construction of communal cisterns because new water sources could lead to a decline in water prices or disappearance of water markets 6 aside from income inequalities differences in ownership of capital assets e g land holding could hinder participation in water related collective action in usoma kenya residents who held strong perceptions of differences in landholding were less likely to participate in collective action in kidwera ii uganda preexisting tensions and land disputes between households led to animosities and unwillingness to cooperate on water issues and fee payment 34 3 women s involvement women play a very important role in community mobilization for water and sanitation studies have found that women are more likely to participate in water related collective action 8 are most likely to join savings cooperatives and water groups 5 are tasked with cleaning communal water points 26 22 are trusted to keep financial contributions 22 and are more likely to make financial contributions toward communal water systems 26 yet their leadership within water committees at the community level is often unrecognized or limited to few positions this can undermine collective action since true community mobilization requires the involvement and recognition of all members indeed research conducted in vaniatu and uganda show that participation of women in water user committees is a significant determinant of continued functionality of water systems 25 15 yet power hierarchies and control of resources within households and cultural norms affect women s participation in communal water activities 37 38 promoting women s participation should be based on critical appraisal of prevailing social norms and engagement with local stakeholders and power brokers in some situations those who administer sanctions to non cooperative members and fee defaulters are subjected to threats and physical abuse 9 36 such abuse can be traumatizing for women if they are pushed into or take up leadership positions without clear pathways for creating a good social atmosphere or tackling gender inequities naiga et al 26 gives a very discouraging example from isingiro in uganda where women who aspire to take leadership positions were given derogatory labels like macho such labels discourage women from taking up leadership positions and continue to perpetuate male dominance in the water sector 4 conclusion for many water practitioners using collective action to initiate implement or sustain rural water infrastructure is attractive because it aligns with romanticised notion of community 1 2 it can also look attractive because it partly offloads responsibility from the state to the responsible willing and capable citizenry however invoking the community and collective action without due attention to the multiple flaws and complexities apparent in community based water interventions will not achieve the desired outcomes while community based collective action has brought an alternative to the privatization movement and top down approaches to water supply in many countries it should be complemented with clear state led direction and involvement of government agencies at all levels aside from active state involvement other funding and governance mechanisms such as water subsidies and delegated management systems as well as mainstreaming the human right to water need critical attention in order to achieve the sdgs otherwise collective action will turn into a burden and struggle for only rural residents and the urban poor since many wealthy urban residents are connected to municipal water systems without any effort on their part as discussed above water related collective action is largely premised on norms of trust and reciprocity institutional arrangements that prescribe and enforce appropriate rules and sanctions and ecological threats and conditions that favour cooperation these factors are not organically present in all rural communities and water systems neither are they easy to establish funding acknowledgement elijah bisung is

20124,this paper provides a review of collective action for safe water provision and management in rural sub saharan africa water related collective action is largely premised on norms of trust and reciprocity institutional arrangements that prescribe and enforce appropriate rules and sanctions and ecological threats and conditions that favour cooperation a central argument of this paper is that while community based water management and collective action are important institutional mechanisms for achieving water security researchers and practitioners need to pay attention to the social ingredients ecological variables and governance structures that easily render them ineffective and counterproductive for rural water provision and management the critical role of the state mainstreaming the human right to water and addressing structural inequalities at all levels should form the foundation of rural water policies and programs keywords collective action water security sub saharan africa rural 1 introduction nearly 90 of the world s population are estimated to use basic drinking water services defined as water from an improved source with a collection time of less than 30 min for a round trip unicef who 2017 this number is expected to reach 96 by 2030 if current trends continue thereby falling short of meeting the sustainable developments goals sdgs target of global universal access in 2017 of the 785 million people who were estimated to have limited services or unimproved sources or surface water 51 20 and 18 were in sub sahara africa ssa south eastern asia and central and south asia respectively in these regions the urban poor and populations in rural areas are the most affected a confluence of factors including lack of funding climate change population growth and governance challenges account for the access gaps in most regions unicef jmp 2017 18 while the number of people without access to basic services in ssa might sound alarming significant gains were made with respect to achieving water targets under the millennium development goals mdgs for example a quarter of the population gained access to at least basic drinking services during the mdg era the largest percentage point change compared to other regions with similar coverage gaps however rural urban disparities remain across the region rural coverage for safely managed services defined as sources that are on site on demand and most importantly free of microbial contamination is around 12 while urban coverage is around 50 unicef jmp 2017 the rural urban gap in safely managed water services means that most rural residents with access to improved water services in ssa are served by standalone boreholes and protected springs outside the household premises while the most ideal situation is to provide safely managed or piped water services for all persons and communities rural communities in ssa for the most part do not have the demand finance and institutional regulations to support piped water delivery systems akin to what is found in urban municipalities 18 in terms of demand rural communities that are frequently made up of a few hundred households for the most part may not be able to support piped water infrastructure in terms of economies of scale with regards to finance the average annual capital cost of providing basic universal water services in rural areas was estimated at 1 4 billion globally and around 931 million for ssa in 2016 20 this is a daunting challenge for many governments in ssa considering the competing demands and development challenges governments are confronted with in terms of cost recovery water tariffs and fiscal arrangements that are used for revenue collection by municipal water service providers in urban areas are often somewhat straightforward to administer in rural areas a plurality of payment schemes exist including pay per use daily weekly or monthly payments pay when broken one time payment schemes in kind payments and no payments 14 18 these payment schemes may fail to generate the needed revenue to maintain water systems are premised on what is locally acceptable or what people can pay and have limited legal prescriptions to penalize defaulters 14 18 24 36 to address rural water challenges post independence community based management cbm was promoted and has been used as an institutional vehicle to implement and manage rural water supplies in ssa while this can take many forms the most popular arrangement involves donors governments and ngos providing water infrastructure while communities take charge of managing and funding on going maintenance and operations 7 34 community members are sometimes required to 1 contribute to the cost of installation mostly through labour and locally available materials such as stones and sand 2 pay user fees to enhance sustainability 3 volunteer through user committees to manage the system and 4 volunteer time to clean around the water source the assumption is that cbm provides opportunities for informed choice and a sense of ownership for communities cbm is also seen as a mechanism for governments to mobilise local resources provide water at a relative lower cost and empower rural communities with technical skills to monitor and undertake repairs of rural water infrastructure however these assumptions and the viability of cbm have been challenge by many researchers in part due to the high rate of handpump malfunction under cmb initiatives financial uncertainty due to low payment of user fees operational burden and inefficiencies and high dependence on social cohesion 4 15 19 36 further cbm to a large extent relies on collective action defined as resident s ability to achieve mutually beneficial cooperative ways of meeting their set expectations 8 30 relying on the romanticized notions of community 1 residents are expected to participate from project implementation to on going maintenance and management with their eyes set on the end goal i e safe drinking water building on the foundation of cbm this paper provides a review of collective action for safe water provision and management in rural ssa in the sections that follow i will first discuss the facilitators and predictors of collective action for the provision governance and sustainability of rural drinking water services in ssa a central argument of this review is that while cbm and collective action are important institutional mechanisms for achieving water security we need to critically examine the social ingredients ecological variables and governance structures that easily render them ineffective and counterproductive for rural water provision and management the review draws on examples published in a wide array of disciplines including economics development studies rural studies sociology and geography i recognise that the review does not provide a comprehensive overview of collective action theory and all the inherent principles relevant for water governance because of space constraints i have chosen some themes principles and examples but not many others in doing so i have tried to focus on themes that i feel are most dominant and relevant to current discourse and debates around rural water provision and management in ssa 2 collective action water related collective action largely focuses on the importance of common interests and values for initiating managing and governing water projects and water governance research on collective action and water have been conducted across various scales of governance from neighbourhood to transnational governance process water bodies e g from springs to transnational basins and on various forms of water issues e g drinking water interventions irrigation schemes and hydroelectric projects in general collective action dilemmas arise when individual actors exhibit uncooperative behaviours because their individual interests do not align with common group interest 29 41 the most common collective action dilemma is found in shared common pool resources such as forest and irrigation schemes where individuals who overexploit or fail to cooperate with the larger group are better off in the short run 40 6 while early collective action theories emphasised external regulation privatization and provision of selective incentive to avoid tragedy of the commons there is compelling evidence that collective action can be achieved through pre existing social institutions and structures 30 31 over the years a number of researchers have identified conditions that support or characterize the success of institutions in managing common pool resources the most popular being the eight elements of successful and stable local common pool resource 30 12 with regards to rural water resources van den broek and brown 34 argue that the effectiveness of communities to undertake collective action is contingent on formal and informal relationships that 1 restrain water users from freeriding 2 motivate people to participate in the management of the water source and 3 aid water users to craft and enforce rules that govern the water system in the sections that follow i will discuss the role of trust institutions and mutual vulnerability in fostering formal and informal relationships and rural water related collective action 2 1 trust trust is a critical determinant of collective action and the associated success in common pool resource management gambetta 2000 pg 218 defines trust as a particular level of the subjective probability with which an agent assesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action both before he can monitor such action or independently of his capacity ever to be able to monitor it and in a context in which it affects his own action in water related collective action trust allows actors to take an action that involves some form of sacrifice or cost e g financial contribution without being certain of reciprocal behaviour or contributions from other members of the community in rural communities frequent interactions among members create opportunities to verify the behaviour of the trusted thus long term collective action in such communities can be ruined if many people build a reputation of untrustworthiness for example users of borehole systems in southern senegal act i e pay their water tariffs in response to others current behavior when deciding whether or not to cooperate in collective action 17 that is people who assumed that other users of the system will contribute financially were more likely to make their own contribution in this example water tariff contribution was used as a measure of collective action necessary for management of community motorized borehole systems in our research with lakeshore rural residents in kenya we investigated the relationship between different forms of social capital including trust and formal and informal networks and participation in collective action 8 in this setting collective action was mostly in the form of contributing labour cash for the construction of a village water facility and attending village water committee meetings we found that people who trust others were more likely to participate in collective action compared to those with low levels of trust similarly findings from studies conducted in kenya zambia and ghana by kelly et al 22 show that high levels of trust influenced the ability of local water committees to mobilize financial resources including organizing fundraisers collaborating with other community institutions and soliciting labuor from community members naiga et al 26 also found that mistrust reduced the likelihood of participation in communal water projects in rural uganda in malawi distrust in water committees largely due to misuse of community funds led to insufficient financial contributions to adequately maintain water points 11 across these case studies willingness to contribute money or labour was influenced by trust in their local water committee particularly the committee treasurer or financial secretary trust was equally premised on certain in actions of the water committees such as presence of a bank account and transparent money use 26 22 further dense networks such as youth groups women groups and local cooperatives are important for developing trust nurturing trustworthiness and building norms of reciprocity in rural areas though the evidence above might sound encouraging the association between trust and water related collective action should be interpreted with caution in most cross sectional quantitative studies bisung et al 8 hanatani and fuse 17 the direction of causality is difficult to ascertain further quantitative studies often involve ahistorical analyses of trust which fails to consider broader inequalities and structural determinants of mistrust hence while trust is an important ingredient for collective action there is very little empirical evidence on how to build or sustain it over the long term 2 2 institutions i use institutions to broadly describe prescriptions of human actions and outcomes structured by rules norms and shared strategies 39 these prescriptions specify actions that are needed allowed or prohibited and the sanctions authorized if the rules or norms are not followed 32 40 with regards to safe water written laws municipal by laws and administrative decisions constitute formal rules enforced by public authorities and formalized institutional structures that can facilitate collective action formal rules and laws can motivate or discourage individuals and groups voluntary participation in water related collective action for example fear of retribution from municipal authorities weakened collective action by residents to demand municipal services in new mpima a suburb of kabwe in zambia 10 residents felt that municipal authorities could disproportionately apply existing building regulations and sanctions against them if they initiate any community mobilization activities thus misapplication of formal rules and laws could inhibit voluntary participation in collective action particularly in instances where there is low confidence in local government structures formal and informal rules can equally facilitate local collective actions particularly under transparent and accountable political regimes for example in ewaso ng iro basin of kenya local actors created water user s associations to address collective action dilemmas related to water allocation among upstream and downstream water users policy makers at the national level subsequently created rules and regulations to support the operations of these associations 3 these regulations provided policy backing conflict resolution mechanisms and greater coordination among actors at different levels to achieve collective action 3 in some contexts however top down policy changes to promote collective action can destabilise past community initiatives if clear roles rules and responsibilities are not well established see naiga et al 27 for an example in rural uganda similarly cbm rules that are externally initiated by government agencies and ngo can easily disappear after such agencies leave the community in rural namibia schnegg and kaika
