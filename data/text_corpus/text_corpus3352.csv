16760,the binding between dissolved organic matter dom and micro pollutants mps results in significant impacts on their migration transformation and degradation however the role of the dom mp binding on their oxidative transformation remains poorly studied the binding of mps by dom in combination with dom s roles as a photosensitizer and or a competitor for free radicals needs to be considered in the context of understanding the dom s impacts on the oxidative degradation of mps this study aims to explore this aspect of dom mp interactions based on the quantitation of humic acid ha and tetracycline tet complexation and its role in tet removal this study also compared the degradation of free tet versus that bound in ha tet complexes in different oxidation processes fourier transform infrared ftir data show that the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in ha are the main binding sites of tet while nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis shows the binding of tet engages its n ch3 2 groups and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos data show that the carboxyl groups in dom are sensitive than phenolic groups in the binding of tet the difference between the degradation rates δkobs of the free and bound tet decreased with the increase of ionic strength using sodium nitrate but increased with the introduction of ca2 and mg2 due to the formation of tet ca2 mg2 complexes quenching experiments showed that the free radicals oh and so4 pms oxidant and uv light were the main contributors to the tet degradation in uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 processes respectively in situ fluorescence time scanning and differential absorbance spectra showed that free tet was preferentially oxidized over the bound tet in all the tested treatments except uv ps these results provide new insights into the role of dom mp complexation in the degradation of mps in natural and engineered systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords binding interactions humic acid bound tetracycline chemical transformation 1 introduction the antibiotic tetracycline tet has been extensively used in animal husbandry medical practice and aquaculture to treat a broad range of bacterial infections ma et al 2020 however approximately 30 90 of the ingested tet molecules are released into the environment via the discharge of animal manure and wastewater effluent sarmah et al 2006 this results in a high level of residual tet concentration in the raw influent 1 24 12 34 μg l and soils 86 199 mg kg hamscher et al 2002 lindsey et al 2001 the presence of tet could lead to bacterial resistance and thus pose a threat to many ecosystems and human health gilliver et al 1999 laxminarayan et al 2013 therefore the environmental effects of tet s presence and its fate in aquatic ecosystems are drawing increasing attention mao et al 2015 tet possesses multiple ionizable moieties and it can form four main species denoted as tet tet tet and tet2 in aquatic environments whose formation is governed by the respective ionization constants pka1 3 3 pka2 7 7 pka3 9 7 fig s1 christl et al 2016 the protonated and zwitterionic tet species can be engaged in electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged molecules of dom which has a complex supramolecular structure that comprises aromatic and aliphatic units with functional groups oh cooh and c o kim et al 2017 the binding with dom has been shown to affect tet s migration and reactivity in aquatic environments and water treatment processes niu et al 2016 sibley and pedersen 2008 prior research has shown that the mp dom interactions impact their adsorption and oxidative degradation xie et al 2019 conventional oxidation processes tend to target mps in their free state in such processes dom acts as an electron donor or a competitor of reactive oxygen species ros with attendant effects of dom on the degradation efficiency of the target mps zhao et al 2021 only a few studies have focused on the formation physicochemical properties and removal efficiency of mps in their bound state jia et al 2020 lutze et al 2015 wenk et al 2013 prior studies on dom mp interactions and their role in environmental processes have mainly focused on the natural light assisted degradation pathways where dom acts as a photosensitizer that can be excited to generate oxygen active substances such as singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and 3dom which accelerate the indirect cooperative oxidation of coexisting pollutants li et al 2016 mangalgiri and blaney 2017 ren et al 2017 in recent years emerging advanced oxidation technologies have examined the performance of the activation of hydrogen peroxide and persulfates to produce oh e0 2 8 v and so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v whose action results in high efficiency degradation of many mps antoniou et al 2010 fang et al 2020 guo et al 2016 2017 yang et al 2019 previous studies have indicated that the concentration of mps bound in complexes with dom can reach up to 100 300 μmol l per g l dissolved organic carbon chu et al 2015 ren et al 2017 additionally the kinetics of oxidative degradation of various forms of free and bound mps in systems potentially dominated by dom mp interactions in different oxidation processes has not been sufficiently studied given that only few studies have explored mp dom binding effects on the oxidative degradation of mps this study aimed to elucidate the role of the binding between tet and humic acid ha in the degradation of tet in different oxidation processes uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 the ha tet binding was characterized by fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy the nature of the binding sites involved in ha tet complexation was ascertained via ftir and 1h nmr analyses data of in situ fluorescence time scans and differential absorbance spectra were generated to compare the reactivity of free tet and ha tet complexes and determine the contribution of ros in the examined oxidation processes based on the use of appropriate probes effects of tet and ha concentrations ionic strength is and metal ions on the degradation rates of the free and bound tet were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents humic acid ha permonosulfate pms persulfate ps and deuterium oxide d2o were purchased from sigma aldrich tetracycline was supplied from tci shanghai development co ltd hydrogen peroxide 30 tert butyl alcohol tba and methyl alcohol ma were obtained from aladdin industrial corporation sodium thiosulfate sodium nitrate nitric acid and sodium hydroxide were purchased from kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china all the reagents were analytic grade and all solutions were prepared with deionized di water 2 2 experimental procedures stock solution of ha 0 5 g ha powder was added to 500 ml 0 001 m sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and stirred at 100 rpm for 12 h in the dark to maximize the dissolution of ha the prepared ha solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous filter membrane to remove residual particulate matter ren et al 2017 then the ha filtrate was adjusted to ph 7 5 with 0 001 m nitric acid solution and stored in the dark at 4 c for later use afe 28 ph meter was used for ph measurements binding experiments spectra por 6 dialysis bags spectrum laboratories with a 1000 da cut off molecular weight were used to quantify the bound concentration of tet i e the concentration of tet complexed with ha maoz and chefetz 2010 the dialysis bags containing 5 ml ha stock solution were placed in 100 ml of reaction solution with 5 µm tet and the ionic strength is 0 001 0 1 m was adjusted by nano3 then the reaction solution was placed on a shaking bed at 40 r min for 48 h in the dark to establish tet ha equilibria and reach dialysis balance finally the inside and outside solutions of the dialysis bag were taken for hplc analysis to measure tet concentration the bound concentration cbound of tet was calculated based on eq 1 qiao et al 2011 1 c bound c in c out where cin and cout μm are the tet concentration of the inside and outside the dialysis bag cbound μm is the bound concentration degradation experiments the concentrations of tet and ha were varied between 1 25 20 µm and 0 20 mg l respectively solutions with equilibrated tet ha complexation the bound tet ha group were prepared by mixing the requisite amounts of tet and ha stock solutions for 12 h in the dark the data for these solutions were compared with those for the control group was in which tet and ha were mixed immediately before the reaction 1 mm phosphate buffer solution was added to control the ph 7 5 0 5 during the reaction then the oxidants 100 µm ps 50 µm pms and 200 µm h2o2 were added to the solution following this step 254 nm uv irradiation 30 w low pressure mercury lamp philips holland was turned on to start the reaction at each time interval 1 ml sample aliquots were taken and quenched with 15 μl 1 m sodium thiosulfate for tet analysis all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods ftir spectroscopy 100 ml of equilibrated tet ha complexes with 10 mg l ha and 0 10 mg l tet were processed using a freeze dry method and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher nicolet is5 all ftir spectra were collected in a 400 4000 cm 1 range and corrected by pure kbr with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the ftir spectra were interpreted using two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis with 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan to reveal the sensitivity and extent of ha tet binding through the application of synchronous and asynchronous maps xu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 1h nmr spectra 1h nmr experiments were performed with a bruker avance 400 mhz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer 2 mg l tet and 0 8 mg l ha were dissolved in d2o and the solutions with equilibrated ha tet complexation were used in the 1h nmr measurements zhao et al 2019 the 1h nmr spectra were obtained for the mass ratio of ha and tet from 0 5 to 4 fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor changes in the fluorescence of ha caused by different oxidation processes fluorescence time scans were performed using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer immediately after the oxidants were added the reaction solution containing 10 mg l ha and 0 100 μm tet was placed into a quartz cuvette and changes of its fluorescence intensity were monitored over a 3600 s period the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 275 nm and 465 nm respectively and the delay time was set at 1 s since tet has no fluorescence response and the concentration of tet is relatively small the internal filtration effect is not considered in this study hplc analysis tet concentrations were measured by an hplc system waters e2695 equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column 4 6 150 mm at the column temperature of 35 c and a uv visible detection waters 2489 at 355 nm the mobile phase was maintained at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min with a constant ratio 20 mm h3po4 acetonitrile 80 20 other analyses changes of the uv vis absorption spectra of tet ha solutions over time were recorded by a uv vis spectrometer mapada uv 1800 in the range of 200 500 nm total organic carbon toc concentrations were determined using a multi n c 3100 analyzer analytikjena 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of binding on the tet degradation in different oxidation processes the apparent first order reaction rate kobs of tet degradation in the tet ha group containing both free and ha bound tet and non bound tet group containing free tet only in uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 oxidation processes were compared to explore the influence of the tet ha binding on the degradation of tet fig 1 shows that the tet ha complexation reduced the kobs of tet degradation as the concentration of tet increased from 1 25 to 20 µm the difference of apparent reaction rate δkobs knon bound kbound decreased in all three oxidation processes fig 1a c this may be attributed to the fact that the concentration of bound micropollutants would reach saturation with the increase of micropollutants dosage yan et al 2014 resulting in a decrease in the relative proportion of bound tet additionally the magnitude of the δkobs values determined for different reactive oxidation species ros and oxidants followed the order of uv pms uv ps uv h2o2 effects of ha concentration on the δkobs of tet degradation were also investigated fig 1e and f as opposed to the trend observed for increasing tet concentrations δkobs and ha concentration showed a positive correlation in uv ps and uv pms processes but a more complicated relationship in uv h2o2 process although the concentration of the bound tet increased with the increase of ha concentration the higher levels of ha also block the uv light and weaken the activation of oxidants to generate free radicals especially in uv h2o2 process for that single h2o2 exhibited limited oxidation potential for tet compared to pms or ps fig s2 zhou et al 2020 the δkobs kcontrol ratios determined for the direct oxidation by the alternative oxidants ps pms and h2o2 uv photolysis and uv oxidants processes were also compared and the results showed that the binding affected the uv oxidants process most significantly followed by uv photolysis and direction oxidation by the applied oxidants alone fig s3 3 2 effect of charge constituents on the electrostatic interactions of binding considering that the speciation of tet is dominated by tet tet species at ph 7 7 while the deprotonation of ha functional groups tends to result in the accumulation of negative charges of the ha molecules yang et al 2020 the effects of electrostatic interactions between dom and tet molecules were examined as well as illustrated in fig s4a the concentration of ha bound tet decreased from 0 78 to 0 58 µm as the is increased from 0 001 to 0 1 m this is likely to be a result of the compression of the electric double layer of the ha molecules at increasing is and the attendant increase of the competition from the background na ions in the electrostatic binding of tet additionally with the increase of is the δkobs kcontrol and removal rate of tet degradation decreased gradually figs 2 a and s6a which showed a significant linear relationship with the bound concentration of tet fig 2c the influence of the hardness cations ca2 and mg2 was examined as well the results of these experiments showed that the tet ha binding was promoted in the presence of ca2 and mg2 fig s4b prior research has reported that tet forms strong tet ca2 and tet mg2 complexes fig s5 zhou et al 2020 these complexes appear to interact more strongly than the free tet cations and or zwitterion with the negatively charged ha via electrostatic interactions christl et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 it is also possible that ca2 or mg2 may bind with both tet and ha functional groups and thus form bridging tet ca2 ha or tet mg2 ha complexes however the concentration of the bound tet in the presence of mg2 was higher than that of ca2 which was ascribed to that the form of tet ca2 would cause an increase of tet s acidity and further weakened the binding interaction werner et al 2006 wessels et al 1998 due to the increase of the bound tet concentration induced by the presence of ca2 or mg2 the δkobs kcontrol of tet degradation increased gradually and possessed a positive correlation with the bound concentration figs 2b d and s6b 3 3 spectroscopic analysis on interactions involved in tet has binding the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of ha samples showed one characteristic fluorescence peak with ex em 250 300 400 500 nm while tet had no fluorescence fig s7 to explore the binding interaction between tet and ha changes in the fluorescence intensity of ha were monitored in the presence of varying tet concentrations as shown in fig 3 a with the tet concentration increasing from 0 to 100 µm the fluorescence intensity decreased by 82 inset of fig 3a the extent of the observed quenching of ha fluorescence by tet indicates the presence of strong tet ha complexation bi et al 2016 ren et al 2017 given that the tet ha binding can affect the absorbance spectra of this system changes in the intensity of the zero order absorption spectra of tet ha solutions were monitored over time fig s8 due to the presence of consistent but relatively minor changes of the absorbance spectra associated with the tet ha interactions differential spectroscopy calculations eq 2 were applied to discern the effect of the binding interaction in more detail yan et al 2015 fig 3b shows that two predominant peaks of tet ha chromophores located at 285 and 400 nm respectively and the intensity of the former increased with time more than the latter inset of fig 3b this demonstrates that the chromophores associated with the absorbance at shorter wavelengths are more sensitive to the formation of tet ha complexes xu et al 2018 2 δ a t a t a 0 here δat at and a0 are the differential uv vis absorption uv vis absorption at binding time t and 0 h respectively 3 4 elucidation of ha and tet binding sites the ftir spectra of ha tet and ha tet complexes formed at varying tet ha ratios were measured to gain insight into the nature of the functional groups involved in the complexation fig 4 a the band between 1104 and 1040 cm 1 was assigned to stretching vibrations of phenolic co and oh νcophen ren et al 2017 vibration lines located at 1386 cm 1 1585 cm 1 and 1720 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetric stretch νcoo s and antisymmetric stretch νcoo as of carboxylate coo and the stretch of carboxylic acid c o νcocarb respectively while 1620 cm 1 corresponded to the stretch of ketone c o νcoketo pan et al 2012 yan et al 2013 the weak peaks located at 1454 and 1356 cm 1 were identified as those corresponding to the cn stretching vibration νcn and nh twisting τnh respectively bai et al 2017 this attribution is consistent with the ftir spectra of pure tet compared to the pristine ha the transmission intensity of the 1104 1040 and 1720 1585 cm 1 lines decreased when the ratio of ha tet increased from 1 0 4 to 1 1 showing that the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were involved in the binding additionally the subtle increase of the 1454 cm 1 and 1356 cm 1 lines demonstrated the formation of tet ha complexes li et al 2018 1h nmr spectra of tet ha complexes were obtained to further explore the binding sites of tet the number of hydrogens and the structure of tet are shown in fig s1 fig 4b shows that the chemical shift δ of d2o was located at 4 7 ppm the aliphatic proton signals were in the range from 1 to 4 7 and δ 6 9 ppm corresponded to the double bond and aromatic protons schlecht and frank 1973 sousa et al 2012 due to the larger chemical shifts 10 ppm and lower signal response the proton signals of the oh and nh2 were not detected garro linck et al 2011 since the binding interaction between tet and ha limited the migration of tet molecules and gave the excited protons a faster relaxation rate the proton signals weakened broadened and the chemical shift moved significantly up field for tet ha complexes subsequently the split lines h7 h8 and h9 merged into a single line with the gradual increase of the ha tet ratio šmejkalová and piccolo 2008 zhao et al 2019 the chemical shift changes δδ of h protons of the tet molecules were analyzed to further confirm the bound sites of the tet molecules fig s9 demonstrates that the chemical shift of h4 and h4 shifted up field dramatically with the increase ha dosages suggesting that the tet ha binding strongly involved the n ch3 2 groups in the tet molecules this observation is in agreement with the ftir results discussed above to further investigate the nature of the functional groups involved in tet binding 2d cos analysis of the ftir spectra was carried out three positive autopeaks intensity order 1104 1010 cm 1 1720 1585 cm 1 1454 1356 cm 1 were located at the diagonal line on the synchronous map fig 5 a suggesting that the phenolic groups were more sensitive to the binding than the carboxyl groups there are two negative crosspeaks 1720 1585 1454 1356 cm 1 and 1454 1356 1104 1010 cm 1 and one positive crosspeak 1720 1585 1104 1010 cm 1 in the synchronous map table s1 demonstrating that the change direction of νcn and τnh was different from phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl as the addition of tet from the asynchronous map fig 5b two positive crosspeaks 1720 1585 1104 1010 cm 1 and 1454 1356 1104 1010 cm 1 and one negative crosspeak 1720 1585 1454 1356 cm 1 appeared above the diagonal line based on noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 it can be concluded that the relative sensitivity of ha functional groups to tet binding was carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl huang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 3 5 comparison of the degradation of free and bound tet in different oxidation processes the evolution of the differential absorbance spectra for the tet ha group solutions in several oxidation processes is shown in fig 6 compared to the differential absorbance spectra of single ha fig s10 the degradation of tet ha was tracked using 285 nm and 360 nm wavelengths the differential absorbance at 285 nm was indicative of the bound tet according to fig 3b while the differential absorbance at 360 nm was deemed to be associated with the degradation of free tet based on fig s8 as illustrated in fig 6a d the absorption peaks at 285 nm decreasing order uv ps uv pms uv h2o2 uv and 360 nm decreasing order uv pms uv ps uv h2o2 uv pms ps decreased with time inset of fig 6 indicating that both bound and free tet molecules were degraded during the reaction which was similar to the results of raeke s photolysis study of the carbamazepine in the presence of dom raeke et al 2017 by comparing the decrease rates of absorbance at both 285 and 360 nm table s2 it can be concluded that both the bound and free tet molecules were degraded simultaneously in the uv ps process their degradation rates were close 3 32 10 4 and 3 56 10 4 the degradation of free tet took place faster than that of the bound tet by uv pms uv h2o2 and uv processes as was indicated by the more prominent decreases of the absorbance at 360 nm compared with that at 285 nm table 1 additionally the comparison of the apparent rates of the decrease of absorbance at 285 nm in the uv 8 04 10 5 uv h2o2 1 42 10 4 and uv ps 3 32 10 4 processes shows that both sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh are likely to contribute to the degradation of the bound tet however in the case of ps or pms oxidations in the absence of uv irradiation fig 6e and f only the peak located at 360 nm was observed to evolve compared to the emergence of the double peaks with the maxima at 285 and 360 nm in the uv oxidants processes this indicated that only free tet rather than both free and bound tet was degraded in the single ps or pms oxidations considering that both tet binding and the oxidative degradation of ha can affect ha fluorescence fluorescence time scans were employed to monitor ha fluorescence changes during the oxidation fig 7 compares changes in the fluorescence of the tet ha group containing ha bound tet and free tet and the ha group in uv ps uv pms uv h2o2 and uv oxidations table s3 shows that the relative fluorescence intensity of ha decreased gradually both in tet ha 0 077 s 1 and ha 0 098 s 1 solutions in the uv ps process fig 7a and b this suggested that ha was degraded in these two systems compared to the single ha group a lower fluorescence reduction rate in tet ha group was observed indicating that ros in this situation were consumed by both tet and ha for the uv pms process changes of the fluorescence proceeded in two stages involving the initial slow phase 0 012 s 1 and relatively fast reaction phase 0 092 s 1 in tet ha group fig 7c and d this demonstrated that tet was preferentially oxidized in the initial phase following which ha was degraded in the uv pms process table 1 however in uv h2o2 and uv processes fig 7e h the fluorescence of ha gradually increased in the tet ha group prior studies have reported that the binding interaction between antibiotics and dom could effectively quench the intrinsic fluorescence of dissolved organic matter via static quenching bi et al 2016 wang et al 2015 dong et al 2021 since tet could not exhibit the fluorescence performance the tet ha complexation could be adopted to investigate the fluorescence evolution of ha the formation of tet ha complexation effectively quenched the fluorescence of ha but the bound tet could also be released from the tet ha complexes due to oxidative destruction or the breaking of the binding balance during the uv h2o2 and uv processes which resulted in the fluorescence increase of ha this was followed by the oxidation of ha leading to the consecutive decrease of its fluorescence since uv could activate h2o2 to generate oh the fluorescence increase rate of the tet ha group was higher in the uv h2o2 process 0 094 s 1 than that of the uv process 0 087 s 1 based on the difference of uv vis spectra and fluorescence time scanning spectra the degradation of the tet ha group containing free tet bound tet and ha took place sequentially in the following order free tet bound tet ha in uv pms uv h2o2 and uv processes while free tet bound tet and ha were degraded simultaneously in the uv ps process 3 6 determination of the roles of ros in the degradation of tet based on the resonance energy transfer theory of förster sklar et al 1977 the occurrence of energy transfer could be judged by the degree of overlap between the fluorescence emission spectrum of ha donor and the uv vis absorbance spectrum of the tet acceptor bi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 as shown in fig s11 the lower spectral overlaps suggested a lower possibility of the energy transfer between ha and tet therefore to probe the mechanism of degradation for the ha bound and free tet molecules methyl alcohol ma kma oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 kma so4 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 liang and su 2009 and tert butyl alcohol tba ktba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2019 were used as free radical scavengers to determine the roles of free radicals in tet degradation fig s12 fig 8 a and d show that as the concentration of tba and ma increased from 0 to 100 mm the kobs decreased from 0 029 min 1 to 0 015 min 1 and 0 012 min 1 respectively indicating that both oh and so4 played a critical role in the uv ps process in the uv pms oxidation the kobs only decreased to 0 024 and 0 019 min 1 with the increase of tba and ma concentration while the kobs of individual pms oxidant was up to 0 016 min 1 fig 8b and e this indicated that pms had a high ability to oxidize tet which was consistent with the previous studies zhou et al 2020 however uv pyrolysis played a leading role in tet degradation in the uv h2o2 process due to the fast quenching effect of ha on oh fig 8c and f lutze et al 2015 the contribution of ros to tet degradation was estimated using eqs 3 7 ren et al 2017 results of these calculations table 2 show that uv ps pms oh and so4 were all involved in tet degradation nevertheless the leading roles in tet degradation in the uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 processes had free radicals pms oxidant and uv respectively this observation is in agreement with the results of fluorescence time scans and differential absorbance spectra 3 r uv k uv k control 4 r oxidants k oxidants k control

or h2o2 oh and two free radicals both oh and so4 to tet degradation respectively the kcontrol ktba kma and kuv are the apparent first order reaction rate of tet degradation in the control group experimental groups with the addition of tba and ma and only by uv irradiation respectively rcalcul oxidants is the contribution of oxidants calculated through the radicals quenching experiments and ideally it should be equal to roxidants comparing rcalcul oxidants with roxidants can help us check the reliability of our calculation method 4 conclusions the binding interactions of tet with ha were demonstrated to have the potential for inhibiting the oxidative transformation of tet in the environment for the first time in our study the δkobs decreased with the increasing tet dosages while was negatively correlated with is ftir and 2d cos analyses show that the carboxyl groups of ha exhibited that the binding priority for tet followed by the phenolic groups despite that phenolic groups were quantitatively more involved in the binding interactions 1h nmr data showed that the n ch3 2 sites in tet molecules were involved in the binding of ha free radicals oh and so4 pms oxidant and uv irradiation were identified as the key contributors to the degradation of tet in the uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 processes in situ time fluorescence scanning and the differential absorbance spectra showed that in the absence of uv irradiation ps and pms could degrade only free tet in the tet ha mixed systems while uv irradiation oh and so4 could degrade free tet bound tet and ha the degradation sensitivity of those pollutants with varied forms followed the order of free tet bound tet ha in the uv pms uv h2o2 and uv processes in comparison free tet bound tet and ha were assumed to be oxidized simultaneously in the uv ps process this study provided new insights into the role of binding with humic acid on the oxidative transformation of tet these results are important in the context of

16760,the binding between dissolved organic matter dom and micro pollutants mps results in significant impacts on their migration transformation and degradation however the role of the dom mp binding on their oxidative transformation remains poorly studied the binding of mps by dom in combination with dom s roles as a photosensitizer and or a competitor for free radicals needs to be considered in the context of understanding the dom s impacts on the oxidative degradation of mps this study aims to explore this aspect of dom mp interactions based on the quantitation of humic acid ha and tetracycline tet complexation and its role in tet removal this study also compared the degradation of free tet versus that bound in ha tet complexes in different oxidation processes fourier transform infrared ftir data show that the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in ha are the main binding sites of tet while nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis shows the binding of tet engages its n ch3 2 groups and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos data show that the carboxyl groups in dom are sensitive than phenolic groups in the binding of tet the difference between the degradation rates δkobs of the free and bound tet decreased with the increase of ionic strength using sodium nitrate but increased with the introduction of ca2 and mg2 due to the formation of tet ca2 mg2 complexes quenching experiments showed that the free radicals oh and so4 pms oxidant and uv light were the main contributors to the tet degradation in uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 processes respectively in situ fluorescence time scanning and differential absorbance spectra showed that free tet was preferentially oxidized over the bound tet in all the tested treatments except uv ps these results

acid bound tetracycline chemical transformation 1 introduction the antibiotic tetracycline tet has been extensively used in animal husbandry medical practice and aquaculture to treat a broad range of bacterial infections ma et al 2020 however approximately 30 90 of the ingested tet molecules are released into the environment via the discharge of animal manure and wastewater effluent sarmah et al 2006 this results in a high level of residual tet concentration in the raw influent 1 24 12 34 μg l and soils 86 199 mg kg hamscher et al 2002 lindsey et al 2001 the presence of tet could lead to bacterial resistance and thus pose a threat to many ecosystems and human health gilliver et al 1999 laxminarayan et al 2013 therefore the environmental effects of tet s presence and its fate in aquatic ecosystems are drawing increasing attention mao et al 2015 tet possesses multiple ionizable moieties and it can form four main species denoted as tet tet tet and tet2 in aquatic environments whose formation is governed by the respective ionization constants pka1 3 3 pka2 7 7 pka3 9 7 fig s1 christl et al 2016 the protonated and zwitterionic tet species can be engaged in electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged molecules of dom which has a complex supramolecular structure that comprises aromatic and aliphatic units with functional groups oh cooh and c o kim et al 2017 the binding with dom has been shown to affect tet s migration and reactivity in aquatic environments and water treatment processes niu et al 2016 sibley and pedersen 2008 prior research has shown that the mp dom interactions impact their adsorption and oxidative degradation xie et al 2019 conventional oxidation processes tend to target mps in their free state in such processes dom acts as an electron donor or a competitor of reactive oxygen species ros with attendant effects of dom on the degradation efficiency of the target mps zhao et al 2021 only a few studies have focused on the formation physicochemical properties and removal efficiency of mps in their bound state jia et al 2020 lutze et al 2015 wenk et al 2013 prior studies on dom mp interactions and their role in environmental processes have mainly focused on the natural light assisted degradation pathways where dom acts as a photosensitizer that can be excited to generate oxygen active substances such as singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and 3dom which accelerate the indirect cooperative oxidation of coexisting pollutants li et al 2016 mangalgiri and blaney 2017 ren et al 2017 in recent years emerging advanced oxidation technologies have examined the performance of the activation of hydrogen peroxide and persulfates to produce oh e0 2 8 v and so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v whose action results in high efficiency degradation of many mps antoniou et al 2010 fang et al 2020 guo et al 2016 2017 yang et al 2019 previous studies have indicated that the concentration of mps bound in complexes with dom can reach up to 100 300 μmol l per g l dissolved organic carbon chu et al 2015 ren et al 2017 additionally the kinetics of oxidative degradation of various forms of free and bound mps in systems potentially dominated by dom mp interactions in different oxidation processes has not been sufficiently studied given that only few studies have explored mp dom binding effects on the oxidative degradation of mps this study aimed to elucidate the role of the binding between tet and humic acid ha in the degradation of tet in different oxidation processes uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 the ha tet binding was characterized by fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy the nature of the binding sites involved in ha tet complexation was ascertained via ftir and 1h nmr analyses data of in situ fluorescence time scans and differential absorbance spectra were generated to compare the reactivity of free tet and ha tet complexes and determine the contribution of ros in the examined oxidation processes based on the use of appropriate probes effects of tet and ha concentrations ionic strength is and metal ions on the degradation rates of the free and bound tet were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents humic acid ha permonosulfate pms persulfate ps and deuterium oxide d2o were purchased from sigma aldrich tetracycline was supplied from tci shanghai development co ltd hydrogen peroxide 30 tert butyl alcohol tba and methyl alcohol ma were obtained from aladdin industrial corporation sodium thiosulfate sodium nitrate nitric acid and sodium hydroxide were purchased from kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china all the reagents were analytic grade and all solutions were prepared with deionized di water 2 2 experimental procedures stock solution of ha 0 5 g ha powder was added to 500 ml 0 001 m sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and stirred at 100 rpm for 12 h in the dark to maximize the dissolution of ha the prepared ha solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous filter membrane to remove residual particulate matter ren et al 2017 then the ha filtrate was adjusted to ph 7 5 with 0 001 m nitric acid solution and stored in the dark at 4 c for later use afe 28 ph meter was used for ph measurements binding experiments spectra por 6 dialysis bags spectrum laboratories with a 1000 da cut off molecular weight were used to quantify the bound concentration of tet i e the concentration of tet complexed with ha maoz and chefetz 2010 the dialysis bags containing 5 ml ha stock solution were placed in 100 ml of reaction solution with 5 µm tet and the ionic strength is 0 001 0 1 m was adjusted by nano3 then the reaction solution was placed on a shaking bed at 40 r min for 48 h in the dark to establish tet ha equilibria and reach dialysis balance finally the inside and outside solutions of the dialysis bag were taken for hplc analysis to measure tet concentration the bound concentration cbound of tet was calculated based on eq 1 qiao et al 2011 1 c bound c in c out where cin and cout μm are the tet concentration of the inside and outside the dialysis bag cbound μm is the bound concentration degradation experiments the concentrations of tet and ha were varied between 1 25 20 µm and 0 20 mg l respectively solutions with equilibrated tet ha complexation the bound tet ha group were prepared by mixing the requisite amounts of tet and ha stock solutions for 12 h in the dark the data for these solutions were compared with those for the control group was in which tet and ha were mixed immediately before the reaction 1 mm phosphate buffer solution was added to control the ph 7 5 0 5 during the reaction then the oxidants 100 µm ps 50 µm pms and 200 µm h2o2 were added to the solution following this step 254 nm uv irradiation 30 w low pressure mercury lamp philips holland was turned on to start the reaction at each time interval 1 ml sample aliquots were taken and quenched with 15 μl 1 m sodium thiosulfate for tet analysis all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods ftir spectroscopy 100 ml of equilibrated tet ha complexes with 10 mg l ha and 0 10 mg l tet were processed using a freeze dry method and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher nicolet is5 all ftir spectra were collected in a 400 4000 cm 1 range and corrected by pure kbr with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the ftir spectra were interpreted using two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis with 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan to reveal the sensitivity and extent of ha tet binding through the application of synchronous and asynchronous maps xu et al 2018 yan et al 2019 1h nmr spectra 1h nmr experiments were performed with a bruker avance 400 mhz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer 2 mg l tet and 0 8 mg l ha were dissolved in d2o and the solutions with equilibrated ha tet complexation were used in the 1h nmr measurements zhao et al 2019 the 1h nmr spectra were obtained for the mass ratio of ha and tet from 0 5 to 4 fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor changes in the fluorescence of ha caused by different oxidation processes fluorescence time scans were performed using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer immediately after the oxidants were added the reaction solution containing 10 mg l ha and 0 100 μm tet was placed into a quartz cuvette and changes of its fluorescence intensity were monitored over a 3600 s period the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 275 nm and 465 nm respectively and the delay time was set at 1 s since tet has no fluorescence response and the concentration of tet is relatively small the internal filtration effect is not considered in this study hplc analysis tet concentrations were measured by an hplc system waters e2695 equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column 4 6 150 mm at the column temperature of 35 c and a uv visible detection waters 2489 at 355 nm the mobile phase was maintained at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min with a constant ratio 20 mm h3po4 acetonitrile 80 20 other analyses changes of the uv vis absorption spectra of tet ha solutions over time were recorded by a uv vis spectrometer mapada uv 1800 in the range of 200 500 nm total organic carbon toc concentrations were determined using a multi n c 3100 analyzer analytikjena 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of binding on the tet degradation in different oxidation processes the apparent first order reaction rate kobs of tet degradation in the tet ha group containing both free and ha bound tet and non bound tet group containing free tet only in uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 oxidation processes were compared to explore the influence of the tet ha binding on the degradation of tet fig 1 shows that the tet ha complexation reduced the kobs of tet degradation as the concentration of tet increased from 1 25 to 20 µm the difference of apparent reaction rate δkobs knon bound kbound decreased in all three oxidation processes fig 1a c this may be attributed to the fact that the concentration of bound micropollutants would reach saturation with the increase of micropollutants dosage yan et al 2014 resulting in a decrease in the relative proportion of bound tet additionally the magnitude of the δkobs values determined for different reactive oxidation species ros and oxidants followed the order of uv pms uv ps uv h2o2 effects of ha concentration on the δkobs of tet degradation were also investigated fig 1e and f as opposed to the trend observed for increasing tet concentrations δkobs and ha concentration showed a positive correlation in uv ps and uv pms processes but a more complicated relationship in uv h2o2 process although the concentration of the bound tet increased with the increase of ha concentration the higher levels of ha also block the uv light and weaken the activation of oxidants to generate free radicals especially in uv h2o2 process for that single h2o2 exhibited limited oxidation potential for tet compared to pms or ps fig s2 zhou et al 2020 the δkobs kcontrol ratios determined for the direct oxidation by the alternative oxidants ps pms and h2o2 uv photolysis and uv oxidants processes were also compared and the results showed that the binding affected the uv oxidants process most significantly followed by uv photolysis and direction oxidation by the applied oxidants alone fig s3 3 2 effect of charge constituents on the electrostatic interactions of binding considering that the speciation of tet is dominated by tet tet species at ph 7 7 while the deprotonation of ha functional groups tends to result in the accumulation of negative charges of the ha molecules yang et al 2020 the effects of electrostatic interactions between dom and tet molecules were examined as well as illustrated in fig s4a the concentration of ha bound tet decreased from 0 78 to 0 58 µm as the is increased from 0 001 to 0 1 m this is likely to be a result of the compression of the electric double layer of the ha molecules at increasing is and the attendant increase of the competition from the background na ions in the electrostatic binding of tet additionally with the increase of is the δkobs kcontrol and removal rate of tet degradation decreased gradually figs 2 a and s6a which showed a significant linear relationship with the bound concentration of tet fig 2c the influence of the hardness cations ca2 and mg2 was examined as well the results of these experiments showed that the tet ha binding was promoted in the presence of ca2 and mg2 fig s4b prior research has reported that tet forms strong tet ca2 and tet mg2 complexes fig s5 zhou et al 2020 these complexes appear to interact more strongly than the free tet cations and or zwitterion with the negatively charged ha via electrostatic interactions christl et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 it is also possible that ca2 or mg2 may bind with both tet and ha functional groups and thus form bridging tet ca2 ha or tet mg2 ha complexes however the concentration of the bound tet in the presence of mg2 was higher than that of ca2 which was ascribed to that the form of tet ca2 would cause an increase of tet s acidity and further weakened the binding interaction werner et al 2006 wessels et al 1998 due to the increase of the bound tet concentration induced by the presence of ca2 or mg2 the δkobs kcontrol of tet degradation increased gradually and possessed a positive correlation with the bound concentration figs 2b d and s6b 3 3 spectroscopic analysis on interactions involved in tet has binding the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of ha samples showed one characteristic fluorescence peak with ex em 250 300 400 500 nm while tet had no fluorescence fig s7 to explore the binding interaction between tet and ha changes in the fluorescence intensity of ha were monitored in the presence of varying tet concentrations as shown in fig 3 a with the tet concentration increasing from 0 to 100 µm the fluorescence intensity decreased by 82 inset of fig 3a the extent of the observed quenching of ha fluorescence by tet indicates the presence of strong tet ha complexation bi et al 2016 ren et al 2017 given that the tet ha binding can affect the absorbance spectra of this system changes in the intensity of the zero order absorption spectra of tet ha solutions were monitored over time fig s8 due to the presence of consistent but relatively minor changes of the absorbance spectra associated with the tet ha interactions differential spectroscopy calculations eq 2 were applied to discern the effect of the binding interaction in more detail yan et al 2015 fig 3b shows that two predominant peaks of tet ha chromophores located at 285 and 400 nm respectively and the intensity of the former increased with time more than the latter inset of fig 3b this demonstrates that the chromophores associated with the absorbance at shorter wavelengths are more sensitive to the formation of tet ha complexes xu et al 2018 2 δ a t a t a 0 here δat at and a0 are the differential uv vis absorption uv vis absorption at binding time t and 0 h respectively 3 4 elucidation of ha and tet binding sites the ftir spectra of ha tet and ha tet complexes formed at varying tet ha ratios were measured to gain insight into the nature of the functional groups involved in the complexation fig 4 a the band between 1104 and 1040 cm 1 was assigned to stretching vibrations of phenolic co and oh νcophen ren et al 2017 vibration lines located at 1386 cm 1 1585 cm 1 and 1720 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetric stretch νcoo s and antisymmetric stretch νcoo as of carboxylate coo and the stretch of carboxylic acid c o νcocarb respectively while 1620 cm 1 corresponded to the stretch of ketone c o νcoketo pan et al 2012 yan et al 2013 the weak peaks located at 1454 and 1356 cm 1 were identified as those corresponding to the cn stretching vibration νcn and nh twisting τnh respectively bai et al 2017 this attribution is consistent with the ftir spectra of pure tet compared to the pristine ha the transmission intensity of the 1104 1040 and 1720 1585 cm 1 lines decreased when the ratio of ha tet increased from 1 0 4 to 1 1 showing that the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were involved in the binding additionally the subtle increase of the 1454 cm 1 and 1356 cm 1 lines demonstrated the formation of tet ha complexes li et al 2018 1h nmr spectra of tet ha complexes were obtained to further explore the binding sites of tet the number of hydrogens and the structure of tet are shown in fig s1 fig 4b shows that the chemical shift δ of d2o was located at 4 7 ppm the aliphatic proton signals were in the range from 1 to 4 7 and δ 6 9 ppm corresponded to the double bond and aromatic protons schlecht and frank 1973 sousa et al 2012 due to the larger chemical shifts 10 ppm and lower signal response the proton signals of the oh and nh2 were not detected garro linck et al 2011 since the binding interaction between tet and ha limited the migration of tet molecules and gave the excited protons a faster relaxation rate the proton signals weakened broadened and the chemical shift moved significantly up field for tet ha complexes subsequently the split lines h7 h8 and h9 merged into a single line with the gradual increase of the ha tet ratio šmejkalová and piccolo 2008 zhao et al 2019 the chemical shift changes δδ of h protons of the tet molecules were analyzed to further confirm the bound sites of the tet molecules fig s9 demonstrates that the chemical shift of h4 and h4 shifted up field dramatically with the increase ha dosages suggesting that the tet ha binding strongly involved the n ch3 2 groups in the tet molecules this observation is in agreement with the ftir results discussed above to further investigate the nature of the functional groups involved in tet binding 2d cos analysis of the ftir spectra was carried out three positive autopeaks intensity order 1104 1010 cm 1 1720 1585 cm 1 1454 1356 cm 1 were located at the diagonal line on the synchronous map fig 5 a suggesting that the phenolic groups were more sensitive to the binding than the carboxyl groups there are two negative crosspeaks 1720 1585 1454 1356 cm 1 and 1454 1356 1104 1010 cm 1 and one positive crosspeak 1720 1585 1104 1010 cm 1 in the synchronous map table s1 demonstrating that the change direction of νcn and τnh was different from phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl as the addition of tet from the asynchronous map fig 5b two positive crosspeaks 1720 1585 1104 1010 cm 1 and 1454 1356 1104 1010 cm 1 and one negative crosspeak 1720 1585 1454 1356 cm 1 appeared above the diagonal line based on noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 it can be concluded that the relative sensitivity of ha functional groups to tet binding was carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl huang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 3 5 comparison of the degradation of free and bound tet in different oxidation processes the evolution of the differential absorbance spectra for the tet ha group solutions in several oxidation processes is shown in fig 6 compared to the differential absorbance spectra of single ha fig s10 the degradation of tet ha was tracked using 285 nm and 360 nm wavelengths the differential absorbance at 285 nm was indicative of the bound tet according to fig 3b while the differential absorbance at 360 nm was deemed to be associated with the degradation of free tet based on fig s8 as illustrated in fig 6a d the absorption peaks at 285 nm decreasing order uv ps uv pms uv h2o2 uv and 360 nm decreasing order uv pms uv ps uv h2o2 uv pms ps decreased with time inset of fig 6 indicating that both bound and free tet molecules were degraded during the reaction which was similar to the results of raeke s photolysis study of the carbamazepine in the presence of dom raeke et al 2017 by comparing the decrease rates of absorbance at both 285 and 360 nm table s2 it can be concluded that both the bound and free tet molecules were degraded simultaneously in the uv ps process their degradation rates were close 3 32 10 4 and 3 56 10 4 the degradation of free tet took place faster than that of the bound tet by uv pms uv h2o2 and uv processes as was indicated by the more prominent decreases of the absorbance at 360 nm compared with that at 285 nm table 1 additionally the comparison of the apparent rates of the decrease of absorbance at 285 nm in the uv 8 04 10 5 uv h2o2 1 42 10 4 and uv ps 3 32 10 4 processes shows that both sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh are likely to contribute to the degradation of the bound tet however in the case of ps or pms oxidations in the absence of uv irradiation fig 6e and f only the peak located at 360 nm was observed to evolve compared to the emergence of the double peaks with the maxima at 285 and 360 nm in the uv oxidants processes this indicated that only free tet rather than both free and bound tet was degraded in the single ps or pms oxidations considering that both tet binding and the oxidative degradation of ha can affect ha fluorescence fluorescence time scans were employed to monitor ha fluorescence changes during the oxidation fig 7 compares changes in the fluorescence of the tet ha group containing ha bound tet and free tet and the ha group in uv ps uv pms uv h2o2 and uv oxidations table s3 shows that the relative fluorescence intensity of ha decreased gradually both in tet ha 0 077 s 1 and ha 0 098 s 1 solutions in the uv ps process fig 7a and b this suggested that ha was degraded in these two systems compared to the single ha group a lower fluorescence reduction rate in tet ha group was observed indicating that ros in this situation were consumed by both tet and ha for the uv pms process changes of the fluorescence proceeded in two stages involving the initial slow phase 0 012 s 1 and relatively fast reaction phase 0 092 s 1 in tet ha group fig 7c and d this demonstrated that tet was preferentially oxidized in the initial phase following which ha was degraded in the uv pms process table 1 however in uv h2o2 and uv processes fig 7e h the fluorescence of ha gradually increased in the tet ha group prior studies have reported that the binding interaction between antibiotics and dom could effectively quench the intrinsic fluorescence of dissolved organic matter via static quenching bi et al 2016 wang et al 2015 dong et al 2021 since tet could not exhibit the fluorescence performance the tet ha complexation could be adopted to investigate the fluorescence evolution of ha the formation of tet ha complexation effectively quenched the fluorescence of ha but the bound tet could also be released from the tet ha complexes due to oxidative destruction or the breaking of the binding balance during the uv h2o2 and uv processes which resulted in the fluorescence increase of ha this was followed by the oxidation of ha leading to the consecutive decrease of its fluorescence since uv could activate h2o2 to generate oh the fluorescence increase rate of the tet ha group was higher in the uv h2o2 process 0 094 s 1 than that of the uv process 0 087 s 1 based on the difference of uv vis spectra and fluorescence time scanning spectra the degradation of the tet ha group containing free tet bound tet and ha took place sequentially in the following order free tet bound tet ha in uv pms uv h2o2 and uv processes while free tet bound tet and ha were degraded simultaneously in the uv ps process 3 6 determination of the roles of ros in the degradation of tet based on the resonance energy transfer theory of förster sklar et al 1977 the occurrence of energy transfer could be judged by the degree of overlap between the fluorescence emission spectrum of ha donor and the uv vis absorbance spectrum of the tet acceptor bi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 as shown in fig s11 the lower spectral overlaps suggested a lower possibility of the energy transfer between ha and tet therefore to probe the mechanism of degradation for the ha bound and free tet molecules methyl alcohol ma kma oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 kma so4 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 liang and su 2009 and tert butyl alcohol tba ktba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2019 were used as free radical scavengers to determine the roles of free radicals in tet degradation fig s12 fig 8 a and d show that as the concentration of tba and ma increased from 0 to 100 mm the kobs decreased from 0 029 min 1 to 0 015 min 1 and 0 012 min 1 respectively indicating that both oh and so4 played a critical role in the uv ps process in the uv pms oxidation the kobs only decreased to 0 024 and 0 019 min 1 with the increase of tba and ma concentration while the kobs of individual pms oxidant was up to 0 016 min 1 fig 8b and e this indicated that pms had a high ability to oxidize tet which was consistent with the previous studies zhou et al 2020 however uv pyrolysis played a leading role in tet degradation in the uv h2o2 process due to the fast quenching effect of ha on oh fig 8c and f lutze et al 2015 the contribution of ros to tet degradation was estimated using eqs 3 7 ren et al 2017 results of these calculations table 2 show that uv ps pms oh and so4 were all involved in tet degradation nevertheless the leading roles in tet degradation in the uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 processes had free radicals pms oxidant and uv respectively this observation is in agreement with the results of fluorescence time scans and differential absorbance spectra 3 r uv k uv k control 4 r oxidants k oxidants k control 5 r tba k control k t b a k control 6 r ma k control k ma k control 7 r calcul oxidants k ma k uv k control in the above equations ruv roxidants rtba and rma are the contribution of uv oxidants ps pms or h2o2 oh and two free radicals both oh and so4 to tet degradation respectively the kcontrol ktba kma and kuv are the apparent first order reaction rate of tet degradation in the control group experimental groups with the addition of tba and ma and only by uv irradiation respectively rcalcul oxidants is the contribution of oxidants calculated through the radicals quenching experiments and ideally it should be equal to roxidants comparing rcalcul oxidants with roxidants can help us check the reliability of our calculation method 4 conclusions the binding interactions of tet with ha were demonstrated to have the potential for inhibiting the oxidative transformation of tet in the environment for the first time in our study the δkobs decreased with the increasing tet dosages while was negatively correlated with is ftir and 2d cos analyses show that the carboxyl groups of ha exhibited that the binding priority for tet followed by the phenolic groups despite that phenolic groups were quantitatively more involved in the binding interactions 1h nmr data showed that the n ch3 2 sites in tet molecules were involved in the binding of ha free radicals oh and so4 pms oxidant and uv irradiation were identified as the key contributors to the degradation of tet in the uv ps uv pms and uv h2o2 processes in situ time fluorescence scanning and the differential absorbance spectra showed that in the absence of uv irradiation ps and pms could degrade only free tet in the tet ha mixed systems while uv irradiation oh and so4 could degrade free tet bound tet and ha the degradation sensitivity of those pollutants with varied forms followed the order of free tet bound tet ha in the uv pms uv h2o2 and uv processes in comparison free tet bound tet and ha were assumed to be oxidized simultaneously in the uv ps process this study provided new insights into the role of binding with humic acid on the oxidative transformation of tet these results are important in the context of

16761,recently free reactive manganese species rmns generated via permanganate catalytic oxidation technology has been applied to contaminants abatement and sludge dewatering this study proposed a novel free rmns generation method in ultrasound enhanced carbon nanotube cnts permanganate process ucp for organics removal taking ciprofloxacin as a target contaminant the removal efficiency in the ucp process 9 78 s 1 was remarkably higher than that of the permanganate 0 71 s 1 and cnts permanganate 2 57 s 1 processes cnts could enrich manganese compounds and ciprofloxacin and act as an electronic platform for the electronic transfer from ciprofloxacin to manganese compounds for free rmns generation which was revealed by dft calculation and spectrum analysis meanwhile ultrasound further regulated the generation of rmns as it could transform the inactive solid mn iv into free rmns in the ucp process non free radical modes including rmns oxidation 49 8 and electron transfer 23 5 were the dominant processes for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process and hydroxyl radical oxidation 13 2 cnts adsorption 5 5 and pm oxidation 8 0 also contributed to ciprofloxacin removal interestingly cnts could be well reused in the ucp process as more than 88 75 of ciprofloxacin was removed after five times reuse of cnts the ucp process provides a novel strategy for rapid contaminants removal in water treatment via continuous generation of free rmns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasound carbon nanotubes permanganate reactive manganese species electron transfer 1 introduction permanganate pm is a strong green oxidant which has been extensively utilized in water treatment owing to the virtues of stability for reserve and transport relatively low prices and easy field preparation hu et al 2018 however compared with other oxidants e g o3 2 07 ev and ho 2 80 ev the lower oxidation potential of permanganate 1 68 ev results in relative lower reaction rates which enervates its potential to address the risk of emergency contaminants bavasso et al 2020 reactive manganese species rmns can be generated during permanganate oxidation reaction and the reaction rate of rmns is much higher than permanganate oxidation alone which is even higher than most of ho based oxidation processes sun et al 2015 hence enhancing rmns generation during the permanganate oxidation process can effectively broaden the application potential of permanganate some methods e g bisulfite gao et al 2018 2017 guo et al 2017 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2018 ultraviolet guo et al 2018 electrochemistry zhu et al 2019a b and carbon materials tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 were proposed to promote contaminants removal via free and or solid rmns generated during the permanganate oxidation process thereinto free rmns mn iii mn v and mn vi could be generated in the bisulfite enhanced permanganate process and compared with solid rmns mn iv s free rmns could be utilized to the rapid removal of contaminants millisecond level which attracted comprehensive attention gao et al 2018 2017 guo et al 2017 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2018 however continuous dosing of reagents increased the operational difficulty of practical applications and resulted in excessive ion concentration in the solution meanwhile carbon materials had been proved as an alternative means to enhance permanganate oxidation which could avoid the problems above tian et al 2019 yet the deactivation problem also hindered its utilization to a certain extent owing to the consumption of active groups and the blocking of pores derakhshani and naghizadeh 2013 liang et al 2016a zhang et al 2013 carbon nanotubes cnts an excellent two dimension carbon material had been proved as an electron mediator between persulfate and carbon nanotubes and in the process there were almost no consumption of active groups of carbon nanotubes han et al 2019 shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018a moreover in the presence of carbon nanotubes organics degradation by permanganate could been improved via the generation of solid mno2 zhao et al 2016 however the performance of solid mno2 on organics removal was lower than that of free rmns guo et al 2018 tian et al 2019 hence the conversion of solid mno2 to free rmns or direct generation free rmns based on the cnts pm process needed to be explored the ultrasound assisted method is a promising approach method in water treatment plants it has excellent mixing and cleaning ability jung et al 2019 which is widely utilized in promoting the adsorption of carbon materials and restoring the active sites during the carbon materials regeneration processes fröhlich et al 2018 suna et al 2018 furthermore ultrasound can also promote the conversion of manganese in valence state jung et al 2019 hence ultrasound may also promote cnts pm catalytic oxidation process by supporting more active reactive sites and promoting the generation and or conversion of rmns importantly previous researches had revealed that permanganate oxidation ability could be promoted by ultrasound via cavitation pyrolysis effect the generated mn iv s colloidal mno2 was considered as the nucleus of cavitation bubbles hu et al 2018 our previous works revealed free rmns could be generated and transformed via electronic access in the electric field song et al 2020 zhu et al 2019a b electron could also be generated via acoustic luminescence effects han et al 2019 shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018a while no scholar showed solicitude for the ultrasound combined cnts pm process in the ultrasound combined cnts pm process carbon nanotubes might act as an electronic mediator which could transfer electrons from contaminants to permanganate for the generation of rmns meanwhile ultrasound might accelerate the ucp process via increasing carbon nanotubes dispersal and cleaning the loads of carbon nanotubes it might also transform solid rmns into free rmns for promoting contaminants removal the hypothesis above needs to be certified to further comprehend the reaction mechanism in the process and acoustic chemistry effect hence the purpose of this research is to i estimate the feasibility of the ultrasound enhanced cnts pm process for the removal and mineralization of ciprofloxacin cip a typical antibiotic which was frequently detected in surface water liang et al 2019 ii ascertain reaction reactive species of the ucp process and its relative contributions to ciprofloxacin removal iii clarify the function of ultrasound and carbon nanotubes in the ucp process and iv document the effect of ultrasonic power initial ph permanganate concentration carbon nanotubes dosage and solution temperature in the ucp process at length the energy consumption of the ucp process was evaluated for validating its practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analytical methods commercial carbon nanotubes cnts were purchased from guosen technology company shenzhen china it was directly used as received cntsucp was the cnts treated by the ucp process without ciprofloxacin cntsucp h was the cntsucp treated by excess hydroxylamine

displayed in text s2 2 2 experimental procedures all batch experiments were conducted with a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask in an ultrasonic machine kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd china the aquatic temperature was controlled by a thermostatic water circulator bath the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 0 via h2so4 and naoh in the ucp process carbon nanotube was appended to ciprofloxacin solution then a certain amount of permanganate was spiked into the reactor quickly and the ultrasonic machine was turned on at the same time after a preset time of reaction 1 0 ml of the solution was quickly collected by filter membrane 0 22 μm and immediately quenched with 100 μl hydroxylamine hydrochloride 10 mm all experiments were repeated 3 times and the data were averaged with the standard deviations 5 unless otherwise noted 2 3 dft calculation methods computational study of permanganate was performed through g09 program and molecules were constructed by gaussian 09 w package geometry optimizations were performed at the becke lee yang parr hybrid exchange correlation three parameter functional b3lyp level with the program the 6 311 g d p basis set was used for all atoms all the geometries were fully optimized without symmetry constraint and a separate frequency calculation was performed to confirm the optimized geometry at the minimum kumar et al 2018 fukui function was utilized for prediction of reactive sites of ciprofloxacin degradation the fukui function contained relative information about different sites of ciprofloxacin and the reactive sites of the exact molecule usually had larger value of condensed fukui function than other regions thereinto the condensed fukui function could be calculated unambiguously for nucleophilic attack ƒ electrophilic attack ƒ and radical attack ƒ0 3 results and discussion 3 1 ciprofloxacin removal in different processes the removal of ciprofloxacin in different processes was compared in fig 1 a and fig s1a the removal ratios of ciprofloxacin in ultrasound us permanganate us pm carbon nanotubes adsorption us cnts pm cnts and ucp processes were 15 27 32 65 40 81 14 99 33 09 73 97 and 100 00 respectively clearly the removal ratio of ciprofloxacin in the cnts pm process was higher than that of permanganate alone which demonstrated that the removal capacity of permanganate oxidation could be enhanced with the addition of carbon nanotubes the addition of ultrasound in the cnts pm process could further promote ciprofloxacin removal as illustrated in fig 1a all these processes followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constant k of the ucp process 9 78 s 1 was substantially higher than other processes 0 27 2 57 s 1 the rate constant was also higher than most of the existed processes table s1 these results indicated that ciprofloxacin could be rapidly removed by the ucp process furthermore the synergistic index si of the cnts pm and ultrasound processes was 3 38 calculation detail was presented in text s3 which illustrated a remarkable synergetic effect between the cnts pm and ultrasound processes zhu et al 2019a b as shown in fig 1b permanganate consumption was improved in the ucp process compared with the cnts pm process which also indicated that the addition of ultrasound could accelerate the consumption of permanganate in parallel as displayed in fig s1b total organic carbon removal in the ucp process 39 75 was higher than that of other processes 6 68 28 45 within 60 min which indicated that the ucp process was an effective method in mineralizing the products the reusability of carbon nanotubes in the ucp process was also evaluated as displayed in fig 2 a ciprofloxacin removal ratio 88 75 remained effectively after five times reuse indicating that carbon nanotubes owned sustainable catalytic capability in the ucp process besides different organic contaminants phenol diclofenac dcf tetracycline hydrochloride tc sulfamethoxazole smx and nitrobenzene nb removal in different processes were evaluated to further validate the enhanced effectiveness of ultrasound on the cnts pm process as shown in fig 2b and fig s1 ultrasound played an excellent role in boosting organic contaminants removal in the ucp process these results revealed that the ucp process was an effective method in handling organic contaminants 3 2 mechanism study the adsorption by carbon nanotubes oxidation via reaction activity species e g radicals and reactive manganese species and ultrasonic pyrolysis effect were all probably contributed to ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process ondarts et al 2018 hence progressive researches were undertaken to ascertain the reaction mechanism of the ucp process 3 2 1 role of adsorption as shown in fig s2a the removal of ciprofloxacin by carbon nanotubes adsorption 14 99 was much lower than that of the ucp process which indicated that adsorption via carbon nanotubes had limited contribution to ciprofloxacin removal the adsorption properties of carbon nanotubes could be altered in permanganate based reaction hence adsorption of carbon nanotubes treated after the ucp process without ciprofloxacin was carried out to further ascertain ciprofloxacin adsorption via carbon nanotubes in the ucp process as clearly illustrated in fig s2 the adsorption capacity of cnts after the ucp process 9 85 was not enhanced but bated compared with that of the original carbon nanotubes adsorption which indicated that the modified function for carbon nanotubes adsorption could be neglected and the suppression phenomenon might be due to the blockage of pores of carbon nanotubes and the deactivation of adsorption sites overall carbon nanotubes could enrich reactant and carbon nanotubes adsorption was contributed to ciprofloxacin removal process but was not the primary reason for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process 3 2 2 role of radical active species in the ultrasound based processes the release of transient high temperature and active substances could be formed through the fracture of cavitation bubbles eqs 1 7 which was contributed to enhance the abatement of contaminants al hamadani et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ho and o2 were regarded as the possible active oxygen species in the ultrasound based reaction process to detect the role of ho methyl alcohol ma k ho 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol tba k ho 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 were selected as ho scavengers wang et al 2019 as clearly shown in fig s3a the removal ratio of ciprofloxacin was slightly suppressed with methyl alcohol and tert butanol increased from 1 to 10 mm furthermore the addition of nitrobenzene k ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 was slightly restrained the degradation of ciprofloxacin 7 13 in the ucp process with excess methyl alcohol fig 3 a chen et al 2020 these results implied that ho was generated but its contribution to ciprofloxacin removal was limited in the ucp process in addition experiments were also carried out to detect the generation and effect of o2 the aeration of n2 and o2 in the ucp process had a negligible impact on ciprofloxacin removal fig s3b which indicated that o2 was not contributed to cip removal eq 6 1 h 2 o h o h 2 h o h 2 o 2 3 sonocatalyst e h sonoluminescence 4 o 2 h ho o 5 2 ho o o 2 h 2 o 2 6 e o 2 o 2 7 h h 2 o h o 8 2 mno 4 6 h 2 mn o 2 2 h o 2 h 2 o 9 2 mno 4 3 h 2 o 2 2 mn o 2 3 o 2 2 h o h 2 o 3 2 3 role of rmns and pyrolysis effect reactive manganese species mn vi mn v mn iv and mn iii were the possible reactive non radical oxides in the ucp process tian et al 2019 zhu et al 2019a b the characteristic absorption peaks of mn vi aq mn v aq colloid mn iv and mn iii aq were generally 610 nm 660 nm 380 410 nm and 258 nm respectively tian et al 2019 the absorption peak of mn vi aq and mn v aq had not been detected by uv vis spectra in this study fig s4 which might be due to the inexistence and or instability of mn vi aq and mn v aq monomer in solution in acidic environment methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was selected as a probe to further confirm the generation of mn vi aq and or mn v aq pmso could be only oxidized into methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via mn vi and or mn v while hydroxylated and or polymeric products was the products of pmso via ho gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 moreover compared with permanganate mn iv s and mn iii aq pmso was oxidized into pmso2 with the stoichiometry of 1 1 by mn vi aq mn v aq in a short time which provided a method to detect the existence and effect of mn vi aq mn v aq gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 as displayed in fig 4 a and s5 pmso2 was generated with pmso degradation in the ucp process and the value of δpmso2 δpmso η of the ucp process was close to 1 0 81 which was higher than the us pm 0 66 and cnts pm 0 71 processes indicating the existence of mn vi aq mn v aq in the ucp process chen et al 2020 song et al 2020 and the adsorption of carbon nanotubes might be clarified the reason of η value 1 in addition as showed in fig 4b with increasing the concentration of pmso a significant inhibition of ciprofloxacin removal was observed it is noteworthy that in a very short time the inhibition phenomenon was still observed inset of fig 4b this result further demonstrated the existence of mn vi aq mn v aq in ucp process and the phenomenon might be owing to the competition reaction between pmso and ciprofloxacin for mn vi aq mn v aq mn iv was a critical final product generated in permanganate based oxidation reaction which could promote contaminants removal via adsorption and catalysis mn iv s mno2 eqs 8 9 could also act as cavitation nucleus in the ultrasound based processes when the diameter was on the brink of cavitation bubble size which promoted contaminants removal via ultrasonic pyrolysis effect hu et al 2018 herein the presence of mn iv s and its effect on ciprofloxacin removal were studied as displayed in fig s6 no apparent absorption peaks 375 410 nm were observed sun et al 2018 however as displayed in fig 4c and fig s7 clusters were attached to the reacted carbon nanotubes in the ucp process and it was constituted by manganese and oxygen elements which indicated that manganese oxides were produced and loaded on carbon nanotubes in the ucp process shandakov et al 2017 further spectral characterizations fig 4d and fig s7 also ascertained the generation of mn iv s on carbon nanotubes hence the effect of mn iv s on ciprofloxacin removal was studied on one hand the ultrasonic pyrolysis effect triggered by mn iv s was evaluated the diameter of mn iv s particles was measured to be 5600 8000 nm fig s8 which was mismatched with the theoretical diameter value of cavitation bubble 16 300 nm calculated by text s4 the result indicated the cavitation enhancement effect had not arisen in theory zhao et al 2014 moreover an ultrasonic pyrolysis experiment was also carried out compared with the us original cnts process the change of ciprofloxacin removal in the us cntsucp process fig 2b was neglected which further indicated the enhanced effect of ultrasonic pyrolysis via mno2 particles was not contributed to ciprofloxacin removal on the other hand adsorption and oxidation by mn iv s was also estimated via adding the mn iv s prepared in situ and ex situ as shown in fig s9 the removal of ciprofloxacin in the both us cnts mno2 and us cnts h2o2 pm processes were restrained compared with the ucp process which demonstrated the effect of mn iv s on boosting ciprofloxacin removal was negligible hence the contribution of mn iv s to ciprofloxacin removal was feeble in the ucp process mn iii a single electron oxidant e0 1 51 v can oxidize contaminants via an electron transfer which may also exist in the ucp process for ciprofloxacin removal kostka et al 1995 as shown in fig 4d and s7d an obvious peak for mn2p was observed in xps spectra of carbon nanotubes in the ucp process which could be decomposed into two peaks corresponding to mn iii 642 03 ev and mn iv 644 80 ev respectively tian et al 2019 and compared with diffraction peaks of raw carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotubes by permanganate oxidation with 002 and 100 graphite layer structures and 211 mno2 structures jcpds no 30 0820 he et al 2019 the xrd pattern of carbon nanotubes after the ucp process owned a slight peak 66 which was assigned to mn2o3 jcpds no 78 0390 chen et al 2019 the shreds of evidences indicated the addition of ultrasound could lead to the generation of mn iii s moreover the effect of mn iii s was further evaluated shown in fig s9b the addition of mn2o3 had no contribution to ciprofloxacin removal demonstrating the mn iii s was not contributed to promote ciprofloxacin removal hence attention was paid to mn iii aq which affirmed as a vital oxide for boosting contaminants degradation as illustrated in fig s10 with the addition of pp ciprofloxacin removal was hindered significantly indicating mn iii aq might be instrumental in the ucp process guo et al 2018 in parallel as shown in fig 4e compared with us pm and cnts pm processes a complex peak of mn iii pp was observed in the ucp process which illustrated that mn iii aq was generated in the ucp process in addition as displayed in fig s11 with the increasing of the carbon nanotubes dosage the peak of mn iii aq pp and permanganate consumption all increased obviously in the presence of ciprofloxacin which demonstrated that more mn iii aq pp was formed and contributed to ciprofloxacin removal overall mn iii s and mn iii aq were all formed in the ucp process but compared with mn iii s mn iii aq was the main active mn iii in ciprofloxacin degradation 3 2 4 reaction mechanism as displayed in fig s4 and fig s9c the influence of radical scavenger oxygen and h2o2 on the removal of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process was neglected which indicated that rmns was formed via electron transfer path rather than the oxygen radical transfer and h2o2 transformation paths carbon nanotubes loaded with different functional groups nh2 and oh all inhibited the removal of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process fig s12 which indicated that permanganate was not inclined to react with surface functional groups of carbon nanotubes tian et al 2019 furthermore the cnts with ozone pre oxidation treatment for oxidizing electron donating groups in cnts was also utilized to detect the electron transfer pathway in the ucp process fig 5 a after ozone pre oxidation treatment of carbon nanotubes ciprofloxacin removal was just slightly decreased in the both cnts pm and ucp processes which also indicated that the reduction of permanganate did not mainly rely on electron donating groups of carbon nanotubes but electron transfer pathway peng et al 2021 hence we speculated that the electron for permanganate reduction might come from ciprofloxacin and carbon nanotubes acted as an electron mediator shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018b to further prove the speculation dft calculation was performed to investigate the homo lomo gaps of the carbon nanotubes ciprofloxacin and permanganate the result table s2 and fig 5c illustrated that i the homo of ciprofloxacin 5 789 ev was more negative than the lumo of cnts 4 170 ev indicating that the electrons originated from ciprofloxacin could migrate from ciprofloxacin to carbon nanotubes han et al 2019 shao et al 2020 ii then electron transferred from the lumo to homo of carbon nanotubes due to the narrowest energy gap 0 430 ev chen et al 2020 yun et al 2018a and iii the electrons migrated from the homo of carbon nanotubes 4 170 ev to the lumo of permanganate 3 183 ev for the generation of rmns shao et al 2020 dft study revealed that carbon nanotubes could act as an electron mediator between ciprofloxacin and permanganate and rmns was formed in situ via electron transfer driven by an energy gap furthermore chronoamperometry was utilized to further detect electron transfer on the carbon nanotubes as displayed in fig 5b the addition of 50 mm na2so4 had no effect on response current which indicated that the increase of electrolyte ions in solution had almost no effect on electron transfer when permanganate and ciprofloxacin were added the response current was enhanced demonstrating electron transfer could be performed between permanganate ciprofloxacin and carbon nanotubes response current was increased notably with the addition of permanganate which indicated that permanganate was reduced on the carbon nanotubes surface moreover the response current rapidly increased as soon as ultrasound turned on and when it reached the spike current a continuous decrease in response current was observed indicating that the recombination processes were occurring during decay electrons in carbon nanotubes were trapped or captured by permanganate this result revealed that ultrasound could enhance the process of transferring electrons to promote the ucp process in addition different organic contaminants with different mo values and groups were evaluated to validate the electron transfer process as displayed in fig s13 fig s14 and table s2 the ucp process presented a modest selectivity toward different contaminants compared with nitrobenzene the selective removal toward other contaminants was due to the higher homo values and electron donating groups shao et al 2020 it also revealed that contaminants with higher homo values and electron donating groups were favor to be removed in the ucp process via electron transfer process in addition the adsorption ability of carbon nanotubes was also improved by ultrasound for boosting ciprofloxacin removal as shown in fig s1 the adsorption ability of carbon nanotubes was promoted by ultrasound moreover the morphology characteristics of virgin carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotubes after the ucp process were observed by sem fig s15 it could be seen that virgin cnts entangle together because of the van der waals forces while carbon nanotubes after the ucp process became less entangled illustrating that the dispersion of carbon nanotubes increased under ultrasonic filed it might attribute to the presence of the cooh content after the ucp process which had reported that the increase of cooh could reduce their surface energy ncibi and sillanpää 2017 as displayed in fig s16 compared with virgin carbon nanotubes the relative intensity of c element of carbon nanotubes decreased from 96 95 to 75 72 after the ucp reaction while the relative intensity of o element increased from 1 33 to 14 64 and the proportion of co increased from 16 93 to 19 34 which indicated the formation of oxygen containing groups e g c o and cooh liang et al 2016b in addition the formation of the mn o mn bond indicated the generation of mnox x 1 5 and 2 ftir results fig s16d further confirmed the formation of the mn o mn bond as mentioned above permanganate was reduced directly with electrons from ciprofloxacin on the surface of carbon nanotubes to form reactive manganese species eqs 10 11 and ultrasound could accelerate the process in the ucp process importantly the formed mn vi mn v tended to conduct direct oxidation of pollutants eqs 12 16 rather than electron transfer of ciprofloxacin through carbon nanotubes due to the negative value of δe table s2 shao et al 2020 hence we considered that the generated reactive manganese species via electron transfer process could further oxidize ciprofloxacin and its intermediate products eqs 12 16 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2018 overall in the ucp process ciprofloxacin removal was contributed to cnts adsorption electron transfer and the oxidation of ho pm and free reactive manganese species rmns the effect of the formed mn iv on ciprofloxacin removal could be ignored seen in fig s9 we performed a semi quantitative calculation in order to further explore the contributions of the processes mentioned above as displayed in text s5 and table s3 rmns 49 8 oxidation and electron transfer 23 5 were the dominant processes for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process while cnts adsorption 5 5 ho oxidation 13 2 and pm oxidation 8 0 had a weak effect on ciprofloxacin removal a simplified reaction pathway for removing ciprofloxacin in the ucp process was proposed and illustrated in graphic abstract 10 mn vii e cnts mn vi 11 mn vii 2 e cnts mn v 12 mn vi contaminant mn v products 13 mn vi contaminant mn iv products 14 mn v contaminant mn iv products 15 mn v contaminant mn iii products 16 mn iii contaminant mn ii products 3 3 transfer pathway of ciprofloxacin as displayed in table s4 and fig s17 ten chemical structures containing nice intermediates were acquired with ultra high performance liquid chromatography supercritical fluid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry analysis moreover fukui function and condensed fukui function were also utilized for the conjecture of the degradation of ciprofloxacin as displayed in table s5 and fig s18 the value of n 5 and c 16 were higher than the surrounding atoms indicating that these bonds were most likely to be broken hence the degradation of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process was proposed based on the identified intermediates and dft calculation there were mainly two pathways radical and non radical pathways fig s19 in a radical pathway int 5 was formed by attacking the quinolone ring of ciprofloxacin the same phenomenon was also observed in o3 oxidation liu et al 2012 indicating that int 5 was formed via attack of oh at the quinolone ring of ciprofloxacin in a non radical pathway ciprofloxacin degradation mainly due to the attack of manganese intermediates on the piperazinyl group of ciprofloxacin firstly the aromatic amine group of ciprofloxacin was oxidized into an enamine int a sun et al 2018 secondly alcohols int b and int d were generated through the hydrolysis of the enamine then the alcohol int d would be further oxidized into aldehyde 8 and the quinolone ring would be opened int c and int c was converted to int 1 through multi step hydrolysis and aldolylation processes the intermediates int 1 could be stably present in cryptomelane type manganese iii iv oxidation reaction sun et al 2018 finally the intermediates would be further attacked via rmns and further decompose into smaller molecules e g co2 and h2o 3 4 optimization of operational parameters the solution ph plays a vital role in removing contaminants via affecting the performance of oxides the states of contaminants and adsorption ability of carbon materials hu et al 2018 ciprofloxacin removal by the ucp process in different ph was evaluated as shown in fig s20 and fig s21 the optimal ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process was 5 0 significantly the removal ratios and k values of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process increased with the reduction of initial ph from 11 0 to 5 0 while decreased when the initial ph reduced to 3 0 indicating that ciprofloxacin was removed effectively in weak acidic condition the phenomenon might be ascribed to the oxidation ability of permanganate states of ciprofloxacin and adsorption ability of carbon nanotubes in different ph in strong acidic condition ph 3 0 carbon nanotubes phpzc 6 10 with positive charges would be repulsive to cationic ciprofloxacin pka1 5 46 pka2 7 67 zhu et al 2019a b which was conducive to the adsorption and oxidation of pollutants naghizadeh 2015 moreover cationic ciprofloxacin was more hydrophilic than unionized ciprofloxacin zhang et al 2019 which was not beneficial to its removal by pyrolysis effect of ultrasound lee et al 2016 in alkaline condition ph 7 0 the oxidation ability of permanganate was limited e0 0 53 v in alkaline condition and carbon nanotubes with negative charges would be repulsive to anionic ciprofloxacin resulting in the reduction of ciprofloxacin removal deng et al 2015 kostka et al 1995 therefore the weak acidic condition was suitable for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process permanganate concentration and carbon nanotubes dosage are vital factors that need to be optimized for saving cost and avoiding the exceeding standard of manganese after reaction zhu et al 2019a b the effect of permanganate concentration and carbon nanotubes dosage were evaluated in fig s22 with the increase of permanganate concentration from 20 to 200 μm the removal ratio of ciprofloxacin increased from 49 83 to 97 01 while the k value increased from 1 09 to 9 78 s 1 table s6 the phenomenon might be due to the increase of the collision probability of permanganate with electrons provided carbon nanotubes which promoted the generation of rmns okitsu et al 2016 tian et al 2019 however the removal rate of ciprofloxacin did not increase substantially as permanganate concentration further increased to 300 μm this phenomenon might be mainly owing to the limitation of the reaction rate of oxidizing substances with ciprofloxacin hence 200 μm was selected as the optimum concentration of permanganate in the ucp process furthermore the removal of ciprofloxacin increased obviously with increased carbon nanotubes dosage from 6 to 14 mg l 1 the phenomenon might be due to the increase of the specific surface area of carbon nanotubes which support more reactive sites for adsorption and the catalytic oxidation reaction areerob et al 2018 wu et al 2018 the reaction rates increased slowly when carbon nanotubes dosage further increased from 14 to 20 mg l 1 hence the dosage of 14 mg l 1 carbon nanotubes was chosen as the optimum dosage in this study ultrasonic power an important operation factor for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process was also evaluated fig s22c and table s6 the k value increased gradually from 8 25 to 10 98 s 1 with the increase of ultrasonic power from 480 to 1200 w l 1 the same phenomenon was also observed for the removal of other contaminants e g azo dye orange g and perfluorooctanoic acid in other processes based on ultrasound hu et al 2018 liu et al 2007 with the increase of ultrasonic power more dynamic cavitation bubbles could be created in the ucp process which promoted pyrolysis effect otherwise ultrasonic induced micro flow would also clean and sweep the carbon nanotubes which increased their surface area and reaction reactivity ondarts et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 moreover in this study ultrasonic could also promote the electron transfer for enhancing the reaction therefore when the power density further increased the reaction rate of ciprofloxacin removal increased correspondingly the effect of temperature was also analyzed and compared in fig s22d the removal of ciprofloxacin increased obviously with the increase of temperature from 298 to 328 k the k value also increased from 9 78 to 36 95 s 1 indicating that the reaction was an endothermic reaction wang et al 2019 furthermore k value followed the arrhenius law shown in the inset of fig s22d and the activation energy of the ucp process was 35 51 kj mol 1 which was lower than that of nahso3 pm 43 6 kj mol 1 sun et al 2018 permanganate oxidation 54 3 kj mol 1 hu et al 2010 and us pm 39 73 kj mol 1 shown in fig s23 processes these results also illustrated that the ucp process is an efficient method to remove ciprofloxacin 3 5 applicability of the ucp process and energy consumption calculation previous works had reported that the presence of ions and natural organic matters would alter the removal performance of permanganate oxidation process pang et al 2019 hence the effect of ions and noms in the ucp process cl hco3 so4 2 humic acid ha no3 ca2 and mg2 was evaluated to ascertain the removal characteristics of the ucp process as displayed in fig s24 and fig s25 the addition of ha and ions all inhibited the removal of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process it was consistent with previous studies that natural organic matters and inorganic salts could competitively react with permanganate or the reactive sites of carbon nanotubes gao et al 2016 pang et al 2019 moreover the applicability of the ucp process in different water matrices was inspected to further discuss the feasibility of the process as shown in fig s24a and table s7 the removal ratios of ciprofloxacin in tap water and surface water were 92 28 and 91 15 respectively which were close to ultrapure water within 30 min however the removal of ciprofloxacin in ultrapure water was faster than that of tap water and surface water natural organic matters and ions in tap and surface water might interfere with the ucp process the detection of water quality parameters of tap water and surface water was displayed in table s8 and the results verified the presence of natural organic matters and ions hence further optimization of the ucp process was needed in practical application but this ucp process on organics removal still showed the potential of application compared with other systems table s1 electric energy per order eeo kwh m 3 order 1 calculated by text s6 was also utilized to compare the energy consumption in different processes and detect the applicability of the ucp process zhu et al 2019a b as shown in table s9 the eeo values in the ultrasound us cnts us pm and ucp processes were 0 75 3 21 0 43 and 0 25 kwh m 3 order 1 respectively moreover the eeo value of the ucp process was further evaluated with that of other systems as illustrated in fig s26 the eeo value of the ucp process was relatively lower than that of other processes e g photo degradation and uv ozonation processes which further indicated that the ucp process was an energy efficient method and owned the practical feasibility of removing ciprofloxacin 4 conclusions reactive manganese species have displayed excellent performance toward contaminants removal in water treatment but immature generation methods and unclear generation pathways still restricted its wider application in this study a novel alternative method for generating rmns in ultrasound enhanced pm cnts process was developed for synergistic degradation of organic contaminants carbon nanotubes an electron donor and mediator exhibited superior activity and reusability in the ucp process for ciprofloxacin removal and the addition of ultrasound could transform inactive solid mn iv into free rmns dft calculation and chronoamperometry indicated that both ciprofloxacin and permanganate could be electronically transferred with carbon nanotubes and the electron transfer from ciprofloxacin to permanganate via cnts furthermore with the increasing of carbon nanotubes dosage permanganate concentration temperature and ultrasonic density ciprofloxacin removal was promoted besides ciprofloxacin could be effectively removed with 0 25 kwh m 3 order 1

16761,recently free reactive manganese species rmns generated via permanganate catalytic oxidation technology has been applied to contaminants abatement and sludge dewatering this study proposed a novel free rmns generation method in ultrasound enhanced carbon nanotube cnts permanganate process ucp for organics removal taking ciprofloxacin as a target contaminant the removal efficiency in the ucp process 9 78 s 1 was remarkably higher than that of the permanganate 0 71 s 1 and cnts permanganate 2 57 s 1 processes cnts could enrich manganese compounds and ciprofloxacin and act as an electronic platform for the electronic transfer from ciprofloxacin to manganese compounds for free rmns generation which was revealed by dft calculation and spectrum analysis meanwhile ultrasound further regulated the generation of rmns as it could transform the inactive solid mn iv into free rmns in the ucp process non free radical modes including rmns oxidation 49 8 and electron transfer 23 5 were the dominant processes for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process and hydroxyl radical oxidation 13 2 cnts adsorption 5 5 and pm oxidation 8 0 also contributed to ciprofloxacin removal interestingly cnts could be well reused in the ucp process as more than 88 75 of ciprofloxacin was removed after five times reuse of cnts the ucp process provides a novel strategy for rapid contaminants removal in water treatment via continuous generation of free rmns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasound carbon nanotubes permanganate reactive manganese species electron transfer 1 introduction permanganate pm is a strong green oxidant which has been extensively utilized in water treatment owing to the virtues of stability for reserve and transport relatively low prices and easy field preparation hu et al 2018 however compared with other oxidants e g o3 2 07 ev and ho 2 80 ev the lower oxidation potential of permanganate 1 68 ev results in relative lower reaction rates which enervates its potential to address the risk of emergency contaminants bavasso et al 2020 reactive manganese species rmns can be generated during permanganate oxidation reaction and the reaction rate of rmns is much higher than permanganate oxidation alone which is even higher than most of ho based oxidation processes sun et al 2015 hence enhancing rmns generation during the permanganate oxidation process can effectively broaden the application potential of permanganate some methods e g bisulfite gao et al 2018 2017 guo et al 2017 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2018 ultraviolet guo et al 2018 electrochemistry zhu et al 2019a b and carbon materials tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 were proposed to promote contaminants removal via free and or solid rmns generated during the permanganate oxidation process thereinto free rmns mn iii mn v and mn vi could be generated in the bisulfite enhanced permanganate process and compared with solid rmns mn iv s free rmns could be utilized to the rapid removal of contaminants millisecond level which attracted comprehensive attention gao et al 2018 2017 guo et al 2017 shi et al 2019 sun et al 2015 2018 however continuous dosing of reagents increased the operational difficulty of practical applications and resulted in excessive ion concentration in the solution meanwhile carbon materials had been proved as an alternative means to enhance permanganate oxidation which could avoid the problems above tian et al 2019 yet the deactivation problem also hindered its utilization to a certain extent owing to the consumption of active groups and the blocking of pores derakhshani and naghizadeh 2013 liang et al 2016a zhang et al 2013 carbon nanotubes cnts an excellent two dimension carbon material had been proved as an electron mediator between persulfate and carbon nanotubes and in the process there were almost no consumption of active groups of carbon nanotubes han et al 2019 shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018a moreover in the presence of carbon nanotubes organics degradation by permanganate could been improved via the generation of solid mno2 zhao et al 2016 however the performance of solid mno2 on organics removal was lower than that of free rmns guo et al 2018 tian et al 2019 hence the conversion of solid mno2 to free rmns or direct generation free rmns based on the cnts pm process needed to be explored the ultrasound assisted method is a promising approach method in water treatment plants it has excellent mixing and cleaning ability jung et al 2019 which is widely utilized in promoting the adsorption of carbon materials and restoring the active sites during the carbon materials regeneration processes fröhlich et al 2018 suna et al 2018 furthermore ultrasound can also promote the conversion of manganese in valence state jung et al 2019 hence ultrasound may also promote cnts pm catalytic oxidation process by supporting more active reactive sites and promoting the generation and or conversion of rmns importantly previous researches had revealed that permanganate oxidation ability could be promoted by ultrasound via cavitation pyrolysis effect the generated mn iv s colloidal mno2 was considered as the nucleus of cavitation bubbles hu et al 2018 our previous works revealed free rmns could be generated and transformed via electronic access in the electric field song et al 2020 zhu et al 2019a b electron could also be generated via acoustic luminescence effects han et al 2019 shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018a while no scholar showed solicitude for the ultrasound combined cnts pm process in the ultrasound combined cnts pm process carbon nanotubes might act as an electronic mediator which could transfer electrons from contaminants to permanganate for the generation of rmns meanwhile ultrasound might accelerate the ucp process via increasing carbon nanotubes dispersal and cleaning the loads of carbon nanotubes it might also transform solid rmns into free rmns for promoting contaminants removal the hypothesis above needs to be certified to further comprehend the reaction mechanism in the process and acoustic chemistry effect hence the purpose of this research is to i estimate the feasibility of the ultrasound enhanced cnts pm process for the removal and mineralization of ciprofloxacin cip a typical antibiotic which was frequently detected in surface water liang et al 2019 ii ascertain reaction reactive species of the ucp process and its relative contributions to ciprofloxacin removal iii clarify the function of ultrasound and carbon nanotubes in the ucp process and iv document the effect of ultrasonic power initial ph permanganate concentration carbon nanotubes dosage and solution temperature in the ucp process at length the energy consumption of the ucp process was evaluated for validating its practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analytical methods commercial carbon nanotubes cnts were purchased from guosen technology company shenzhen china it was directly used as received cntsucp was the cnts treated by the ucp process without ciprofloxacin cntsucp h was the cntsucp treated by excess hydroxylamine hydrochloride all chemicals utilized in this study were analytical pure or above other details were listed in text s1 all aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm the analytical methods containing chronoamperometry ultra high performance liquid chromatography supercritical fluid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and other method were displayed in text s2 2 2 experimental procedures all batch experiments were conducted with a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask in an ultrasonic machine kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd china the aquatic temperature was controlled by a thermostatic water circulator bath the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 0 via h2so4 and naoh in the ucp process carbon nanotube was appended to ciprofloxacin solution then a certain amount of permanganate was spiked into the reactor quickly and the ultrasonic machine was turned on at the same time after a preset time of reaction 1 0 ml of the solution was quickly collected by filter membrane 0 22 μm and immediately quenched with 100 μl hydroxylamine hydrochloride 10 mm all experiments were repeated 3 times and the data were averaged with the standard deviations 5 unless otherwise noted 2 3 dft calculation methods computational study of permanganate was performed through g09 program and molecules were constructed by gaussian 09 w package geometry optimizations were performed at the becke lee yang parr hybrid exchange correlation three parameter functional b3lyp level with the program the 6 311 g d p basis set was used for all atoms all the geometries were fully optimized without symmetry constraint and a separate frequency calculation was performed to confirm the optimized geometry at the minimum kumar et al 2018 fukui function was utilized for prediction of reactive sites of ciprofloxacin degradation the fukui function contained relative information about different sites of ciprofloxacin and the reactive sites of the exact molecule usually had larger value of condensed fukui function than other regions thereinto the condensed fukui function could be calculated unambiguously for nucleophilic attack ƒ electrophilic attack ƒ and radical attack ƒ0 3 results and discussion 3 1 ciprofloxacin removal in different processes the removal of ciprofloxacin in different processes was compared in fig 1 a and fig s1a the removal ratios of ciprofloxacin in ultrasound us permanganate us pm carbon nanotubes adsorption us cnts pm cnts and ucp processes were 15 27 32 65 40 81 14 99 33 09 73 97 and 100 00 respectively clearly the removal ratio of ciprofloxacin in the cnts pm process was higher than that of permanganate alone which demonstrated that the removal capacity of permanganate oxidation could be enhanced with the addition of carbon nanotubes the addition of ultrasound in the cnts pm process could further promote ciprofloxacin removal as illustrated in fig 1a all these processes followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constant k of the ucp process 9 78 s 1 was substantially higher than other processes 0 27 2 57 s 1 the rate constant was also higher than most of the existed processes table s1 these results indicated that ciprofloxacin could be rapidly removed by the ucp process furthermore the synergistic index si of the cnts pm and ultrasound processes was 3 38 calculation detail was presented in text s3 which illustrated a remarkable synergetic effect between the cnts pm and ultrasound processes zhu et al 2019a b as shown in fig 1b permanganate consumption was improved in the ucp process compared with the cnts pm process which also indicated that the addition of ultrasound could accelerate the consumption of permanganate in parallel as displayed in fig s1b total organic carbon removal in the ucp process 39 75 was higher than that of other processes 6 68 28 45 within 60 min which indicated that the ucp process was an effective method in mineralizing the products the reusability of carbon nanotubes in the ucp process was also evaluated as displayed in fig 2 a ciprofloxacin removal ratio 88 75 remained effectively after five times reuse indicating that carbon nanotubes owned sustainable catalytic capability in the ucp process besides different organic contaminants phenol diclofenac dcf tetracycline hydrochloride tc sulfamethoxazole smx and nitrobenzene nb removal in different processes were evaluated to further validate the enhanced effectiveness of ultrasound on the cnts pm process as shown in fig 2b and fig s1 ultrasound played an excellent role in boosting organic contaminants removal in the ucp process these results revealed that the ucp process was an effective method in handling organic contaminants 3 2 mechanism study the adsorption by carbon nanotubes oxidation via reaction activity species e g radicals and reactive manganese species and ultrasonic pyrolysis effect were all probably contributed to ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process ondarts et al 2018 hence progressive researches were undertaken to ascertain the reaction mechanism of the ucp process 3 2 1 role of adsorption as shown in fig s2a the removal of ciprofloxacin by carbon nanotubes adsorption 14 99 was much lower than that of the ucp process which indicated that adsorption via carbon nanotubes had limited contribution to ciprofloxacin removal the adsorption properties of carbon nanotubes could be altered in permanganate based reaction hence adsorption of carbon nanotubes treated after the ucp process without ciprofloxacin was carried out to further ascertain ciprofloxacin adsorption via carbon nanotubes in the ucp process as clearly illustrated in fig s2 the adsorption capacity of cnts after the ucp process 9 85 was not enhanced but bated compared with that of the original carbon nanotubes adsorption which indicated that the modified function for carbon nanotubes adsorption could be neglected and the suppression phenomenon might be due to the blockage of pores of carbon nanotubes and the deactivation of adsorption sites overall carbon nanotubes could enrich reactant and carbon nanotubes adsorption was contributed to ciprofloxacin removal process but was not the primary reason for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process 3 2 2 role of radical active species in the ultrasound based processes the release of transient high temperature and active substances could be formed through the fracture of cavitation bubbles eqs 1 7 which was contributed to enhance the abatement of contaminants al hamadani et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ho and o2 were regarded as the possible active oxygen species in the ultrasound based reaction process to detect the role of ho methyl alcohol ma k ho 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol tba k ho 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 were selected as ho scavengers wang et al 2019 as clearly shown in fig s3a the removal ratio of ciprofloxacin was slightly suppressed with methyl alcohol and tert butanol increased from 1 to 10 mm furthermore the addition of nitrobenzene k ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 was slightly restrained the degradation of ciprofloxacin 7 13 in the ucp process with excess methyl alcohol fig 3 a chen et al 2020 these results implied that ho was generated but its contribution to ciprofloxacin removal was limited in the ucp process in addition experiments were also carried out to detect the generation and effect of o2 the aeration of n2 and o2 in the ucp process had a negligible impact on ciprofloxacin removal fig s3b which indicated that o2 was not contributed to cip removal eq 6 1 h 2 o h o h 2 h o h 2 o 2 3 sonocatalyst e h sonoluminescence 4 o 2 h ho o 5 2 ho o o 2 h 2 o 2 6 e o 2 o 2 7 h h 2 o h o 8 2 mno 4 6 h 2 mn o 2 2 h o 2 h 2 o 9 2 mno 4 3 h 2 o 2 2 mn o 2 3 o 2 2 h o h 2 o 3 2 3 role of rmns and pyrolysis effect reactive manganese species mn vi mn v mn iv and mn iii were the possible reactive non radical oxides in the ucp process tian et al 2019 zhu et al 2019a b the characteristic absorption peaks of mn vi aq mn v aq colloid mn iv and mn iii aq were generally 610 nm 660 nm 380 410 nm and 258 nm respectively tian et al 2019 the absorption peak of mn vi aq and mn v aq had not been detected by uv vis spectra in this study fig s4 which might be due to the inexistence and or instability of mn vi aq and mn v aq monomer in solution in acidic environment methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was selected as a probe to further confirm the generation of mn vi aq and or mn v aq pmso could be only oxidized into methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via mn vi and or mn v while hydroxylated and or polymeric products was the products of pmso via ho gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 moreover compared with permanganate mn iv s and mn iii aq pmso was oxidized into pmso2 with the stoichiometry of 1 1 by mn vi aq mn v aq in a short time which provided a method to detect the existence and effect of mn vi aq mn v aq gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 as displayed in fig 4 a and s5 pmso2 was generated with pmso degradation in the ucp process and the value of δpmso2 δpmso η of the ucp process was close to 1 0 81 which was higher than the us pm 0 66 and cnts pm 0 71 processes indicating the existence of mn vi aq mn v aq in the ucp process chen et al 2020 song et al 2020 and the adsorption of carbon nanotubes might be clarified the reason of η value 1 in addition as showed in fig 4b with increasing the concentration of pmso a significant inhibition of ciprofloxacin removal was observed it is noteworthy that in a very short time the inhibition phenomenon was still observed inset of fig 4b this result further demonstrated the existence of mn vi aq mn v aq in ucp process and the phenomenon might be owing to the competition reaction between pmso and ciprofloxacin for mn vi aq mn v aq mn iv was a critical final product generated in permanganate based oxidation reaction which could promote contaminants removal via adsorption and catalysis mn iv s mno2 eqs 8 9 could also act as cavitation nucleus in the ultrasound based processes when the diameter was on the brink of cavitation bubble size which promoted contaminants removal via ultrasonic pyrolysis effect hu et al 2018 herein the presence of mn iv s and its effect on ciprofloxacin removal were studied as displayed in fig s6 no apparent absorption peaks 375 410 nm were observed sun et al 2018 however as displayed in fig 4c and fig s7 clusters were attached to the reacted carbon nanotubes in the ucp process and it was constituted by manganese and oxygen elements which indicated that manganese oxides were produced and loaded on carbon nanotubes in the ucp process shandakov et al 2017 further spectral characterizations fig 4d and fig s7 also ascertained the generation of mn iv s on carbon nanotubes hence the effect of mn iv s on ciprofloxacin removal was studied on one hand the ultrasonic pyrolysis effect triggered by mn iv s was evaluated the diameter of mn iv s particles was measured to be 5600 8000 nm fig s8 which was mismatched with the theoretical diameter value of cavitation bubble 16 300 nm calculated by text s4 the result indicated the cavitation enhancement effect had not arisen in theory zhao et al 2014 moreover an ultrasonic pyrolysis experiment was also carried out compared with the us original cnts process the change of ciprofloxacin removal in the us cntsucp process fig 2b was neglected which further indicated the enhanced effect of ultrasonic pyrolysis via mno2 particles was not contributed to ciprofloxacin removal on the other hand adsorption and oxidation by mn iv s was also estimated via adding the mn iv s prepared in situ and ex situ as shown in fig s9 the removal of ciprofloxacin in the both us cnts mno2 and us cnts h2o2 pm processes were restrained compared with the ucp process which demonstrated the effect of mn iv s on boosting ciprofloxacin removal was negligible hence the contribution of mn iv s to ciprofloxacin removal was feeble in the ucp process mn iii a single electron oxidant e0 1 51 v can oxidize contaminants via an electron transfer which may also exist in the ucp process for ciprofloxacin removal kostka et al 1995 as shown in fig 4d and s7d an obvious peak for mn2p was observed in xps spectra of carbon nanotubes in the ucp process which could be decomposed into two peaks corresponding to mn iii 642 03 ev and mn iv 644 80 ev respectively tian et al 2019 and compared with diffraction peaks of raw carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotubes by permanganate oxidation with 002 and 100 graphite layer structures and 211 mno2 structures jcpds no 30 0820 he et al 2019 the xrd pattern of carbon nanotubes after the ucp process owned a slight peak 66 which was assigned to mn2o3 jcpds no 78 0390 chen et al 2019 the shreds of evidences indicated the addition of ultrasound could lead to the generation of mn iii s moreover the effect of mn iii s was further evaluated shown in fig s9b the addition of mn2o3 had no contribution to ciprofloxacin removal demonstrating the mn iii s was not contributed to promote ciprofloxacin removal hence attention was paid to mn iii aq which affirmed as a vital oxide for boosting contaminants degradation as illustrated in fig s10 with the addition of pp ciprofloxacin removal was hindered significantly indicating mn iii aq might be instrumental in the ucp process guo et al 2018 in parallel as shown in fig 4e compared with us pm and cnts pm processes a complex peak of mn iii pp was observed in the ucp process which illustrated that mn iii aq was generated in the ucp process in addition as displayed in fig s11 with the increasing of the carbon nanotubes dosage the peak of mn iii aq pp and permanganate consumption all increased obviously in the presence of ciprofloxacin which demonstrated that more mn iii aq pp was formed and contributed to ciprofloxacin removal overall mn iii s and mn iii aq were all formed in the ucp process but compared with mn iii s mn iii aq was the main active mn iii in ciprofloxacin degradation 3 2 4 reaction mechanism as displayed in fig s4 and fig s9c the influence of radical scavenger oxygen and h2o2 on the removal of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process was neglected which indicated that rmns was formed via electron transfer path rather than the oxygen radical transfer and h2o2 transformation paths carbon nanotubes loaded with different functional groups nh2 and oh all inhibited the removal of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process fig s12 which indicated that permanganate was not inclined to react with surface functional groups of carbon nanotubes tian et al 2019 furthermore the cnts with ozone pre oxidation treatment for oxidizing electron donating groups in cnts was also utilized to detect the electron transfer pathway in the ucp process fig 5 a after ozone pre oxidation treatment of carbon nanotubes ciprofloxacin removal was just slightly decreased in the both cnts pm and ucp processes which also indicated that the reduction of permanganate did not mainly rely on electron donating groups of carbon nanotubes but electron transfer pathway peng et al 2021 hence we speculated that the electron for permanganate reduction might come from ciprofloxacin and carbon nanotubes acted as an electron mediator shao et al 2020 yun et al 2018b to further prove the speculation dft calculation was performed to investigate the homo lomo gaps of the carbon nanotubes ciprofloxacin and permanganate the result table s2 and fig 5c illustrated that i the homo of ciprofloxacin 5 789 ev was more negative than the lumo of cnts 4 170 ev indicating that the electrons originated from ciprofloxacin could migrate from ciprofloxacin to carbon nanotubes han et al 2019 shao et al 2020 ii then electron transferred from the lumo to homo of carbon nanotubes due to the narrowest energy gap 0 430 ev chen et al 2020 yun et al 2018a and iii the electrons migrated from the homo of carbon nanotubes 4 170 ev to the lumo of permanganate 3 183 ev for the generation of rmns shao et al 2020 dft study revealed that carbon nanotubes could act as an electron mediator between ciprofloxacin and permanganate and rmns was formed in situ via electron transfer driven by an energy gap furthermore chronoamperometry was utilized to further detect electron transfer on the carbon nanotubes as displayed in fig 5b the addition of 50 mm na2so4 had no effect on response current which indicated that the increase of electrolyte ions in solution had almost no effect on electron transfer when permanganate and ciprofloxacin were added the response current was enhanced demonstrating electron transfer could be performed between permanganate ciprofloxacin and carbon nanotubes response current was increased notably with the addition of permanganate which indicated that permanganate was reduced on the carbon nanotubes surface moreover the response current rapidly increased as soon as ultrasound turned on and when it reached the spike current a continuous decrease in response current was observed indicating that the recombination processes were occurring during decay electrons in carbon nanotubes were trapped or captured by permanganate this result revealed that ultrasound could enhance the process of transferring electrons to promote the ucp process in addition different organic contaminants with different mo values and groups were evaluated to validate the electron transfer process as displayed in fig s13 fig s14 and table s2 the ucp process presented a modest selectivity toward different contaminants compared with nitrobenzene the selective removal toward other contaminants was due to the higher homo values and electron donating groups shao et al 2020 it also revealed that contaminants with higher homo values and electron donating groups were favor to be removed in the ucp process via electron transfer process in addition the adsorption ability of carbon nanotubes was also improved by ultrasound for boosting ciprofloxacin removal as shown in fig s1 the adsorption ability of carbon nanotubes was promoted by ultrasound moreover the morphology characteristics of virgin carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotubes after the ucp process were observed by sem fig s15 it could be seen that virgin cnts entangle together because of the van der waals forces while carbon nanotubes after the ucp process became less entangled illustrating that the dispersion of carbon nanotubes increased under ultrasonic filed it might attribute to the presence of the cooh content after the ucp process which had reported that the increase of cooh could reduce their surface energy ncibi and sillanpää 2017 as displayed in fig s16 compared with virgin carbon nanotubes the relative intensity of c element of carbon nanotubes decreased from 96 95 to 75 72 after the ucp reaction while the relative intensity of o element increased from 1 33 to 14 64 and the proportion of co increased from 16 93 to 19 34 which indicated the formation of oxygen containing groups e g c o and cooh liang et al 2016b in addition the formation of the mn o mn bond indicated the generation of mnox x 1 5 and 2 ftir results fig s16d further confirmed the formation of the mn o mn bond as mentioned above permanganate was reduced directly with electrons from ciprofloxacin on the surface of carbon nanotubes to form reactive manganese species eqs 10 11 and ultrasound could accelerate the process in the ucp process importantly the formed mn vi mn v tended to conduct direct oxidation of pollutants eqs 12 16 rather than electron transfer of ciprofloxacin through carbon nanotubes due to the negative value of δe table s2 shao et al 2020 hence we considered that the generated reactive manganese species via electron transfer process could further oxidize ciprofloxacin and its intermediate products eqs 12 16 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2018 overall in the ucp process ciprofloxacin removal was contributed to cnts adsorption electron transfer and the oxidation of ho pm and free reactive manganese species rmns the effect of the formed mn iv on ciprofloxacin removal could be ignored seen in fig s9 we performed a semi quantitative calculation in order to further explore the contributions of the processes mentioned above as displayed in text s5 and table s3 rmns 49 8 oxidation and electron transfer 23 5 were the dominant processes for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process while cnts adsorption 5 5 ho oxidation 13 2 and pm oxidation 8 0 had a weak effect on ciprofloxacin removal a simplified reaction pathway for removing ciprofloxacin in the ucp process was proposed and illustrated in graphic abstract 10 mn vii e cnts mn vi 11 mn vii 2 e cnts mn v 12 mn vi contaminant mn v products 13 mn vi contaminant mn iv products 14 mn v contaminant mn iv products 15 mn v contaminant mn iii products 16 mn iii contaminant mn ii products 3 3 transfer pathway of ciprofloxacin as displayed in table s4 and fig s17 ten chemical structures containing nice intermediates were acquired with ultra high performance liquid chromatography supercritical fluid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry analysis moreover fukui function and condensed fukui function were also utilized for the conjecture of the degradation of ciprofloxacin as displayed in table s5 and fig s18 the value of n 5 and c 16 were higher than the surrounding atoms indicating that these bonds were most likely to be broken hence the degradation of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process was proposed based on the identified intermediates and dft calculation there were mainly two pathways radical and non radical pathways fig s19 in a radical pathway int 5 was formed by attacking the quinolone ring of ciprofloxacin the same phenomenon was also observed in o3 oxidation liu et al 2012 indicating that int 5 was formed via attack of oh at the quinolone ring of ciprofloxacin in a non radical pathway ciprofloxacin degradation mainly due to the attack of manganese intermediates on the piperazinyl group of ciprofloxacin firstly the aromatic amine group of ciprofloxacin was oxidized into an enamine int a sun et al 2018 secondly alcohols int b and int d were generated through the hydrolysis of the enamine then the alcohol int d would be further oxidized into aldehyde 8 and the quinolone ring would be opened int c and int c was converted to int 1 through multi step hydrolysis and aldolylation processes the intermediates int 1 could be stably present in cryptomelane type manganese iii iv oxidation reaction sun et al 2018 finally the intermediates would be further attacked via rmns and further decompose into smaller molecules e g co2 and h2o 3 4 optimization of operational parameters the solution ph plays a vital role in removing contaminants via affecting the performance of oxides the states of contaminants and adsorption ability of carbon materials hu et al 2018 ciprofloxacin removal by the ucp process in different ph was evaluated as shown in fig s20 and fig s21 the optimal ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process was 5 0 significantly the removal ratios and k values of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process increased with the reduction of initial ph from 11 0 to 5 0 while decreased when the initial ph reduced to 3 0 indicating that ciprofloxacin was removed effectively in weak acidic condition the phenomenon might be ascribed to the oxidation ability of permanganate states of ciprofloxacin and adsorption ability of carbon nanotubes in different ph in strong acidic condition ph 3 0 carbon nanotubes phpzc 6 10 with positive charges would be repulsive to cationic ciprofloxacin pka1 5 46 pka2 7 67 zhu et al 2019a b which was conducive to the adsorption and oxidation of pollutants naghizadeh 2015 moreover cationic ciprofloxacin was more hydrophilic than unionized ciprofloxacin zhang et al 2019 which was not beneficial to its removal by pyrolysis effect of ultrasound lee et al 2016 in alkaline condition ph 7 0 the oxidation ability of permanganate was limited e0 0 53 v in alkaline condition and carbon nanotubes with negative charges would be repulsive to anionic ciprofloxacin resulting in the reduction of ciprofloxacin removal deng et al 2015 kostka et al 1995 therefore the weak acidic condition was suitable for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process permanganate concentration and carbon nanotubes dosage are vital factors that need to be optimized for saving cost and avoiding the exceeding standard of manganese after reaction zhu et al 2019a b the effect of permanganate concentration and carbon nanotubes dosage were evaluated in fig s22 with the increase of permanganate concentration from 20 to 200 μm the removal ratio of ciprofloxacin increased from 49 83 to 97 01 while the k value increased from 1 09 to 9 78 s 1 table s6 the phenomenon might be due to the increase of the collision probability of permanganate with electrons provided carbon nanotubes which promoted the generation of rmns okitsu et al 2016 tian et al 2019 however the removal rate of ciprofloxacin did not increase substantially as permanganate concentration further increased to 300 μm this phenomenon might be mainly owing to the limitation of the reaction rate of oxidizing substances with ciprofloxacin hence 200 μm was selected as the optimum concentration of permanganate in the ucp process furthermore the removal of ciprofloxacin increased obviously with increased carbon nanotubes dosage from 6 to 14 mg l 1 the phenomenon might be due to the increase of the specific surface area of carbon nanotubes which support more reactive sites for adsorption and the catalytic oxidation reaction areerob et al 2018 wu et al 2018 the reaction rates increased slowly when carbon nanotubes dosage further increased from 14 to 20 mg l 1 hence the dosage of 14 mg l 1 carbon nanotubes was chosen as the optimum dosage in this study ultrasonic power an important operation factor for ciprofloxacin removal in the ucp process was also evaluated fig s22c and table s6 the k value increased gradually from 8 25 to 10 98 s 1 with the increase of ultrasonic power from 480 to 1200 w l 1 the same phenomenon was also observed for the removal of other contaminants e g azo dye orange g and perfluorooctanoic acid in other processes based on ultrasound hu et al 2018 liu et al 2007 with the increase of ultrasonic power more dynamic cavitation bubbles could be created in the ucp process which promoted pyrolysis effect otherwise ultrasonic induced micro flow would also clean and sweep the carbon nanotubes which increased their surface area and reaction reactivity ondarts et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 moreover in this study ultrasonic could also promote the electron transfer for enhancing the reaction therefore when the power density further increased the reaction rate of ciprofloxacin removal increased correspondingly the effect of temperature was also analyzed and compared in fig s22d the removal of ciprofloxacin increased obviously with the increase of temperature from 298 to 328 k the k value also increased from 9 78 to 36 95 s 1 indicating that the reaction was an endothermic reaction wang et al 2019 furthermore k value followed the arrhenius law shown in the inset of fig s22d and the activation energy of the ucp process was 35 51 kj mol 1 which was lower than that of nahso3 pm 43 6 kj mol 1 sun et al 2018 permanganate oxidation 54 3 kj mol 1 hu et al 2010 and us pm 39 73 kj mol 1 shown in fig s23 processes these results also illustrated that the ucp process is an efficient method to remove ciprofloxacin 3 5 applicability of the ucp process and energy consumption calculation previous works had reported that the presence of ions and natural organic matters would alter the removal performance of permanganate oxidation process pang et al 2019 hence the effect of ions and noms in the ucp process cl hco3 so4 2 humic acid ha no3 ca2 and mg2 was evaluated to ascertain the removal characteristics of the ucp process as displayed in fig s24 and fig s25 the addition of ha and ions all inhibited the removal of ciprofloxacin in the ucp process it was consistent with previous studies that natural organic matters and inorganic salts could competitively react with permanganate or the reactive sites of carbon nanotubes gao et al 2016 pang et al 2019 moreover the applicability of the ucp process in different water matrices was inspected to further discuss the feasibility of the process as shown in fig s24a and table s7 the removal ratios of ciprofloxacin in tap water and surface water were 92 28 and 91 15 respectively which were close to ultrapure water within 30 min however the removal of ciprofloxacin in ultrapure water was faster than that of tap water and surface water natural organic matters and ions in tap and surface water might interfere with the ucp process the detection of water quality parameters of tap water and surface water was displayed in table s8 and the results verified the presence of natural organic matters and ions hence further optimization of the ucp process was needed in practical application but this ucp process on organics removal still showed the potential of application compared with other systems table s1 electric energy per order eeo kwh m 3 order 1 calculated by text s6 was also utilized to compare the energy consumption in different processes and detect the applicability of the ucp process zhu et al 2019a b as shown in table s9 the eeo values in the ultrasound us cnts us pm and ucp processes were 0 75 3 21 0 43 and 0 25 kwh m 3 order 1 respectively moreover the eeo value of the ucp process was further evaluated with that of other systems as illustrated in fig s26 the eeo value of the ucp process was relatively lower than that of other processes e g photo degradation and uv ozonation processes which further indicated that the ucp process was an energy efficient method and owned the practical feasibility of removing ciprofloxacin 4 conclusions reactive manganese species have displayed excellent performance toward contaminants removal in water treatment but immature generation methods and unclear generation pathways still restricted its wider application in this study a novel alternative method for generating rmns in ultrasound enhanced pm cnts process was developed for synergistic degradation of organic contaminants carbon nanotubes an electron donor and mediator exhibited superior activity and reusability in the ucp process for ciprofloxacin removal and the addition of ultrasound could transform inactive solid mn iv into free rmns dft calculation and chronoamperometry indicated that both ciprofloxacin and permanganate could be electronically transferred with carbon nanotubes and the electron transfer from ciprofloxacin to permanganate via cnts furthermore with the increasing of carbon nanotubes dosage permanganate concentration temperature and ultrasonic density ciprofloxacin removal was promoted besides ciprofloxacin could be effectively removed with 0 25 kwh m 3 order 1 energy consumption from natural water in the ucp process the ucp process based on free rmns will provide an efficient economical and sustainable water treatment technology declaration of competing

identified as the probable main fib sources to surf zone waters yet hf183 human fecal markers were consistently detected determining hf183 sources was therefore prioritized via year 3 sub studies in

not sources dye tracing discounted hydraulic connections and shallow groundwater was uncontaminated sediments from coastal creeks and downstream scour ponds nearshore marine sediments and sands from inter and supratidal zones contained neither hf183 nor pathogens two nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp outfalls discharged hf183 into plumes that were either deep or distant with uncertain onshore transport regardless local sources were evidenced as surf zone hf183 detection rates mostly exceeded those offshore and nearshore around boat anchorages the presence of swimmers was associated with surf zone hf183 as swimmer counts on weekdays holidays weekends and during races significantly correlated p 0 05 n 196 to hf183 detections besides comprehensively assessing all possible fecal

leadbetter beach and east beach in santa barbara ca were investigated in a 3 year study to determine fecal sources besides fib and human dog and gull fecal markers pathogens including human adenovirus and salmonella bacteria were also determined in this study to evaluate the potential risk to human health for the first time in coastal urban california during dry weather all hypothesized human fecal sources and transmission routes were rigorously tested including watersheds urban creek outlets and scour ponds groundwater transport supratidal and intertidal beach sands storm drains sanitary sewers septic systems harbor facilities with boats moored boats in anchorage areas recycled water the treated wwtp effluent discharged from two nearby ocean outfalls as well as beach campers and swimmers after excluding almost all potential human fecal sources and transmission routes the results demonstrated that consistent human marker hf183 detections in surf zones at low concentration levels correlated with swimmer counts with the potential additional influence of wwtp effluent surf zone recreation has been recognized as a source of fib to the surf zone elmir et al 2007 elmir et al 2009 but this is the first time that counts of swimmers were found to be significantly correlated to human associated fecal markers in a field study of recreational beaches the results inform expectations of human fecal contamination and markers in recreational beaches for future water quality criteria that may regard human fecal markers with potential benefit to regulators managers and researchers materials and methods beaches overall study structure and sample analyses two urban santa barbara california recreational beaches were studied leadbetter beach lb at honda creek and east beach eb at sycamore creek arroyo hondo ah was the rural reference beach fig s1 lb and eb were selected due to historically elevated surf zone fib concentrations with lb and eb exceeding the u s environmental

particularly dogbact and hf183 and salmonella were mobilized with fecal deposits into creek waters during runoff generating rainfall events although more dry weather hf183 detections appeared for lb creek waters during y2 versus y1 table s3 there were no significant interannual variations in fecal markers during either dry or wet weather high concentrations of fib such as tc over 1000 mpn g dry sediment detected in 65 2 of samples n 23 by combining lb and eb watersheds together were quantified in creek sediments table s4 a characteristic of freshwater environments pachepsky and shelton 2011

human adenovirus was detected at one site e10 fig s5 table s4 beach sands scour ponds beach infrastructure and recycled water neither supratidal sands collected from the average high tide elevation nor intertidal sands showed evidence of fecal contamination table s4 fib concentrations were very low to nondetectable in beach sands and no fecal markers or pathogens were detected groundwater

results nearshore and offshore water sediments and moored boats by synchronously sampling surf zone nearshore and offshore lb and eb waters in y2 fig s8 and surf zone nearshore and boat anchorage waters in y3 fig s18 fib and fecal markers particularly hf183 decreased from the surf zone to nearshore to offshore fig 3 hf183 markers were detected in 40 9 of surf zone n 88 30 4 of nearshore n 56

anchorage areas fig s18 located between nearshore and offshore fell within these gradients with an hf183 detection frequency of 20 n 20 this discounted human waste discharge from moored boats as an hf183 surf zone source yet dnq level detections of hf183 were occasionally observed in the nearshore and offshore along with the surf zone water samples and on one date 10 5 2017 higher concentrations were measured in the nearshore fig s31 si results indicating periodic offshore or nearshore sources markers were mostly uncorrelated with fib except that gull2taqman concentrations correlated with ec and entero1a ρ of 0 41 and 0 39 both p 0 02 n 179 pathogens were not detected in nearshore or offshore waters nearshore marine sediments were devoid of fecal markers including hf183 and contained low to nondetectable fib table s4 treated wastewater effluent the el estero wwtp raw sewage contained 2 0e 08 9 3e 06 and 3 1e 04 copies 100 ml of hf183 dogbact and human adenovirus respectively table s7 concentrations averaged 3 6e 05 6 9e 03 and 1 6e 01 copies 100 ml for hf183 dogbact and human adenovirus respectively in samples acquired at one of the outfall diffuser ports table s7 and fig s18 which were a mixture of surrounding seawater and effluent lower hf183 concentrations on average 4 4e 02 copies 100 ml and no dogbact or human adenovirus were found in the discharge of an msd wwtp outfall diffuser port table s7 and fig s18 the fate of the diffused el estero wwtp outfall discharge was simulated using the um3 plume model details in the si under the three modeling scenarios the plume was not predicted to surface on the y3 offshore sampling dates and while the y2 plume was predicted to be more buoyant it was also unlikely to surface at marine sampling locations directly above the outfall diffuser fig s19 fecal markers and pathogens were detected at 18 m depth from the surface but not at 1 m depth and rarely at 9 m depth table s7 predicted hf183 entero1a and human adenovirus concentrations in the plume after trapping were within range or similar to those measured in the collected 18 m depth water samples although it is possible that the effluent plume could reach the surf zone via surface currents that can move onshore in the region ohlmann et al 2012 fecal indicator marker and pathogen concentrations in the plume would attenuate during transport due to diffusion and decay and thus the frequency or magnitude of plume constituents in eb or lb surf zones were highly uncertain similarly the results from a prior study of the msd wwtp outfall would support that the surfaced plume could migrate towards eb sampling sites however the comparatively low hf183 concentrations measured at the msd outfall in this study coupled with the previously observed dilution of microbiological constituents along the surfaced plume trajectory and that there was no significant increase in hf183 marker detection at the surf zone and nearshore locations closest to the outfall indicated that the msd wwtp outfall plume was also an unlikely source of hf183 to eb si results surf zone water defecation recreation and spatial analysis studies possible water defecation overnight in the surf zone by beach campers was investigated in a targeted study at eb fig s17 by comparing hf183 concentrations in the early morning ca 7 am with those in the previous late afternoon ca 6 pm and further with the following mid afternoon ca 3 pm this timing also allowed for inferring possible daytime sunlight mediated marker decay across the study sites the hf183 detection frequency was higher in the late afternoon 48 n 25 as compared to the early morning 8 n 25 and mid afternoon 4 n 25 table s8 wilcoxon test both p 0 03 thus relegating overnight water defecation as an unlikely source of hf183 in the surf zone on holidays and busy high visitation weekends hf183 detection frequencies in the surf zone were also higher in the mid afternoon ca 3 pm 26 7 positive n 15 as compared to the morning 6 7 n 15 or at the same time ca 3 pm on weekdays 4 n 25 table s8 possibly due to more people in the surf zone 7 4 versus 0 2 and 2 4 per site on average table s10 the highest hf183 detection frequency was observed before ca 5 pm and after swimming races ca 7 pm fig s16 with hf183 present in 73 of surf zone samples both n 15 followed by 67 in the next early morning n 15 table s8 the concentrations of hf183 pre and post race events were higher than those at nearly the same time ca 6 pm on weekdays during the water defecation study p 0 006 n 55 corresponding to the higher number of swimmers during races p 0 0001 table s10 however across all morning y1 y3 eb surf zone samples from sites e01 to e05 fig s5 n 113 total 20 to 27 per site there was no significant difference in hf183 based on sampling location p 0 8878 wilcoxon suggesting an in common hf183 source even when including the dry weather afternoon samples taken at the same sites n 179 total 32 to 45 per site there was still no significant difference in hf183 detection and or concentration between the sites p 0 7603 wilcoxon similarly there was no significant difference in hf183 detection between the three eb nearshore sampling locations fig s8 and s18 sites e 1ns e 2ns and e 3ns n 24 total 8 per site sampled across y2 and y3 2016 and 2017 p 1 0000 wilcoxon these results could support a chronic albeit low level and varying effect of the wwtp outfalls on surf zone hf183 regardless there was a significant association between the presence of hf183 in lb and eb surf zones versus surf zone swimmer counts at the time of sampling table s10 fisher s exact test p 0 03 spearman s ρ 0 17 p 0 02 logistic regression p 0 01 n 196 that could imply a role of swimmers on surf zone hf183 detections this included samples taken during weekdays holidays and high visitation weekends swimming races and also the morning sampling campaigns when people were counted in contrast negative correlations were found between hf183 concentrations and the numbers of people on sand or observed bedding data not shown the association between hf183 concentrations and the counts of swimmers fig 4

potentially reaching the shore discussion considering the frequencies of dogs and gulls or other seabirds at beaches it is not surprising that such hosts are often identified as major fib sources in surf zones converse et al 2012 goodwin et al 2016 wright et al 2009 as shown in this study however animal feces typically pose fewer risks to public health due to the host specificity of many pathogens here similarly to prior studies of recreational beaches cao et al 2017 jennings et al 2018 mcquaig et al 2012 riedel et al 2015 russell et al 2013 santoro and boehm 2007 low levels of human fecal markers were consistently detected in surf zone waters hf183 did not nonspecifically amplify from gull or seabird feces in this study or from marine mammal feces as shown previously shanks et al 2010 a low level amplification of hf183 from dog fecal dna was reported previously boehm et al 2013 however to generate a low dnq level of hf183 10 copies 100 ml in this study 8 8e 07 times more dog feces than human feces are needed boehm et al 2013 ervin et al 2013 and 2014 this would result in a corresponding dogbact concentration of 9 4e 08 copies 100 ml which is much higher than the dogbact concentrations quantified herein less than 1 0e 05 copies 100 ml thus the presence of hf183 in this study s surf zone water samples could not be attributed to dog fecal contamination and instead signaled human fecal sources freshwater flows from storm drains and urban creeks can convey watershed sources of fecal contamination into surf zones owing partly to at risk intersections of storm drains and sewage pipes as discussed before izbicki et al 2009 the california ab411 monitoring period coincides with little rainfall for the mediterranean type climate of southern california yet the few small rain events during this study were able to mobilize dog and human fecal wastes into creek waters which resulted in elevated fecal indicators markers and pathogens as observed previously steele et al 2018 dog fecal contamination in urban creeks can be controlled through targeted pet waste disposal education and management for creek side residences ervin et al 2014 however creek sediments previously found to harbor human fecal bacteria and consistently contaminate surface water particularly during storm flows frey et al 2015 kim and wuertz 2015 were not reservoirs for fecal markers and pathogens in this study furthermore similarly to a previous study elsewhere russell et al 2013 and similarly to a prior study in this region izbicki et al 2009 beach groundwater was not contaminated with fecal markers indicating that the bermed creek outlets here were hydrologically disconnected from surf zones further as per the dye studies sewers in the surf zone vicinities were not leaking compared to other potential fecal origins to surf zones those from nearshore and offshore have been less investigated moored boats could illegally discharge human waste into the ocean although this was not evidenced herein hf183 concentrations in the effluent plume from the el estero wwtp ocean outfall matched the plume modeling output for deep waters at a distance from shore but salinity light intensity dilution and food webs can contribute to marker attenuation carneiro et al 2018 still on one sampling date higher hf183 concentrations were observed in the nearshore as compared to the surf zone indicating a source of hf183 related to the nearshore environment fig s31 owing to complex circulation processes in the santa barbara channel including upwelling harms and winant 1998 far field modeling approaches brooks 1960 were not utilized to simulate the plume movement beyond its initial dilution one or more wwtp outfalls such as el estero or msd discharging hf183 into a plume that consistently migrates to shore could account for chronically observed hf183 with inter site spatial homogeneity at eb as the sources would be continuous further given typical diurnal patterns of wwtp flows tchobanoglous et al 2003 lower morning relative to late afternoon hf183 detections as observed here might relate to temporal patterns of hf183 discharge at the outfall diffusers and associated plume migration to shore neither of which was studied here thus the wwtp effluent plumes were not ruled out as sources of either hf183 or other fecal indicators to lb or eb yet given the majority on to offshore spatial gradients of hf183 detections it is unlikely that effluent plumes were the main sources of hf183 remarkably there were higher levels of surf zone hf183 during swimming race events holidays and high visitation weekends in contrast to low visitation weekdays further surf zone hf183 correlated to counts of swimmers beach campers have been previously hypothesized as human fecal contamination sources in recreational beach waters due to water defecation noble et al 2000 however the hf183 night to day patterns when assessing potential water defecation did not support this hypothesis rather swimmers appeared to be sources of hf183 in surf zone waters an estimate of either 152 swimmers at an average published fecal shedding amount 0 14 g per person or only 2 bathers at a worst case fecal shedding amount 10 g per person gerba 2000 or 0 2 fecal discharge events rose et al 2015 could generate a low roq level 100 copies 100 ml of hf183 ervin et al 2013 in a narrow swath of surf zone spanning over the sampling sites at lb or eb 1 9e 08 l of water estimated by measuring the distance spanning the three nearshore sampling locations and the distance halfway from the nearshore locations to the surf zone using gis assuming an average depth of 1 5 m as extrapolated from scientific diver depth measurements at the nearshore locations then averaging the volume from each beach in addition applied to a smaller section of the narrow surf zone swath i e encompassing the swim race section of 2 of the eb 5 surf zone sampling sites totaling 7 5e 07 l calculated by multiplying the original surf zone swath estimate above by 0 4 an hf183 signal of 100 copies 100 ml could be generated by 61 swimmers at the average shedding amount or by 1 bather at the worst case fecal shedding amount or by 0 08 fecal events similar or even higher levels of hf183 were recorded before races and people counted on beach sands as these counts included people preparing for the swim race events showed a significant correlation with the concentration of hf183 in pre and after race surf zone samples spearman s ρ 0 40 p 0 03 n 30 table s10 further the correlation between swimmer count and hf183 was stronger in the afternoon when there were more swimmers relative to the morning most research emphasizes surf zone water sampling in the morning to avoid effects of sunlight mediated accelerated human marker decay late afternoon sampling of surf zone water or at least sampling to coincide with the presence of swimmers should be considered in future research the low levels of hf183 recorded in the surf zones of this study were well below estimated thresholds for public health risk 4100 copies 100 ml boehm et al 2015 brown 2017 with only one exception site l04 fig 3b table s6 s8 consistently pathogens including human adenovirus and salmonella bacteria were rarely detected in the surf zones beaches in california deemed as priorities and listed for potential study as well as implementation of capital improvements towards remediation are based on fib concentrations sikich et al 2018 given the disconnect between fib and human fecal contamination mika et al 2014 as in this study human fecal markers such as hf183 could be used more routinely to indicate human fecal contamination in cases such as this study where hf183 was found to correlate with swimmer counts human fecal marker detection frequency relatedness to variations in beach visitation swimmers or particularly racers could be monitored for understanding potential public health ramifications and the need for management of human behavior through education regardless this study points to a low threshold of hf183 that is attainable at urban recreational beaches when almost all other potential human fecal sources besides bathing humans and remote effluent plumes are ruled out these results may also be relevant for enclosed beaches with intractable sources of hf183 that may be a result of high swimmer loads and lack of dilution in addition these results suggest that natural exclusion studies or quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra based site specific criteria may need to allow for consistent low levels of hf183 however as the potential for chronic contamination of coastal zones by wwtp effluent plumes has many chemical and microbiological pollution implications further studies of plume migration using modeling and multi tracer field studies is also warranted conclusions low levels of chronic hf183 in recreational beach surf zone waters have long been observed pointing to ongoing public health risks in a comprehensive three year summertime assessment of two urban california beaches surf zone fib contamination was mainly attributed to gull and dog wastes after excluding almost all other human fecal sources hf183 in surf zones was attributable to swimmers particularly in the afternoon but two wwtp outfalls in the vicinity could not be ruled out as sources this study demonstrates how all hypothesized fecal sources can be systematically tested to reveal for two urban recreational beaches a prevalence of non human fib sources an

were investigated over three dry seasons summers using nearly 2000 field samples of water ocean creek groundwater sand sediments effluent and fecal sources in years 1 and 2 gull and dog feces were identified as the probable main fib sources to surf zone waters yet hf183 human fecal markers were consistently detected determining hf183 sources was therefore prioritized via year 3 sub studies in lower watersheds human and dog wastes were mobilized by small storms into creeks but no storm drain outfalls or creeks discharged into surf zones beach area bathrooms sewers and a septic system were not sources dye tracing discounted hydraulic connections and shallow groundwater was uncontaminated sediments from coastal creeks and downstream scour ponds nearshore marine sediments and sands from inter and supratidal zones contained neither hf183 nor pathogens two nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp outfalls discharged hf183 into plumes that were either deep or distant with uncertain onshore transport regardless local sources were evidenced as surf zone hf183 detection rates mostly exceeded those offshore and nearshore around boat anchorages the presence of swimmers was associated with surf zone hf183 as swimmer counts on weekdays holidays weekends and during races significantly correlated p 0 05 n 196 to hf183 detections besides comprehensively assessing all possible fecal

leadbetter beach and east beach in santa barbara ca were investigated in a 3 year study to determine fecal sources besides fib and human dog and gull fecal markers pathogens including human adenovirus and salmonella bacteria were also determined in this study to evaluate the potential risk to human health for the first time in coastal urban california during dry weather all hypothesized human fecal sources and transmission routes were rigorously tested including watersheds urban creek outlets and scour ponds groundwater transport supratidal and intertidal beach sands storm drains sanitary sewers septic systems harbor facilities with boats moored boats in anchorage areas recycled water the treated wwtp effluent discharged from two nearby ocean outfalls as well as beach campers and swimmers after excluding almost all potential human fecal sources and transmission routes the results demonstrated that consistent human marker hf183 detections in surf zones at low concentration levels correlated with swimmer counts with the potential additional influence of wwtp effluent surf zone recreation has been recognized as a source of fib to the surf zone elmir et al 2007 elmir et al 2009 but this is the first time that counts of swimmers were found to be significantly correlated to human associated fecal markers in a field study of recreational beaches the results inform expectations of human fecal contamination and markers in recreational beaches for future water quality criteria that may regard human fecal markers with potential benefit to regulators managers and researchers materials and methods beaches overall study structure and sample analyses two urban santa barbara california recreational beaches were studied leadbetter beach lb at honda creek and east beach eb at sycamore creek arroyo hondo ah was the rural reference beach fig s1 lb and eb were selected due to historically elevated surf zone fib concentrations with lb and eb exceeding the u s environmental

particularly dogbact and hf183 and salmonella were mobilized with fecal deposits into creek waters during runoff generating rainfall events although more dry weather hf183 detections appeared for lb creek waters during y2 versus y1 table s3 there were no significant interannual variations in fecal markers during either dry or wet weather high concentrations of fib such as tc over 1000 mpn g dry sediment detected in 65 2 of samples n 23 by combining lb and eb watersheds together were quantified in creek sediments table s4 a characteristic of freshwater environments pachepsky and shelton 2011

human adenovirus was detected at one site e10 fig s5 table s4 beach sands scour ponds beach infrastructure and recycled water neither supratidal sands collected from the average high tide elevation nor intertidal sands showed evidence of fecal contamination table s4 fib concentrations were very low to nondetectable in beach sands and no fecal markers or pathogens were detected groundwater

results nearshore and offshore water sediments and moored boats by synchronously sampling surf zone nearshore and offshore lb and eb waters in y2 fig s8 and surf zone nearshore and boat anchorage

anchorage areas fig s18 located between nearshore and offshore fell within these gradients with an hf183 detection frequency of 20 n 20 this discounted human waste discharge from moored boats as an hf183 surf zone source yet dnq level detections of hf183 were occasionally observed in the nearshore and offshore along with the surf zone water samples and on one date 10 5 2017 higher concentrations were measured in the nearshore fig s31 si results indicating periodic offshore or nearshore sources markers were mostly uncorrelated with fib except that gull2taqman concentrations correlated with ec

to nondetectable fib table s4 treated wastewater effluent the el estero wwtp raw sewage contained 2 0e 08 9 3e 06 and 3 1e 04 copies 100 ml of hf183 dogbact and human adenovirus respectively table s7 concentrations averaged 3 6e 05 6 9e 03 and 1 6e 01 copies 100 ml for hf183 dogbact and human adenovirus respectively in samples acquired at one of the outfall diffuser ports table s7 and fig s18 which were a mixture of surrounding seawater and effluent lower hf183 concentrations on average 4 4e 02 copies 100 ml and no dogbact or human adenovirus were found in the discharge of an msd wwtp outfall diffuser port table s7 and fig s18 the fate of the diffused el estero wwtp outfall discharge was simulated using the um3 plume model details in the si under the three modeling scenarios the plume was not predicted to surface on the y3 offshore sampling dates and while the y2 plume was predicted to be more buoyant it was also unlikely to surface at marine sampling locations directly above the outfall diffuser fig s19 fecal markers and pathogens were detected at 18 m depth from the surface but not at 1 m depth and rarely at 9 m depth table s7 predicted hf183 entero1a and human adenovirus concentrations in the plume after trapping were within range or similar to those measured in the collected 18 m depth water samples although it is possible that the effluent plume could reach the surf zone via surface currents that can move onshore in the region ohlmann et al 2012 fecal indicator marker and pathogen concentrations in the plume would attenuate during transport due to diffusion and decay and thus the frequency or magnitude of plume constituents in eb or lb surf zones were highly uncertain similarly the results from a prior study of the msd wwtp outfall would support that the surfaced plume could migrate towards eb sampling sites however the comparatively low hf183 concentrations measured at the msd outfall in this study coupled with the previously observed dilution of microbiological constituents along the surfaced plume trajectory and that there was no significant increase in hf183 marker detection at the surf zone and nearshore locations closest to the outfall indicated that the msd wwtp outfall plume was also an unlikely source of hf183 to eb si results surf zone water defecation recreation and spatial analysis studies possible water defecation overnight in the surf zone by beach campers was investigated in a targeted study at eb fig s17 by comparing hf183 concentrations in the early morning ca 7 am with those in the previous late afternoon ca 6 pm and further with the following mid afternoon ca 3 pm this timing also allowed for inferring possible daytime sunlight mediated marker decay across the study sites the hf183 detection frequency was higher in the late afternoon 48 n 25 as compared to the early morning 8 n 25 and mid afternoon 4 n 25 table s8 wilcoxon test both p 0 03 thus relegating overnight water defecation as an unlikely source of hf183 in the surf zone on holidays and busy high visitation weekends hf183 detection frequencies in the surf zone were also higher in the mid afternoon ca 3 pm 26 7 positive n 15 as compared to the morning 6 7 n 15 or at the same time ca 3 pm on weekdays 4 n 25 table s8 possibly due to more people in the surf zone 7 4 versus 0 2 and 2 4 per site on average table s10 the highest hf183 detection frequency was observed before ca 5 pm and after swimming races ca 7 pm fig s16 with hf183 present in 73 of surf zone samples both n 15 followed by 67 in the next early morning n 15 table s8 the concentrations of hf183 pre and post race events were higher than those at nearly the same time ca 6 pm on weekdays during the water defecation study p 0 006 n 55 corresponding to the higher number of swimmers during races p 0 0001 table s10 however across all morning y1 y3 eb surf zone samples from sites e01 to e05 fig s5 n 113 total 20 to 27 per site there was no significant difference in hf183 based on sampling location p 0 8878 wilcoxon suggesting an in common hf183 source even when including the dry weather afternoon samples taken at the same sites n 179 total 32 to 45 per site there was still no significant difference in hf183 detection and or concentration between the sites p 0 7603 wilcoxon similarly there was no significant difference in hf183 detection between the three eb nearshore sampling locations fig s8 and s18 sites e 1ns e 2ns and e 3ns n 24 total 8 per site sampled across y2 and y3 2016 and 2017 p 1 0000 wilcoxon these results could support a chronic albeit low level and varying effect of the wwtp outfalls on surf zone hf183 regardless there was a significant association between the presence of hf183 in lb and eb surf zones versus surf zone swimmer counts at the time of sampling table s10 fisher s exact test p 0 03 spearman s ρ 0 17 p 0 02 logistic regression p 0 01 n 196 that could imply a role of swimmers on surf zone hf183 detections this included samples taken during weekdays holidays and high visitation weekends swimming races and also the morning sampling campaigns when people were counted in contrast negative correlations were found between hf183 concentrations and the numbers of people on sand or observed bedding data not shown the association between hf183 concentrations and the counts of swimmers fig 4

potentially reaching the shore discussion considering the frequencies of dogs and gulls or other seabirds at beaches it is not surprising that such hosts are often identified as major fib sources in surf zones converse et al 2012 goodwin et al 2016 wright et al 2009 as shown in this study however animal feces typically pose fewer risks to public health due to the host specificity of many pathogens here similarly to prior studies of recreational beaches cao et al 2017 jennings et al 2018 mcquaig et al 2012 riedel et al 2015 russell et al 2013 santoro and boehm 2007 low levels of human fecal markers were consistently detected in surf zone waters hf183 did not nonspecifically amplify from gull or seabird feces in this study or from marine mammal feces as shown previously shanks et al 2010 a low level amplification of hf183 from dog fecal dna was reported previously boehm et al 2013 however to generate a low dnq level of hf183 10 copies 100 ml in this study 8 8e 07 times more dog feces than human feces are needed boehm et al 2013 ervin et al 2013 and 2014 this would result in a corresponding dogbact concentration of 9 4e 08 copies 100 ml which is much higher than the dogbact concentrations quantified herein less than 1 0e 05 copies 100 ml thus the presence of hf183 in this study s surf zone water samples could not be attributed to dog fecal contamination and instead signaled human fecal sources freshwater flows from storm drains and urban creeks can convey watershed sources of fecal contamination into surf zones owing partly to at risk intersections of storm drains and sewage pipes as discussed before izbicki et al 2009 the california ab411 monitoring period coincides with little rainfall for the mediterranean type climate of southern california yet the few small rain events during this study were able to mobilize dog and human fecal wastes into creek waters which resulted in elevated fecal indicators markers and pathogens as observed previously steele et al 2018 dog fecal contamination in urban creeks can be controlled through targeted pet waste disposal education and management for creek side residences ervin et al 2014 however creek sediments previously found to harbor human fecal bacteria and consistently contaminate surface water particularly during storm flows frey et al 2015 kim and wuertz 2015 were not reservoirs for fecal markers and pathogens in this study furthermore similarly to a previous study elsewhere russell et al 2013 and similarly to a prior study in this region izbicki et al 2009 beach groundwater was not contaminated with fecal markers indicating that the bermed creek outlets here were hydrologically disconnected from surf zones further as per the dye studies sewers in the surf zone vicinities were not leaking compared to other potential fecal origins to surf zones those from nearshore and offshore have been less investigated moored boats could illegally discharge human waste into the ocean although this was not evidenced herein hf183 concentrations in the effluent plume from the el estero wwtp ocean outfall matched the plume modeling output for deep waters at a distance from shore but salinity light intensity dilution and food webs can contribute to marker attenuation carneiro et al 2018 still on one sampling date higher hf183 concentrations were observed in the nearshore as compared to the surf zone indicating a source of hf183 related to the nearshore environment fig s31 owing to complex circulation processes in the santa barbara channel including upwelling harms and winant 1998 far field modeling approaches brooks 1960 were not utilized to simulate the plume movement beyond its initial dilution one or more wwtp outfalls such as el estero or msd discharging hf183 into a plume that consistently migrates to shore could account for chronically observed hf183 with inter site spatial homogeneity at eb as the sources would be continuous further given typical diurnal patterns of wwtp flows tchobanoglous et al 2003 lower morning relative to late afternoon hf183 detections as observed here might relate to temporal patterns of hf183 discharge at the outfall diffusers and associated plume migration to shore neither of which was studied here thus the wwtp effluent plumes were not ruled out as sources of either hf183 or other fecal indicators to lb or eb yet given the majority on to offshore spatial gradients of hf183 detections it is unlikely that effluent plumes were the main sources of hf183 remarkably there were higher levels of surf zone hf183 during swimming race events holidays and high visitation weekends in contrast to low visitation weekdays further surf zone hf183 correlated to counts of swimmers beach campers have been previously hypothesized as human fecal contamination sources in recreational beach waters due to water defecation noble et al 2000 however the hf183 night to day patterns when assessing potential water defecation did not support this hypothesis rather swimmers appeared to be sources of hf183 in surf zone waters an estimate of either 152 swimmers at an average published fecal shedding amount 0 14 g per person or only 2 bathers at a worst case fecal shedding amount 10 g per person gerba 2000 or 0 2 fecal discharge events rose et al 2015 could generate a low roq level 100 copies 100 ml of hf183

the distance halfway from the nearshore locations to the surf zone using gis assuming an average depth of 1 5 m as extrapolated from scientific diver depth measurements at the nearshore locations then averaging the volume from each beach in addition applied to a smaller section of the narrow surf zone swath i e encompassing the swim race section of 2 of the eb 5 surf zone sampling sites totaling 7 5e 07 l calculated by multiplying the original surf zone swath estimate above by 0 4 an hf183 signal of 100 copies 100 ml could be generated by 61 swimmers at the average shedding amount or by 1 bather at the worst case fecal shedding amount or by 0 08 fecal events similar or even higher levels of hf183 were recorded before races and people counted on beach sands as these counts included people preparing for the swim race events showed a significant correlation with the concentration of hf183 in pre and after race surf zone samples spearman s ρ 0 40 p 0 03 n 30 table s10 further the correlation between swimmer count and hf183 was stronger in the afternoon when there were more swimmers relative to the morning most research emphasizes surf zone water sampling in the morning to avoid effects of sunlight mediated accelerated human marker decay late afternoon sampling of surf zone water or at least sampling to coincide with the presence of swimmers should be considered in future research the low levels of hf183 recorded in the surf zones of this study were well below estimated thresholds for public health risk 4100 copies 100 ml boehm et al 2015 brown 2017 with only one exception site l04 fig 3b table s6 s8 consistently pathogens including human adenovirus and salmonella bacteria were rarely detected in the surf zones beaches in california deemed as priorities and listed for potential study as well as implementation of capital improvements towards remediation are based on fib concentrations sikich et al 2018 given the disconnect between fib and human fecal contamination mika et al 2014 as in this study human fecal markers such as hf183 could be used more routinely to indicate human fecal contamination in cases such as this study where hf183 was found to correlate with swimmer counts human fecal marker detection frequency relatedness to variations in beach visitation swimmers or particularly racers could be monitored for understanding potential public health ramifications and the need for management of human behavior through education regardless this study points to a low threshold of hf183 that is attainable at urban recreational beaches when almost all other potential human fecal sources besides bathing humans and remote effluent plumes are ruled out these results may also be relevant for enclosed beaches with intractable sources of hf183 that may be a result of high swimmer loads and lack of dilution in addition these results suggest that natural exclusion studies or quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra based site specific criteria may need to allow for consistent low levels of hf183 however as the potential for chronic contamination of coastal zones by wwtp effluent plumes has many chemical and microbiological pollution implications further studies of plume migration using modeling and multi tracer field studies is also warranted conclusions low levels of chronic hf183 in recreational beach surf zone waters have long been observed pointing to ongoing public health risks in a comprehensive three year summertime assessment of two urban california beaches surf zone fib contamination was mainly attributed to gull and dog wastes after excluding almost all other human fecal sources hf183 in surf zones was attributable to swimmers particularly in the afternoon but two wwtp outfalls in the vicinity could not be ruled out as sources this study demonstrates how all hypothesized fecal sources can be systematically tested to reveal for two urban recreational beaches a prevalence of non human fib sources an absence of tested pathogens in most samples and a lower achievable limit of hf183 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

these regional groundwater resources with water users here we present waterroute water route optimization utility tool evaluation a model which optimizes water supply network configurations based on infrastructure investment costs while considering the water quality salinity requirements of the user we present an example simulation in which we determine the optimal wsn for different values of the maximum allowed salinity at the demand location while supplying 2 5 million m3 year 1 with regional groundwater the example simulation is based on data from zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands the optimal wsn configurations for the years 2030 2045 and 2110 are generated based on the simulated salinity of the regional groundwater resources the simulation results show that small changes in the maximum salinity at the demand location have significant effects on the wsn configuration and therefore on regional planning for the example simulation the wsn costs can differ by up to 68 based on the required salinity at the demand site waterroute can be used to design water supply networks which incorporate alternative water supply sources such as local brackish groundwater this study

functionality to the previously developed wsn model willet et al 2020 the original wsn model generates regional water supply networks only based on water quantity requirements in the work presented here the previously developed wsn model is extended to include water quality specifically in terms of salinity the addition of water quality as a design criterion for water supply networks is crucial to design regional decentralized water supply networks the inclusion of water quality makes the delivery of water at the desired quality possible by mixing in this study waterroute is used to demonstrate how brackish saline groundwater resources exploited at sustainable yields can serve as potential alternative water resources for industrial use brackish water resources can ensure a sustainable water supply when combined with optimal network layouts and desalination caldera and breyer 2017 reddy and ghaffour 2007 for the first time to our knowledge we present and apply a modeling approach to create water supply network layouts with optimal pipeline routing at a high spatial resolution connecting supply sources with different salinities which also accounts for pipeline placement costs waterroute optimizes water supply network configurations according to site specific demands for water quality and quantity with water supply sources that have different and variable water qualities with this functionality we connect regional hydrological modeling with planning of water supply infrastructure the model generates the optimal network configuration and quantity of water needed from each supply source to satisfy the industrial demand without trespassing sustainable limits for water extractions waterroute is a valuable tool for iwrm and regional planning in areas where maximum sustainable yields of aquifers need to be enforced areas of particular interest are freshwater scarce areas with intensive industrial activities for which lower quality water can be used and where alternative ground water resources are available we present and example simulation with regional brackish groundwater resources as the alternative water source for an industrial site 2 methodology waterroute is an optimization and visualization model which calculates optimal water supply network configurations the optimization model mixes water streams with different qualities to supply a single demand location with a desired water quality mixing of water is a new and essential functionality to design decentralized water supply networks that use alternative water resources with different qualities in waterroute water supply and demand sites are represented as vertices and pipeline connections are represented as edges the vertex and edge representation of water transport networks is commonly used for optimization mala jetmarova et al 2017 and was previously used for network design without mixing in willet et al 2020 waterroute requires two inputs the available water sources in a region and a preliminary network from which the optimal network configuration is selected the preliminary network is created by determining the lowest cost routes between demand and supply locations using geographic information systems gis methods the inputs are processed by the waterroute optimization model to yield the network configuration with the lowest cost for a specific water demand at the demand location section 2 1 2 6 the outputs are then visualized with gis software for evaluation and decision making an overall representation of waterroute 1 1 software used for

layout and visualization arcgis pro build number 2 4 19948 software used for the optimization python version 3 7 9 gurobi version 9 0 3 is shown in fig 1 2 1 formulation and parameters the waterroute optimization model is a variation of the fixed charge network flow problem fcnfp hirsch and dantzig 1968 kim and hooker 2002 in this study we alter the original fcnfp formulation to include water quality parameters as a constraint the water quality parameter included in this study is the salinity the chloride concentration of groundwater water may mix throughout the network yet the water reaching the demand location must not exceed the maximum salinity defined by the user the waterroute optimization problem is described as a planar mathematical system represented by vertices v i and edges e v i v j vertices represent supply locations demand locations and transport hubs junctions edges represent the possible pipeline connections between vertices each vertex v i has a chloride concentration c i and an associated water supply or demand s i three situations can be distinguished for each vertex when s i 0 vertex v i is a water source s i is the volume of water available and c i is the chloride concentration of the available water when s i 0 vertex v i is a demand location s i is the volume of water to be supplied and c i is the maximum chloride concentration for the water when s i 0 vertex v i is a transport hub junction in the network where water can mix edges e v i v j transport water from vertex v i into vertex v j each edge e v i v j has two variables flow of water x i j and flow of product p i j the product is the amount of chloride in mgcl day 1 the total product is determined based on the concentration and amount of water extracted from each supply vertex each edge has an associated cost per unit flow per km r i j and a length in km l i j additional parameters are the maximum flow u i j and maximum product capacity t i j over each edge we define a maximum allowed concentration c m that is used to constrain the final quality of the supplied water table 1 gives an overview of the parameters in the waterroute optimization problem formulation 2 2 objective function the waterroute optimization problem minimizes the total investment costs for pipeline placement tppc total pipeline placement costs the tppc is the sum of the costs of the individual pipeline segments required for the complete water supply network due to the limited number of available pipeline diameters the pipeline investment costs r i j increase with steps depending on the flow required the interaction between the available pipeline diameters flow requirements and flow velocity leads to investment costs which increase with a stepwise pattern see supplementary information 1 a stepwise increase in costs is referred to as a stairwise arc cost function bornstein and rust 1988 du and pardalos 1993 holmberg 1994 in this study pipeline diameters with increments of 100 mm and a maximum flow velocity of 1 5 m s 1 are used the steps in the cost function were determined for a flow range between 0 and 5 5 mm3 year 1 by increasing the flow with steps of 0 1 mm3 year 1 with a peak factor of 1 5 supplementary information 1 the stepwise behavior is incorporated in the objective function given by 1 t p p c i j e f i j x i j the stepwise costs for placement of new pipelines f i j x i j are defined by 2 f i j x i j 0 x i j 0 w i t h r i j k a n d λ i j k a s r i j k l i j λ i j k 1 x i j λ i j k d e f i n e d i n t a b l e 2 where x i j is the flow and λ i j k represent the breakpoints in the cost function based on the flow in the pipeline when there is no flow over an edge x i j 0 no investment costs are incurred resulting in f i j x i j 0 and the edge is considered unused the possible pipeline diameters are represented with an index k 1 to k 5 the length of the pipeline segment is l i j and r i j k are the investment costs per meter table 2 2 3 constraints water quantity and pipeline capacity the amount of water extracted from any vertex should be smaller than or equal to the total amount of water available at that vertex and is ensured by 3 i j e x i j j i e x j i s i i v which ensures the water balance at each vertex we apply this constraint to every vertex i in the set of vertices v edges can be assigned a flow of 0 meaning the edge is not used but the flow should not exceed the maximum capacity u i j of the edge which is ensured by 4 0 x i j u i j i j e which represents the allowed minimum and maximum flow over each edge the maximum capacity over the edges in the preliminary network is equal to the demand volume of the demand site because existing pipelines are not included in the example simulation if existing pipelines are re used the maximum capacity over an edge depends on the size of the existing pipeline section we apply the constraint to every edge the sum of the water flows exiting a vertex should be equal to the sum of the water flows entering the vertex if the vertex is a transport hub s i 0 5 i j e x i j j i e x j i 0 i v s i 0 which ensures that the outgoing flow x i j is equal to the incoming flow x j i for all transport hubs s i 0 supply sites located in the middle of the network can perform a dual function providing water to the network while also serving as a transport hub see fig 2 the water flowing out from any supply vertex needs to be larger or equal to the water flowing towards the supply vertex and is ensured by 6 i j e x i j j i e x j i 0 i v s i 0 the sum of the water flows out x i j from a supply site vertex s i 0 must be greater than or equal to the sum of the water flows entering x j i the vertex 2 4 constraints water quality waterroute generates network layouts that supply water with a specific maximum concentration at the demand site for mixing of water flows up to a maximum concentration we formulate the constraints in eq 7 11 these constraints control the amount of product p j i flowing over an edge e i j the amount of product mass extracted from a supply vertex must be equal to the amount of water volume extracted from that vertex times the concentration mass volume at that vertex if the vertex is a source s i 0 we ensure this with 7 i j e p i j j i e p j i i j e x i j i j e x j i c i i v s i 0 the constraint in eq 7 ensures that the water extracted from a supply vertex x i j x j i times the concentration at the vertex c i is equal to the product extracted p i j p j i the amount of product extracted from any supply vertex must be lower than or equal to the amount of product extractable from that vertex 8 i j e p i j j i e p j i s i c i i v s i 0 the product available at a supply vertex is determined by multiplying the concentration at the vertex by the amount of water available s i c i similar to the water flows for a supply site functioning as a transport hub the sum of the product flows towards the vertex must be lower than or equal to the sum of the product flows exiting the vertex this is achieved with 9 i j e p i j j i e p j i 0 i v s i 0 where p i j is the outgoing product flow and p j i is the incoming product flow the product flow mgcl day 1 towards the demand site s i 0 divided by the water volume m3 day 1 towards the demand vertex must be lower or equal to the maximum allowed concentration we ensure this with 10 i j e p i j j i e p j i i j e x i j i j e x j i c i i v s i 0 which is similar to eq 7 but the equality condition is replaced by an inequality condition and eq 7 is only applied to the demand location s i 0 if an exact target concentration is required the inequality condition in eq 10 is replaced by an equality condition if an edge is used the product flow should be larger than zero and the product flow must not exceed the maximum allowed concentration for water in the pipeline t i j 11 0 p i j t i j x i j i j e which can be used for the expansion of existing networks where the product concentration needs to be limited for certain pipelines 2 5 formulation overview and outputs the complete formulation for the waterroute optimization problem is written as minimize objective function tppc 1 subject to flow conservation constraints 3 5 6 physical bounds constraints 4 11 product conservation constraints 7 8 9 10 solving the optimization problem yields the lowest cost wsn that supplies water with a concentration lower than or equal to the maximum allowed concentration at the demand location the output of the problem is the water flow x i j over each edge of the preliminary network layout edges that are assigned a flow of zero see eq 2 and table 2 are not in use and do not contribute to the tppc 2 6 special case minimum salinity network determination when the desired water quality is set to the minimum salinity achievable for a certain demand see supplementary information 3 the supply sources can be determined before the network configuration optimization supply sites are ordered by increasing salinity and the cumulative water availability and associated salinity are calculated the set of clusters which can supply the demand at the minimum salinity is determined from the cumulative water and salinity list clusters not in the set are removed from the waterroute optimization model inputs and the optimal network is determined by omitting the water quality constraints this procedure reduces calculation time considerably for large networks 3 waterroute example simulation inputs waterroute is demonstrated by generating water supply networks to supply an industrial site dow terneuzen in zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands with local groundwater the waterroute model is used to investigate the effect of varying the maximum chloride concentration mgcl l 1 reaching the industrial site on the optimal wsn layout waterroute is used to generate water supply networks for 2030 2045 and 2110 to account for changes in groundwater salinity and a static demand of 2 5 mm3 year 1 the inputs for the example simulation are the available local groundwater sources section 3 1 and the preliminary network layout between the demand and supply locations section 3 2 3 1 groundwater salinity and availability the groundwater in the example simulation comes from several well clusters identified based on the fresh salt groundwater interface as well as the transmissivity which affects the possibility to extract water of the groundwater system in the region see willet et al 2020 the regional groundwater system has been extensively monitored mapped and modelled in the past and shows the presence of fresh groundwater resources on top of groundwater with a higher salinity delsman et al 2018 a submodel of an existing calibrated 3d variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model is used to simulate changes in groundwater salinity and piezometric heads over time for the period 2020 2110 van baaren et al 2016 the submodel covers zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands and has the dimensions 70 km west east by 28 km north south by 143 m thick the 3d groundwater model uses the modflow michael g mcdonald and arlen w harbaugh 1988 based computer code mocdens3d faneca sànchez et al 2012 oude essink et al 2010 it uses 40 model layers with grid cell thicknesses varying from 0 5 m to 10 m with increasing depth to reproduce the movement of groundwater salinity in the vertical direction resulting in over 7 8 million grid cells changes in groundwater salinity are simulated by advection and hydrodynamic dispersion complex geology horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities stafleu et al 2011 and the mapped groundwater salinity via intensive airborne electromagnetics delsman et al 2018 are inserted in the model stresses to the groundwater system consist of seasonal natural groundwater recharge from de lange et al 2014 six surface water types sea and estuarine waters lakes canals small rivers watercourses up to ditches a shallow drainage system and groundwater extraction wells retrieved from a database of the water board scheldestromen the surface water and drainage systems are inserted into the model using an accurate digital elevation model actuel hoogtebestand nederland 2020 resolution 5 5 m boundary conditions the sea the estuary and the belgian hinterland complete the existing 3d groundwater model van baaren et al 2016 the original 3d variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model has been calibrated based on a database of piezometric heads calibration was done in van baaren et al 2016 the model has been published in a deltares report van baaren et al 2016 the final calibration set of piezometric heads consisted of 606 observations for the entire area of the province of zeeland from the database of dinoloket nl over the period 1 1 1991 up to 31 12 2000 the effect of the groundwater density in the observation wells on the heads was considered post et al 2007 we used the code pest the most widely used calibration software for groundwater in the world doherty 2005 parameters that have been changed during the calibration are the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard the hydraulic resistance from to the surface water system and finally the groundwater recharge the results for zeeuws vlaanderen are as follows the median of the difference between the calculated minus the measured heads changes from 0 18 m to 0 009 m and the average absolute difference between the calculated minus the measured heads changes from 0 29 m to 0 24 m we believe these differences are good enough calibration results validation of the model has not been performed as the entire dataset was believed to be needed for the calibration in this study the 3d groundwater model simulates the effect of multiple brackish groundwater extractions used as the alternative water supply source over the well clusters on the groundwater salinity over time and the piezometric heads in the vicinity of well clusters in willet et al 2020 analytical equations were used to estimate the upconing of the interface between fresh and saline groundwater dagan and bear 1968 and the drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level bruggeman 1999 the numerical 3d groundwater model incorporates hydro geo logical details of the local setting the heterogeneous salinity distribution interaction with the surface water system geology includes changes in groundwater salinity due to extraction wells and thus produces more accurate results than the previously used analytical methods the same locations of the 2079 extraction wells in the 25 well clusters identified in willet et al 2020 were used the number of extraction wells per well cluster varies from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 331 the extraction wells are positioned at least 100 m from each other to limit strong drawdown superposition for further details on well placement and extraction rates see supplementary information 2 the surface water boundary is modelled with a fixed salinity concentration and does not change over the entire simulation period there is not enough surface water salinity data to insert a seasonal varying surface water salinity boundary condition though the model can do so a seasonal varying surface water head boundary was modeled several surface water features in the zeeuws vlaanderen region are draining from the groundwater system or are not active in summer the fresh groundwater recharge is likely a dominant source of fresh water that enters the wells given that small water courses and ditches are the main surface water phenomena in this region to meet environmental targets e g natura2000 and to limit drought effects the maximum drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level is set to 50 mm fig 3 the exact maximum allowed groundwater extraction rate per well was determined iteratively while meeting the maximum drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level in the first iteration step the starting groundwater extraction rates as used in willet et al 2020 are taken within ten iteration steps the changes in groundwater extraction rates become negligible the 3d groundwater model considers interferences in piezometric head and groundwater salinity over time of nearby extraction wells the overall salinity of a well cluster is determined based on the sum of the salt in mgcl day 1 extracted from all wells in the well cluster and the sum of the water m3 day 1 extracted from all wells in the well cluster the available groundwater from all well clusters in the study area is 6 119 mm3 year 1 while having a maximum drawdown of 50 mm changes in precipitation patterns and the associated effects on groundwater availability were not included the overall combined salinity of all 2079 wells over 25 well clusters is 472 mgcl l 1 in 2020 in 2020 there are two well clusters in the northwest and center of the study area which are significantly more saline fig 5 operating all well clusters at the maximum extraction rate increases the salinity of most clusters the average chloride concentration increases from 472 mgcl l 1 in 2020 to 852 mgcl l 1 in 2030 981 mgcl l 1 in 2045 and 1095 mgcl l 1 in 2110 see supplementary information 4 for details on water availability at each well cluster when water extractions start the salinity of well clusters changes quickly within on average 10 years but stabilizes over time when a new equilibrium in the subsoil is reached see supplementary information 5 for some well clusters a significant decrease in salinity i e freshening occurs because fresh water from the surface water system moves towards the extraction point when groundwater is extracted clusters 10 13 16 and 19 see fig 4 well cluster 24 first becomes more saline between 2020 and 2030 and then becomes slightly fresher up to 2110 the salinization or freshening rate of well clusters is not uniform for all clusters and therefore the optimal wsn configuration with the lowest costs is specific for each period and demand quality 3 2 preliminary network layout the preliminary network layout is the complete set of possible pipelines connecting all the supply and demand locations in the study area the waterroute optimization model selects the subset of pipelines with the lowest total costs for a specific demand at the demand site the selected subset is the optimal wsn configuration for a specific scenario the preliminary network layout in this study represents a water supply network which still needs to be built but the same methodology can be applied for an existing to be expanded water supply network the preliminary network for the zeeuws vlaanderen region was generated following the steps as outlined in willet et al 2020 using lowest cost route methods with gis software the main steps to generate the preliminary network layout are 1 creating a cost of passage surface based on local land use types in collaboration with water supply experts see willet et al 2020 a cost of passage surface is needed to include the local spatial data in the network optimization problem including local spatial data is important since the costs for placing pipeline infrastructure depend on the local land use and subsurface characteristics feldman et al 1995 2 tracing the lowest cost route between each possible combination of supply and demand locations based on the cost of passage surface the resulting network serves as the preliminary network layout for optimization the use of lowest cost route methods is common for infrastructure routing atkinson et al 2005 collischonn and pilar 2000 douglas 1994 the preliminary network has a total of 408 pipeline segments and 243 transport hubs to connect the 25 groundwater supply locations and the single demand location see supplementary information 7 4 results waterroute is used to generate the optimal water supply network configuration for five demand scenarios in the zeeuws vlaanderen region for the years 2030 2045 and 2110 a total of 15 simulations in each scenario the salinity of the water reaching the demand location differs while the demand volume is kept the same at 2 5 mm3 year the scenarios are 1 the minimum possible salinity for water reaching the demand location 2 no salinity requirements for water reaching the demand location after determining the salinity range in 1 and 2 three intermediate scenarios are simulated 3 a salinity of 375 mgcl l 1 or lower for water reaching the demand location 4 a salinity of 400 mgcl l 1 or lower for water reaching the demand location 5 a salinity of 425 mgcl l 1 or lower for water reaching the demand location 4 1 network configurations for a minimum salinity at the demand location the lowest possible salinity is determined by sorting well clusters in order of increasing salinity and by calculating the cumulative salinity based on the available water see supplementary information 6 the set of the well clusters included in the wsn differs between 2030 2045 and 2110 because the salinization freshening rate is not equal for all well clusters the minimum possible salinity for a demand of 2 5 mm 3 year 1 at the demand location is 246 mgcl l 1 in 2030 287 mgcl l 1 in 2045 and 318 mgcl l 1 in 2110 supplying water at the lowest possible salinity requires supply networks covering almost the complete study area fig 6 such extensive networks are needed when high quality water is not available close to the demand site the main difference between the 2030 simulation and the simulations of 2045 and 2110 is the use of well cluster 1 the salinity of well cluster 1 increases at a faster rate than other well clusters and is excluded from the minimum salinity network in favor of well cluster 16 in 2045 and 2110 well cluster 21 also has a relatively high rate of salinization and is excluded in the 2110 network 4 2 network configurations without salinity requirements at the demand location networks without a salinity requirement have an identical configuration total length 46 9 km and costs in 2030 2045 and 2110 fig 7 the configuration is identical because the water quantity which can be extracted from each well cluster is considered constant due to salinization the resulting chloride concentrations at the demand location are 491 mgcl l 1 in 2030 510 mgcl l 1 in 2045 and 529 mgcl l 1 in 2110 the chloride concentration increase is 38 mgcl 1 l 8 2 2 529 mgcl l 1 491 mgcl l 1 491 mgcl l 1 8 and is low compared to the overall 243 mgcl l 1 29 3 3 1095 mgcl l 1 852 mgcl l 1 852 mgcl l 1 29 see last row of supplementary information 6 increase for the complete study area the low salinization of the water supplied by the wsn is caused by freshening of well clusters 10 13 and 16 the extraction rate from well cluster 14 is capped at 97 corresponding to a flow of 548 m3 day 1 with a pipeline diameter of 100 mm see table 2 increasing the flow of this cluster would require a pipeline diameter of 200 mm leading to higher costs the amount of water that can be extracted from well cluster 10 is flexible and can be increased from 98 to 100 without increasing or decreasing the network investment costs this flexibility can be used to provide slightly more water but leads to water with higher salinity at the demand location 4 3 network configurations for a salinity at the demand location of 375 mgcl l 1 400 mgcl l 1 and 425 mgcl l 1 or lower the optimal network configurations for different periods and salinities at the demand site are shown in fig 8 small changes in demand quality 25 mgcl l 1 affect the optimal configuration of the water supply network the general trend is that the length complexity and costs of the supply network increase when groundwater with a lower salinity is required at the demand location this trend is the most pronounced for the 2110 simulation the optimal network for a demand quality of 425 mgcl l 1 is 17 2 km shorter than for a demand of 375 mgcl l 1 see fig 8 and table 3 the salinization of well clusters leads to longer networks and increasing costs over time the networks a2 a3 and b3 see fig 8 share the same configuration this network configuration has a length of 51 8 km and is suitable between 2030 and 2045 for a salinity up to 425 mgcl l 1 the difference with the network configuration without a salinity requirement at the demand location section 4 2 is the addition of well cluster 17 well cluster 17 is added because it provides enough fresh groundwater to reach the desired salinity the networks a1 b2 and c3 see fig 8 also share the same configuration this network configuration of 51 6 km is 0 1 more expensive than the 51 8 km network a2 a3 and b3 a shorter network can have higher costs depending on the specific pipeline diameters which need to be used the salinity of the groundwater supplied by this network is lower than the required salinity of the demand site for any of the periods shown in fig 8 for example the chloride concentration of groundwater provided by network a1 is 337 mgcl l 1 instead of the maximum allowed concentration of 375 mgcl l 1 this is possible due to the constraint in eq 10 which ensures that the salinity of groundwater reaching the demand location is lower than or equal to the demand salinity a network which supplies groundwater with a lower salinity than the demand salinity the case for a1 b2 and c3 only occurs when the lowest cost network happens to yield a lower salinity the networks b1 and c2 see fig 8 share the same configuration this network configuration has a length of 59 0 km and is needed for a demand salinity up to 375 mgcl 1 by 2045 the c1 network is created by connecting cluster 20 to the b1 c2 network resulting in a 68 8 km network for a detailed description of the characteristics of the network configurations see supplementary information 8 to supplementary information 10 4 4 network costs in relation to salinity and time as the maximum allowed salinity at the demand site increases the length and costs of the wsn decrease table 3 from top to bottom increasing the maximum allowed salinity increases the number of well clusters which can be used in the network a larger number of usable well clusters increases the probability that well clusters located close to the demand location can be used the possibility to choose well clusters close to the demand location results in shorter networks shorter networks generally have lower costs with some exceptions see section 4 3 in general the wsn costs increase when the same water quality needs to be supplied further in the future table 3 from left to right except for the minimum salinity network this is the result of the salinization of the well clusters in the study area salinization of well clusters results in fewer clusters which can contribute to the network for a specific demand salinity as a result longer networks which transport fresh water from further away are needed the optimal network configuration for a specific region depends on the local groundwater availability and the groundwater salinization freshening dynamics salinization and freshening of specific well clusters can lead to unexpected wsn costs for the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation this is reflected in the optimal network configuration for the minimum possible salinity at the demand location when only using groundwater based on the modeled changes in groundwater salinity in zeeuws vlaanderen the minimum salinity network for 2110 has lower costs compared to 2045 and 2030 5 discussion 5 1 waterroute for regional planning the modeling approach presented in this study expands the functionality of the wsn model willet et al 2020 with the possibility to mix water and further expands the modeling toolbox on which integrated water resources management is reliant srdjevic et al 2004 determining the most cost effective network for a specific quality at the demand site needs to consider different water qualities and water quantities at the supply sites input data on water quantity and water quality is supplied by existing and tested external hydrological models waterroute processes these inputs and makes it possible to explore water supply network options when the water quality of regional supply sources changes over time it shows how small changes in the maximum allowed salinity of water reaching the demand location cause significant changes in the configuration of the water supply network this knowledge is useful for regional planning purposes waterroute can also be used to plan network expansion by using the characteristics of an existing supply network as inputs for existing networks the capacity of the existing pipelines is fixed but using these pipelines does not require new investments other characteristics of existing networks can also be incorporated for example if existing networks contain segments with iron pipelines a maximum salinity constraint for these pipeline sections can prevent corrosion when using saline brackish water resources the possibility to include several demand locations instead of a single demand location for decentralized water supply network design and regional planning is relevant for areas where multiple water users compete for the same water resources the addition of multiple demand locations with different water demand quantities and qualities introduces non convex quadratic constraints to the optimization model and requires a problem formulation where several water flows of different qualities can flow over the same trajectory in parallel pipelines developing an effective problem formulation for multiple demand sites is suggested for future research 5 2 alternative water sources for industrial use decentralized supply networks making use of alternative water sources can be a solution to cope with future changes in water availability around the world decentralization of water supply can enhance water reuse possibilities leflaive 2009 and can have advantages over centralized systems domènech 2011 leflaive 2009 piratla and goverdhanam 2015 supplying industrial sites with alternative regional water resources requires data on the availability of alternative sources now and in the future waterroute is a tool that can evaluate the feasibility of using these alternative sources and their corresponding decentralized supply networks at a high spatial resolution modeled brackish groundwater is used as the alternative water supply in the zeeuws vlaanderen example simulation other alternatives such as treated wastewater rainwater desalinated seawater or surface water can also be evaluated with waterroute the formulation of the optimization problem in waterroute is based on an overall mass balance of water and a product the product used in the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation is chloride other water quality parameters than chloride can also be used another possibility is to investigate multiple products simultaneously by adding new variables and constraints for each of the additional products to the basic model framework this functionality is useful when evaluating other local alternative water sources such as rainwater and treated wastewater from industries urban areas and agriculture when adding additional quality parameters non linear and non additive relationships between products should be accounted for for example two water steams originally free of microbial activity the first due to a lack of nutrients the second due to a lack of organic carbon can lead to bacterial growth when mixed the addition of these complex interactions is only possible when they can be accurately predicted mathematically but can lead to computational problems if relationships are non linear the fields of industrial ecology hond 1999 and circular urban metabolism agudelo vera et al 2012 can benefit from such additions for analysis and design within industrial ecology specifically industrial symbiosis providing water at a specific quality fit for purpose has been proposed to alleviate water shortages bauer et al 2019 5 3 supply sources and sustainability groundwater extractions have inevitable consequences on local groundwater hydrology limiting the amount of groundwater extracted to renewable rates is one step towards sustainable exploitation of local water resources waterroute is suitable for designing water supply networks which respect sustainable extraction rates this functionality is needed for regional planning that aims to anticipate on the expected changes in water availability hanasaki et al 2013 salinization of ground water resources h d holland and k k turekian 2003 unep 2016 and the overall need to match resource utilization with the local global carrying capacity bakshi et al 2015 within industrial water use the connection between local carrying capacity and evaluation methods for water use is still lacking willet et al 2019 waterroute provides a link between the physical hydrological modeling of water resources and regional planning of water supply networks through this link the costs for mismanagement of scarce water resources e g overextraction leading to salinization requiring longer supply networks becomes apparent in this study the maximum groundwater extraction rates are made dependent on a maximum drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level for the complete region it is proposed to replace regional values for maximum salinization and phreatic groundwater level drawdown by well cluster specific values in future research using well cluster specific values reveals the effect of sustainability thresholds at a higher spatial resolution on wsn design other possible criteria for groundwater extractions are the vulnerability of local ecosystems to salinization castillo et al 2018 herbert et al 2015 and the susceptibility of soils to sodification minhas et al 2019 a nearly irreversible process the results of waterroute show that in most scenarios not all well clusters are used or well clusters are exploited below their maximum capacity waterroute does not yet consider the effects of partial extractions on the complete groundwater system the simulations performed for this study suggest that interference between well clusters can be neglected for the zeeuws vlaanderen area because well clusters are far enough apart in other areas interference may occur and simulating the effects of partial extractions on groundwater salinity and drawdown to verify the feasibility of the network design is suggested simulating the effects of a network design on groundwater and subsequently updating the network design creates a dynamic interaction between the optimization model and the groundwater model such a dynamic interaction is relevant in areas where water extractions at one well cluster can affect other well clusters but is currently computationally infeasible the waterroute model can also assist in designing regional water supply networks which counteract saltwater intrusion from the sea by using the wsn to recharge aquifers when fresh surface water is abundant smart groundwater extractions can lead to freshening of groundwater resources by attracting fresh water from the surface water systems instead of saline groundwater from below the extraction point coupling the operation of decentralized water supply networks with locations where this form of freshening is possible can lead to regional benefits besides water supply fresh water resources can be stored during the wet season to be retrieved at a later moment with aquifer storage and recovery asr maliva et al 2006 correct timing of extractions can make the stored water available for use without affecting the fresh salt groundwater interface in the subsoil while being a cost effective option compared to other water supply alternatives oude essink et al 2018 vink et al 2010 zuurbier et al 2012 waterroute is needed to design the supply network in which asr sites are embedded 5 4 interactions with desalination waterroute can in future work be combined with desalination models to evaluate the potential for local supply networks in combination with mild desalination desalination of lower quality water provided by shorter and less expensive networks can be preferable over extensive networks which provide high quality water the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation shows that up to 2030 the 375 mgcl l 1 network is not significantly more expensive than the 400 mgcl l 1 or 425 mgcl l 1 network supplying water at 375 mgcl l 1 in 2110 leads to a significant increase in costs instead of expanding the supply network mild desalination can be applied to achieve the desired quality desalination technology improvements and optimization of treatment train design allow for treatment of a wide range of saline streams mcgovern et al 2014 several modeling approaches exist to design treatment trains optimized for a specific input stream skiborowski et al 2012 wreyford et al 2020 coupling a treatment train model which calculates the lowest treatment train costs such as desalt wreyford et al 2020 with the costs for water transport can yield better overall system configurations the performance of such systems can be evaluated through multi criteria decision making techniques such as data envelopment analysis belmondo bianchi et al 2020 determining the optimal location for desalination systems at the user at the individual supply sites or at mixing locations within decentralized networks has implications for the energy system and is a next step within the water energy nexus research field hussey and pittock 2012 6 conclusions waterroute is a valuable tool for planning and design of water supply networks using local alternative water sources waterroute designs water supply networks that deliver water at the specified quality and quantity of the user based on the modeled or known availability of water resources in a region the model is used in an example simulation to show how the dynamics of groundwater resources can be connected to the regional design and planning of water supply networks long term scenarios can be generated which help to anticipate on changes in fresh water availability waterroute is demonstrated with a simulation for zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands and shows that a small decrease in demand quality a chloride concentration increase from 375 mgcl l 1 to 400 mgcl l in 2110 results in a decrease of the supply network placement costs by 7 for a demand of 2 5 mm3 year 1 delivering higher quality water leads to higher costs because longer networks are needed the length of the water supply network for the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation varies between 46 9 km and 122 1 km based on the water quality required at the demand location the waterroute model shows that costs can be up to 68 higher to supply water with the lowest possible salinity compared to a demand with no salinity constraint in the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation the best network configuration depends on the specific water quality demand of the user the local water availability and the time horizon over which planning occurs as water quality requirements become more stringent optimal network selection becomes more complex and modeling tools such as waterroute are needed to assist decision makers in designing cost effective decentralized water supply networks waterroute can in future work be expanded and can be used to determine the optimal balance between water transport and water treatment desalination the use of aquifer storage and recovery within decentralized networks and the creation of decentralized water supply networks based on the exchange of water between urban industrial and agricultural areas through these applications waterroute can assist in

16763,water users can reduce their impact on scarce freshwater resources by using more abundant regional brackish or saline groundwater resources decentralized water supply networks wsn can connect these regional groundwater resources with water users here we present waterroute water route optimization utility tool evaluation a model which optimizes water supply network configurations based on infrastructure investment costs while considering the water quality salinity requirements of the user we present an example simulation in which we determine the optimal wsn for different values of the maximum allowed salinity at the demand location while supplying 2 5 million m3 year 1 with regional groundwater the example simulation is based on data from zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands the optimal wsn configurations for the years 2030 2045 and 2110 are generated based on the simulated salinity of the regional groundwater resources the simulation results show that small changes in the maximum salinity at the demand location have significant effects on the wsn configuration and therefore on regional planning for the example simulation the wsn costs can differ by up to 68 based on the required salinity at the demand site waterroute can be used to design water supply networks which incorporate alternative water supply sources such as local brackish groundwater this study

footprint 4 4 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 but have a high local water use intensity industrial facilities are generally located close to an abundant water source or large quantities of water are transported towards the industrial site to cover the demand historically industries rely on centralized water supply infrastructures to transport water domènech 2011 gleick 2003 the use of alternative local water resources can reduce the environmental impact of industrial water supply and requires a transition to decentralized water supply systems decentralized systems can alleviate environmental

functionality to the previously developed wsn model willet et al 2020 the original wsn model generates regional water supply networks only based on water quantity requirements in the work presented here the previously developed wsn model is extended to include water quality specifically in terms of salinity the addition of water quality as a design criterion for water supply networks is crucial to design regional decentralized water supply networks the inclusion of water quality makes the delivery of water at the desired quality possible by mixing in this study waterroute is used to demonstrate how brackish saline groundwater resources exploited at sustainable yields can serve as potential alternative water resources for industrial use brackish water resources can ensure a sustainable water supply when combined with optimal network layouts and desalination caldera and breyer 2017 reddy and ghaffour 2007 for the first time to our knowledge we present and apply a modeling approach to create water supply network layouts with optimal pipeline routing at a high spatial resolution connecting supply sources with different salinities which also accounts for pipeline placement costs waterroute optimizes water supply network configurations according to site specific demands for water quality and quantity with water supply sources that have different and variable water qualities with this functionality we connect regional hydrological modeling with planning of water supply infrastructure the model generates the optimal network configuration and quantity of water needed from each supply source to satisfy the industrial demand without trespassing sustainable limits for water extractions waterroute is a valuable tool for iwrm and regional planning in areas where maximum sustainable yields of aquifers need to be enforced areas of particular interest are freshwater scarce areas with intensive industrial activities for which lower quality water can be used and where alternative ground water resources are available we present and example simulation with regional brackish groundwater resources as the alternative water source for an industrial site 2 methodology waterroute is an optimization and visualization model which calculates optimal water supply network configurations the optimization model mixes water streams with different qualities to supply a single demand location with a desired water quality mixing of water is a new and essential functionality to design decentralized water supply networks that use alternative water resources with different qualities in waterroute water supply and demand sites are represented as vertices and pipeline connections are represented as edges the vertex and edge representation of water transport networks is commonly used for optimization mala jetmarova et al 2017 and was previously used for network design without mixing in willet et al 2020 waterroute requires two inputs the available water sources in a region and a preliminary network from which the optimal network configuration is selected the preliminary network is created by determining the lowest cost routes between demand and supply locations using geographic information systems gis methods the inputs are processed by the waterroute optimization model to yield the network configuration with the lowest cost for a specific water demand at the demand location section 2 1 2 6 the outputs are then visualized with gis software for evaluation and decision making an overall representation of waterroute 1 1 software used for

optimization model is a variation of the fixed charge network flow problem fcnfp hirsch and dantzig 1968 kim and hooker 2002 in this study we alter the original fcnfp formulation to include water quality parameters as a constraint the water quality parameter included in this study is the salinity the chloride concentration of groundwater water may mix throughout the network yet the water reaching the demand location must not exceed the maximum salinity defined by the user the waterroute optimization problem is described as a planar mathematical system represented by vertices v i and edges e v i v j vertices represent supply locations demand locations and transport hubs junctions edges represent the possible pipeline connections between vertices each vertex v i has a chloride concentration c i and an associated water supply or demand s i three situations can be distinguished for each vertex when s i 0 vertex v i is a water source s i is the volume of water available and c i is the chloride concentration of the available water when s i 0 vertex v i is a demand location s i is the volume of water to be supplied and c i is the maximum chloride concentration for the water when s i 0 vertex v i is a transport hub junction in the network where water can mix edges e v i v j transport water from vertex v i into vertex v j each edge e v i v j has two variables flow of water x i j and flow of product p i j the product is the amount of chloride in mgcl day 1 the total product is determined based on the concentration and amount of water extracted from each supply vertex each edge has an associated cost per unit flow per km r i j and a length in km l i j additional parameters are the maximum flow u i j and maximum product capacity t i j over each edge we define a maximum allowed concentration c m that is used to constrain the final quality of the supplied water table 1 gives an overview of the parameters in the waterroute optimization problem formulation 2 2 objective function the waterroute optimization problem minimizes the total investment costs for pipeline placement tppc total pipeline placement costs the tppc is the sum of the costs of the individual pipeline segments required for the complete water supply network due to the limited number of available pipeline diameters the pipeline investment costs r i j increase with steps depending on the flow required the interaction between the available pipeline diameters flow requirements and flow velocity leads to investment costs which increase with a stepwise pattern see supplementary information 1 a stepwise increase in costs is referred to as a stairwise arc cost function bornstein and rust 1988 du and pardalos 1993 holmberg 1994 in this study pipeline diameters with increments of 100 mm and a maximum flow velocity of 1 5 m s 1 are used the steps in the cost function were determined for a flow range between 0 and 5 5 mm3 year 1 by increasing the flow with steps of 0 1 mm3 year 1 with a peak factor of 1 5 supplementary information 1 the stepwise behavior is incorporated in the objective function given by 1 t p p c i j e f i j x i j the stepwise costs for placement of new pipelines f i j x i j are defined by 2 f i j x i j 0 x i j 0 w i t h r i j k a n d λ i j k a s r i j k l i j λ i j k 1 x i j λ i j k d e f i n e d i n t a b l e 2 where x i j is the flow and λ i j k represent the breakpoints in the cost function based on the flow in the pipeline when there is no flow over an edge x i j 0 no investment costs are incurred resulting in f i j x i j 0 and the edge is considered unused the possible pipeline diameters are represented with an index k 1 to k 5 the length of the pipeline segment is l i j and r i j k are the investment costs per meter table 2 2 3 constraints water quantity and pipeline capacity the amount of water extracted from any vertex should be smaller than or equal to the total amount of water available at that vertex and is ensured by 3 i j e x i j j i e x j i s i i v which ensures the water balance at each vertex we apply this constraint to every vertex i in the set of vertices v edges can be assigned a flow of 0 meaning the edge is not used but the flow should not exceed the maximum capacity u i j of the edge which is ensured by 4 0 x i j u i j i j e which represents the allowed minimum and maximum flow over each edge the maximum capacity over the edges in the preliminary network is equal to the demand volume of the demand site because existing pipelines are not included in the example simulation if existing pipelines are re used the maximum capacity over an edge depends on the size of the existing pipeline section we apply the constraint to every edge the sum of the water flows exiting a vertex should be equal to the sum of the water flows entering the vertex if the vertex is a transport hub s i 0 5 i j e x i j j i e x j i 0 i v s i 0 which ensures that the outgoing flow x i j is equal to the incoming flow x j i for all transport hubs s i 0 supply sites located in the middle of the network can perform a dual function providing water to the network while also serving as a transport hub see fig 2 the water flowing out from any supply vertex needs to be larger or equal to the water flowing towards the supply vertex and is ensured by 6 i j e x i j j i e x j i 0 i v s i 0 the sum of the water flows out x i j from a supply site vertex s i 0 must be greater than or equal to the sum of the water flows entering x j i the vertex 2 4 constraints water quality waterroute generates network layouts that supply water with a specific maximum concentration at the demand site for mixing of water flows up to a maximum concentration we formulate the constraints in eq 7 11 these constraints control the amount of product p j i flowing over an edge e i j the amount of product mass extracted from a supply vertex must be equal to the amount of water volume extracted from that vertex times the concentration mass volume at that vertex if the vertex is a source s i 0 we ensure this with 7 i j e p i j j i e p j i i j e x i j i j e x j i c i i v s i 0 the constraint in eq 7 ensures that the water extracted from a supply vertex x i j x j i times the concentration at the vertex c i is equal to the product extracted p i j p j i the amount of product extracted from any supply vertex must be lower than or equal to the amount of product extractable from that vertex 8 i j e p i j j i e p j i s i c i i v s i 0 the product available at a supply vertex is determined by multiplying the concentration at the vertex by the amount of water available s i c i similar to the water flows for a supply site functioning as a transport hub the sum of the product flows towards the vertex must be lower than or equal to the sum of the product flows exiting the vertex this is achieved with 9 i j e p i j j i e p j i 0 i v s i 0 where p i j is the outgoing product flow and p j i is the incoming product flow the product flow mgcl day 1 towards the demand site s i 0 divided by the water volume m3 day 1 towards the demand vertex must be lower or equal to the maximum allowed concentration we ensure this with 10 i j e p i j j i e p j i i j e x i j i j e x j i c i i v s i 0 which is similar to eq 7 but the equality condition is replaced by an inequality condition and eq 7 is only applied to the demand location s i 0 if an exact target concentration is required the inequality condition in eq 10 is replaced by an equality condition if an edge is used the product flow should be larger than zero and the product flow must not exceed the maximum allowed concentration for water in the pipeline t i j 11 0 p i j t i j x i j i j e which can be used for the expansion of existing networks where the product concentration needs to be limited for certain pipelines 2 5 formulation overview and outputs the complete formulation for the waterroute optimization problem is written as minimize objective function tppc 1 subject to flow conservation constraints 3 5 6 physical bounds constraints 4 11 product conservation constraints 7 8 9 10 solving the optimization problem yields the lowest cost wsn that supplies water with a concentration lower than or equal to the maximum allowed concentration at the demand location the output of the problem is the water flow x i j over each edge of the preliminary network layout edges that are assigned a flow of zero see eq 2 and table 2 are not in use and do not contribute to the tppc 2 6 special case minimum salinity network determination when the desired water quality is set to the minimum salinity achievable for a certain demand see supplementary information 3 the supply sources can be determined before the network configuration optimization supply sites are ordered by increasing salinity and the cumulative water availability and associated salinity are calculated the set of clusters which can supply the demand at the minimum salinity is determined from the cumulative water and salinity list clusters not in the set are removed from the waterroute optimization model inputs and the optimal network is determined by omitting the water quality constraints this procedure reduces calculation time considerably for large networks 3 waterroute example simulation inputs waterroute is demonstrated by generating water supply networks to supply an industrial site dow terneuzen in zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands with local groundwater the waterroute model is used to investigate the effect of varying the maximum chloride concentration mgcl l 1 reaching the industrial site on the optimal wsn layout waterroute is used to generate water supply networks for 2030 2045 and 2110 to account for changes in groundwater salinity and a static demand of 2 5 mm3 year 1 the inputs for the example simulation are the available local groundwater sources section 3 1 and the preliminary network layout between the demand and supply locations section 3 2 3 1 groundwater salinity and availability the groundwater in the example simulation comes from several well clusters identified based on the fresh salt groundwater interface as well as the transmissivity which affects the possibility to extract water of the groundwater system in the region see willet et al 2020 the regional groundwater system has been extensively monitored mapped and modelled in the past and shows the presence of fresh groundwater resources on top of groundwater with a higher salinity delsman et al 2018 a submodel of an existing calibrated 3d variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model is used to simulate changes in groundwater salinity and piezometric heads over time for the period 2020 2110 van baaren et al 2016 the submodel covers zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands and has the dimensions 70 km west east by 28 km north south by 143 m thick the 3d groundwater model uses the modflow michael g mcdonald and arlen w harbaugh 1988 based computer code mocdens3d faneca sànchez et al 2012 oude essink et al 2010 it uses 40 model layers with grid cell thicknesses varying from 0 5 m to 10 m with increasing depth to reproduce the movement of groundwater salinity in the vertical direction resulting in over 7 8 million grid cells changes in groundwater salinity are simulated by advection and hydrodynamic dispersion complex geology horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities stafleu et al 2011 and the mapped groundwater salinity via intensive airborne electromagnetics delsman et al 2018 are inserted in the model stresses to the groundwater system consist of seasonal natural groundwater recharge from de lange et al 2014 six surface water types sea and estuarine waters lakes canals small rivers watercourses up to ditches a shallow drainage system and groundwater extraction wells retrieved from a database of the water board scheldestromen the surface water and drainage systems are inserted into the model using an accurate digital elevation model actuel hoogtebestand nederland 2020 resolution 5 5 m boundary conditions the sea the estuary and the belgian hinterland complete the existing 3d groundwater model van baaren et al 2016 the original 3d variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model has been calibrated based on a database of piezometric heads calibration was done in van baaren et al 2016 the model has been published in a deltares report van baaren et al 2016 the final calibration set of piezometric heads consisted of 606 observations for the entire area of the province of zeeland from the database of dinoloket nl over the period 1 1 1991 up to 31 12 2000 the effect of the groundwater density in the observation wells on the heads was considered post et al 2007 we used the code pest the most widely used calibration software for groundwater in the world doherty 2005 parameters that have been changed during the calibration are the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard the hydraulic resistance from to the surface water system and finally the groundwater recharge the results for zeeuws vlaanderen are as follows the median of the difference between the calculated minus the measured heads changes from 0 18 m to 0 009 m and the average absolute difference between the calculated minus the measured heads changes from 0 29 m to 0 24 m we believe these differences are good enough calibration results validation of the model has not been performed as the entire dataset was believed to be needed for the calibration in this study the 3d groundwater model simulates the effect of multiple brackish groundwater extractions used as the alternative water supply source over the well clusters on the groundwater salinity over time and the piezometric heads in the vicinity of well clusters in willet et al 2020 analytical equations were used to estimate the upconing of the interface between fresh and saline groundwater dagan and bear 1968 and the drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level bruggeman 1999 the numerical 3d groundwater model incorporates hydro geo logical details of the local setting the heterogeneous salinity distribution interaction with the surface water system geology includes changes in groundwater salinity due to extraction wells and thus produces more accurate results than the previously used analytical methods the same locations of the 2079 extraction wells in the 25 well clusters identified in willet et al 2020 were used the number of extraction wells per well cluster varies from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 331 the extraction wells are positioned at least 100 m from each other to limit strong drawdown superposition for further details on well placement and extraction rates see supplementary information 2 the surface water boundary is modelled with a fixed salinity concentration and does not change over the entire simulation period there is not enough surface water salinity data to insert a seasonal varying surface water salinity boundary condition though the model can do so a seasonal varying surface water head boundary was modeled several surface water features in the zeeuws vlaanderen region are draining from the groundwater system or are not active in summer the fresh groundwater recharge is likely a dominant source of fresh water that enters the wells given that small water courses and ditches are the main surface water phenomena in this region to meet environmental targets e g natura2000 and to limit drought effects the maximum drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level is set to 50 mm fig 3 the exact maximum allowed groundwater extraction rate per well was determined iteratively while meeting the maximum drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level in the first iteration step the starting groundwater extraction rates as used in willet et al 2020 are taken within ten iteration steps the changes in groundwater extraction rates become negligible the 3d groundwater model considers interferences in piezometric head and groundwater salinity over time of nearby extraction wells the overall salinity of a well cluster is determined based on the sum of the salt in mgcl day 1 extracted from all wells in the well cluster and the sum of the water m3 day 1 extracted from all wells in the well cluster the available groundwater from all well clusters in the study area is 6 119 mm3 year 1 while having a maximum drawdown of 50 mm changes in precipitation patterns and the associated effects on groundwater availability were not included the overall combined salinity of all 2079 wells over 25 well clusters is 472 mgcl l 1 in 2020 in 2020 there are two well clusters in the northwest and center of the study area which are significantly more saline fig 5 operating all well clusters at the maximum extraction rate increases the salinity of most clusters the average chloride concentration increases from 472 mgcl l 1 in 2020 to 852 mgcl l 1 in 2030 981 mgcl l 1 in 2045 and 1095 mgcl l 1 in 2110 see supplementary information 4 for details on water availability at each well cluster when water extractions start the salinity of well clusters changes quickly within on average 10 years but stabilizes over time when a new equilibrium in the subsoil is reached see supplementary information 5 for some well clusters a significant decrease in salinity i e freshening occurs because fresh water from the surface water system moves towards the extraction point when groundwater is extracted clusters 10 13 16 and 19 see fig 4 well cluster 24 first becomes more saline between 2020 and 2030 and then becomes slightly fresher up to 2110 the salinization or freshening rate of well clusters is not uniform for all clusters and therefore the optimal wsn configuration with the lowest costs is specific for each period and demand quality 3 2 preliminary network layout the preliminary network layout is the complete set of possible pipelines connecting all the supply and demand locations in the study area the waterroute optimization model selects the subset of pipelines with the lowest total costs for a specific demand at the demand site the selected subset is the optimal wsn configuration for a specific scenario the preliminary network layout in this study represents a water supply network which still needs to be built but the same methodology can be applied for an existing to be expanded water supply network the preliminary network for the zeeuws vlaanderen region was generated following the steps as outlined in willet et al 2020 using lowest cost route methods with gis software the main steps to generate the preliminary network layout are 1 creating a cost of passage surface based on local land use types in collaboration with water supply experts see willet et al 2020 a cost of passage surface is needed to include the local spatial data in the network optimization problem including local spatial data is important since the costs for placing pipeline infrastructure depend on the local land use and subsurface characteristics feldman et al 1995 2 tracing the lowest cost route between each possible combination of supply and demand locations based on the cost of passage surface the resulting network serves as the preliminary network layout for optimization the use of lowest cost route methods is common for infrastructure routing atkinson et al 2005 collischonn and pilar 2000 douglas 1994 the preliminary network has a total of 408 pipeline segments and 243 transport hubs to connect the 25 groundwater supply locations and the single demand location see supplementary information 7 4 results waterroute is used to generate the optimal water supply network configuration for five demand scenarios in the zeeuws vlaanderen region for the years 2030 2045 and 2110 a total of 15 simulations in each scenario the salinity of the water reaching the demand location differs while the demand volume is kept the same at 2 5 mm3 year the scenarios are 1 the minimum possible salinity for water reaching the demand location 2 no salinity requirements for water reaching the demand location after determining the salinity range in 1 and 2 three intermediate scenarios are simulated 3 a salinity of 375 mgcl l 1 or lower for water reaching the demand location 4 a salinity of 400 mgcl l 1 or lower for water reaching the demand location 5 a salinity of 425 mgcl l 1 or lower for water reaching the demand location 4 1 network configurations for a minimum salinity at the demand location the lowest possible salinity is determined by sorting well clusters in order of increasing salinity and by calculating the cumulative salinity based on the available water see supplementary information 6 the set of the well clusters included in the wsn differs between 2030 2045 and 2110 because the salinization freshening rate is not equal for all well clusters the minimum possible salinity for a demand of 2 5 mm 3 year 1 at the demand location is 246 mgcl l 1 in 2030 287 mgcl l 1 in 2045 and 318 mgcl l 1 in 2110 supplying water at the lowest possible salinity requires supply networks covering almost the complete study area fig 6 such extensive networks are needed when high quality water is not available close to the demand site the main difference between the 2030 simulation and the simulations of 2045 and 2110 is the use of well cluster 1 the salinity of well cluster 1 increases at a faster rate than other well clusters and is excluded from the minimum salinity network in favor of well cluster 16 in 2045 and 2110 well cluster 21 also has a relatively high rate of salinization and is excluded in the 2110 network 4 2 network configurations without salinity requirements at the demand location networks without a salinity requirement have an identical configuration total length 46 9 km and costs in 2030 2045 and 2110 fig 7 the configuration is identical because the water quantity which can be extracted from each well cluster is considered constant due to salinization the resulting chloride concentrations at the demand location are 491 mgcl l 1 in 2030 510 mgcl l 1 in 2045 and 529 mgcl l 1 in 2110 the chloride concentration increase is 38 mgcl 1 l 8 2 2 529 mgcl l 1 491 mgcl l 1 491 mgcl l 1 8 and is low compared to the overall 243 mgcl l 1 29 3 3 1095 mgcl l 1 852 mgcl l 1 852 mgcl l 1 29 see last row of supplementary information 6 increase for the complete study area the low salinization of the water supplied by the wsn is caused by freshening of well clusters 10 13 and 16 the extraction rate from well cluster 14 is capped at 97 corresponding to a flow of 548 m3 day 1 with a pipeline diameter of 100 mm see table 2 increasing the flow of this cluster would require a pipeline diameter of 200 mm leading to higher costs the amount of water that can be extracted from well cluster 10 is flexible and can be increased from 98 to 100 without increasing or decreasing the network investment costs this flexibility can be used to provide slightly more water but leads to water with higher salinity at the demand location 4 3 network configurations for a salinity at the demand location of 375 mgcl l 1 400 mgcl l 1 and 425 mgcl l 1 or lower the optimal network configurations for different periods and salinities at the demand site are shown in fig 8 small changes in demand quality 25 mgcl l 1 affect the optimal configuration of the water supply network the general trend is that the length complexity and costs of the supply network increase when groundwater with a lower salinity is required at the demand location this trend is the most pronounced for the 2110 simulation the optimal network for a demand quality of 425 mgcl l 1 is 17 2 km shorter than for a demand of 375 mgcl l 1 see fig 8 and table 3 the salinization of well clusters leads to longer networks and increasing costs over time the networks a2 a3 and b3 see fig 8 share the same configuration this network configuration has a length of 51 8 km and is suitable between 2030 and 2045 for a salinity up to 425 mgcl l 1 the difference with the network configuration without a salinity requirement at the demand location section 4 2 is the addition of well cluster 17 well cluster 17 is added because it provides enough fresh groundwater to reach the desired salinity the networks a1 b2 and c3 see fig 8 also share the same configuration this network configuration of 51 6 km is 0 1 more expensive than the 51 8 km network a2 a3 and b3 a shorter network can have higher costs depending on the specific pipeline diameters which need to be used the salinity of the groundwater supplied by this network is lower than the required salinity of the demand site for any of the periods shown in fig 8 for example the chloride concentration of groundwater provided by network a1 is 337 mgcl l 1 instead of the maximum allowed concentration of 375 mgcl l 1 this is possible due to the constraint in eq 10 which ensures that the salinity of groundwater reaching the demand location is lower than or equal to the demand salinity a network which supplies groundwater with a lower salinity than the demand salinity the case for a1 b2 and c3 only occurs when the lowest cost network happens to yield a lower salinity the networks b1 and c2 see fig 8 share the same configuration this network configuration has a length of 59 0 km and is needed for a demand salinity up to 375 mgcl 1 by 2045 the c1 network is created by connecting cluster 20 to the b1 c2 network resulting in a 68 8 km network for a detailed description of the characteristics of the network configurations see supplementary information 8 to supplementary information 10 4 4 network costs in relation to salinity and time as the maximum allowed salinity at the demand site increases the length and costs of the wsn decrease table 3 from top to bottom increasing the maximum allowed salinity increases the number of well clusters which can be used in the network a larger number of usable well clusters increases the probability that well clusters located close to the demand location can be used the possibility to choose well clusters close to the demand location results in shorter networks shorter networks generally have lower costs with some exceptions see section 4 3 in general the wsn costs increase when the same water quality needs to be supplied further in the future table 3 from left to right except for the minimum salinity network this is the result of the salinization of the well clusters in the study area salinization of well clusters results in fewer clusters which can contribute to the network for a specific demand salinity as a result longer networks which transport fresh water from further away are needed the optimal network configuration for a specific region depends on the local groundwater availability and the groundwater salinization freshening dynamics salinization and freshening of specific well clusters can lead to unexpected wsn costs for the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation this is reflected in the optimal network configuration for the minimum possible salinity at the demand location when only using groundwater based on the modeled changes in groundwater salinity in zeeuws vlaanderen the minimum salinity network for 2110 has lower costs compared to 2045 and 2030 5 discussion 5 1 waterroute for regional planning the modeling approach presented in this study expands the functionality of the wsn model willet et al 2020 with the possibility to mix water and further expands the modeling toolbox on which integrated water resources management is reliant srdjevic et al 2004 determining the most cost effective network for a specific quality at the demand site needs to consider different water qualities and water quantities at the supply sites input data on water quantity and water quality is supplied by existing and tested external hydrological models waterroute processes these inputs and makes it possible to explore water supply network options when the water quality of regional supply sources changes over time it shows how small changes in the maximum allowed salinity of water reaching the demand location cause significant changes in the configuration of the water supply network this knowledge is useful for regional planning purposes waterroute can also be used to plan network expansion by using the characteristics of an existing supply network as inputs for existing networks the capacity of the existing pipelines is fixed but using these pipelines does not require new investments other characteristics of existing networks can also be incorporated for example if existing networks contain segments with iron pipelines a maximum salinity constraint for these pipeline sections can prevent corrosion when using saline brackish water resources the possibility to include several demand locations instead of a single demand location for decentralized water supply network design and regional planning is relevant for areas where multiple water users compete for the same water resources the addition of multiple demand locations with different water demand quantities and qualities introduces non convex quadratic constraints to the optimization model and requires a problem formulation where several water flows of different qualities can flow over the same trajectory in parallel pipelines developing an effective problem formulation for multiple demand sites is suggested for future research 5 2 alternative water sources for industrial use decentralized supply networks making use of alternative water sources can be a solution to cope with future changes in water availability around the world decentralization of water supply can enhance water reuse possibilities leflaive 2009 and can have advantages over centralized systems domènech 2011 leflaive 2009 piratla and goverdhanam 2015 supplying industrial sites with alternative regional water resources requires data on the availability of alternative sources now and in the future waterroute is a tool that can evaluate the feasibility of using these alternative sources and their corresponding decentralized supply networks at a high spatial resolution modeled brackish groundwater is used as the alternative water supply in the zeeuws vlaanderen example simulation other alternatives such as treated wastewater rainwater desalinated seawater or surface water can also be evaluated with waterroute the formulation of the optimization problem in waterroute is based on an overall mass balance of water and a product the product used in the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation is chloride other water quality parameters than chloride can also be used another possibility is to investigate multiple products simultaneously by adding new variables and constraints for each of the additional products to the basic model framework this functionality is useful when evaluating other local alternative water sources such as rainwater and treated wastewater from industries urban areas and agriculture when adding additional quality parameters non linear and non additive relationships between products should be accounted for for example two water steams originally free of microbial activity the first due to a lack of nutrients the second due to a lack of organic carbon can lead to bacterial growth when mixed the addition of these complex interactions is only possible when they can be accurately predicted mathematically but can lead to computational problems if relationships are non linear the fields of industrial ecology hond 1999 and circular urban metabolism agudelo vera et al 2012 can benefit from such additions for analysis and design within industrial ecology specifically industrial symbiosis providing water at a specific quality fit for purpose has been proposed to alleviate water shortages bauer et al 2019 5 3 supply sources and sustainability groundwater extractions have inevitable consequences on local groundwater hydrology limiting the amount of groundwater extracted to renewable rates is one step towards sustainable exploitation of local water resources waterroute is suitable for designing water supply networks which respect sustainable extraction rates this functionality is needed for regional planning that aims to anticipate on the expected changes in water availability hanasaki et al 2013 salinization of ground water resources h d holland and k k turekian 2003 unep 2016 and the overall need to match resource utilization with the local global carrying capacity bakshi et al 2015 within industrial water use the connection between local carrying capacity and evaluation methods for water use is still lacking willet et al 2019 waterroute provides a link between the physical hydrological modeling of water resources and regional planning of water supply networks through this link the costs for mismanagement of scarce water resources e g overextraction leading to salinization requiring longer supply networks becomes apparent in this study the maximum groundwater extraction rates are made dependent on a maximum drawdown of the phreatic groundwater level for the complete region it is proposed to replace regional values for maximum salinization and phreatic groundwater level drawdown by well cluster specific values in future research using well cluster specific values reveals the effect of sustainability thresholds at a higher spatial resolution on wsn design other possible criteria for groundwater extractions are the vulnerability of local ecosystems to salinization castillo et al 2018 herbert et al 2015 and the susceptibility of soils to sodification minhas et al 2019 a nearly irreversible process the results of waterroute show that in most scenarios not all well clusters are used or well clusters are exploited below their maximum capacity waterroute does not yet consider the effects of partial extractions on the complete groundwater system the simulations performed for this study suggest that interference between well clusters can be neglected for the zeeuws vlaanderen area because well clusters are far enough apart in other areas interference may occur and simulating the effects of partial extractions on groundwater salinity and drawdown to verify the feasibility of the network design is suggested simulating the effects of a network design on groundwater and subsequently updating the network design creates a dynamic interaction between the optimization model and the groundwater model such a dynamic interaction is relevant in areas where water extractions at one well cluster can affect other well clusters but is currently computationally infeasible the waterroute model can also assist in designing regional water supply networks which counteract saltwater intrusion from the sea by using the wsn to recharge aquifers when fresh surface water is abundant smart groundwater extractions can lead to freshening of groundwater resources by attracting fresh water from the surface water systems instead of saline groundwater from below the extraction point coupling the operation of decentralized water supply networks with locations where this form of freshening is possible can lead to regional benefits besides water supply fresh water resources can be stored during the wet season to be retrieved at a later moment with aquifer storage and recovery asr maliva et al 2006 correct timing of extractions can make the stored water available for use without affecting the fresh salt groundwater interface in the subsoil while being a cost effective option compared to other water supply alternatives oude essink et al 2018 vink et al 2010 zuurbier et al 2012 waterroute is needed to design the supply network in which asr sites are embedded 5 4 interactions with desalination waterroute can in future work be combined with desalination models to evaluate the potential for local supply networks in combination with mild desalination desalination of lower quality water provided by shorter and less expensive networks can be preferable over extensive networks which provide high quality water the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation shows that up to 2030 the 375 mgcl l 1 network is not significantly more expensive than the 400 mgcl l 1 or 425 mgcl l 1 network supplying water at 375 mgcl l 1 in 2110 leads to a significant increase in costs instead of expanding the supply network mild desalination can be applied to achieve the desired quality desalination technology improvements and optimization of treatment train design allow for treatment of a wide range of saline streams mcgovern et al 2014 several modeling approaches exist to design treatment trains optimized for a specific input stream skiborowski et al 2012 wreyford et al 2020 coupling a treatment train model which calculates the lowest treatment train costs such as desalt wreyford et al 2020 with the costs for water transport can yield better overall system configurations the performance of such systems can be evaluated through multi criteria decision making techniques such as data envelopment analysis belmondo bianchi et al 2020 determining the optimal location for desalination systems at the user at the individual supply sites or at mixing locations within decentralized networks has implications for the energy system and is a next step within the water energy nexus research field hussey and pittock 2012 6 conclusions waterroute is a valuable tool for planning and design of water supply networks using local alternative water sources waterroute designs water supply networks that deliver water at the specified quality and quantity of the user based on the modeled or known availability of water resources in a region the model is used in an example simulation to show how the dynamics of groundwater resources can be connected to the regional design and planning of water supply networks long term scenarios can be generated which help to anticipate on changes in fresh water availability waterroute is demonstrated with a simulation for zeeuws vlaanderen the netherlands and shows that a small decrease in demand quality a chloride concentration increase from 375 mgcl l 1 to 400 mgcl l in 2110 results in a decrease of the supply network placement costs by 7 for a demand of 2 5 mm3 year 1 delivering higher quality water leads to higher costs because longer networks are needed the length of the water supply network for the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation varies between 46 9 km and 122 1 km based on the water quality required at the demand location the waterroute model shows that costs can be up to 68 higher to supply water with the lowest possible salinity compared to a demand with no salinity constraint in the zeeuws vlaanderen simulation the best network configuration depends on the specific water quality demand of the user the local water availability and the time horizon over which planning occurs as water quality requirements become more stringent optimal network selection becomes more complex and modeling tools such as waterroute are needed to assist decision makers in designing cost effective decentralized water supply networks waterroute can in future work be expanded and can be used to determine the optimal balance between water transport and water treatment desalination the use of aquifer storage and recovery within decentralized networks and the creation of decentralized water supply networks based on the exchange of water between urban industrial and agricultural areas through these applications waterroute can assist in

16764,the present study aimed to investigate the changes in the chemical composition and in the optical and photooxidant properties of suwannee river natural organic matter srnom induced by uvc 254 nm treatment the extent of the photodegradation was first assessed by uv visible fluorescence spectroscopies and organic carbon analysis an in depth investigation of the chemical changes was also conducted using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry after derivatizations a series of mono di and tricarbonyls and mono and dicarboxylic acids in c1 c6 were identified in samples irradiated from 1 to 4 h after 3 h of irradiation carbonyls accounted for 46 of the organic carbon remaining in solution whereas carboxylic acids represented about 2 then we investigated the modifications of the photooxidant properties of srnom induced by these chemical changes at 254 nm uvc pre irradiated srnom photodegraded glyphosate 29 times faster than original srnom and the reaction was fully inhibited by 2 propanol 5 10 3 m this enhanced photooxidant properties at 254 nm toward glyphosate was therefore reasonably due to oh radicals formation as confirmed by additional esr measurements a mechanism involving a chain reaction was proposed based on independent experiments conducted on carbonyl compounds particularly pyruvic acid and acetone the findings of this study show that uvc pre treatment of nom can enhance the removal of water pollutants and suggests a possible integration of a nom pre activation step in engineered water treatment sytems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural organic matter carbonyls hydroperoxides chain reaction glyphosate oh radicals 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds formed in soils sediments and natural waters as a result of microbial and chemical transformation of plant tissues and microbial remains and it is an ubiquitous constituent of surface waters and drinking water supplies nom needs to be removed in the process of drinking water production because it can affect the color and organoleptic parameters of water and it can act as a carrier of toxic organic compounds zoschke et al 2012 tang et al 2014 under uvc radiations 200 280 nm typically used to remove bacterial and chemical contamination sillanpää et al 2018 nom undergoes extensive degradation even though complete mineralization is not usually achieved the generation of potentially harmful by products originating from nom degradation is a crucial aspect of drinking water production buchanan et al 2016 even though great efforts were put toward a better understanding of the fate of nom in uvc treaments ike et al 2019 paul et al 2012 varanasi et al 2018 s r sarathy et al 2011 kulovaara et al 1996 schmitt kopplin et al 1998 corin et al 1996 polewski et al 2005 lamsal et al 2011 many questions related to the nature of intermediary photoproducts formed and their photoreactivity remain unanswered and need to be further investigated due to its heterogeneity and chemical complexity nom transformation was often studied by monitoring global parameters using techniques such as absorption or fluorescence spectroscopy total organic carbon analysis 13c nmr pyrolysis and gel permeation chromatography ike et al 2019 paul et al 2012 hao et al 2020 sarathy and mohseni 2007 fukushima and tatsumi 2001 schmitt kopplin et al 1998 polewski et al 2005 these analytical techniques allowed to assess an overall decrease of nom uv visible absorbance of aromaticity and of molecular weight during oxidation processes several studies focused on the identification of small molecules generated from nom breakdown by coupling derivatization techniques with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms or gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms formation of c1 c4 carbonyl compounds and c2 c5 carboxylic acids amino acids and alcohols in uvc treatments was reported thomson et al 2004 agbaba et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 corin et al 1996 some of these photoproducts were also found upon irradiation of nom with natural or simulated solar light λ 290 nm brinkmann et al 2003 de bryun et al 2011 goldstone et al 2002 kieber et al 1990 the presence of nom in uvc treatments has been generally reported to lower treatment efficiency due to its ability to scavenge the reactive species generated under irradiation and or to absorb photons competitively therefore decreasing the degradation rate of target compounds wang et al 2016 however nom is able to generate oxidant species such as hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and triplet excited states 3nom under irradiation vione et al 2014 and can also promote the degradation of contaminants during uvc treatment lester et al 2013 the photosensitizing properties of nom may evolve during the uvc treatment because nom itself undergoes chemical changes yet to the best of our knowledge very few studies investigated the effect of such modifications on the ability of nom to generate photooxidants in the course of engineered water treatments treatments of nom with hypochlorous acid and ozone were reported to increase its capacity to generate 1o2 in simulated solar light due to the possible formation of quinone like molecules mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 leresche et al 2019 but also to decrease its capacity to generate 3nom due to photosensitizers destruction wenk et al 2015 on the other hand uv chlorine treatment of nom at high chlorine dosage was found to increase its ability to generate 3nom 1o2 and oh upon irradiation within the range 290 400 nm zhou et al 2021 again these effects were proposed to be due to the formation of quinone and ketone functional groups the goal of this work was to study the chemical changes of srnom under uvc irradiation and to determine how these changes affect its photodegrading properties in the first part spectral changes of irradiated srnom solutions were monitored by uv visible and fluorescence spectroscopies while photoproducts were analyzed by derivatization of srnom followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry uhplchrms or gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms in the second part we studied the effect of the uvc pre irradiation on the photosensitizing properties of srnom for the experiments at 254 nm we chose glyphosate as a probe molecule for two reasons it is non absorbant at 254 nm and thus poorly subject to photolysis moreover its aliphatic and saturated structure makes it difficult to oxidize except by very oxidant species such as oh the photooxidant properties of carbonyls at 254 nm was also studied for comparison for the experiments at λ 300 nm we used recommanded probe molecules to compare the formation of oh 3srnom and singlet oxygen before and after uvc pre irradiation rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals srnom

irradiated srnom glyphosate was used to probe the formation of very oxidant species such as oh from original and pre irradiated srnom solutions at 254 nm the solutions containing glyphosate 10 5 m and srnom were prepared by adding 25 μl of the stock solution of glyphosate 10 2 m to 10 2 ml of srnom 40 mg l 1 and by adding purified water to reach the final volume of 25 ml for srnom3h solutions the same spike of glyphosate was added to 25 ml of non diluted solution this way the two solutions showed the same absorbance of 0 34 at 254 nm then 15 ml of each solution were irradiated in the above described device 2 propanol was used as a quencher of oh glyphosate 10 5 m was also irradiated in the presence of acetone 10 4 m pyruvic acid 10 4 m h2o2 10 5 m acetone 10 4 m h2o2 10 5 m furthermore acetone 10 4 m was irradiated alone and in mixture with h2o2 10 5 and 10 3 m all these experiments were conducted in air saturated solutions the effect of oxygen on the rate of glyphosate photodegradation in the presence of srnom3h was studied by saturating the solution with n2 glyphosate concentration was monitored by uhplchrms by integrating peak area at m z 168 0056 5 ppm ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid with m z 110 0002 5 ppm was the only glyphosate photoproduct detected acetone loss and photoproducts formation were monitored by derivatization with dnph followed by uhplchrms analysis photodegrading properties of srnom and srnom3h solutions were also investigated under irradiation between 300 and 400 nm both solutions were diluted by a half during preparation of mixtures terephthalic acid 2 10 5 m was used to probe oh radicals 2 4 6 trimethyphenol 2 10 5 m to probe 3srnom and 3srnom3h and furfuryl alcohol 5 8 10 5 m to trap 1o2 solutions buffered at ph 7 were irradiated in a device equipped with 6 fluorescent tubes emitting between 300 and 400 nm palma et al 2020 pseudo first order rate constants of probes phototransformation were determined by plotting ln ct c0 k t where ct and c0 are the probe concentration at time t and before irradiation all the experiments were duplicated 2 5 peroxides titration peroxides concentration was measured by the

bruker emx 9 8 ghz equipped with a cavity er4105dr and a xenon lamp xenovia 200 900 nm the esr spectra were obtained at room temperature under irradiation inside the cell of the following mixtures dmpo 25 mm in the presence of srnom 20 mg l 1 srnom3h or h2o2 5 10 3 or 10 5 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectral changes of srnom upon 254 nm irradiation fig 1 a shows that the srnom solution progressively photobleached the absorbance at 254 nm declined by 59 and 77 after 3 and 4 h of irradiation respectively table 1 the reduction of doc as a function of irradiation time revealed that srnom also underwent substantial mineralization 35 after 4 h while the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva decreased by 42 and 64 after 3 and 4 h of irradiation respectively indicating a loss of unsaturated aromatic moieties weisshar et al 2003 table 1 yet the spectrum shape fig 1b and the e2 e3 ratio table 1 did not change much indicating that photoproducts negligibly contributed to the absorption and were poorly absorbing compounds irradiation also led to a breakdown of fluorescent species in accordance with previous studies patel sorrentino et al 2004 the fluorescence intensity at the emission maximum declined by 53 after 3 h of irradiation and by 68 after 4 h fig 1c fig 1d also shows that the blue part of the fluorescence emission spectra disappeared the fastest leading to emission spectra red shifted by 10 15 nm or to a band contraction on the contrary treatment of nom with radicals such as so4 zhang et al 2019 or oh varanasi et al 2018 was reported to induce a blue shift of fluorescence emission spectra attributed to preferential degradation of high molecular weight moieties into smaller entities in these treatments radicals are expected to react preferentially with biggest macromolecules offering the largest number of attack sites while in photolytic treatment the reactivity of generated excited states is the critical factor our results suggest that smaller fluorescent entities initially present in srnom or produced in the course of the treatment were more subject to photodegradation than larger ones the reasons could be that they were more light absorbing because more oxidized and or underwent less desactivation processes than bigger constituents being less embedded in large structures than these latter 3 2 carbonyls and carboxylic acids formation upon 254 nm irradiation of srnom table 2 summarizes the chemicals detected by dnph or bstfa derivatization and by ci ms in srnom before irradiation and after irradiation detailed ms data are given in figure si 3 tables si 1 to si 3 and the structures of photoproducts observed in irradiated samples are shown in fig 2 in starting srnom we detected 5 carbohydrates in c5 and c6 xylose rhamnose fucose glucose and galactose mentionned in the ihss web page along with 2 monocarboxylated alkanes in c3 and c18 glyceric and oleic acids and 3 dicarboxylated alkanes in c6 c9 and c12 hexanedioic nonanedioic and dodecanedioic acids tables 2 and si 1 several carbonyls were found but only as traces in srnom3h none of the carbohydrates observed in srnom were found while 11 carboxylated alkanes were detected 5 monocarboxylated in c1 formic acid c2 acetic and glycolic acid c3 lactic acid and c4 4 aminobutanoic acid 7 dicarboxylated alkanes in c2 oxalic acid c3 malonic tartronic dihydroxymalonic acids c4 butanedioic and malic acids c5 glutaric acid and c6 tricarballylic acid tables 3 and si 2 in all the irradiated samples 16 carbonyls in c1 c5 were detected among them 7 monocarbonyls formaldehyde acetaldehyde glycoladehyde glyoxylic acid 7 dicarbonyls glyoxal methylglyoxal butenedial and 2 tricarbonyls some of these compounds were already reported to be produced by irradiation of natural surface waters or synthetic waters containing nom with natural or simulated solar light by ozone treatment or by uv based aops of solutions of humic substances this is the case for formic acetic and oxalic acids brinkmann et al 2003 goldstone et al 2002 formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal and methylglyoxal thomson et al 2004 agbaba et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 de bryun et al 2011 kieber et al 1990 malonic and butanedioic acids corin et al 1996 and pyruvic acid thomson et al 2004 the concentration of the different carbonyls after 1 2 3 and 4 h of irradiation were estimated using derivatized methylglyoxal and pyruvic acid table si 4 fig 3 a shows the concentration profile of the most concentrated ones i e formaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glyoxal and glycolaldehyde as a function of irradiation time the concentration of formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid was maximum after 2 h of irradiation and then declined while that of pyruvic acid glyoxal and glycolaldehyde increased throughout the 4 h of irradiation it shows that srnom photodegradation still proceeds beyond 4 h although a significant absorbance decrease at 254 nm the total pool of c1 c5 carbonyls was estimated by summing the individual concentrations fig 3b shows that their cumulative concentration increased during the first 2 h of irradiation to reach the value of 2 8 10 4 m based on these concentrations and on the doc measurements the mass percentage of carbon atoms contained in the detected carbonyls could be calculated using eq 1 this percentage was maximum after 3 h of irradiation where it reached 46 fig 3b this high value demonstrates the very important contribution of c1 c5 carbonyls to the pool of photoproducts as most of these compounds poorly absorbed below 300 nm their high concentration explains the unchanged spectrum shape following irradiation 1 m a s s p e r c e n t a g e t i 1 i n c i t m i d o c t where ci t and mi are the concentration at time t and the molecular mass of carbonyl i and doct is the organic carbon content in the solution at time t the concentration of carboxylic acids detected in srnom3h are shown in table si 5 in general bstfa gc ms and ci ms analyses gave consistent results regarding the concentration estimations bstfa gc ms was however less performant than ci ms in the analysis of compounds containing 2 or 3 co2h or oh functions such as tartronic dihydroxymalonic acid oxalic acid and tricarballylic acids the difficulty to solubilize lyophilized srnom3h in acetonitrile to conduct the bstfa derivatization or a partial derivatization of these compounds probably explain these discrepancies malic oxalic butanedioic glycolic and malonic acids were the most concentrated acids however their concentration in srnom3h that laid below 2 8 10 6 m were much lower than those of carbonyls eq 1 allowed to determine that the detected carboxylic acids contained only 2 in mass of the srnom3h carbon atoms nitrate ions were also detected by ci ms in srnom at a level of 2 9 10 6 m but not in srnom3h the detection of all these compounds suggests that the photodegradation of srnom under uvc resulted from a complex set of reactions involving the direct photolysis of srnom constituents as well as their oxidation by the radicals generated in the course of the irradiation many radicals such as r ro ro2 ho2 o2 and oh can be formed by cc co and oo bond cleavage phenyl o and rco2 photoionization addition of oxygen on radicals and various radicalar attacks once formed these radicals could contribute to further degradation of srnom constituents and of their by products among them oh radical is likely to play a significant role for several reasons it is the most oxidant species able to react with a wide variety of chemicals by addition on double bonds or by h atom abstraction buxton et al 1988 nom was shown to generate oh radicals vaughan and blough 1998 page et al 2011 mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 gan et al 2008 sun et al 2015 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 aguer and richard 1999 under irradiation in reactions where oh radicals are purposely produced varanasi et al 2018 the oxidation degree of photoproducts given by the o c ratio is generally high 1 2 as observed here last the photolysis of chlorosalicylic acid that was proposed to occur via the intermediary formation of oh radicals tafer et al 2016 yielded glycolic lactic and butanedioic acids acetaldehyde glycoaldehyde methylglyoxal c4h4o3 and c3o3h2 that were also detected in the present work 3 3 effect of srnom pre irradiation on the oxidant properties at 254 nm in order to explore the photooxidant properties of pre irradiated srnom we chose glyphosate as a chemical probe we first checked that it is photostable when irradiated in our device k 2 10 4 min 1 table 3 for these experiments we selected srnom3h that showed the highest concentration of intermediary carbonyl compounds 2 4 10 4 m and srnom and srnom3h were tested at the same absorbance at 254 nm 0 34 in the presence of srnom glyphosate 10 5 m disappeared with a rate constant k of 0 0013 0 0002 min 1 in air saturated solution fig 4 a and table 3 making the hypothesis that the reaction was due to the reaction of glyphosate with oh radicals we used this rate constant to estimate the quantum yield of oh radicals formation by srnom srnom oh in the first stages of the reaction once formed by process 1 oh radicals react with glyphosate k gly 3 37 0 10 107 m 1 s 1 vidal et al 2015 process 2 and with srnom process 3 we took for k srnom the value of 1 6 108 mc 1 s 1 reported in the literature for suwannee river fulvic acid westerhff et al 2007 srnom hν srnom oh 1 srnom oh oh glyphosate products 2 k gly oh srnom products 3 k srnom the rate of glyphosate photodegradation rgly can be written si text 7 2 r gly i 0 1 10 a srnom oh srnom k gly gly k gly gly k srnom srnom where i 0 1 10 a s r n o m is the rate of light absorption by srnom as srnom was diluted 2 44 fold to reach the same absorbance at 254 nm as srnom3h srnom was equal to 6 35 mgc l 1 or 0 529 mmc 1 taking 12 for the molar mass of carbon in these conditions one gets that glyphosate trapped 0 38 of oh radicals and that srnom oh was equal to 0 024 this value is in the range of that reported by lester et al 2013 at 254 nm 0 047 in the presence of srnom3h and in air saturated solution glyphosate disappeared much faster than in the presence of srnom fig 4a with k 0 038 0 004 min 1 table 3 in n2 purged srnom3h solution the glyphosate photodegradation rate was significantly reduced compared to the one conducted in air saturated medium k 0 002 0 002 min 1 in the first 10 min of the reaction fig 4a table 3 demonstrating the important role played by oxygen in the reaction moreover we irradiated glyphosate and srnom3h in the presence of 2 propanol to determine whether oh radicals were involved in the loss of glyphosate using k 2 propanol 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 for the bimolecular rate constant of reaction between oh and 2 propanol oh 2 propanol products 4 k 2 propanol we added 5 10 3 m of 2 propanol expecting an inhibition of the reaction 90 based on k srnom3h srnom3h 9 104 s 1 as for srnom the inhibition was of 90 fig 4a table 3 in accordance with a significant contribution of oh spin trap experiments using dmpo as the spin trapping reagent were also conducted to confirm the formation of oh radicals fig 5 shows that the four line signal with an intensity ratio 1 2 2 1 characteristic of the dmpooh adduct was not detected when dmpo was irradiated in the presence of srnom plot a or h2o2 10 5 plot c while it was observed with srnom3h plot b and h2o2 5 10 3 m plot d again this result is in line with the production of oh radicals upon irradiation of srnom3h in uvc postulating that the disappearance of glyphosate was only due to the reaction with oh we made the same calculation for srnom3h as for srnom after having replaced processes 1 and 2 by processes 1 and 3 respectively srnom3h hν srnom3h oh 1 srnom oh oh srnom3h products 3 k srnom3h and substituting srnom by srnom3h in eqn 2 the toc analyses showed that srnom3h had a doc content of 10 9 mgc l 1 or 0 907 mmc 1 table 1 to estimate the percentage of oh radicals reacting with glyphosate in srnom3h solution we also need to know the value of k srnom3h since srnom3h is much less aromatic than srnom and oh radicals react more easily with aromatic or conjugated structures than with saturated ones ksrnom3h is possibly smaller than ksrnom postulating that the rate constant decrease may parallel the absorbance decrease at 254 nm we opted for k srnom3h 0 7 0 3 108 mc 1 s 1 from this value the percentage of oh radicals trapped by glyphosate in srnom3h solution would lay between 0 3 and 0 8 and srnom3h oh would be comprised between 0 21 and 0 55 a value between 10 and 20 times higher than that found for srnom oh this value must be considered as a maximal value and would be lower if radicals other than oh also contributed to the degradation of glyphosate to better understand the enhancing effect of the pre irradiation on the photooxidant properties of srnom we conducted additional experiments and tested potential candidates for their ability to photodegrade glyphosate 3 4 peroxides formation and role of h2o2 in the oxidant properties at 254 nm peroxides are sources of oh radicals through direct photolysis process 5 or photo fenton reaction and we quantified their formation in our system measurements of h2o2 and ro2h ro2r were performed on srnom and srnom3h irradiated for 30 min fig 5 in srnom h2o2 and ro2h ro2r accumulated linearly after 30 min of irradiation the total concentration of h2o2 ro2h ro2r was equal to 16 μm h2o2 was by far the most abundant species 14 2 μm while ro2h ro2r contributed to the pool of peroxides in a minor way 1 8 μm in srnom3h the peroxides formation was auto inhibited slowing down after 10 min the total concentration reached 15 8 μm after 30 min h2o2 and ro2h ro2r were in equivalent amounts of 8 0 μm the formation of h2o2 in the photolysis of nom is well documented in the literature garg et al 2011 it is formed by dimutation of o2 that arises from reduction of dissolved o2 peroxides and hydroperoxides are generated after the reaction of r radicals with dissolved o2 to yield ro2 and the reaction of these peroxyl radicals with o2 ho2 sun et al 2021 to determine the contribution of h2o2 to the formation of oh via process 5 we proceeded as follows we first measured r gly in the presence of h2o2 10 5 m alone the value of 1 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 allowed us to check that glyphosate reacted with oh and to measure the photon flux i0 in the irradiation device si text 1 then we calculated r gly h2 o 2 in srnom solution using eq 3 supposing that the photolysis of h2o2 produced during the irradiation of srnom was the only source of oh through process 5 si text 5 h2o2 oh h 2 o 2 oh 5 3 r gly h 2 o 2 i a h 2 o 2 srnom h 2 o 2 oh k gly gly k gly gly k srnom srnom k h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 taking h2o2 14 μm corresponding to the highest value reached for srnom εh2o2 19 6 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm a254 0 34 for srnom and ℓ 2 we calculated i a h 2 o 2 s r n o m using the beer lamber law for a mixture si text 8 then taking k h2o2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 stefan et al 1996 we got that glyphosate trapped 0 38 of oh and using h2o2 oh 1 yu and barker 2003 we finally obtained r gly h2 o 2 7 0 10 12 m s 1 in the case of srnom3h we took h2o2 8 μm and the same calculation led to r gly h2 o 2 3 0 9 0 10 12 m s 1 both values are very small compared to the experimental values 2 2 10 10 m s 1 and 6 5 10 9 m s 1 respectively measured for srnom and srnom3h and it can be concluded that the photochemical decomposition of titrated hydroperoxides negligibly contributed to the oxidation of glyphosate spontaneous decomposition of unstable hydroperoxides into ro and oh might be an alternative source of oh radicals this was considered by badali et al 2015 and krapf et al 2016 in their studies on secondary organic aerosols 3 5 role of carbonyls in the photooxidant properties at 254 nm given the high concentration of carbonyls detected in srnom3h and the known potential of these chemicals as sensitizers we tested if they could induce the transformation of glyphosate at 254 nm we first tested pyruvic acid since this compound had been previously detected in our irradiated srnom samples in the presence of this ketoacid 10 4 m in ph 7 buffered solutions glyphosate 10 5 m disappeared with an apparent first order rate constant equal to 0 021 0 002 min 1 fig 6 a table 3 pyruvate was also photodegraded and the reaction auto accelerated during the first 6 min of irradiation only 1 8 10 6 m of pyruvate were transformed against 3 1 10 5 m between 6 and 30 min fig 6b the rate of pyruvate loss r pyruvate in the second part of the curve was equal to 2 1 10 8 m s 1 and r gly to 3 5 10 9 m s 1 the experiment was repeated in the presence of 2 propanol added to trap oh radicals the concentration 10 4 m was chosen for 2 propanol for a theoritical trapping of more than 95 based on k pyruvate acid 3 108 m 1 s 1 process 6 buxton et al 1988 after 30 min the rate of glyphosate loss was reduced by 75 confirming a significant contribution of oh in the reaction oh pyruvate products 6 k pyruvate although it was not detected in irradiated srnom samples acetone was chosen to represent monocarbonyls because it is a simple molecule it can be purchased in high purity it was already studied and its quantum yield of photolysis is known acetone 0 061 at 270 nm anpo and kubokawa 1977 at 10 4 m a concentration falling within the range of that found for intermediary carbonyls acetone increased the rate of glyphosate photodegradation and the reaction was also auto accelerated fig 6a table 3 during the first 10 min of reaction an averaged k 0 002 0 001 min 1 was obtained while between 10 and 30 min we measured k 0 024 0 003 min 1 in parallel the decay of acetone was monitored by uhplchrms after dnph derivatization acetone also disapppeared by an autoaccelerated reaction fig 6b between 0 and 10 min the loss of acetone was lower than 5 corresponding to a rate of acetone photodegradation r acetone 0 9 10 8 m s 1 while between 10 and 40 min acetone disappeared by 43 and r acetone was equal to 2 4 10 8 m s 1 table 3 during this reaction h2o2 was formed fig 6b the h2o2 production was of 2 μm between 0 and 10 min and 10 μm between 10 and 30 min which mirrored the autoaccelerated decrease of glyphosate and acetone in the presence of 2 propanol 10 4 m and acetone 10 4 m glyphosate disappeared by 10 instead of 42 in the absence of 2 propanol after 30 min of irradiation fig 6a table 3 confirming again a significant contribution of oh in the reaction 75 acetone was also irradiated alone to check that the observed auto acceleration was not due to the presence of glyphosate at 2 4 10 4 m acetone also disappeared in an auto accelerated reaction with r acetone 0 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 between 0 and 10 min and r acetone 3 9 10 8 m s 1 between 10 and 30 min table 3 the photoproducts were pyruvic acid methyl glyoxal hydroxyacetone formadehyde as described by stefan and bolton 1999 when they studied the photolysis of acetone in the presence of h2o2 at 254 nm using the quantum yield of acetone photodegradation in diluted solutions 0 061 and εacetone 16 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm it is possible to calculate the rate of acetone photodegradation by direct photolysis r a c e t o n e d p using eq 4 4 r acet one dp i 0 1 10 a acet one acet one 4 for acetone 10 4 m one gets r a c e t o n e d p 1 3 10 9 m s 1 and for acetone 2 4 10 4 m r a c e t o n e d p 3 1 10 9 s 1 these values are consistent with the ones obtained between 0 and 10 min 9 10 9 m s 1 and one can conclude that r a c e t o n e d p being negligible behind r acetone measured in the second part of the curves other reactions should take place an autoaccelerated reaction is generally due to the accumulation of key intermediates here the intermediary chemicals were the acetone photoproducts and peroxides among which h2o2 we therefore studied the effect of h2o2 used a hydroperoxide model at the concentration of 10 5 and 10 3 m on the photodegradation of acetone 2 4 10 4 m the photodegradation of acetone was fast till the very beginning of the irradiation r acetone 3 5 10 8 and 1 8 10 7 m s 1 respectively table 3 and no auto accelerating effect was observed in this mixture acetone can disappear by reaction with oh produced from h2o2 photolysis process 7 k acetone 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 process 8 is a potential competiting pathway of oh disappearance k h2o2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 oh acetone products 7 k acetone oh h2o2 products 8 k h2o2 for h2o2 10 3 m and acetone 2 4 10 4 m process 8 was expected to significantly reduce the percentage of oh radicals trapped by acetone taking into account that acetone should trap about 50 of oh one obtains racetone 1 3 10 7 m s 1 against 1 8 10 7 m s 1 measured experimentally for h2o2 10 5 m and acetone 2 4 10 4 m process 8 was negligible and acetone was expected to trap all the oh radicals produced by h2o2 photolysis its rate of decay through process 7 racetone oh was equal to 2 6 10 9 m s 1 according to eq 5 5 r acet one oh i 0 1 10 a h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh 5 this calculated rate accounted for only 6 6 of the measured rate indicating that an additional radical source was responsible for acetone degradation then we simultaneously irradiated glyphosate 10 5 m h2o2 10 5 m and acetone 10 4 m in this case the glyphosate photodegradation was fast till the beginning of the irradiation k 0 016 min 1 fig 6a table 3 showing that h2o2 or other hydroperoxides are important intermediaries in the reaction the results obtained for acetone can be tentatively explained by the chain reaction mechanism shown in scheme 1 in the classical chain oxidation of a chemical rh bearing a labile h atom the initiator produces the primary radicals process 9 that start the chain through a transfer reaction by generating the radical r process 7 then r produces ro2 by adding o2 process 10 and ro2 regenerates r along to ro2h by abstracting of a h from rh process 11 the longer the chain length the faster the reaction in fact when the chain is long enough the rate of the propagation reactions becomes much higher than the rates of initiation and of transfer in our case the calculated rate of acetone photolysis r a c e t o n e d p process 9 was much lower than the experimental rate of acetone photodegradation consistently with the involvement of a chain reaction the irradiation of acetone was expected to yield radicals by α cleavage of the triplet excited state process 9 pearson 1963 the triplet could also abstract a h atom from methyl groups of acetone however neither acetone itself nor glyphosate were concentrated enough to compete significantly with the cleavage anpo and kubokawa 1977 due to the oxidation of these radicals and to the photolysis of the formed hydroperoxides there should be a pool of initiating radicals in the system the acetonyl radical r formed by process 7 stefan et al 1996 should easily react with oxygen process 10 to yield the peroxyl radical roo stefan et al 1996 this peroxyl radical likely abstracted an h atom from acetone process 11 to regenerate the acetonyl radical and produce the hydroperoxide rooh the recombination of two peroxide radicals process 12 terminated this chain reaction in this chain reaction glyphosate might be oxidized by several of the radicals formed in the complex mixture however while the reaction with oh was evidenced the oxidation with the other radicals remains to be demonstrated if we make the hypothesis that oh contributed significantly to the glyphosate degradation the source of oh needs to be explained indeed calculations showed that the photolysis of the different hydroperoxides did not yield enough radicals to explain the high rate of glyphosate degradation an alternative formation of oh could be the spontaneous decomposition at room temperature of unstable hydroperoxides here ch3 coch2ooh process 13 according to the works of badali et al 2015 and krapf et al 2016 the formation of very unstable hydroperoxides is plausible therefore despite processes 7 10 and 11 still taking place the key process became process 13 since it introduced a continuous source of oh and ro radicals consequently the rate of glyphosate degradation increased during the accumulation phase of rooh reaching the maximal value rate when the ro2h formation equaled the ro2h decomposition ch3 coch2ooh ch3 coch2o oh 13 in the case of srnom3h carbonyls were present at 2 4 10 4 m and hydroperoxides were potentially generated at a fast rate therefore making it possible the mechanism already proposed in the case of acetone to occur in accordance rooh roor were formed along with h2o2 in srnom3h solution r gly was equal to 6 3 10 9 m s 1 considering that glyphosate trapped between 0 3 and 0 8 of oh radicals in competition with srnom3h constituents the rate of oh formation should be comprised between 8 10 7 and 2 10 6 m s 1 in the model solution containing glyphosate 10 5 m h2o2 10 5 m and acetone 10 4 m rgly was equal to 2 7 10 9 m s 1 considering that oh contributed to the reaction at 75 and that glyphosate trapped 3 of oh in competition with acetone then the rate of oh formation should be equal to 7 10 8 m s 1 for acetone 2 4 10 4 m it might be 1 7 10 7 m s 1 this value is smaller than that estimated for the srnom3h solution and several explanations of this difference can be proposed i srnom3h was a much more complex system than h2o2 acetone and quantitative results cannot be directly transferable furthermore calculation lays on an hypothetical value of the bimolecular reaction rate constant of srnom3h with oh ii acetone was chosen as a model compound but among the carbonyls formed in srnom3h some may absorb more than acetone especially those bearing double bonds and or photodissociate much more easily anpo and kubokawa 1977 iii srnom3h also contained chemicals acting probably as better h donors than acetone and glyphosate which should favor process 11 and thus the formation of unstable hydroperoxides iv oxidant species other than oh might contribute to the photodegradation of glyphosate in the case of srnom rgly was much higher than r gly h2 o 2 as for srnom3h suggesting that chain reactions might take place as for srnom3 h although leading to a much slower production of oh accordingly the 6 times less formation of roor rooh from srnom than from srnom3h suggests that unstable hydroperoxides should be produced in smaller amounts by srnom than by srnom3h spectral measurements showed that srnom is much more aromatic than srnom3h which constitutes an important difference in terms of oh reactions the oh radicals are known to add on phenols lundquist and eriksson 2000 to finally produce unreactive phenoxyl radicals while they generate radicals oxidable into hydroperoxides when they abstract hydrogen atoms from aliphatic compounds hence the presence of carbonyls in srnom3h could not only favor the formation of radicals through their photolysis but also constitutes a pool of aliphatic compounds oxidable into hydroperoxides ampa was the main glyphosate photoproduct detected by uhplchrms fig 4b in the literature other oxidation products were also detected such as sarcosine chen et al 2007 not detected in this work after 30 min of irradiation the highest yield of ampa was measured with h2o2 66 followed by srnom3h 62 acetone 57 and pyruvic acid 38 interestingly when 2 propanol was added to acetone and pyruvate solutions the yield of ampa dropped to 10 and 17 respectively the formation of ampa may be thus an indirect evidence of the involvement of oh radicals in the photodegradation fig 7 3 5 effect of srnom pre irradiation on oh 1o2 and 3srnom formation under simulated solar light we also compared the ability of srnom and srnom3h to photoproduce photooxidants 3srnom 1o2 and oh in simulated solar light after the normalization for light absorption the rate of 2 4 6 trimethyphenol was found to be 1 5 times higher in srnom than in srnom3h in accordance with lower rate of 3srnom formation therefore chromophores yielding 3srnom were partly degraded under uvc irradiation in the case of 1o2 titrated using furfuryl alcohol we found rates of formation varying by less than 10 between srnom and srnom3h at last results on terephthalic acid used to estimate the rate of oh formation showed a higher rate of oh formation in srnom3h solution than in srnom solution taking k srnom 1 6 108 mc 1 s 1 and k srnom3h 0 7 108 mc 1 s 1 for the bimolecular rate constants of reaction with oh we got a rate of oh formation higher by 40 for srnom3h solution than for srnom solution this enhancement was much lower than the one observed at 254 nm with glyphosate the dependence of the oh formation enhancement on the irradiation wavelength supports the hypothesis of the involvement of poorly conjugated and light absorbing carbonyl compounds in the photochemical production of oh 4 conclusion this work aimed to investigate the effect of uvc irradiation on the ability of srnom to generate oxidant species in particular oh radicals under uvc through in depth analytical and kinetic studies we demonstrated that srnom irradiation drastically increased the pool of aliphatic carbonyls together with its capacity of photoinducing the degradation of glyphosate at 254 nm several experimental results suggest that oh radicals contributed to this degradation to better understand the role of carbonyls in the reaction we studied the photodegradation of glyphosate in the presence of acetone and pyruvate experimental data were explained by a mechanism involving a chain reaction in which oh radicals may be formed through the spontaneous decomposition of unstable hydroperoxides the same mechanism might prevail in pre irradiated srnom and explain its high efficiency to photodegrade glyphosate upon irradiation at 254 nm these results show that in uvc treatments nom could favor the degradation of micropollutants through its high capacity to generate very oxidant radicals such a pretreatment of nom would deserve to be further studied in combination with other engineered water treatment sytems declaration of competing interest the

16764,the present study aimed to investigate the changes in the chemical composition and in the optical and photooxidant properties of suwannee river natural organic matter srnom induced by uvc 254 nm treatment the extent of the photodegradation was first assessed by uv visible fluorescence spectroscopies and organic carbon analysis an in depth investigation of the chemical changes was also conducted using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry after derivatizations a series of mono di and tricarbonyls and mono and dicarboxylic acids in c1 c6 were identified in samples irradiated from 1 to 4 h after 3 h of irradiation carbonyls accounted for 46 of the organic carbon remaining in solution whereas carboxylic acids represented about 2 then we investigated the modifications of the photooxidant properties of srnom induced by these chemical changes at 254 nm uvc pre irradiated srnom photodegraded glyphosate 29 times faster than original srnom and the reaction was fully inhibited by 2 propanol 5 10 3 m this enhanced photooxidant properties at 254 nm toward glyphosate was therefore reasonably due to oh radicals formation as confirmed by additional esr measurements a mechanism involving a chain reaction was proposed based on independent experiments conducted on carbonyl compounds particularly pyruvic acid and acetone the findings of this study show that uvc pre treatment of nom can enhance the removal of water pollutants and suggests a possible integration of a nom pre activation step in engineered water treatment sytems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural organic matter carbonyls hydroperoxides chain reaction glyphosate oh radicals 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds formed in soils sediments and natural waters as a result of microbial and chemical transformation of plant tissues and microbial remains and it is an ubiquitous constituent of surface waters and drinking water supplies nom needs to be removed in the process of drinking water production because it can affect the color and organoleptic parameters of water and it can act as a carrier of toxic organic compounds zoschke et al 2012 tang et al 2014 under uvc radiations 200 280 nm typically used to remove bacterial and chemical contamination sillanpää et al 2018 nom undergoes extensive degradation even though complete mineralization is not usually achieved the generation of potentially harmful by products originating from nom degradation is a crucial aspect of drinking water production buchanan et al 2016 even though great efforts were put toward a better understanding of the fate of nom in uvc treaments ike et al 2019 paul et al 2012 varanasi et al 2018 s r sarathy et al 2011 kulovaara et al 1996 schmitt kopplin et al 1998 corin et al 1996 polewski et al 2005 lamsal et al 2011 many questions related to the nature of intermediary photoproducts formed and their photoreactivity remain unanswered and need to be further investigated due to its heterogeneity and chemical complexity nom transformation was often studied by monitoring global parameters using techniques such as absorption or fluorescence spectroscopy total organic carbon analysis 13c nmr pyrolysis and gel permeation chromatography ike et al 2019 paul et al 2012 hao et al 2020 sarathy and mohseni 2007 fukushima and tatsumi 2001 schmitt kopplin et al 1998 polewski et al 2005 these analytical techniques allowed to assess an overall decrease of nom uv visible absorbance of aromaticity and of molecular weight during oxidation processes several studies focused on the identification of small molecules generated from nom breakdown by coupling derivatization techniques with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms or gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms formation of c1 c4 carbonyl compounds and c2 c5 carboxylic acids amino acids and alcohols in uvc treatments was reported thomson et al 2004 agbaba et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 corin et al 1996 some of these photoproducts were also found upon irradiation of nom with natural or simulated solar light λ 290 nm brinkmann et al 2003 de bryun et al 2011 goldstone et al 2002 kieber et al 1990 the presence of nom in uvc treatments has been generally reported to lower treatment efficiency due to its ability to scavenge the reactive species generated under irradiation and or to absorb photons competitively therefore decreasing the degradation rate of target compounds wang et al 2016 however nom is able to generate oxidant species such as hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and triplet excited states 3nom under irradiation vione et al 2014 and can also promote the degradation of contaminants during uvc treatment lester et al 2013 the photosensitizing properties of nom may evolve during the uvc treatment because nom itself undergoes chemical changes yet to the best of our knowledge very few studies investigated the effect of such modifications on the ability of nom to generate photooxidants in the course of engineered water treatments treatments of nom with hypochlorous acid and ozone were reported to increase its capacity to generate 1o2 in simulated solar light due to the possible formation of quinone like molecules mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 leresche et al 2019 but also to decrease its capacity to generate 3nom due to photosensitizers destruction wenk et al 2015 on the other hand uv chlorine treatment of nom at high chlorine dosage was found to increase its ability to generate 3nom 1o2 and oh upon irradiation within the range 290 400 nm zhou et al 2021 again these effects were proposed to be due to the formation of quinone and ketone functional groups the goal of this work was to study the chemical changes of srnom under uvc irradiation and to determine how these changes affect its photodegrading properties in the first part spectral changes of irradiated srnom solutions were monitored by uv visible and fluorescence spectroscopies while photoproducts were analyzed by derivatization of srnom followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry uhplchrms or gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms in the second part we studied the effect of the uvc pre irradiation on the photosensitizing properties of srnom for the experiments at 254 nm we chose glyphosate as a probe molecule for two reasons it is non absorbant at 254 nm and thus poorly subject to photolysis moreover its aliphatic and saturated structure makes it difficult to oxidize except by very oxidant species such as oh the photooxidant properties of carbonyls at 254 nm was also studied for comparison for the experiments at λ 300 nm we used recommanded probe molecules to compare the formation of oh 3srnom and singlet oxygen before and after uvc pre irradiation rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals srnom

irradiated srnom glyphosate was used to probe the formation of very oxidant species such as oh from original and pre irradiated srnom solutions at 254 nm the solutions containing glyphosate 10 5 m and srnom were prepared by adding 25 μl of the stock solution of glyphosate 10 2 m to 10 2 ml of srnom 40 mg l 1 and by adding purified water to reach the final volume of 25 ml for srnom3h solutions the same spike of glyphosate was added to 25 ml of non diluted solution this way the two solutions showed the same absorbance of 0 34 at 254 nm then 15 ml of each solution were irradiated in the above described device 2 propanol was used as a quencher of oh glyphosate 10 5 m was also irradiated in the presence of acetone 10 4 m pyruvic acid 10 4 m h2o2 10 5 m acetone 10 4 m h2o2 10 5 m furthermore acetone 10 4 m was irradiated alone and in mixture with h2o2 10 5 and 10 3 m all these experiments were conducted in air saturated solutions the effect of oxygen on the rate of glyphosate photodegradation in the presence of srnom3h was studied by saturating the solution with n2 glyphosate concentration was monitored by uhplchrms by integrating peak area at m z 168 0056 5 ppm ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid with m z 110 0002 5 ppm was the only glyphosate photoproduct detected acetone loss and photoproducts formation were monitored by derivatization with dnph followed by uhplchrms analysis photodegrading properties of srnom and srnom3h solutions were also investigated under irradiation between 300 and 400 nm both solutions were diluted by a half during preparation of

irradiated in a device equipped with 6 fluorescent tubes emitting between 300 and 400 nm palma et al 2020 pseudo first order rate constants of probes phototransformation were determined by plotting ln ct c0 k t where ct and c0 are the probe concentration at time t and before irradiation all the experiments were duplicated 2 5 peroxides titration peroxides concentration was measured by the

dmpo 25 mm in the presence of srnom 20 mg l 1 srnom3h or h2o2 5 10 3 or 10 5 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectral changes of srnom upon 254 nm irradiation fig 1 a shows that the srnom solution progressively photobleached the absorbance at 254 nm declined by 59 and 77 after 3 and 4 h of irradiation respectively table 1 the reduction of doc as a function of irradiation time revealed that srnom also underwent substantial mineralization 35 after 4 h while the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva decreased by 42 and 64 after 3 and 4 h of irradiation respectively indicating a loss of unsaturated aromatic moieties weisshar et al 2003 table 1 yet the spectrum shape fig 1b and the e2 e3 ratio table 1 did not change much indicating that photoproducts negligibly contributed to the absorption and were poorly absorbing compounds irradiation also led to a breakdown of fluorescent species in accordance with previous studies patel sorrentino et al 2004 the fluorescence intensity at the emission maximum declined by 53 after 3 h of irradiation and by 68 after 4 h fig 1c fig 1d also shows that the blue part of the fluorescence emission spectra disappeared the fastest leading to emission spectra red shifted by 10 15 nm or to a band contraction on the contrary treatment of nom with radicals such as so4 zhang et al 2019 or oh varanasi et al 2018 was reported to induce a blue shift of fluorescence emission spectra attributed to preferential degradation of high molecular weight moieties into smaller entities in these treatments radicals are expected to react preferentially with biggest macromolecules offering the largest number of attack sites while in photolytic treatment the reactivity of generated excited states is the critical factor our results suggest that smaller fluorescent entities initially present in srnom or produced in the course of the treatment were more subject to photodegradation than larger ones the reasons could be that they were more light absorbing because more oxidized and or underwent less desactivation processes than bigger constituents being less embedded in large structures than these latter 3 2 carbonyls and carboxylic acids formation upon 254 nm irradiation of srnom table 2 summarizes the chemicals detected by dnph or bstfa derivatization and by ci ms in srnom before irradiation and after irradiation detailed ms data are given in figure si 3 tables si 1 to si 3 and the structures of photoproducts observed in irradiated samples are shown in fig 2 in starting srnom we detected 5 carbohydrates in c5 and c6 xylose rhamnose fucose glucose and galactose mentionned in the ihss web page along with 2 monocarboxylated alkanes in c3 and c18 glyceric and oleic acids and 3 dicarboxylated alkanes in c6 c9 and c12 hexanedioic nonanedioic and dodecanedioic acids tables 2 and si 1 several carbonyls were found but only as traces in srnom3h none of the carbohydrates observed in srnom were found while 11 carboxylated alkanes were detected 5 monocarboxylated in c1 formic acid c2 acetic and glycolic acid c3 lactic acid and c4 4 aminobutanoic acid 7 dicarboxylated alkanes in c2 oxalic acid c3 malonic tartronic dihydroxymalonic acids c4 butanedioic and malic acids c5 glutaric acid and c6 tricarballylic acid tables 3 and si 2 in all the irradiated samples 16 carbonyls in c1 c5 were detected among them 7 monocarbonyls formaldehyde acetaldehyde glycoladehyde glyoxylic acid 7 dicarbonyls glyoxal methylglyoxal butenedial and 2 tricarbonyls some of these compounds were already reported to be produced by irradiation of natural surface waters or synthetic waters containing nom with natural or simulated solar light by ozone treatment or by uv based aops of solutions of humic substances this is the case for formic acetic and oxalic acids brinkmann et al 2003 goldstone et al 2002 formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal and methylglyoxal thomson et al 2004 agbaba et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 de bryun et al 2011 kieber et al 1990 malonic and butanedioic acids corin et al 1996 and pyruvic acid thomson et al 2004 the concentration of the different carbonyls after 1 2 3 and 4 h of irradiation were estimated using derivatized methylglyoxal and pyruvic acid table si 4 fig 3 a shows the concentration profile of the most concentrated ones i e formaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glyoxal and glycolaldehyde as a function of irradiation time the concentration of formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid was maximum after 2 h of irradiation and then declined while that of pyruvic acid glyoxal and glycolaldehyde increased throughout the 4 h of irradiation it shows that srnom photodegradation still proceeds beyond 4 h although a significant absorbance decrease at 254 nm the total pool of c1 c5 carbonyls was estimated by summing the individual concentrations fig 3b shows that their cumulative concentration increased during the first 2 h of irradiation to reach the value of 2 8 10 4 m based on these concentrations and on the doc measurements the mass percentage of carbon atoms contained in the detected carbonyls could be calculated using eq 1 this percentage was maximum after 3 h of irradiation where it reached 46 fig 3b this high value demonstrates the very important contribution of c1 c5 carbonyls to the pool of photoproducts as most of these compounds poorly absorbed below 300 nm their high concentration explains the unchanged spectrum shape following irradiation 1 m a s s p e r c e n t a g e t i 1 i n c i t m i d o c t where ci t and mi are the concentration at time t and the molecular mass of carbonyl i and doct is the organic carbon content in the solution at time t the concentration of carboxylic acids detected in srnom3h are shown in table si 5 in general bstfa gc ms and ci ms analyses gave consistent results regarding the concentration estimations bstfa gc ms was however less performant than ci ms in the analysis of compounds containing 2 or 3 co2h or oh functions such as tartronic dihydroxymalonic acid oxalic acid and tricarballylic acids the difficulty to solubilize lyophilized srnom3h in acetonitrile to conduct the bstfa derivatization or a partial derivatization of these compounds probably explain these discrepancies malic oxalic butanedioic glycolic and malonic acids were the most concentrated acids however their concentration in srnom3h that laid below 2 8 10 6 m were much lower than those of carbonyls eq 1 allowed to determine that the detected carboxylic acids contained only 2 in mass of the srnom3h carbon atoms nitrate ions were also detected by ci ms in srnom at a level of 2 9 10 6 m but not in srnom3h the detection of all these compounds suggests that the photodegradation of srnom under uvc resulted from a complex set of reactions involving the direct photolysis of srnom constituents as well as their oxidation by the radicals generated in the course of the irradiation many radicals such as r ro ro2 ho2 o2 and oh can be formed by cc co and oo bond cleavage phenyl o and rco2 photoionization addition of oxygen on radicals and various radicalar attacks once formed these radicals could contribute to further degradation of srnom constituents and of their by products among them oh radical is likely to play a significant role for several reasons it is the most oxidant species able to react with a wide variety of chemicals by addition on double bonds or by h atom abstraction buxton et al 1988 nom was shown to generate oh radicals vaughan and blough 1998 page et al 2011 mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 gan et al 2008 sun et al 2015 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 aguer and richard 1999 under irradiation in reactions where oh radicals are purposely produced varanasi et al 2018 the oxidation degree of photoproducts given by the o c ratio is generally high 1 2 as observed here last the photolysis of chlorosalicylic acid that was proposed to occur via the intermediary formation of oh radicals tafer et al 2016 yielded glycolic lactic and butanedioic acids acetaldehyde glycoaldehyde methylglyoxal c4h4o3 and c3o3h2 that were also detected in the present work 3 3 effect of srnom pre irradiation on the oxidant properties at 254 nm in order to explore the photooxidant properties of pre irradiated srnom we chose glyphosate as a chemical probe we first checked that it is photostable when irradiated in our device k 2 10 4 min 1 table 3 for these experiments we selected srnom3h that showed the highest concentration of intermediary carbonyl compounds 2 4 10 4 m and srnom and srnom3h were tested at the same absorbance at 254 nm 0 34 in the presence of srnom glyphosate 10 5 m disappeared with a rate constant k of 0 0013 0 0002 min 1 in air saturated solution fig 4 a and table 3 making the hypothesis that the reaction was due to the reaction of glyphosate with oh radicals we used this rate constant to estimate the quantum yield of oh radicals formation by srnom srnom oh in the first stages of the reaction once formed by process 1 oh radicals react with glyphosate k gly 3 37 0 10 107 m 1 s 1 vidal et al 2015 process 2 and with srnom process 3 we took for k srnom the value of 1 6

srnom was diluted 2 44 fold to reach the same absorbance at 254 nm as srnom3h srnom was equal to 6 35 mgc l 1 or 0 529 mmc 1 taking 12 for the molar mass of carbon in these conditions one gets that glyphosate trapped 0 38 of oh radicals and that srnom oh was equal to 0 024 this value is in the range of that reported by lester et al 2013 at 254 nm 0 047 in the presence of srnom3h and in air saturated solution glyphosate disappeared much faster than in the presence of srnom fig 4a with k 0 038 0 004 min 1 table 3 in n2 purged srnom3h solution the glyphosate photodegradation rate was significantly reduced compared to the one conducted in air saturated medium k 0 002 0 002 min 1 in the first 10 min of the reaction fig 4a table 3 demonstrating the important role played by oxygen in the reaction moreover we irradiated glyphosate and srnom3h in the presence of 2 propanol to determine whether oh radicals were involved in the loss of glyphosate using k 2 propanol 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 for the bimolecular rate constant of reaction between oh and 2 propanol oh 2 propanol products 4 k 2 propanol we added 5 10 3 m of 2 propanol expecting an inhibition of the reaction 90 based on k srnom3h srnom3h 9 104 s 1 as for srnom the inhibition was of 90 fig 4a table 3 in accordance with a significant contribution of oh spin trap experiments using dmpo as the spin trapping reagent were also conducted to confirm the formation of oh radicals fig 5 shows that the four line signal with an intensity ratio 1 2 2 1 characteristic of the dmpooh adduct was not detected when dmpo was irradiated in the presence of srnom plot a or h2o2 10 5 plot c while it was observed with srnom3h plot b and h2o2 5 10 3 m plot d again this result is in line with the production of oh radicals upon irradiation of srnom3h in uvc postulating that the disappearance of glyphosate was only due to the reaction with oh we made the same calculation for srnom3h as for srnom after having replaced processes 1 and 2 by processes 1 and 3 respectively srnom3h hν srnom3h oh 1 srnom oh oh srnom3h products 3 k srnom3h and substituting srnom by srnom3h in eqn 2 the toc analyses showed that srnom3h had a doc content of 10 9 mgc l 1 or 0 907 mmc 1 table 1 to estimate the percentage of oh radicals reacting with glyphosate in srnom3h solution we also need to know the value of k srnom3h since srnom3h is much less aromatic than srnom and oh radicals react more easily with aromatic or conjugated structures than with saturated ones ksrnom3h is possibly smaller than ksrnom postulating that the rate constant decrease may parallel the absorbance decrease at 254 nm we opted for k srnom3h 0 7 0 3 108 mc 1 s 1 from this value the percentage of oh radicals trapped by glyphosate in srnom3h solution would lay between 0 3 and 0 8 and srnom3h oh would be comprised between 0 21 and 0 55 a value between 10 and 20 times higher than that found for srnom oh this value must be considered as a maximal value and would be lower if radicals other than oh also contributed to the degradation of glyphosate to better understand the enhancing effect of the pre irradiation on the photooxidant properties of srnom we conducted additional experiments and tested potential candidates for their ability to photodegrade glyphosate 3 4 peroxides formation and role of h2o2 in the oxidant properties at 254 nm peroxides are sources of oh radicals through direct photolysis process 5 or photo fenton reaction and we quantified their formation in our system measurements of h2o2 and ro2h ro2r were performed on srnom and srnom3h irradiated for 30 min fig 5 in srnom h2o2 and ro2h ro2r accumulated linearly after 30 min of irradiation the total concentration of h2o2 ro2h ro2r was equal to 16 μm h2o2 was by far the most abundant species 14 2 μm while ro2h ro2r contributed to the pool of peroxides in a minor way 1 8 μm in srnom3h the peroxides formation was auto inhibited slowing down after 10 min the total concentration reached 15 8 μm after 30 min h2o2 and ro2h ro2r were in equivalent amounts of 8 0 μm the formation of h2o2 in the photolysis of nom is well documented in the literature garg et al 2011 it is formed by dimutation of o2 that arises from reduction of dissolved o2 peroxides and hydroperoxides are generated after the reaction of r radicals with dissolved o2 to yield ro2 and the reaction of these peroxyl radicals with o2 ho2 sun et al 2021 to determine the contribution of h2o2 to the formation of oh via process 5 we proceeded as follows we first measured r gly in the presence of h2o2 10 5 m alone the value of 1 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 allowed us to check that glyphosate reacted with oh and to measure the photon flux i0 in the irradiation device si text 1 then we calculated r gly h2 o 2 in srnom solution using eq 3 supposing that the photolysis of h2o2 produced during the irradiation of srnom was the only source of oh through process 5 si text 5 h2o2 oh h 2 o 2 oh 5 3 r gly h 2 o 2 i a h 2 o 2 srnom h 2 o 2 oh k gly gly k gly gly k srnom srnom k h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 taking h2o2 14 μm corresponding to the highest value reached for srnom εh2o2 19 6 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm a254 0 34 for srnom and ℓ 2 we calculated i a h 2 o 2 s r n o m using the beer lamber law for a mixture si text 8 then taking k h2o2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 stefan et al 1996 we got that glyphosate trapped 0 38 of oh and using h2o2 oh 1 yu and barker 2003 we finally obtained r gly h2 o 2 7 0 10 12 m s 1 in the case of srnom3h we took h2o2 8 μm and the same calculation led to r gly h2 o 2 3 0 9 0 10 12 m s 1 both values are very small compared to the experimental values 2 2 10 10 m s 1 and 6 5 10 9 m s 1 respectively measured for srnom and srnom3h and it can be concluded that the photochemical decomposition of titrated hydroperoxides negligibly contributed to the oxidation of glyphosate spontaneous decomposition of unstable hydroperoxides into ro and oh might be an alternative source of oh radicals this was considered by badali et al 2015 and krapf et al 2016 in their studies on secondary organic aerosols 3 5 role of carbonyls in the photooxidant properties at 254 nm given the high concentration of carbonyls detected in srnom3h and the known potential of these chemicals as sensitizers we tested if they could induce the transformation of glyphosate at 254 nm we first tested pyruvic acid since this compound had been previously detected in our irradiated srnom samples in the presence of this ketoacid 10 4 m in ph 7 buffered solutions glyphosate 10 5 m disappeared with an apparent first order rate constant equal to 0 021 0 002 min 1 fig 6 a table 3 pyruvate was also photodegraded and the reaction auto accelerated during the first 6 min of irradiation only 1 8 10 6 m of pyruvate were transformed against 3 1 10 5 m between 6 and 30 min fig 6b the rate of pyruvate loss r pyruvate in the second part of the curve was equal to 2 1 10 8 m s 1 and r gly to 3 5 10 9 m s 1 the experiment was repeated in the presence of 2 propanol added to trap oh radicals the concentration 10 4 m was chosen for 2 propanol for a theoritical trapping of more than 95 based on k pyruvate acid 3 108 m 1 s 1 process 6 buxton et al 1988 after 30 min the rate of glyphosate loss was reduced by 75 confirming a significant contribution of oh in the reaction oh pyruvate products 6 k pyruvate although it was not detected in irradiated srnom samples acetone was chosen to represent monocarbonyls because it is a simple molecule it can be purchased in high purity it was already studied and its quantum yield of photolysis is known acetone 0 061 at 270 nm anpo and kubokawa 1977 at 10 4 m a concentration falling within the range of that found for intermediary carbonyls acetone increased the rate of glyphosate photodegradation and the reaction was also auto accelerated fig 6a table 3 during the first 10 min of reaction an averaged k 0 002 0 001 min 1 was obtained while between 10 and 30 min we measured k 0 024 0 003 min 1 in parallel the decay of acetone was monitored by uhplchrms after dnph derivatization acetone also disapppeared by an autoaccelerated reaction fig 6b between 0 and 10 min the loss of acetone was lower than 5 corresponding to a rate of acetone photodegradation r acetone 0 9 10 8 m s 1 while between 10 and 40 min acetone disappeared by 43 and r acetone was equal to 2 4 10 8 m s 1 table 3 during this reaction h2o2 was formed fig 6b the h2o2 production was of 2 μm between 0 and 10 min and 10 μm between 10 and 30 min which mirrored the autoaccelerated decrease of glyphosate and acetone in the presence of 2 propanol 10 4 m and acetone 10 4 m glyphosate disappeared by 10 instead of 42 in the absence of 2 propanol after 30 min of irradiation fig 6a table 3 confirming again a significant contribution of oh in the reaction 75 acetone was also irradiated alone to check that the observed auto acceleration was not due to the presence of glyphosate at 2 4 10 4 m acetone also disappeared in an auto accelerated reaction with r acetone 0 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 between 0 and 10 min and r acetone 3 9 10 8 m s 1 between 10 and 30 min table 3 the photoproducts were pyruvic acid methyl glyoxal hydroxyacetone formadehyde as described by stefan and bolton 1999 when they studied the photolysis of acetone in the presence of h2o2 at 254 nm using the quantum yield of acetone photodegradation in diluted solutions 0 061 and εacetone 16 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm it is possible to calculate the rate of acetone photodegradation by direct photolysis r a c e t o n e d p using eq 4 4 r acet one dp i 0 1 10 a acet one acet one 4 for acetone 10 4 m one gets r a c e t o n e d p 1 3 10 9 m s 1 and for acetone 2 4 10 4 m r a c e t o n e d p 3 1 10 9 s 1 these values are consistent with the ones obtained between 0 and 10 min 9 10 9 m s 1 and one can conclude that r a c e t o n e d p being negligible behind r acetone measured in the second part of the curves other reactions should take place an autoaccelerated reaction is generally due to the accumulation of key intermediates here the intermediary chemicals were the acetone photoproducts and peroxides among which h2o2 we therefore studied the effect of h2o2 used a hydroperoxide model at the concentration of 10 5 and 10 3 m on the photodegradation of acetone 2 4 10 4 m the photodegradation of acetone was fast till the very beginning of the irradiation r acetone 3 5 10 8 and 1 8 10 7 m s 1 respectively table 3 and no auto accelerating effect was observed in this mixture acetone can disappear by reaction with oh produced from h2o2 photolysis process 7 k acetone 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 process 8 is a potential competiting pathway of oh disappearance k h2o2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 oh acetone products 7 k acetone oh h2o2 products 8 k h2o2 for h2o2 10 3 m and acetone 2 4 10 4 m process 8 was expected to significantly reduce the percentage of oh radicals trapped by acetone taking into account that acetone should trap about 50 of oh one obtains racetone 1 3 10 7 m s 1 against 1 8 10 7 m s 1 measured experimentally for h2o2 10 5 m and acetone 2 4 10 4 m process 8 was negligible and acetone was expected to trap all the oh radicals produced by h2o2 photolysis its rate of decay through process 7 racetone oh was equal to 2 6 10 9 m s 1 according to eq 5 5 r acet one oh i 0 1 10 a h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh 5 this calculated rate accounted for only 6 6 of the measured rate indicating that an additional radical source was responsible for acetone degradation then we simultaneously irradiated glyphosate 10 5 m h2o2 10 5 m and acetone 10 4 m in this case the glyphosate photodegradation was fast till the beginning of the irradiation k 0 016 min 1 fig 6a table 3 showing that h2o2 or other hydroperoxides are important intermediaries in the reaction the results obtained for acetone can be tentatively explained by the chain reaction mechanism shown in scheme 1 in the classical chain oxidation of a chemical rh bearing a labile h atom the initiator produces the primary radicals process 9 that start the chain through a transfer reaction by generating the radical r process 7 then r produces ro2 by adding o2 process 10 and ro2 regenerates r along to ro2h by abstracting of a h from rh process 11 the longer the chain length the faster the reaction in fact when the chain is long enough the rate of the propagation reactions becomes much higher than the rates of initiation and of transfer in our case the calculated rate of acetone photolysis r a c e t o n e d p process 9 was much lower than the experimental rate of acetone photodegradation consistently with the involvement of a chain reaction the irradiation of acetone was expected to yield radicals by α cleavage of the triplet excited state process 9 pearson 1963 the triplet could also abstract a h atom from methyl groups of acetone however neither acetone itself nor glyphosate were concentrated enough to compete significantly with the cleavage anpo and kubokawa 1977 due to the oxidation of these radicals and to the photolysis of the formed hydroperoxides there should be a pool of initiating radicals in the system the acetonyl radical r formed by process 7 stefan et al 1996 should easily react with oxygen process 10 to yield the peroxyl radical roo stefan et al 1996 this peroxyl radical likely abstracted an h atom from acetone process 11 to regenerate the acetonyl radical and produce the hydroperoxide rooh the recombination of two peroxide radicals process 12 terminated this chain reaction in this chain reaction glyphosate might be oxidized by several of the radicals formed in the complex mixture however while the reaction with oh was evidenced the oxidation with the other radicals remains to be demonstrated if we make the hypothesis that oh contributed significantly to the glyphosate degradation the source of oh needs to be explained indeed calculations showed that the photolysis of the different hydroperoxides did not yield enough radicals to explain the high rate of glyphosate degradation an alternative formation of oh could be the spontaneous decomposition at room temperature of unstable hydroperoxides here ch3 coch2ooh process 13 according to the works of badali et al 2015 and krapf et al 2016 the formation of very unstable hydroperoxides is plausible therefore despite processes 7 10 and 11 still taking place the key process became process 13 since it introduced a continuous source of oh and ro radicals consequently the rate of glyphosate degradation increased during the accumulation phase of rooh reaching the maximal value rate when the ro2h formation equaled the ro2h decomposition ch3 coch2ooh ch3 coch2o oh 13 in the case of srnom3h carbonyls were present at 2 4 10 4 m and hydroperoxides were potentially generated at a fast rate therefore making it possible the mechanism already proposed in the case of acetone to occur in accordance rooh roor were formed along with h2o2 in srnom3h solution r gly was equal to 6 3 10 9 m s 1 considering that glyphosate trapped between 0 3 and 0 8 of oh radicals in competition with srnom3h constituents the rate of oh formation should be comprised between 8 10 7 and 2 10 6 m s 1 in the model solution containing glyphosate 10 5 m h2o2 10 5 m and acetone 10 4 m rgly was equal to 2 7 10 9 m s 1 considering that oh contributed to the reaction at 75 and that glyphosate trapped 3 of oh in competition with acetone then the rate of oh formation should be equal to 7 10 8 m s 1 for acetone 2 4 10 4 m it might be 1 7 10 7 m s 1 this value is smaller than that estimated for the srnom3h solution and several explanations of this difference can be proposed i srnom3h was a much more complex system than h2o2 acetone and quantitative results cannot be directly transferable furthermore calculation lays on an hypothetical value of the bimolecular reaction rate constant of srnom3h with oh ii acetone was chosen as a model compound but among the carbonyls formed in srnom3h some may absorb more than acetone especially those bearing double bonds and or photodissociate much more easily anpo and kubokawa 1977 iii srnom3h also contained chemicals acting probably as better h donors than acetone and glyphosate which should favor process 11 and thus the formation of unstable hydroperoxides iv oxidant species other than oh might contribute to the photodegradation of glyphosate in the case of srnom rgly was much higher than r gly h2 o 2 as for srnom3h suggesting that chain reactions might take place as for srnom3 h although leading to a much slower production of oh accordingly the 6 times less formation of roor rooh from srnom than from srnom3h suggests that unstable hydroperoxides should be produced in smaller amounts by srnom than by srnom3h spectral measurements showed that srnom is much more aromatic than srnom3h which constitutes an important difference in terms of oh reactions the oh radicals are known to add on phenols lundquist and eriksson 2000 to finally produce unreactive phenoxyl radicals while they generate radicals oxidable into hydroperoxides when they abstract hydrogen atoms from aliphatic compounds hence the presence of carbonyls in srnom3h could not only favor the formation of radicals through their photolysis but also constitutes a pool of aliphatic compounds oxidable into hydroperoxides ampa was the main glyphosate photoproduct detected by uhplchrms fig 4b in the literature other oxidation products were also detected such as sarcosine chen et al 2007 not detected in this work after 30 min of irradiation the highest yield of ampa was measured with h2o2 66 followed by srnom3h 62 acetone 57 and pyruvic acid 38 interestingly when 2 propanol was added to acetone and pyruvate solutions the yield of ampa dropped to 10 and 17 respectively the formation of ampa may be thus an indirect evidence of the involvement of oh radicals in the photodegradation fig 7 3 5 effect of srnom pre irradiation on oh 1o2 and 3srnom formation under simulated solar light we also compared the ability of srnom and srnom3h to photoproduce photooxidants 3srnom 1o2 and oh in simulated solar light after the normalization for light absorption the rate of 2 4 6 trimethyphenol was found to be 1 5 times higher in srnom than in srnom3h in accordance with lower rate of 3srnom formation therefore chromophores yielding 3srnom were partly degraded under uvc irradiation in the case of 1o2 titrated using furfuryl alcohol we found rates of formation varying by less than 10 between srnom and srnom3h at last results on terephthalic acid used to estimate the rate of oh formation showed a higher rate of oh formation in srnom3h solution than in srnom solution taking k srnom 1 6 108 mc 1 s 1 and k srnom3h 0 7 108 mc 1 s 1 for the bimolecular rate constants of reaction with oh we got a rate of oh formation higher by 40 for srnom3h solution than for srnom solution this enhancement was much lower than the one observed at 254 nm with glyphosate the dependence of the oh formation enhancement on the irradiation wavelength supports the hypothesis of the involvement of poorly conjugated and light absorbing carbonyl compounds in the photochemical production of oh 4 conclusion this work aimed to investigate the effect of uvc irradiation on the ability of srnom to generate oxidant species in particular oh radicals under uvc through in depth analytical and kinetic studies we demonstrated that srnom irradiation drastically increased the pool of aliphatic carbonyls together with its capacity of photoinducing the degradation of glyphosate at 254 nm several experimental results suggest that oh radicals contributed to this degradation to better understand the role of carbonyls in the reaction we studied the photodegradation of glyphosate in the presence of acetone and pyruvate experimental data were explained by a mechanism involving a chain reaction in which oh radicals may be formed through the spontaneous decomposition of unstable hydroperoxides the same mechanism might prevail in pre irradiated srnom and explain its high efficiency to photodegrade glyphosate upon irradiation at 254 nm these results show that in uvc treatments nom could favor the degradation of micropollutants through its high capacity to generate very oxidant radicals such a pretreatment of nom would deserve to be further studied in combination with other engineered water treatment sytems declaration of competing interest the
