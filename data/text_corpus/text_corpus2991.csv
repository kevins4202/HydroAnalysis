14955,though thousands of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been on the global market most research focused on only a small fraction potentially resulting in underestimated environmental risks here we used complementary target suspect and nontarget screening for quantifying and identifying the target and nontarget pfas respectively and developed a risk model considering their specific properties to prioritize the pfas in surface waters thirty three pfas were identified in surface water in the chaobai river beijing the suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap displayed a sensitivity of 77 indicating its good performance in identifying the pfas in samples we used triple quadrupole qqq under multiple reaction monitoring for quantifying pfas with authentic standards due to its potentially high sensitivity to quantify the nontarget pfas without authentic standards we trained a random forest regression model which presented the differences up to only 2 7 times between measured and predicted response factors rfs the maximum minimum rf in each pfas class was as high as 1 2 10 0 in orbitrap and 1 7 22 3 in qqq a risk based prioritization approach was developed to rank the identified pfas and four pfas i e perfluorooctanoic acid hydrogenated perfluorohexanoic acid bistriflimide 6 2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid were flagged with high priority risk index 0 1 for remediation and management our study highlighted the importance of a quantification strategy during environmental scrutiny of pfas especially for nontarget pfas without standards graphical abstract

on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a ubiquitous class of synthetic chemicals with extremely high thermal and chemical stability and have drawn increasing concerns due to their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity pbt barrett et al 2021 chu and letcher 2014 though more than 4700 pfas are or have been on the global market wang et al 2021c most research focused on only a small fraction of these pfas barrett et al 2021 chen et al 2020 wang et al 2018 evaluating the pfas risks by including their majority will help to estimate their environmental fate and risks which could be underestimated based on a small fraction of pfas koelmel et al 2022 wang et al 2021b quantitative target analysis of pfas is commonly conducted by acquiring the tandem mass spectrometry ms ms data through their precursor product ion transitions with high selectivity and sensitivity de silva et al 2021 jia et al 2022 high resolution ms hrms such as orbitrap and quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometers has emerged as a powerful tool to identify the unknown chemicals due to its wide mass range high quality resolution and accurate masses barzen hanson et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 nontarget screening by hrms is increasingly used to complement to traditional target analysis for the discovery of unknown pfas in various environmental samples liu et al 2019 wang et al 2021b 2020 young et al 2022 jacob et al 2021a used nontarget screening on full scan ms data coupled with data dependent ms ms data in q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap ms and found the presence of 41 homologous series of pfas comprising 133 homologues in wastewater of three electronics fabrication facilities though target pfas can be quantified by either ms ms under mrm or full scan ms the standard availability limited the quantification of unknown pfas many efforts have been made to quantify the nontarget pfas without authentic standards jacob et al 2021a munoz et al 2022 wang et al 2020 most of the quantification methods were matching nontarget pfas to target pfas based on structural similarity e g functional group or perfluorinated chain length or proximity of retention time resulting in high variations and uncertainty jacob et al 2021a kruve 2020 predicting the response factor or ionization efficiency has emerged as a robust tool to quantify the identified nontarget chemicals kruve 2020 palm and kruve 2022 considering the potential number of pfas existing in the aquatic environments the pfas prioritization based on the principles of risk assessment is critical for remediation and management purposes in general the risk is reflected by multiplying the exposure of a chemical with its hazard gaston et al 2019 it is comprised of ecotoxicological risk based on dose response data short term or long term toxicity for aquatic organisms and health risks based on tolerable daily intakes or oral reference doses for human brown et al 2020 ojo et al 2021 however specific toxicological properties i e mutagenicity carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity which were frequently reported on pfas evich et al 2022 ojo et al 2021 were rarely included in human health risk assessment besides several pfas e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorononanoic acid pfna have been identified as the pbt persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity substances under registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach https echa europa eu pbt therefore it is critical to develop a comprehensive risk prioritization approach for pfas in the aquatic environments by including these specific properties evich et al 2022 which is still missing the objective of this study is to prioritize the pfas with high risk in surface waters by identifying and quantifying the target and nontarget pfas and considering their specific properties in the risk modeling specifically we used 1 orbitrap for identifying the nontarget pfas through the suspect screening and homologue and fragment based nontarget screening workflow and 2 qqq for quantifying the pfas with authentic standards the identified nontarget pfas without authentic standards were quantified using their response factors predicted by a random forest regression model we finally developed a risk based prioritization approach by integrating hazard effects reflected by the toxpi score incorporation of 18 pbt attributes with environmental exposure to rank the identified pfas in surface waters this study integrated the identification of target and nontarget pfas with a comprehensive risk modeling to prioritize the pfas with high risk in surface waters our results highlight that the quantification of nontarget pfas is essential for bridging the gaps between pfas discovery and risk assessment 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection preparation and analysis we collected surface water samples n 90 in 2 l pre rinsed polypropylene bottles in september 2020 autumn and april 2021 spring from 45 routine monitoring stations of the chaobai river beijing fig s1 and table s1 the collected water samples were stored at 4 c and extracted in 48 h using the routine solid phase extraction method cai et al 2022 li et al 2020a briefly 2 l filtered water samples spiked with 50 ng isotope labeled internal standards iliss were extracted by oasis wax cartridges 6 ml 500 mg waters us preconditioned by 10 ml methanol with 0 1 nh4oh and 10 ml water then the cartridge was washed with 25 mm ammonium acetate ph 4 and eluted with 10 ml 0 1 nh4oh in methanol the eluent was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 1 ml methanol this extraction procedure was conducted in duplicate for each water sample procedural blanks were performed simultaneously using ultrapure water finally the extracted samples with pfas in methanol were stored in polypropylene vials at 20 c before instrumental analysis to identify and semi quantify pfas through suspect and nontarget screening the extracted samples were analyzed by an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography interfaced to a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific san jose ca us under the full ms dd ms2 top 3 mode to identify and quantify target pfas the extracted samples were analyzed by an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometer tsq endura thermo fisher scientific san jose ca us using mrm in negative electrospray ionization mode esi which mainly focused on anionic pfas detailed information is provided in the si section 1 for target pfas and iliss si section 2 for instrument analysis and si section 3 for quality assurance and quality control qaqc 2 2 suspect and nontarget screening to identify the nontarget pfas that were not included in target analysis we developed a suspect and nontarget screening workflow involving data preprocessing selection of pfas candidates and structure identification fig 1 a using compound discover 3 2 thermo fisher scientific san jose ca us we performed data preprocessing of orbitrap raw data including peak picking retention time alignment grouping of peaks across files and background subtraction which generated a peak list with the information of apex mass corrected retention time and max intensity for suspect screening firstly we compiled a suspect list comprised of 7676 ms ready pfas with exact neutral mass and structure by combining 9252 pfas in the pfas master list of pfas substances accessed may 13th 2021 from the united states environmental protection agency us epa comptox chemistry dashboard and 1030 pfas from norman suspect list exchange with the removal of duplicates metal ions salts isotopes and mixtures liu et al 2019 yukioka et al 2020 through the function of search mass lists in compound discover 3 2 we identified the positive hits by matching the peak list with this suspect list using the criteria of mass tolerance 5 ppm for nontarget screening we filtered peaks with cf2 adjusted kendrick mass defect kmd 0 85 or 0 15 barzen hanson et al 2017 jacob et al 2021a and searched pfas homologue series with the units of cf2 c2f4 cf2o cf2ch2 and c2f4o using the nontarget r package jacob et al 2021a mccord et al 2020 wang et al 2018 the peaks were further filtered when we did not observe an ascending trend of retention time versus m z of each homologue series after removing duplicates and checking peak shape the peaks with positive hits from suspect screening and the filtered peaks from nontarget screening were labeled as pfas candidates when having isotopic pattern fit 80 to identify pfas candidates structures the predicted molecular formula was determined with the criteria of 1 maximum element counts c50h50f50o12s4n4p4 2 ring double bond equivalents rdbe 0 5 3 isotopic fit threshold 80 and 4 mass tolerance 5 ppm using the function of predict compositions in compound discover 3 2 when having pfas candidates without ms ms spectra we reinjected the samples into orbitrap after adding m z of these pfas to the inclusion list with the help of previous literature mass spectral database e g mzcloud and massbank and in silico fragmentation tools e g cfm id wang et al 2021a and mass frontier the structures of pfas candidates were interpreted based on their ms ms spectra such as the diagnostic fragments jacob et al 2021a wang et al 2020 pfas candidates with interpreted structures were labeled as identified pfas we further checked the identified pfas with similar retention time or chromatograms to exclude the in source fragmentation kang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 finally we assigned confidence level 1 3 with level 1 having the highest reliability to the identified pfas according to charbonnet et al 2022 river water samples and 43 target pfas spiked samples blank spiked with 5 and 10 ng standards were determined to evaluate the performance of suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap jacob et al 2021b selectivity is the ability of suspect and nontarget screening to avoid the identifications of pfas that were not present in a sample eq 1 sensitivity is the ability of suspect and nontarget screening to identify the pfas that were truly present in a sample eq 2 1 selectivity t p t p f p 2 sensitivity t

nontarget screening but unidentified by target analysis tn true negative is the number of pfas identified by target analysis but unidentified by suspect and nontarget screening fig 2 a 2 3 quantifying target and nontarget pfas for both qqq and orbitrap we performed an internal calibration curve using seven standard samples containing both 43 target pfas and 8 iliss 0 1 0 5 1 5 10 50 and 100 μg l for each target pfas 50 μg l for each ilis r2 0 99 with the method detection limits mdls of 0 01 1 36 ng l for qqq and 0 06 5 23 ng l for orbitrap table s7 we also acquired the authentic standards for 7 nontarget pfas identified in our samples and thus quantified them in qqq under mrm we developed a random forest regression model to quantify the 13 nontarget pfas without authentic standards through the prediction of response factors rfs referring to the slope of the linear regressions of the calibration curve in orbitrap kruve 2020 palm and kruve 2022 the feature dataset included 1450 molecular descriptors from padel descriptor yap 2011 and ufz lser https www ufz de lserd and the retention times of 50 pfas with authentic standards in orbitrap we removed the features with not available value zero variance and high correlation pearson s r 0 8 with 113 features left table s8 the feature dataset and rfs of 50 pfas with authentic standards in orbitrap were randomly split into training and test sets 80 20 for model training and validation we tested eight machine learning regression algorithms for model development including gradient boosting adaboost random forest decision trees k nearest neighbors support vector machines multiple linear regression and ridge regression these models were constructed using functions in the scikit learn package in python and evaluated using 5 fold cross validation random forest regression model constructed by the function of randomforestregressor achieved the best performance and was selected in our study we performed feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of original feature space and had 14 most relevant features for final model development si section 4 the model s performance was evaluated using r2 root mean squared error rmse and prediction error max predicted measured rf measured predicted rf finally the concentrations of nontarget pfas were calculated based on their predicted rfs using the model and peak areas in orbitrap 2 4 risk modeling to rank the identified pfas we developed a risk based prioritization approach according to their potential hazard effects and environmental exposure this approach includes three steps 1 calculating a pbt based score for each identified pfas 2 assessing the exposure by detection frequency and concentration 3 determining pfas prioritization based on their hazard and exposure firstly to estimate the pbt of pfas a total of 18 attributes we used the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models such as epi suite v4 11 ecosar v2 0 t e s t v5 1 1 vega v1 2 0 and qsar toolbox v4 5 si section 5 and table s9 and thus the criteria in reach annex xiii and iii and ghs classification table s10 to rank the pfas hazard we then used pbt to calculate the toxpi score for each pfas in the toxicological priority index toxpi software marvel et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 secondly detection frequency df is the regularity of occurrence and prevalence while magnitude represents the relative intensity of pfas eq 3 gaston et al 2019 the pfas exposure was estimated by multiplying df with concentration magnitude eq 4 which was then normalized within 0 1 eq 5 thirdly we calculated the risk index ri of each pfas by multiplying its toxpi score with normalized exposure eq 6 zhao et al 2021 according to ri we prioritized the pfas into four levels high ri 0 1 medium 0 01 ri 0 1 low 0 001 ri 0 01 and insignificant priority ri 0 001 3 magnitude c i c m i n c m a x c m i n 4 exposure df magnitude 5 exposur e normalized e x p o s u r e i e x p o s u r e m i n e x p o s

the lowest value among the maximum concentrations of all pfas df is the detection frequency of pfas magnitude is the concentration magnitude of pfas exposurei is the exposure value of pfas i exposuremin is the minimum exposure value of all pfas exposuremax is the maximum exposure value of all pfas 3 results and discussion 3 1 suspect and nontarget screening among 77 284 peaks generated by the preprocessing of raw data 42 250 peaks were retained after blank subtraction for further suspect and nontarget screening fig 1a we obtained 445 positive hits through suspect screening and 733 pfas homologues through nontarget screening by mass defect filter homologue detection and retention time versus m z filter after removing duplicates and bad shape peaks we obtained 742 peaks for ms ms spectra annotation through further structure elucidation based on diagnostic fragments and false positive check we finally identified 30 pfas in the surface water from the chaobai river figs s3 s12 and table s11 among these 30 pfas 10 pfas were also identified by target analysis and 7 nontarget pfas were further confirmed by newly obtained authentic standards notably two limitations could present in our study 1 analyzing only pfas extracted by a specific spe cartridge oasis wax cartridge and 2 analyzing only pfas which can be ionized under esi this resulted the dominance of anionic pfas and the exclusion of cationic pfas as the identified pfas in our samples these 30 pfas could be grouped into 15 classes fig 1b 1 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas 2 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas 4 fluorotelomer sulfonic acids ftsas 5 hydrogenated pfcas h pfcas 6 perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides fasas 7 n methyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides mefasas 8 n methyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido acetic acids mefasaas 9 perfluoroalkyl sulfinates pfsias 10 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates cl pfesas 11 hydrogenated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates h pfesas 12 cyclic pfsas c pfsas 13 oxa unsaturated pfcas o u pfcas 14 p perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate obs and 15 bistriflimide thereinto pfcas pfsas h pfcas and fasas contained 3 homologues cf2 or c2f4 repeating units in each class and were distributed as horizontal lines in the cf2 adjusted kmd plot fig s3a these 4 classes comprising of 17 pfas could be identified by nontarget screening strategy via homologue detection and showed a retention time increasing trend across each homologous series fig s3b legacy pfcas and pfsas five pfca homologues c6 c10 and 3 pfsa homologues c4 c6 and c8 were identified through both suspect and nontarget screening table s11 they were all confirmed by authentic standards based on exact mass retention time and ms ms spectra level 1a for pfcas neutral loss of co2 m z 43 98983 and fragments cnf2n 1 were typically observed in their ms ms spectra fig s4 structures of pfsas were elucidated using the characteristic fragments of m z 79 95736 so3 m z 82 96085 so2f m z 98 95577 so3f as well as fragments cnf2n 1 notably distinct from other pfsas and pfcas pfos eluted as split peaks in water samples fig s5d suggesting the presence of isomers the most abundant pfos isomer in samples retention time 8 14 min was identified as linear pfos by comparing retention time and ms ms spectrum with the standard other two peaks eluted at 7 95 and 7 81 min were attributed to the branched pfos isomers fig s5d schulz et al 2020 previous studies have well documented the bioaccumulation of pfcas and pfsas in biota like fish wildlife marine mammals and human barrett et al 2021 ma et al 2022 poothong et al 2017 spaan et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2022 as well as their hepatotoxicity developmental and reproductive toxicity immunotoxicity endocrine disruption and carcinogenicity fenton et al 2021 ojo et al 2021 ftcas and ftsas we detected 6 2 ftca and 6 2 ftsa by suspect screening confirmed by standards level 1a for 6 2 ftca sequential neutral losses of co2 and hf were observed and supported by the presence of characteristic fragment m co2 h2f2 in its ms ms spectrum fig s6a for 6 2 ftsa neutral losses of hf m hf and m h2f2 were also marked in the ms ms spectrum fig s6b and the presence of m z 79 95736 so3 and m z 80 96519 hso3 indicated the sulfonate moiety in its structure 6 2 ftsa is used as surfactants in metal plating substitutes to pfos and 6 2 ftca has been used as an alternative processing acid to pfoa in china shi et al 2017 they are the degradation intermediates of fluorotelomer based surfactants e g 6 2 fluorotelomer alcohol and 6 2 fluorotelomer thio alkyl amido sulfonic acids and can be further degraded to pfcas with shorter carbon chain lengths liu et al 2021 h pfcas we tentatively identified six homologues c4 c8 and c10 in this class through both suspect and nontarget screening unequivocal molecular formulas of 6 homologues were first determined as cnhf2n 2o2 2 9 to 1 3 ppm the most abundant fragments m co2 hf in all the ms ms spectra were attributed to the neutral losses of co2 and hf and thus suggested their identifications as hydrogenated pfcas fig s7 barrett et al 2021 wang et al 2021b yu et al 2020 the identities were further supported by the increasing retention times across 6 homologues and shorter retention times 2 05 7 53 min compared to pfca analogues 6 67 8 64 min figs s4 and s7 likely due to the higher hydrophilicity of h pfcas logk ow 1 83 hydrogenated perfluorobutanoic acid h pfba to 5 84 hydrogenated perfluorodecanoic acid h pfda relative to corresponding pfcas logk ow 2 14 pfba to 6 15 pfda table s11 according to barrett et al 2021 the possible artifact identity was excluded wherein hcnpfcas are likely formed via in source fragmentation of cn 2pfcas by comparing their retention times and chromatograms and checking the correlations of concentrations across all samples fig s7 however we did not determine the exact h substitution position through ms ms spectra and thus identified this class at level 3a h pfcas could transform from pfcas jacob et al 2021a washington et al 2009 and were reported in beluga whales livers barrett et al 2021 however few studies were conducted relevant to their toxicity fasas we identified three fasa homologues i e perfluorobutane sulfonamide fbsa perfluorohexane sulfonamide fhxsa and perfluorooctane sulfonamide fosa through both suspect and nontarget screening the identities were supported by the presence of the diagnostic fragment so2n with m z 77 96552 in all the ms ms spectra and the increased retention time fig s8 also their longer retention times 6 98 9 62 min compared with the corresponding pfsas 6 08 8 10 min agreed with their higher logk ow values 3 13 5 80 than pfsas 1 82 4 49 which increased the confidence level of identifications finally the structures of 3 homologues were proposed and confirmed by authentic standards with level 1a fasas are used as raw material for surfactants and surface protection products and also reported as the biodegradation products of sulfonamide containing substances e g n alkyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido ethanols or acids and as the precursors of pfsas and pfcas chu and letcher 2014 rhoads et al 2008 schaefer et al 2018 supporting this we found that the identified pfsas and fasas both had 4 6 and 8 c atoms in their structures and a branched fosa was also found in its chromatogram fig s8a similar to pfos fig s5d though they can be biodegraded to corresponding pfsas fasas are relatively stable and were frequently found in wildlife and human samples barrett et al 2021 spaan et al 2020 wang et al 2021b and fosa was reported to display higher liver concentrations than pfos in beluga whales from alaska reiner et al 2011 and melon headed whales from japan hart et al 2008 mefasas and mefasaas here only n methyl perfluorobutane sulfonamide mefbsa and n methyl perfluorobutane sulfonamido acetic acid mefbsaa were identified by suspect screening for mefbsa c4f9 m z 218 98618 was the most abundant fragment in ms ms spectrum and the identity was confirmed by authentic standard level 1a fig s9a fragments so2f m z 82 96085 c4f9 m z 218 98618 c4f9so2 m z 282 94808 and c5h3f9no2s m z 311 97463 were found in ms ms spectrum of mefbsaa level 2a fig s9b newton et al 2017 wang et al 2020 its identification was further supported by reasonable order of retention times mefbsa 7 94 min mefbsaa 6 87 min perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs 6 08 min in line with the order of calculated logk ow values mefbsa 3 59 mefbsaa 3 06 pfbs 1 82 table s11 these two compounds have been documented as the intermediate transformation products of n methyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido ethanols mefbse rhoads et al 2008 which was not detected in this study and they can be subsequently biotransformed to fbsa pfsias two homologues i e perfluorobutane sulfinate pfbsi and perfluorooctane sulfinate pfosi were tentatively identified by suspect screening the characteristic fragments so2f m z 82 96085 and cnf2n 1 in their ms ms spectra fig s9c and s9d supported the identities of levels 2b and 2c respectively munoz et al 2022 they have been detected in organic waste products for land application munoz et al 2022 and aqueous film forming foams afffs impacted groundwater barzen hanson et al 2017 they can be derived from the degradation of commercial products containing perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido substances e g fasas and also subsequently transform to pfsas and pfcas rhoads et al 2008 cl pfesas and h pfesas we identified 6 2 cl pfesa a well known successor of pfos which has been used in chrome planting industry in china for over 30 years wang et al 2013 and another homologue i e 4 2 cl pfesa the identities were supported by the isotopic pattern m h m h 2 3 1 in the ms spectra and the characteristic fragments m c2f4so3 in the ms ms spectra fig s10a the identity of 6 2 cl pfesa was confirmed by authentic standard level 1a and thus the identity of 4 2 cl pfesa was assigned with level 2c in addition we detected 6 2 h pfesa level 2b a hydrogenated analogue of 6 2 cl pfesa with fragments m c2f4so3 m c2f4so3 hf and m c2f4so3 hf cf2o in its ms ms spectrum fig s10c wang et al 2013 2020 since the first report of 6 2 cl pfesa in 2013 wang et al 2013 many studies barrett et al 2021 shi et al 2015 spaan et al 2020 wang et al 2021b documented its bioaccumulation developmental toxicity hepatotoxicity acute metabolic effects and associations with health effects and illustrated the comparable and even stronger toxicity of 6 2 cl pfesa relative to pfos 6 2 h pfesa was noted as the reductive dichlorination product of 6 2 cl pfesa under anoxic conditions lin et al 2017 and in biota yi et al 2022 2020 with unclear toxicity other emerging pfas we identified other four emerging pfas i e perfluoroethylenecyclohexanesulfonate pfechs o u pfoa obs and bistriflimide pfechs was identified using the exact mass 460 93319 0 5 ppm unequivocal molecular formula c8f15o3s and characteristic fragments so3f c2f5 and c8f15 in its ms ms spectrum fig s11 compared with the previous studies wang et al 2021b 2016 this evidence supported the identity as pfechs rather than an unsaturated pfos due to the absence of a series of cnf2n 1 mcdonough et al 2021 finally using authentic standard we confirmed the identity of level 1b due to the uncertainty on the exact positions of sulfonate and perfluoroethyl fig s11 another cyclic pfos isomer perfluoropropylcyclopentanesulfonate pfpcpes was tentatively identified and distinct from pfechs due to the different retention time and the c3f7 presence niu et al 2019 reported the growth inhibition of 8 07 and 51 85 for 10 ng l and 1000 ng l pfechs respectively on marine chlorella sp at 14 d o u pfoa was tentatively identified at level 2b due to the characteristic fragments c2f5o c3f5o c5f9 and c6f11 in its ms ms spectrum fig s12a barzen hanson et al 2017 wang et al 2018 it has been detected in afffs barzen hanson et al 2017 and wastewater from a fluorochemical manufacturing park wang et al 2018 obs was tentatively identified at level 2b due to the characteristic fragments c6h4o4s c11h4o3f7s and c13h4o4f11s in its ms ms spectrum fig s12b wang et al 2020 xu et al 2017 as an alternative to pfos obs is extensively used as additive and surfactant in oil production and afffs with estimated production of about 3500 tons in china in 2017 bao et al 2017 it illustrated the gut barrier dysfunction and hepatotoxicity to maternal mice wang et al 2022 2019 and was found in fish marine mammals and maternal and umbilical cord blood serum li et al 2020b shi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b we detected bistriflimide a polyfluorinated sulfonimide dimer fig s13 the peak with m z 279 91685 at 4 16 min in several samples has considerable intensity compared to pfoa and pfos its molecular formula was preliminarily determined as c2f6no4s2 top ranked by searching it within database 10 structures were retrieved among them bistriflimide cas 82113 65 3 had the most patents 7585 items in pubchem and references 284 items in chemspider indicating its environmental presence with high possibility manual interpretation of the experimental ms ms spectrum supported this identity fig s13 moreover this identity was confirmed by comparing retention time and ms ms spectrum with its standard level 1a this compound is widely used in organic synthesis and as an anion of ion liquids zhao and sun 2018 and was listed as a dangerous chemical of category 3 with relatively high acute toxicity for dosed rats https echa europa eu registration dossier registered dossier 8988 7 3 2 it was found as a xenobiotic in human blood and included in an exposome chemical database barupal and fiehn 2019 and its long chain homologues were identified in mice dosed with afffs mcdonough et al 2020 3 2 pfas quantification combining target suspect and nontarget screening we identified 33 pfas in river water samples including 13 target pfas 7 nontarget pfas confirmed by newly obtained authentic standards and 13 nontarget pfas among the 13 target pfas 3 pfas i e 8 2 ftsa 6 2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid ftuca and 8 2 ftuca were not identified by the suspect and nontarget screening fig s13 therefore according to eq 1 the sensitivity of the suspect and nontarget screening was 77 10 13 fig 2a however all the 10 target pfas identified by the suspect and nontarget screening were also identified by target analysis thus according to eq 2 the suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap had 100 selectivity for 43 target pfas in river water samples fig 2a specifically low sensitivity of 50 was observed in the individual river water samples with relatively low pfas concentrations fig s15 and table s12 10 ng l similarly we found that suspect and nontarget screening had 100 selectivity and 93 sensitivity for target pfas in spiked samples specifically we found the sensitivity of 93 40 43 and 100 43 43 for the 5 ng and 10 ng spiked samples respectively there were 3 pfas i e perfluorohexylphosphonic acid perfluorooctylphosphonic acid pfopa and 6 cloroperfluorohexylphosphonic acid in the 5 ng spiked samples unidentified by the suspect and nontarget screening the absence of unidentified target pfas in river water and spiked samples were confirmed by checking the orbitrap raw data and thus excluded they were lost during suspect and nontarget screening workflow compared to target analysis by qqq under mrm suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap under full ms dd ms2 top 3 would likely miss these peaks with low intensity during instrument analysis and result in the false negatives it is confirmed by the relatively lower mdls of 0 01 1 36 ng l for 43 target pfas in qqq compared with 0 06 5 23 ng l in orbitrap table s7 also the measured qqq concentrations of the target pfas unidentified by orbitrap were close to or lower than their mdls in orbitrap additionally the quantified concentrations of 10 target pfas and 7 nontarget pfas with newly purchased authentic standards i e mefbsa fbsa fhxsa fosa 6 2 cl pfesa pfechs and bistriflimide in the river water samples were similar between orbitrap and qqq pearson s r 0 941 p 0 001 fig 2b although some data points showed variations by factors of 2 10 the complex matrix of real samples influences the efficiency of molecular ionization and precursor product ion transitions resulting in variations in the quantified concentrations between orbitrap and qqq especially for the pfas with low abundances finally we used qqq for the quantification of the pfas with authentic standards due to its potentially high sensitivity for the pfas with relatively low concentrations especially 3 pfas i e 8 2 ftsa 6 2 ftuca and 8 2 ftuca unidentified by orbitrap random forest a machine learning algorithm was used to develop a model to predict the rfs of 13 nontarget pfas based on their physicochemical properties abrahamsson et al 2020 random forest has demonstrated advantages in developing predictive models because it can unravel the complex relationships between rfs and chemical properties by automatically learning patterns from a large amount of data with a set of input features liigand et al 2020 compared to traditional semi quantification approach that selected a target pfas based on molecular structure or retention time random forest regression model uses multiple molecular descriptors of chemicals and consequently shows good prediction stability and accuracy the developed random forest model illustrated a relatively great performance with 2d autocorrelation descriptors as the most critical features table s13 specifically when comparing measured with predicated logrf the random forest regression model presented r2 and rmse of 0 959 and 0 126 in the training set and 0 912 and 0 128 in the test set fig 2c the prediction errors of rfs ranged in 1 0 2 7 median of 1 1 and 1 0 2 5 1 1 for the training set and test set respectively fig 2d and table s14 suggesting the differences of up to 2 7 times between measured and predicted rfs relatively large prediction errors 1 5 were observed for 6 2 cl pfesa pfopa pfba 3 3 ftca and mefbsa which all had the maximum or minimum values in at least one feature table s8 6 2 cl pfesa as an ether sulfonate and mefbsa as a n methyl sulfonamide also showed great differences in their molecular structures from other pfas in comparison the ratio of the maximum to minimum measured rf for each class of pfas ranged from 1 2 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids pfpias to 10 0 pfcas in orbitrap and from 1 7 pfsas to 22 3 pfcas in qqq fig 2e and 2f this result indicated the potential for high inaccuracy when using pfas with authentic standards for quantifying nontarget pfas without authentic standards in the same class certainly the ratio of the maximum to minimum measured rfs is related to the number of pfas in each class 3 homologues for pfpas ftucas dipaps or pfpias and 13 homologues for pfcas table s2 thereinto pfcas had the most members which likely resulted in the relatively large differences in structure and property and thus great variation in rfs the concentrations of individual pfas ranged from not detected nd to 32 9 ng l hydrogenated perfluorohexanoic acid h pfhxa in autumn and from nd to 89 9 ng l h pfhxa in spring fig 2g and i pfoa was detected in all samples with concentrations up to 14 9 ng l in autumn and 12 1 ng l in spring except for pfcas we observed all other pfas with detection frequencies less than 40 and mainly detected at the downstream sites the predominant pfsa homologues were pfos nd 6 02 ng l in autumn and nd 11 8 ng l in spring and its alternative pfbs nd 21 0 ng l in autumn and nd 2 40 ng l in spring the concentrations of most emerging pfas generally exhibited 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than legacy pfas such as pfoa pfos and pfbs except h pfhxa bistriflimide and 6 2 ftca with concentrations up to 89 9 28 9 and 13 4 ng l respectively furthermore we observed apparent spatial variations of pfas concentrations and profiles fig 2g j the downstream sites exhibited higher pfas summed concentrations pfas and more diverse pfas profiles relative to the upstream sites illustrated by the strong positive correlation of pfas and the total number of identified pfas r 0 940 p 0 001 in autumn and r 0 951 p 0 001 in spring this may be attributed to the influence of wastewater treatment plant wwtps on the downstream fig s1 and the stringent pollution mitigation strategies e g collection and treatment of rural garbage and wastewater bans of animal agriculture and construction of wetlands implemented on the upstream to ensure the water quality of miyun reservoir hu et al 2022 notably two reservoirs r10 and r13 had relatively high concentrations pfas up to 10 3 and 36 7 ng l respectively this was likely because r10 is a resort with ski field and aquatic center project and r13 locates at the downstream closed to cb2 linear and branched isomers were detected for pfos and fosa figs s5 and s8 with relatively high concentrations at the downstream sites which may be derived from the industry parks automobile manufacturing and food manufacturing packaging companies located in the urban area cai et al 2022 h pfcas were only detected at the downstream sampling sites i e t16 t18 cb1 cb4 and r13 indicating the influence of wwtp effluents fig s1 this was in line with that h pfcas have been found as the most abundant pfas in wwtps effluents of beijing with total concentrations of 1000 ng l wang et al 2020 the concentrations of pfechs 0 92 and 0 78 ng l were elevated evidently at t18 downstream of beijing international airport indicating the influence of airport pfechs is mainly used as an anticorrosive agent and erosion inhibitor in aircraft hydraulic fluids and has been reported in crucian carps of a river located in the downstream of beijing international airport wang et al 2016 it was found that some pfas co occurred with their transformation products such as fluorotelomer based compounds and pfcas pfcas and h pfcas and fasas and pfsas specifically 6 2 ftca and pfhxa co occurred in 24 samples pfcas and h pfcas were both detected at the downstream sites i e t16 t18 cb1 cb4 and r13 and the corresponding fasas and pfsas were both identified at the downstream sites and r10 3 3 risk based prioritization to identify the pfas with high risk we for the first time developed a risk based prioritization model which incorporated 18 pbt attributes and environmental exposure of pfas different from general pfas risk assessment based on only ecotoxicological or human health effects brown et al 2020 ojo et al 2021 multiple hazard properties were included in this prioritization model we identified 9 out of 33 pfas as pbt substances fig s16 and fosa had the highest hazards followed by obs according to the toxpi score fig 3 a for persistence we found that all identified pfas except h pfba met three criteria of biowin 1 0 5 biowin 3 2 25 and biowin 5 0 5 with the highest persistence for obs indicating their property of extremely persistence for bioaccumulation 11 pfas fulfilled the criteria of bcf 2000 l kg with the greatest bioaccumulation for pfda bcf 13 700 l kg table s15 for ecotoxicology only fosa fulfilled the aquatic toxicity criteria of lc50 or ec50 0 1 mg l suggesting its potential toxicity to aquatic organisms for human health effects we found 24 pfas with possible carcinogenicity pfbs with potential developmental toxicity 4 2 and 6 2 cl pfesa with potential hepatotoxicity 4 h pfca homologues with potential skin irritation corrosion and 7 pfas with acute toxicity to human health due to the oral rat ld50 300 mg kg we estimated all the identified pfas without mutagenicity endocrine disrupting effect and eye irritation corrosion moreover we calculated the toxpi scores of 0 07 0 70 for 33 pfas fig 3a and table s16 with the highest toxpi score for fosa score 0 70 rank 1 33 followed by obs score 0 67 rank 2 33 pfas with longer carbon chain length generally had higher toxpi scores pearson s r 0 880 p 0 001 fig s17 mainly attributed to their greater persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity to daphnid and green algae fig s16a for example the interactions of legacy pfcas and pfsas with biological molecules have been linked to fluoroalkyl carbon chain length and also functional group evich et al 2022 vogs et al 2019 the bioaccumulation potentials of long chain pfcas and pfsas in aquatic food webs are greater than those of short chain pfcas burkhard 2021 the pfsas with longer carbon chain length showed greater toxicity to soil microorganisms cai et al 2019 and higher developmental neurotoxicity to zebrafish gaballah et al 2020 two emerging pfas i e obs and 6 2 cl pfesa presented higher hazards compared to their predecessor tu et al 2019 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 for example obs as a high volume alternative to pfos had higher hazard than pfos toxpi score 0 54 rank 9 33 another pfos alternative 6 2 cl pfesa also showed slightly higher hazard toxpi score 0 61 rank 5 33 relative to pfos previous studies zhang et al 2018 documented stronger hepatotoxicity of 6 2 cl pfesa relative to its predecessor pfos our study prioritized 4 pfas with high priority in the chaobai river water through exposure assessment on df and concentration magnitude we calculated exposure values of 0 0 17 for 33 pfas and found 11 pfas i e pfoa h pfhxa bistriflimide 6 2 ftca pfbs pfos pfhxa mefbsaa hydrogenated perfluoroheptanoic acid h pfhpa pfhpa and hydrogenated perfluoropentanoic acid h pfpea with exposure value 0 01 fig 3b these 11 pfas included the ubiquitous pfas e g pfoa as well as the site specific pfas with high concentrations e g h pfhxa and bistriflimide to prioritize pfas in our river water samples we obtained the risk index of 0 0 51 for 33 pfas fig 3c and table s16 with the highest priority for pfoa due to its toxpi score of 0 51 and normalized exposure value of 1 00 four pfas i e pfoa h pfhxa bistriflimide and 6 2 ftca had a risk index 0 1 and were flagged with high priority the priority pfas list included legacy pfoa due to its high exposure and high hazard fig 3d additionally there were ten pfas i e pfos pfhpa h pfhpa pfhxa mefbsaa obs pfna pfbs h pfda and h pfpea classified with medium priority with the gradual phase out of legacy pfoa and pfos their short chain replacements e g pfhxa pfhpa and pfbs have been reported with an elevated trend in the environments barrett et al 2021 wang et al 2021b 4 conclusions the environmental fate and risks of pfas could be highly underestimated due to the focus on their small fraction during environmental scrutiny and few considerations of their specific properties during risk assessments our study developed a comprehensive identification quantification and prioritization approach to prioritize the pfas with high risk in surface waters for remediation and management purposes based on qqq under mrm and orbitrap under full ms dd ms2 top 3 we identified 33 pfas in surface waters in the chaobai river through target suspect and nontarget screening including 13 target 7 nontarget pfas confirmed by newly obtained authentic standards and 13 nontarget pfas relative to qqq under mrm orbitrap full scan had relatively higher mdls and would likely miss some peaks with low intensity resulting in the false negatives when quantifying pfas with authentic standards to quantify the nontarget pfas without authentic standards we developed a random forest regression model using molecular descriptors retention time and rfs of 50 pfas with authentic standards in orbitrap which illustrated the differences up to only 2 7 times between measured and predicted rf we suggested the rf prediction by machine learning algorithms as a feasible approach for accurately quantifying the nontarget pfas without authentic standards in comparison the maximum to minimum rf ratio varied greatly in each pfas class 1 2 10 0 in orbitrap and 1 7 22 3 in qqq which indicated the potential of high inaccuracy when using the pfas in the same class for semi quantitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14955,though thousands of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been on the global market most research focused on only a small fraction potentially resulting in underestimated environmental risks here we used complementary target suspect and nontarget screening for quantifying and identifying the target and nontarget pfas respectively and developed a risk model considering their specific properties to prioritize the pfas in surface waters thirty three pfas were identified in surface water in the chaobai river beijing the suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap displayed a sensitivity of 77 indicating its good performance in identifying the pfas in samples we used triple quadrupole qqq under multiple reaction monitoring for quantifying pfas with authentic standards due to its potentially high sensitivity to quantify the nontarget pfas without authentic standards we trained a random forest regression model which presented the differences up to only 2 7 times between measured and predicted response factors rfs the maximum minimum rf in each pfas class was as high as 1 2 10 0 in orbitrap and 1 7 22 3 in qqq a risk based prioritization approach was developed to rank the identified pfas and four pfas i e perfluorooctanoic acid hydrogenated perfluorohexanoic acid bistriflimide 6 2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid were flagged with high priority risk index 0 1 for remediation and management our study highlighted the importance of a quantification strategy during environmental scrutiny of pfas especially for nontarget pfas without standards graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances triple quadrupole orbitrap surface water random forest regression risk prioritization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a ubiquitous class of synthetic chemicals with extremely high thermal and chemical stability and have drawn increasing concerns due to their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity pbt barrett et al 2021 chu and letcher 2014 though more than 4700 pfas are or have been on the global market wang et al 2021c most research focused on only a small fraction of these pfas barrett et al 2021 chen et al 2020 wang et al 2018 evaluating the pfas risks by including their majority will help to estimate their environmental fate and risks which could be underestimated based on a small fraction of pfas koelmel et al 2022 wang et al 2021b quantitative target analysis of pfas is commonly conducted by acquiring the tandem mass spectrometry ms ms data through their precursor product ion transitions with high selectivity and sensitivity de silva et al 2021 jia et al 2022 high resolution ms hrms such as orbitrap and quadrupole time of flight qtof mass spectrometers has emerged as a powerful tool to identify the unknown chemicals due to its wide mass range high quality resolution and accurate masses barzen hanson et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 nontarget screening by hrms is increasingly used to complement to traditional target analysis for the discovery of unknown pfas in various environmental samples liu et al 2019 wang et al 2021b 2020 young et al 2022 jacob et al 2021a used nontarget screening on full scan ms data coupled with data dependent ms ms data in q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap ms and found the presence of 41 homologous series of pfas comprising 133 homologues in wastewater of three electronics fabrication facilities though target pfas can be quantified by either ms ms under mrm or full scan ms the standard availability limited the quantification of unknown pfas many efforts have been made to quantify the nontarget pfas without authentic standards jacob et al 2021a munoz et al 2022 wang et al 2020 most of the quantification methods were matching nontarget pfas to target pfas based on structural similarity e g functional group or perfluorinated chain length or proximity of retention time resulting in high variations and uncertainty jacob et al 2021a kruve 2020 predicting the response factor or ionization efficiency has emerged as a robust tool to quantify the identified nontarget chemicals kruve 2020 palm and kruve 2022 considering the potential number of pfas existing in the aquatic environments the pfas prioritization based on the principles of risk assessment is critical for remediation and management purposes in general the risk is reflected by multiplying the exposure of a chemical with its hazard gaston et al 2019 it is comprised of ecotoxicological risk based on dose response data short term or long term toxicity for aquatic organisms and health risks based on tolerable daily intakes or oral reference doses for human brown et al 2020 ojo et al 2021 however specific toxicological properties i e mutagenicity carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity which were frequently reported on pfas evich et al 2022 ojo et al 2021 were rarely included in human health risk assessment besides several pfas e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorononanoic acid pfna have been identified as the pbt persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity substances under registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach https echa europa eu pbt therefore it is critical to develop a comprehensive risk prioritization approach for pfas in the aquatic environments by including these specific properties evich et al 2022 which is still missing the objective of this study is to prioritize the pfas with high risk in surface waters by identifying and quantifying the target and nontarget pfas and considering their specific properties in the risk modeling specifically we used 1 orbitrap for identifying the nontarget pfas through the suspect screening and homologue and fragment based nontarget screening workflow and 2 qqq for quantifying the pfas with authentic standards the identified nontarget pfas without authentic standards were quantified using their response factors predicted by a random forest regression model we finally developed a risk based prioritization approach by integrating hazard effects reflected by the toxpi score incorporation of 18 pbt attributes with environmental exposure to rank the identified pfas in surface waters this study integrated the identification of target and nontarget pfas with a comprehensive risk modeling to prioritize the pfas with high risk in surface waters our results highlight that the quantification of nontarget pfas is essential for bridging the gaps between pfas discovery and risk assessment 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection preparation and analysis we collected surface water samples n 90 in 2 l pre rinsed polypropylene bottles in september 2020 autumn and april 2021 spring from 45 routine monitoring stations of the chaobai river beijing fig s1 and table s1 the collected water samples were stored at 4 c and extracted in 48 h using the routine solid phase extraction method cai et al 2022 li et al 2020a briefly 2 l filtered water samples spiked with 50 ng isotope labeled internal standards iliss were extracted by oasis wax cartridges 6 ml 500 mg waters us preconditioned by 10 ml methanol with 0 1 nh4oh and 10 ml water then the cartridge was washed with 25 mm ammonium acetate ph 4 and eluted with 10 ml 0 1 nh4oh in methanol the eluent was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 1 ml methanol this extraction procedure was conducted in duplicate for each water sample procedural blanks were performed simultaneously using ultrapure water finally the extracted samples with pfas in methanol were stored in polypropylene vials at 20 c before instrumental analysis to identify and semi quantify pfas through suspect and nontarget screening the extracted samples were analyzed by an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography interfaced to a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific san jose ca us under the full ms dd ms2 top 3 mode to identify and quantify target pfas the extracted samples were analyzed by an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometer tsq endura thermo fisher scientific san jose ca us using mrm in negative electrospray ionization mode esi which mainly focused on anionic pfas detailed information is provided in the si section 1 for target pfas and iliss si section 2 for instrument analysis and si section 3 for quality assurance and quality control qaqc 2 2 suspect and nontarget screening to identify the nontarget pfas that were not included in target analysis we developed a suspect and nontarget screening workflow involving data preprocessing selection of pfas candidates and structure identification fig 1 a using compound discover 3 2 thermo fisher scientific san jose ca us we performed data preprocessing of orbitrap raw data including peak picking retention time alignment grouping of peaks across files and background subtraction which generated a peak list with the information of apex mass corrected retention time and max intensity for suspect screening firstly we compiled a suspect list comprised of 7676 ms ready pfas with exact neutral mass and structure by combining 9252 pfas in the pfas master list of pfas substances accessed may 13th 2021 from the united states environmental protection agency us epa comptox chemistry dashboard and 1030 pfas from norman suspect list exchange with the removal of duplicates metal ions salts isotopes and mixtures liu et al 2019 yukioka et al 2020 through the function of search mass lists in compound discover 3 2 we identified the positive hits by matching the peak list with this suspect list using the criteria of mass tolerance 5 ppm for nontarget screening we filtered peaks with cf2 adjusted kendrick mass defect kmd 0 85 or 0 15 barzen hanson et al 2017 jacob et al 2021a and searched pfas homologue series with the units of cf2 c2f4 cf2o cf2ch2 and c2f4o using the nontarget r package jacob et al 2021a mccord et al 2020 wang et al 2018 the peaks were further filtered when we did not observe an ascending trend of retention time versus m z of each homologue series after removing duplicates and checking peak shape the peaks with positive hits from suspect screening and the filtered peaks from nontarget screening were labeled as pfas candidates when having isotopic pattern fit 80 to identify pfas candidates structures the predicted molecular formula was determined with the criteria of 1 maximum element counts c50h50f50o12s4n4p4 2 ring double bond equivalents rdbe 0 5 3 isotopic fit threshold 80 and 4 mass tolerance 5 ppm using the function of predict compositions in compound discover 3 2 when having pfas candidates without ms ms spectra we reinjected the samples into orbitrap after adding m z of these pfas to the inclusion list with the help of previous literature mass spectral database e g mzcloud and massbank and in silico fragmentation tools e g cfm id wang et al 2021a and mass frontier the structures of pfas candidates were interpreted based on their ms ms spectra such as the diagnostic fragments jacob et al 2021a wang et al 2020 pfas candidates with interpreted structures were labeled as identified pfas we further checked the identified pfas with similar retention time or chromatograms to exclude the in source fragmentation kang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 finally we assigned confidence level 1 3 with level 1 having the highest reliability to the identified pfas according to charbonnet et al 2022 river water samples and 43 target pfas spiked samples blank spiked with 5 and 10 ng standards were determined to evaluate the performance of suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap jacob et al 2021b selectivity is the ability of suspect and nontarget screening to avoid the identifications of pfas that

target and nontarget pfas for both qqq and orbitrap we performed an internal calibration curve using seven standard samples containing both 43 target pfas and 8 iliss 0 1 0 5 1 5 10 50 and 100 μg l for each target pfas 50 μg l for each ilis r2 0 99 with the method detection limits mdls of 0 01 1 36 ng l for qqq and 0 06 5 23 ng l for orbitrap table s7 we also acquired the authentic standards for 7 nontarget pfas identified in our samples and thus quantified them in qqq under mrm we developed a random forest regression model to quantify the 13 nontarget pfas without authentic standards through the prediction of response factors rfs referring to the slope of the linear regressions of the calibration curve in orbitrap kruve 2020 palm and kruve 2022 the feature dataset included 1450 molecular descriptors from padel descriptor yap 2011 and ufz lser https www ufz de lserd and the retention times of 50 pfas with authentic standards in orbitrap we removed the features with not available value zero variance and high correlation pearson s r 0 8 with 113 features left table s8 the feature dataset and rfs of 50 pfas with authentic standards in orbitrap were randomly split into training and test sets 80 20 for model training and validation we tested eight machine learning regression algorithms for model development including gradient boosting adaboost random forest decision trees k nearest neighbors support vector machines multiple linear regression and ridge regression these models were constructed using functions in the scikit learn package in python and evaluated using 5 fold cross validation random forest regression model constructed by the function of randomforestregressor achieved the best performance and was selected in our study we performed feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of original feature space and had 14 most relevant features for final model development si section 4 the model s performance was evaluated using r2 root mean squared error rmse and prediction error max predicted measured rf measured predicted rf finally the concentrations of nontarget pfas were calculated based on their predicted rfs using the model and peak areas in orbitrap 2 4 risk modeling to rank the identified pfas we developed a risk based prioritization approach according to their potential hazard effects and environmental exposure this approach includes three steps 1 calculating a pbt based score for each identified pfas 2 assessing the exposure by detection frequency and concentration 3 determining pfas prioritization based on their hazard and exposure firstly to estimate the pbt of pfas a total of 18 attributes we used the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models such as epi suite v4 11 ecosar v2 0 t e s t v5 1 1 vega v1 2 0 and qsar toolbox v4 5 si section 5 and table s9 and thus the criteria in reach annex xiii and iii and ghs classification table s10 to rank the pfas hazard we then used pbt to calculate the toxpi score for each pfas in the toxicological priority index toxpi software marvel et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 secondly detection frequency df is the regularity of occurrence and prevalence while magnitude represents the relative intensity of pfas eq 3 gaston et al 2019 the pfas exposure was estimated by multiplying df with concentration magnitude eq 4 which was then normalized within 0 1 eq 5 thirdly we calculated the risk index ri of each pfas by multiplying its toxpi score with normalized exposure eq 6 zhao et al 2021 according to ri we prioritized the pfas into four levels high ri 0 1 medium 0 01 ri 0 1 low 0 001 ri 0 01 and insignificant priority ri 0 001 3 magnitude c i c m i n c m a x c m i n 4 exposure df magnitude 5 exposur e normalized e x p o s u r e i e x p o s u r e m i n e x p o s

the preprocessing of raw data 42 250 peaks were retained after blank subtraction for further suspect and nontarget screening fig 1a we obtained 445 positive hits through suspect screening and 733 pfas homologues through nontarget screening by mass defect filter homologue detection and retention time versus m z filter after removing duplicates and bad shape peaks we obtained 742 peaks for ms ms spectra annotation through further structure elucidation based on diagnostic fragments and false positive check we finally identified 30 pfas in the surface water from the chaobai river figs s3 s12 and table s11 among these 30 pfas 10 pfas were also identified by target analysis and 7 nontarget pfas were further confirmed by newly obtained authentic standards notably two limitations could present in our study 1 analyzing only pfas extracted by a specific spe cartridge oasis wax cartridge and 2 analyzing only pfas which can be ionized under esi this resulted the dominance of anionic pfas and the exclusion of cationic pfas as the identified pfas in our samples these 30 pfas could be grouped into 15 classes fig 1b 1 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas 2 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas 4 fluorotelomer sulfonic acids ftsas 5 hydrogenated pfcas h pfcas 6 perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides fasas 7 n methyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides mefasas

sulfonates h pfesas 12 cyclic pfsas c pfsas 13 oxa unsaturated pfcas o u pfcas 14 p perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate obs and 15 bistriflimide thereinto pfcas pfsas h pfcas and fasas contained 3 homologues cf2 or c2f4 repeating units in each class and were distributed as horizontal lines in the cf2 adjusted kmd plot fig s3a these 4 classes comprising of 17 pfas could be identified by nontarget screening strategy via homologue detection and showed a retention time increasing trend across each homologous series fig s3b legacy pfcas and pfsas five pfca homologues c6 c10 and 3 pfsa homologues c4 c6 and c8 were identified through both suspect and nontarget screening table s11 they were all confirmed by authentic standards based on exact mass retention time and ms ms spectra level 1a for pfcas neutral loss of co2 m z 43 98983 and fragments cnf2n 1 were typically observed in their ms ms spectra fig s4 structures of pfsas were elucidated using the characteristic fragments of m z

isomers the most abundant pfos isomer in samples retention time 8 14 min was identified as linear pfos by comparing retention time and ms ms spectrum with the standard other two peaks eluted at 7 95 and 7 81 min were attributed to the branched pfos isomers fig s5d schulz et al 2020 previous studies have well documented the bioaccumulation of pfcas and pfsas in biota like fish wildlife marine mammals and human barrett et al 2021 ma et al 2022 poothong et al 2017 spaan et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2022 as well as their hepatotoxicity developmental and reproductive toxicity immunotoxicity endocrine disruption and carcinogenicity fenton et al 2021 ojo et al 2021 ftcas and ftsas we detected 6 2 ftca and 6 2 ftsa by suspect screening confirmed by standards level 1a for 6 2 ftca sequential neutral losses of co2 and hf were observed and supported by the presence of characteristic fragment m co2 h2f2 in its ms ms spectrum fig s6a for 6 2 ftsa neutral losses of hf m hf and m h2f2 were also marked in the ms ms spectrum fig s6b and the presence of m z 79 95736 so3 and m z 80 96519 hso3 indicated the sulfonate moiety in its structure 6 2 ftsa is used as surfactants in metal plating substitutes to pfos and 6 2 ftca has been used as an alternative processing acid to pfoa in china shi et al 2017 they are the degradation intermediates of fluorotelomer based surfactants e g 6 2 fluorotelomer alcohol and 6 2 fluorotelomer thio alkyl amido sulfonic acids and can be further degraded to pfcas with shorter carbon chain lengths liu et al 2021 h pfcas we tentatively identified six homologues c4 c8 and c10 in this class through both suspect and nontarget screening unequivocal molecular formulas of 6 homologues were first determined as cnhf2n 2o2 2 9 to 1 3 ppm the most abundant fragments m co2 hf in all the ms ms spectra were attributed to the neutral losses of co2 and hf and thus suggested their identifications as hydrogenated pfcas fig s7 barrett et al 2021 wang et al 2021b yu et al 2020 the identities were further supported by the increasing retention times across 6 homologues and shorter retention times 2 05 7 53 min compared to pfca analogues 6 67 8 64 min figs s4 and s7 likely due to the higher hydrophilicity of h pfcas logk ow 1 83 hydrogenated perfluorobutanoic acid h pfba to 5 84 hydrogenated perfluorodecanoic acid h pfda relative to corresponding pfcas logk ow 2 14 pfba to 6 15 pfda table s11 according to barrett et al 2021 the possible artifact identity was excluded wherein hcnpfcas are likely formed via in source fragmentation of cn 2pfcas by comparing their retention times and chromatograms and checking the correlations of concentrations across all samples fig s7 however we did not determine the exact h substitution position through ms ms spectra and thus identified this class at level 3a h pfcas could transform from pfcas jacob et al 2021a washington et al 2009 and were reported in beluga whales livers barrett et al 2021 however few studies were conducted relevant to their toxicity fasas we identified three fasa homologues i e perfluorobutane sulfonamide fbsa perfluorohexane sulfonamide fhxsa and perfluorooctane sulfonamide fosa through both suspect and nontarget screening the identities were supported by the presence of the diagnostic fragment so2n with m z 77 96552 in all the ms ms spectra and the increased retention time fig s8 also their longer retention times 6 98 9 62 min compared with the corresponding pfsas 6 08 8 10 min agreed with their higher logk ow values 3 13 5 80 than pfsas 1 82 4 49 which increased the confidence level of identifications finally the structures of 3 homologues were proposed and confirmed by authentic standards with level 1a fasas are used as raw material for surfactants and surface protection products and also reported as the biodegradation products of sulfonamide containing substances e g n alkyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido ethanols or acids and as the precursors of pfsas and pfcas chu and letcher 2014 rhoads et al 2008 schaefer et al 2018 supporting this we found that the identified pfsas and fasas both had 4 6 and 8 c atoms in their structures and a branched fosa was also found in its chromatogram fig s8a similar to pfos fig s5d though they can be biodegraded to corresponding pfsas fasas are relatively stable and were frequently found in wildlife and human samples barrett et al 2021 spaan et al 2020 wang et al 2021b and fosa was reported to display higher liver concentrations than pfos in beluga whales from alaska reiner et al 2011 and melon headed whales from japan hart et al 2008 mefasas and mefasaas here only n methyl perfluorobutane sulfonamide mefbsa and n methyl perfluorobutane sulfonamido acetic acid mefbsaa were identified by suspect screening for mefbsa c4f9 m z 218 98618 was the most abundant fragment in ms ms spectrum and the identity was confirmed by authentic standard level 1a fig s9a fragments so2f m z 82 96085 c4f9 m z 218 98618 c4f9so2 m z 282 94808 and c5h3f9no2s m z 311 97463 were found in ms ms spectrum of mefbsaa level 2a fig s9b newton et al 2017 wang et al 2020 its identification was further supported by reasonable order of retention times mefbsa 7 94 min mefbsaa 6 87 min perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs 6 08 min in line with the order of calculated logk ow values mefbsa 3 59 mefbsaa 3 06 pfbs 1 82 table s11 these two compounds have been documented as the intermediate transformation products of n methyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido ethanols mefbse rhoads et al 2008 which was not detected in this study and they can be subsequently biotransformed to fbsa pfsias two homologues i e perfluorobutane sulfinate pfbsi and perfluorooctane sulfinate pfosi were tentatively identified by suspect screening the characteristic fragments so2f m z 82 96085 and cnf2n 1 in their ms ms spectra fig s9c and s9d supported the identities of levels 2b and 2c respectively munoz et al 2022 they have been detected in organic waste products for land application munoz et al 2022 and aqueous film forming foams afffs impacted groundwater barzen hanson et al 2017 they can be derived from the degradation of commercial products containing perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido substances e g fasas and also subsequently transform to pfsas and pfcas rhoads et al 2008 cl pfesas and h pfesas we identified 6 2 cl pfesa a well known successor of pfos which has been used in chrome planting industry in china for over 30 years wang et al 2013 and another homologue i e 4 2 cl pfesa the identities were supported by the isotopic pattern m h m h 2 3 1 in the ms spectra and the characteristic fragments m c2f4so3 in the ms ms spectra fig s10a the identity of 6 2 cl pfesa was confirmed by authentic standard level 1a and thus the identity of 4 2 cl pfesa was assigned with level 2c in addition we detected 6 2 h pfesa level 2b a hydrogenated analogue of 6 2 cl pfesa with fragments m c2f4so3 m c2f4so3 hf and m c2f4so3 hf cf2o in its ms ms spectrum fig s10c wang et al 2013 2020 since the first report of 6 2 cl pfesa in 2013 wang et al 2013 many studies barrett et al 2021 shi et al 2015 spaan et al 2020 wang et al 2021b documented its bioaccumulation developmental toxicity hepatotoxicity acute metabolic effects and associations with health effects and illustrated the comparable and even stronger toxicity of 6 2 cl pfesa relative to pfos 6 2 h pfesa was noted as the reductive dichlorination product of 6 2 cl pfesa under anoxic conditions lin et al 2017 and in biota yi et al 2022 2020 with unclear toxicity other emerging pfas we identified other four emerging pfas i e perfluoroethylenecyclohexanesulfonate pfechs o u pfoa obs and bistriflimide pfechs was identified using the exact mass 460 93319 0 5 ppm unequivocal molecular formula c8f15o3s and characteristic fragments so3f c2f5 and c8f15 in its ms ms spectrum fig s11 compared with the previous studies wang et al 2021b 2016 this evidence supported the identity as pfechs rather than an unsaturated pfos due to the absence of a series of cnf2n 1 mcdonough et al 2021 finally using authentic standard we confirmed the identity of level 1b due to the uncertainty on the exact positions of sulfonate and perfluoroethyl fig s11 another cyclic pfos isomer perfluoropropylcyclopentanesulfonate pfpcpes was tentatively identified and distinct from pfechs due to the different retention time and the c3f7 presence niu et al 2019 reported the growth inhibition of 8 07 and 51 85 for 10 ng l and 1000 ng l pfechs respectively on marine chlorella sp at 14 d o u pfoa was tentatively identified at level 2b due to the characteristic fragments c2f5o c3f5o c5f9 and c6f11 in its ms ms spectrum fig s12a barzen hanson et al 2017 wang et al 2018 it has been detected in afffs barzen hanson et al 2017 and wastewater from a fluorochemical manufacturing park wang et al 2018 obs was tentatively identified at level 2b due to the characteristic fragments c6h4o4s c11h4o3f7s and c13h4o4f11s in its ms ms spectrum fig s12b wang et al 2020 xu et al 2017 as an alternative to pfos obs is extensively used as additive and surfactant in oil production and afffs with estimated production of about 3500 tons in china in 2017 bao et al 2017 it illustrated the gut barrier dysfunction and hepatotoxicity to maternal mice wang et al 2022 2019 and was found in fish marine mammals and maternal and umbilical cord blood serum li et al 2020b shi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b we detected bistriflimide a polyfluorinated sulfonimide dimer fig s13 the peak with m z 279 91685 at 4 16 min in several samples has considerable intensity compared to pfoa and pfos its molecular formula was preliminarily determined as c2f6no4s2 top ranked by searching it within database 10 structures were retrieved among them bistriflimide cas 82113 65 3 had the most patents 7585 items in pubchem and references 284 items in chemspider indicating its environmental presence with high possibility manual interpretation of the experimental ms ms spectrum supported this identity fig s13 moreover this identity was confirmed by comparing retention time and ms ms spectrum with its standard level 1a this compound is widely used in organic synthesis and as an anion of ion liquids zhao and sun 2018 and was listed as a dangerous chemical of category 3 with relatively high acute toxicity for dosed rats https echa europa eu registration dossier registered dossier 8988 7 3 2 it was found as a xenobiotic in human blood and included in an exposome chemical database barupal and fiehn 2019 and its long chain homologues were identified in mice dosed with afffs mcdonough et al 2020 3 2 pfas quantification combining target suspect and nontarget screening we identified 33 pfas in river water samples including 13 target pfas 7 nontarget pfas confirmed by newly obtained authentic standards and 13 nontarget pfas among the 13 target pfas 3 pfas i e 8 2 ftsa 6 2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid ftuca and 8 2 ftuca were not identified by the suspect and nontarget screening fig s13 therefore according to eq 1 the sensitivity of the suspect and nontarget screening was 77 10 13 fig 2a however all the 10 target pfas identified by the suspect and nontarget screening were also identified by target analysis thus according to eq 2 the suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap had 100 selectivity for 43 target pfas in river water samples fig 2a specifically low sensitivity of 50 was observed in the individual river water samples with relatively low pfas concentrations fig s15 and table s12 10 ng l similarly we found that suspect and nontarget screening had 100 selectivity and 93 sensitivity for target pfas in spiked samples specifically we found the sensitivity of 93 40 43 and 100 43 43 for the 5 ng and 10 ng spiked samples respectively there were 3 pfas i e perfluorohexylphosphonic acid perfluorooctylphosphonic acid pfopa and 6 cloroperfluorohexylphosphonic acid in the 5 ng spiked samples unidentified by the suspect and nontarget screening the absence of unidentified target pfas in river water and spiked samples were confirmed by checking the orbitrap raw data and thus excluded they were lost during suspect and nontarget screening workflow compared to target analysis by qqq under mrm suspect and nontarget screening by orbitrap under full ms dd ms2 top 3 would likely miss these peaks with low intensity during instrument analysis and result in the false negatives it is confirmed by the relatively lower mdls of 0 01 1 36 ng l for 43 target pfas in qqq compared with 0 06 5 23 ng l in orbitrap table s7 also the measured qqq concentrations of the target pfas unidentified by orbitrap were close to or lower than their mdls in orbitrap additionally the quantified concentrations of 10 target pfas and 7 nontarget pfas with newly purchased authentic standards i e mefbsa fbsa fhxsa fosa 6 2 cl pfesa pfechs and bistriflimide in the river water samples were similar between orbitrap and qqq pearson s r 0 941 p 0 001 fig 2b although some data points showed variations by factors of 2 10 the complex matrix of real samples influences the efficiency of molecular ionization and precursor product ion transitions resulting in variations in the quantified concentrations between orbitrap and qqq especially for the pfas with low abundances finally we used qqq for the quantification of the pfas with authentic standards due to its potentially high sensitivity for the pfas with relatively low concentrations especially 3 pfas i e 8 2 ftsa 6 2 ftuca and 8 2 ftuca unidentified by orbitrap random forest a machine learning algorithm was used to develop a model to predict the rfs of 13 nontarget pfas based on their physicochemical properties abrahamsson et al 2020 random forest has demonstrated advantages in developing predictive models because it can unravel the complex relationships between rfs and chemical properties by automatically learning patterns from a large amount of data with a set of input features liigand et al 2020 compared to traditional semi quantification approach that selected a target pfas based on molecular structure or retention time random forest regression model uses multiple molecular descriptors of chemicals and consequently shows good prediction stability and accuracy the developed random forest model illustrated a relatively great performance with 2d autocorrelation descriptors as the most critical features table s13 specifically when comparing measured with predicated logrf the random forest regression model presented r2 and rmse of 0 959 and 0 126 in the training set and 0 912 and 0 128 in the test set fig 2c the prediction errors of rfs ranged in 1 0 2 7 median of 1 1 and 1 0 2 5 1 1 for the training set and test set respectively fig 2d and table s14 suggesting the differences of up to 2 7 times between measured and predicted rfs relatively large prediction errors 1 5 were observed for 6 2 cl pfesa pfopa pfba 3 3 ftca and mefbsa which all had the maximum or minimum values in at least one feature table s8 6 2 cl pfesa as an ether sulfonate and mefbsa as a n methyl sulfonamide also showed great differences in their molecular structures from other pfas in comparison the ratio of the maximum to minimum measured rf for each class of pfas ranged from 1 2 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids pfpias to 10 0 pfcas in orbitrap and from 1 7 pfsas to 22 3 pfcas in qqq fig 2e and 2f this result indicated the potential for high inaccuracy when using pfas with authentic standards for quantifying nontarget pfas without authentic standards in the same class certainly the ratio of the maximum to minimum measured rfs is related to the number of pfas in each class 3 homologues for pfpas ftucas dipaps or pfpias and 13 homologues for pfcas table s2 thereinto pfcas had the most members which likely resulted in the relatively large differences in structure and property and thus great variation in rfs the concentrations of individual pfas ranged from not detected nd to 32 9 ng l hydrogenated perfluorohexanoic acid h pfhxa in autumn and from nd to 89 9 ng l h pfhxa in spring fig 2g and i pfoa was detected in all samples with concentrations up to 14 9 ng l in autumn and 12 1 ng l in spring except for pfcas we observed all other pfas with detection frequencies less than 40 and mainly detected at the downstream sites the predominant pfsa homologues were pfos nd 6 02 ng l in autumn and nd 11 8 ng l in spring and its alternative pfbs nd 21 0 ng l in autumn and nd 2 40 ng l in spring the concentrations of most emerging pfas generally exhibited 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than legacy pfas such as pfoa pfos and pfbs except h pfhxa bistriflimide and 6 2 ftca with concentrations up to 89 9 28 9 and 13 4 ng l respectively furthermore we observed apparent spatial variations of pfas concentrations and profiles fig 2g j the downstream sites exhibited higher pfas summed concentrations pfas and more diverse pfas profiles relative to the upstream sites illustrated by the strong positive correlation of pfas and the total number of identified pfas r 0 940 p 0 001 in autumn and r 0 951 p 0 001 in spring this may be attributed to the influence of wastewater treatment plant wwtps on the downstream fig s1 and the stringent pollution mitigation strategies e g collection and treatment of rural garbage and wastewater bans of animal agriculture and construction of wetlands implemented on the upstream to ensure the water quality of miyun reservoir hu et al 2022 notably two reservoirs r10 and r13 had relatively high concentrations pfas up to 10 3 and 36 7 ng l respectively this was likely because r10 is a resort with ski field and aquatic center project and r13 locates at the downstream closed to cb2 linear and branched isomers were detected for pfos and fosa figs s5 and s8 with relatively high concentrations at the downstream sites which may be derived from the industry parks automobile manufacturing and food manufacturing packaging companies located in the urban area cai et al 2022 h pfcas were only detected at the downstream sampling sites i e t16 t18 cb1 cb4 and r13 indicating the influence of wwtp effluents fig s1 this was in line with that h pfcas have been found as the most abundant pfas in wwtps effluents of beijing with total concentrations of 1000 ng l wang et al 2020 the concentrations of pfechs 0 92 and 0 78 ng l were elevated evidently at t18 downstream of beijing international airport indicating the influence of airport pfechs is mainly used as an anticorrosive agent and erosion inhibitor in aircraft hydraulic fluids and has been reported in crucian carps of a river located in the downstream of beijing international airport wang et al 2016 it was found that some pfas co occurred with their transformation products such as fluorotelomer based compounds and pfcas pfcas and h pfcas and fasas and pfsas specifically 6 2 ftca and pfhxa co occurred in 24 samples pfcas and h pfcas were both detected at the downstream sites i e t16 t18 cb1 cb4 and r13 and the corresponding fasas and pfsas were both identified at the downstream sites and r10 3 3 risk based prioritization to identify the pfas with high risk we for the first time developed a risk based prioritization model which incorporated 18 pbt attributes and environmental exposure of pfas different from general pfas risk assessment based on only ecotoxicological or human health effects brown et al 2020 ojo et al 2021 multiple hazard properties were included in this prioritization model we identified 9 out of 33 pfas as pbt substances fig s16 and fosa had the highest hazards followed by obs according to the toxpi score fig 3 a for persistence we found that all identified pfas except h pfba met three criteria of biowin 1 0 5 biowin 3 2 25 and biowin 5 0 5 with the highest persistence for obs indicating their property of extremely persistence for bioaccumulation 11 pfas fulfilled the criteria of bcf 2000 l kg with the greatest bioaccumulation for pfda bcf 13 700 l kg table s15 for ecotoxicology only fosa fulfilled the aquatic toxicity criteria of lc50 or ec50 0 1 mg l suggesting its potential toxicity to aquatic organisms for human health effects we found 24 pfas with possible carcinogenicity pfbs with potential developmental toxicity 4 2 and 6 2 cl pfesa with potential hepatotoxicity 4 h pfca homologues with potential skin irritation corrosion and 7 pfas with acute toxicity to human health due to the oral rat ld50 300 mg kg we estimated all the identified pfas without mutagenicity endocrine disrupting effect and eye irritation corrosion moreover we calculated the toxpi scores of 0 07 0 70 for 33 pfas fig 3a and table s16 with the highest toxpi score for fosa score 0 70 rank 1 33 followed by obs score 0 67 rank 2 33 pfas with longer carbon chain length generally had higher toxpi scores pearson s r 0 880 p 0 001 fig s17 mainly attributed to their greater persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity to daphnid and green algae fig s16a for example the interactions of legacy pfcas and pfsas with biological molecules have been linked to fluoroalkyl carbon chain length and also functional group evich et al 2022 vogs et al 2019 the bioaccumulation potentials of long chain pfcas and pfsas in aquatic food webs are greater than those of short chain pfcas burkhard 2021 the pfsas with longer carbon chain length showed greater toxicity to soil microorganisms cai et al 2019 and higher developmental neurotoxicity to zebrafish gaballah et al 2020 two emerging pfas i e obs and 6 2 cl pfesa presented higher hazards compared to their predecessor tu et al 2019 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 for example obs as a high volume alternative to pfos had higher hazard than pfos toxpi score 0 54 rank 9 33 another pfos alternative 6 2 cl pfesa also showed slightly higher hazard toxpi score 0 61 rank 5 33 relative to pfos previous studies zhang et al 2018 documented stronger hepatotoxicity of 6 2 cl pfesa relative to its predecessor pfos our study prioritized 4 pfas with high priority in the chaobai river water through exposure assessment on df and concentration magnitude we calculated exposure values of 0 0 17 for 33 pfas and found 11 pfas i e pfoa h pfhxa bistriflimide 6 2 ftca pfbs pfos pfhxa mefbsaa hydrogenated perfluoroheptanoic acid h pfhpa pfhpa and hydrogenated perfluoropentanoic acid h pfpea with exposure value 0 01 fig 3b these 11 pfas included the ubiquitous pfas e g pfoa as well as the site specific pfas with high concentrations e g h pfhxa and bistriflimide to prioritize pfas in our river water samples we obtained the risk index of 0 0 51 for 33 pfas fig 3c and table s16 with the highest priority for pfoa due to its toxpi score of 0 51 and normalized exposure value of 1 00 four pfas i e pfoa h pfhxa bistriflimide and 6 2 ftca had a risk index 0 1 and were flagged with high priority the priority pfas list included legacy pfoa due to its high exposure and high hazard fig 3d additionally there were ten pfas i e pfos pfhpa h pfhpa pfhxa mefbsaa obs pfna pfbs h pfda and h pfpea classified with medium priority with the gradual phase out of legacy pfoa and pfos their short chain replacements e g pfhxa pfhpa and pfbs have been reported with an elevated trend in the environments barrett et al 2021 wang et al 2021b 4 conclusions the environmental fate and risks of pfas could be highly underestimated due to the focus on their small fraction during environmental scrutiny and few considerations of their specific properties during risk assessments our study developed a comprehensive identification quantification and prioritization approach to prioritize the pfas with high risk in surface waters for remediation and management purposes based on qqq under mrm and orbitrap under full ms dd ms2 top 3 we identified 33 pfas in surface waters in the chaobai river through target suspect and nontarget screening including 13 target 7 nontarget pfas confirmed by newly obtained authentic standards and 13 nontarget pfas relative to qqq under mrm orbitrap full scan had relatively higher mdls and would likely miss some peaks with low intensity resulting in the false negatives when quantifying pfas with authentic standards to quantify the nontarget pfas without authentic standards we developed a random forest regression model using molecular descriptors retention time and rfs of 50 pfas with authentic standards in orbitrap which illustrated the differences up to only 2 7 times between measured and predicted rf we suggested the rf prediction by machine learning algorithms as a feasible approach for accurately quantifying the nontarget pfas without authentic standards in comparison the maximum to minimum rf ratio varied greatly in each pfas class 1 2 10 0 in orbitrap and 1 7 22 3 in qqq which indicated the potential of high inaccuracy when using the pfas in the same class for semi quantitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14956,biofilms are an efficient way to underpin the biological process of wastewater treatment however little is known about the driving forces of biofilm formation and development in industrial settings long term observation of anammox biofilms indicated the interplay between different microhabitats biofilm aggregate plankton was important in sustaining biofilm formation sourcetracker analysis showed that 88 77 2 26 of initial biofilm originated from the aggregate however independent evolution was led by anammox species in the later stage 182d and 245d noticeably the source proportion of aggregate and plankton increased when temperature varied suggesting an interchange of species between different microhabitats could be helpful to biofilm recovery the microbial interaction pattern and community variation displayed similar trends but the unknown source proportion of interaction was very high during the entire incubation 7 245d thereby the same species may develop different relationships within the distinct microhabitats the core phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidota accounted for 80 of interactions in all lifestyles which is consistent with the fact that bacteroidota played important role in the early stage of biofilm assembly although anammox species evolved few links with other otus candidatus brocadiaceae still outcompeted the ns9 marine group to dominate the homogeneous selection process in the later stage 56 245d of biofilm assembly implying that the functional species may be decoupled from the core species in the microbial network the conclusions will shed a light on the understanding of biofilm development in large scale biosystems of wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox biofilm assembly microbial network wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the anammox cored process is commonly considered as one of most energy efficient environmental biotechnology for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater and as such anammox ecology has been the focus of many research groups lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 although the simple calculation by broda 1977 showed that coupling ammonia and nitrite to produce gaseous nitrogen was thermodynamically feasible it took several decades for researchers to discover and confirm the existence of the anammox process broda 1977 oren 2015 unfortunately to date no anammox species has been successfully brought into pure culture the first attempt to enrich for an anammox community took several years as the growth rate was assumed to be below 0 001 h 1 kuenen 2020 currently 19 species belonging to 6 candidate genera brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua anammoxoglobus and anammoximicrobium exhibiting various growth rates with μmax between 0 1 0 4 d 1 have been identified through the assistance of omics technology zhang and okabe 2020 various wastewater treatment processes have been developed around the anammox reaction including partial nitritation anammox pn a one stage anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox the wide application of anammox has been achieved not only at lab scale but also in the real world by the end of 2014 there were more than 100 full scale industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants applying this technology in the mainstream or sidestream processes lackner et al 2014 however the extremely slow growth rate is still a nightmare for the implementation of anammox process resulting in a long startup period and prolonged retention time there are several ways to tackle the barriers created by extremely slow growth rate mainly by maximizing biomass retention as much as possible biofilm and granular systems set the stage for developing rapid startup anammox technology gilbert et al 2014 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 among them biofilms are currently widely used as it is feasible for these to form on the surface of various materials and are easily adapted to industrial environments therefore understanding biofilm assembly is key to developing strategies for constructing or regulating the anammox process generally community assembly is controlled by stochastic neutral and deterministic processes which have been proven to play important roles at different stages of anammox biofilm formation from colonization to maturation niederdorfer et al 2021 however the mechanisms of succession in anammox biofilms are still only vaguely understood community ecology considers four higher level process classes which are selection drift speciation and dispersal among them selection represents the deterministic effect drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance speciation referred to the creation of new species by genetic variation while dispersal is the result of species movement across space vellend 2010 it would be meaningful to understand the biofilm assembly which can affect the ecosystem functioning via shaping the community structure fukami et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 moreover community assembly is generally considered based on the pairwise turnovers of the whole communities rather than at the level of individual taxa stegen et al 2015 2013 but the latter is normally related to function the focus in wastewater treatment has been on discovering the core species to optimize the current process or the construction of novel engineering systems therefore the role of microbial taxonomy has been significantly highlighted in previous studies global water microbiome consortium et al 2019 saunders et al 2016 however it is necessary to determine the specific assembly process of anammox biofilms at the level of individual lineages nevertheless the biofilm plankton and aggregate communities are all existing for the practical implementation of anammox the exchange of species between different microhabitats also could lead to a substantial effect on the biofilm assembly but this has been understudied overall several questions have arisen as we have tried to understand how the employed unique species anammox alter the functional biofilm in artificially engineered systems which specific process control biofilm assembly of anammox in full scale application what is the role of anammox species in biofilm assembly do the different microhabitats matter in biofilm development to address these questions we used five different materials to form biofilms and enrich for anammox organisms within a full scale wastewater treatment plant specifically we selected a full scale partial nitrification anammox pna tank with stable performance as our target to enrich for an anammox biofilm to investigate the movement of microorganisms between microhabitats within the tank we separated the microbial samples into three categories water which contained the free living planktonic organisms sludge the organisms contained within aggregates and carriers the physical substrates upon which biofilms developed we sampled organisms from the three different microhabitats to investigate the biofilm assembly process time associated samples were taken from plankton aggregate and biofilm to reveal the time dependent variation of the prokaryotic community seven functional genes were analyzed over time to assess anammox activity the null model bayesian based sourcetracker and network analysis allowed us to monitor the time dependent variation in community composition and interaction of the different microhabitats 2 methods and materials 2 1 sampling strategy five different material types were placed as biofilm carriers in the anammox unit of a full scale wastewater treatment plant heibei china which had operated for over two years to remove ammonia from pharmaceutical wastewater the whole process was shown in fig s1 according to our investigation on carriers type at full scale level the polymers are commonly used substrate for enhancing anammox startup thereby we choose main five types of commercial carriers to further verify its effect on biofilm assembly in a full scale plant table s1 the carriers included fiber ball fb polyester polyurethane sponge ps polyurethane non woven fabric nf polypropylene small commercial sponge scs polyurethane and large commercial sponge lcs polyurethane all carriers were immersed into the wastewater in the middle point of the ditch fixed by iron wires six replicates were taken at 7d 21d 35d 56d 182d and 245d from all five carriers and the water and sludge of the unit fig s1 a small piece of carrier was cut off to collect biofilm from its surface by vertexing the sludge and water were mixed in the aeration tank thus a specific volume of this mixture 500 ml was taken and transferred into a low griffin beaker to separate the water and sludge by settling for 30 min the supernatant water was filtered through a 0 22 um filter 13 mm diameter the filter was the planktonic microbial sample the sediment in the beaker was collected as the sludge sample there were 6 biological replicates for individual samples at each time point the ph and temperature of wastewater were measured daily by a portable device phs 3c shanghai leici instrument factory china the ammonia n nitrite n nitrate n were detected by the national standard method sun et al 2022 the contact angle of all substrates was measured by dropping liquid on the surface of materials and quantified by specific equipment dsa100 kruss german 2 2 dna extraction sequencing and quantitative pcr all 240 samples were used to extract dna according to our previous study with primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 cai et al 2020 pcr thermocycling was performed on the adi geneamp 9700 model ca usa with an optimized program denaturation at 95 for 3 min 27 cycles of denaturation at 95 for 30 s annealing at 55 for 30 s extension at 72 for 45 s the final extension was annealing for10 min at 72 the pcr products were sent out for sequencing at the shanghai majorbio company china on the illumina miseq platform as only bacteria and archaea were amplified in the current study prokaryotic community will be used rather than microbial community the 16s rrna gene was used to determine the total biomass all quantitative date were referenced by the volume of biofilm water and sludge samples microorganisms size were ignored the coefficient of variation cv was calculated by the following equation cv standard deviation mean 2 3 prokaryotic community analysis the raw sequencing data in fastq format were uploaded to a publicly available galaxy pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 feng et al 2017 the filtered data were clustered through the unoise3 algorithm to resolve distinct sequences down to a singleton level edgar 2016 rdp classifier was employed to assign microbial taxonomy to the otu list with reference to the silva database version 138 1 wang et al 2007 all samples were resampled to 31 062 reads generating a total 15 463 otus that were used in the subsequent analysis the rarefaction curves for all samples indicated the depth of sequencing had reached the plateau stage fig s3 the otu table and mapping file were imported into the phyloseq r package and the alpha indices bray curtis based dissimilarity and nmds were calculated and visualized by the ggplot2 r package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 hopkins statistic k means and silhouette analyses were accomplished by cluster and factoextra r packages adonis based on bray curtis was calculated by the vegan r package with 0 05 as significance threshold conditionally rare taxa crt were identified by the coefficient of bimodality b 0 90 and relative abundance 0 05 described previously shade et al

additionally we defined the silencers colonizers dispersal and transient categories according to their absolute change we used the absolute number of each otu to reveal the increase or decrease trend firstly we defined the transient species if they were absence in more than three time points samples six time points in total we run the linear regression test eq 4 to infer the coefficient b value 4 y b x α b is the linear coefficient representing the change trend of individual otu along with time then we calculate the corresponding upper limitation at percentile 90 and lower limitation at percentile 10 if the b value is higher than the upper limitation we defined this otu belonged to the colonizers as it has showed obvious increase trend if b value is lower than the low limitation we defined it as dispersal species as it has been reduced clearly otherwise b values distributed in the middle from low to upper limitation were defined as silencers as their increase or decrease trend is slight the assembly process of biofilms was analyzed by the icamp r package ning et al 2020 bins are the group of phylogenetic relatives in icamp there were five processes defined in the method homogeneous selection hos heterogeneous selection hes homogenizing dispersal hd dispersal limitation dl drift and others dr 2 4 sourcetracker and microbial interaction network analysis a bayesian based source track method was employed to estimate the proportion of each source contributed to the development of the biofilms knights et al 2011 the sourcetracker method can identify the contribution proportion of each source to the sink we defined the water plankton sludge aggregate and pre biofilm the biofilm from previous time points samples as the source among plankton and aggregate include all samples taken from the current and previous time points the replicate biofilm samples from the specific time point as the sink in order to separately evaluate the contribution of community composition and microbial interaction from source to sink we used the otu table as input data to present the community composition network pattern based sourcetracker analysis was completed with the network absence presence dataset only significant correlation links were preserved and r value matrix all links were preserved as an input source to replace otu table supplementary excel sheet 1 and 2 we used the normalization method and ceiling r package to pretreat the r value matrix before entering the sourcetracker the microbial interaction was built upon the spearman correlation of absolute abundance which was calculated by multiplying qpcr result and taxonomic relative abundance vandeputte et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the threshold of significant correlation was set as p 0 05 fig s4 and the corresponding r threshold was shown in table s2 we used a bootstrap method 100 times random resample to test if the correlation was random defined by p 0 05 the network visualization was achieved by the gephi software the within module zi and participation coefficient pi score were calculated by the following equations 5 z i k i i n k σ 6 p i 1 c 1 n m k i i n k i 2 k i i n is the number of degrees of node i in its own module k and σ are the average and standard deviation of within module connectivity respectively in a specific module k i is the total links of node i in whole

coefficient was completed with mccr r package 3 results 3 1 operational performance of pna tank in the full scale wastewater treatment plant as shown in fig 1 a and s5 the ammonia concentration of influent is around 189 80 45 12 mg l there is a series of pna chamber the concentration decreased to 129 24 45 18 mg l in the second chamber and 70 67 41 24 mg l in the third chamber the final effluent showed a varying ammonia concentration 35 25 33 02 mg l thereby the total removal efficiency of ammonia could reach 82 82 12 23 the temperature varied at 54d decrease from 31 4 to 28 8 fig 1b although the value increased to around 30 but the lower temperature was observed at 59 64d the ph range is 6 71 7 58 during the sampling period 245 days fig s5 3 2 clustering of communities the hopkins statistic of otu abundance distribution was 0 99 which was higher than 0 5 indicating the distribution was uneven therefore the community composition of all samples could be easily clustered the silhouette width of the prokaryotic community was smaller than 0 4 fig s6 which indicated that the clustering results were unreliable kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 tobias hünefeldt et al 2021 according to the k means method results the best clustering number could not be confirmed fig s7 we defined several spatiotemporal categories according to the substrate type fb ps nf scs lcs material polyester polyurethane polypropylene shape cubic cloth spheric time 7 245 d stage 7 35d 56d 182 245d and microhabitat biofilm plankton aggregate all properties showed significant grouping p 0 01 time played a significant role adonis 33 40 of variance fig 1c microhabitat explained 18 21 of community composition and variation which was similar to the values of substrate shape material and type according to the community variation and nmds results of biofilm community fig 1d and s8 there is a clear separation in community variation from 56d the permanova test also verified three significant separations we divided the community stages into three categories colonization 7d 21d 35d succession 56d maturation 182d 245d niederdorfer et al 2021 regarding the aggregate and plankton community in fig 1d we also defined five clusters cluster1 c1 includes the samples from all carriers at 7d 21d and 35d cluster2 c2 represents the samples from all carriers at 182d and 245d cluster3 c3 is all samples taken at 56d cluster4 c4 is composed of sludge samples except 56d cluster5 c5 is a sum of samples from water except 56d as shown in figs 1e and s9 the early stage c1 showed significantly lower value of dissimilarity within groups than compared with c2 mann whitney test p 0 0001 the values were significantly lower than dissimilarity between and within other clusters mann whitney test p 0 0001 the planktonic community c5 exhibited significant dissimilarity to biofilm and aggregate fig s10 mann whitney test p 0 0001 3 3 development of communities at the taxonomic level bacteroidota and planctomycetota varied significantly with biofilm development fig s12 one sample wilcoxon test p 0 01 accordingly bacteroidota and planctomycetota were predominant in dispersal and colonizers in most biofilm community fig 2 a and b almost all taxa displayed a dynamic state dispersal can reach 58 88 5 55 at 245d in biofilm community colonizers decreased from 89 59 8 34 to 33 91 5 56 therefore all biofilm samples showed an extremely low abundance of silencers table s3 the richness of all samples as revealed by chao1 index increased slightly with time fig s11 the phylogenetic diversity pd was relatively stable over time for all microhabitats fig 2c the absolute abundance of specific anammox genera brocadia jettenia kuenenia increased beginning at 21d fig s13 however biofilm biomass decreased by 79 89 2 85 except for lcs and scs carriers which saw an increase of nearly 33 51 4 45 fig s14 and table s4 the cv of water was highest fig s15 dl and hos determined the assembly process of all communities fig s16 dl accounted for nearly 64 95 4 38 in the early stage colonization of plankton then decreased to 48 59 at 56d before increasing again to 82 20 at 245d table s5 a slight fluctuation was observed in the aggregate community as both dl and hos approached 50 48 68 8 05 vs 49 69 8 26 clearly hos contributed more to the biofilm assembly than dl for all substrates in biofilm and aggregate the contribution of the ns9 marine group to hos decreased with time especially for the biofilm of all carriers reaching a maximum 16 08 2 75 at 21d before declining to 0 79 0 27 at 245d the trueperaceae also exhibited a similar trend of hos proportion in both biofilm and aggregate conversely the candidatus brocadiaceae and akyh767 controlled the hos in the later stage 182d and 245d of the incubation it was noticeable that the portion contributed by candidatus brocadiaceae increased from 56d to 182d accounting for nearly 32 87 6 76 during the maturation stage fig 3 and supplementary excel file sheet3 the biofilm community originated from the sludge based on the high proportion of sludge at 7d 88 77 2 26 fig 4 the pre biofilm community mainly affected the maturation of biofilm while the planktonic community contributed very little during the early stage 3 92 2 67 the plankton constituted 28 06 6 38 in nf and 44 04 3 73 in fb at 56d meanwhile the aggregates were confirmed as 66 15 0 86 of the source of the other biofilm communities during the biofilm maturation stage the pre biofilm increased from 41 50 6 99 at 21d to 89 38 1 43 at 245d the plankton was affected equally by biofilm and aggregate during the initial days of biofilm development fig s17 the pre plankton exhibited a higher portion in the sourcetracker at 21d 65 26 6 60 but then subsequently decreased the role of biofilm was enhanced at 56d reaching 53 45 12 29 the remaining proportion was mainly composed of aggregate and pre plankton 3 4 microbial network comparisons between different microbial microhabitats and carriers figs s18 s19 and table s6 showed there was no significant change for most indices of network topological properties c1 exhibited significantly higher centralization betweenness average degree clustering coefficient and connectance than other clusters the percentage of shared links between biofilm plankton and aggregate were relatively low 10 of total as shown in fig s20 and the network degree of biofilm was larger than that of plankton and aggregate accounting for 38 52 of total as shown in fig s21 only 6 of total links belonged to the cluster3 network most interactions within microhabitat at 56d inherited from the cluster1 7 of total and passed to cluster2 11 of total as shown in fig 5 a the frequent links present in more than 80 of different carriers were constructed by the proteobacteria and bacteroidota as well as in the networks of plankton sludge and aggregate water the planctomycetota to which anammox organisms belong showed independent links with other taxa otu15375 which was assigned to the brocadiaceae displayed a higher z score during maturation of the biofilm fig s22 the nmds plot fig 5b indicated a similar clustering region of interaction matrix with community composition permanova r2 0 24 p 0 01 the matthews correlation coefficient mcc score fig 5c of c1 was significantly higher than other clusters mann whitney test p 0 0001 according to the sourcetracker results fig 5d of microbial interaction pattern based on absence presence data aggregates contributed 20 88 5 42 to the formation of microbial association during the early stage of emerging biofilm on different carriers 7 35 d the plankton accounted for less than 10 at all biofilm stages the results of r value data showed similar trend fig s23a in the succession stage of biofilm the microbial interactions of the biofilm were independent from the pre biofilm aggregate and plankton 65 04 11 79 of unknown the pre biofilm 33 19 0 94 and unknown 42 41 0 26 were predominant during the maturation stage of the biofilm temperature always exhibited higher r2 in linear regression analysis compared with ph table s7 ammonia and nitrate showed significantly results in fb scs w and s fig s24 the average 16s rrna gene copy number demonstrated the all biofilm communities increased at 56d fig s25 and s26 4 discussion 4 1 prokaryotic community was clustered by the time and microhabitat the carriers was commonly considered as a crucial strategy to extend the biomass retention and shorten the startup period in anammox application kosgey et al 2021 in previous studies the various carriers were used to enrich anammox species but the polymers were commonly used in the full scale implementation of anammox table s1 as it can provide higher specific surface area and lower cost the nitrogen removal performance and key anammox species growth have been well enhanced with distinct polymer carriers in previous studies adams et al 2020 but most studies will employ one kind of material as the carriers in full scale application the community analysis will focus on the variation of aob nob and anammox species our study provided a deep insight into the community variation of different polymer type and size all of carriers showed a slight difference in the community composition of biofilm compared with time and microhabitat effect even the previous study reported the size of porous could lead to varying community composition yang et al 2021 in addition to the highest contribution of colonization succession and maturation to the community variation 46 86 the substrate type introduced an additional factor to divide the samples into several groups after which the explanation displayed a plateau when attempting to divide samples into more groups fig s23 therefore microhabitat was considered as another factor to determine the clustering of communities fig 1d cluster 5 although surface properties and microbial social phenotypes were considered as deterministic factors modulating the biofilm community nadell et al 2016 herein the substrate type showed a slight difference compared with microhabitat under long term development a previous study also showed the first species to colonize a substrate were random regardless of surface topology paula et al 2020 thereby the carrier selection strategy of full scale application could have a wide range on the material size and type 4 2 core species in the anammox biofilm assembly the microbial competition in the community jungle could be the key to regulating the formation and development of biofilms hibbing et al 2010 wright et al 2013 the presence of colonizers and dispersal species implied that the lottery theory may play a role at the initial stage such that most species may colonize randomly on the surface of carriers but some will dwindle away as functional species develop according to the absolute variation of colonizers and dispersal the enriched anammox species may not only occupy more free space the biofilm growing visibly thicker as shown in fig s1 but also invade other habitats during its development specifically the bacteroidota dominated dispersal in the biofilm meanwhile planctomycete grew as the main colonizers this was accordant to the observations of previous study where bacterioidota exhibited opposite variation with planctomycete cao et al 2021 the bacteroidota are considered to be degraders of organic matter and thus are important to the removal of organic compounds from industrial wastewater their decrease indicated the biofilm s transformation into an autotrophic community in which the anammox organisms occupied a larger proportion of the available space according to the results of biofilm assembly process the bottom up selection pressure determined by environmental factors in terms of water nutrients ph and temperature was confirmed to be related to the heterogenous and homogeneous selection according to the mantel and linear regression test fig s24 and table s7 accounting for nearly half of biofilm assembly in the results of icamp the remaining portion almost entirely belonged to dispersal stochastic determination it is accordant that bacterioidota controlled biofilm homogeneous selection during the initial stage fig 3 switching from the ns9 marine group and trueperaceae to candidatus brocadiaceae in the maturation stage 182 245d the relevant colonizers in the biofilm also included patescibacteria chloroflexi and proteobacteria each of which were present at more than 10 respectively we assumed that patescibacteria provided lactate and formate in the anammox biofilm maintaining growth of the coexisting bacteria hosokawa et al 2021 the nitrogen catabolism species mainly belonged to the proteobacteria and their presence could be an auxiliary route for nitrogen removal cao et al 2019 therefore we assumed the decrease in actual number and dominance of bacterioidota may provide an opportunity for anammox to become enriched in the biofilm which was clearly higher than plankton and aggregates for the same functional niche fig 2 apart from the biofilm and aggregate proteobacteria was dominant in silencers and transients accounting for 50 of the total community indicating the nitrification process could mainly occur in the planktonic environment overall the core microbiome could contain several phyla which are the key to regulating the anammox community in the different microhabitat modes the decline of the bacterioidota would offer more space for planctomycete to grow within the biofilm but it may inhibit their relative abundance in aggregates 4 3 source track of distinct microhabitats biofilm formation is supposed to begin from small aggregates attached on the surface that grow to be larger microcolonies tolker nielsen 2015 the presence of microcolony in the initial biofilm could originate from sludge aggregates 88 77 2 26 of sourcetracker result it was speculated that hydraulic pressure moves the sludge on the surface of carriers via the aeration once the microcolony grows after 7d the pre biofilm exhibited a high proportion of contribution to biofilm development according to sourcetracker implying the independent biofilm development in the maturation stage fig 4 although the dispersal of species from the water environment also could occupy the surface to form the microcolony the plankton played only a minor role in biofilm development during the initial stage showing it may fail to compete with aggregates to attach on the substrate surface conversely the biofilm was recognized as one of the sources of plankton at 7d fig s17 which could be ascribed to the release of cells from the biofilm the higher proportion of pre plankton indicated that the plankton could be independent of the biofilm and aggregate at 21d and 35d fig s17 the subsequent increase of biofilm and aggregate suggested that plankton will be highly affected by the other microhabitats i e the planktonic microorganism could originate from the movement of species the planktonic species may be indispensable even without providing a specific contribution to performance although microbial aggregation of sludge and biofilm is one form of collective behavior in which large numbers of microorganisms enrich and play specific functions in a coordinated manner however a certain number of individuals are inevitably dispersed from the aggregate or biofilm to form the planktonic community a previous study highlighted the eco evolutionary significance of those loners which potentially foster the biodiversity across spatiotemporal scales via endow competitive advantage to strains with more fewer loners in face of shorter longer replenishment time rossine et al 2020 this was consistent with the increase of the planktonic proportion in sourcetracker at 56d the plankton may play an important ecological role in maintaining the robustness of all the communities water sludge and biofilm in the treatment tank although biofilm development was independent even in the presence of aeration which boost the movement of species perturbation may accelerate species exchange between different microhabitats the biomass and community structure of biofilm varied at 56d when temperature decreased the fast growing species may occupy the free space which was verified by the higher average estimated rrna copy number at 56d fig s25 considering full scale plants operated as a continuous model there is sufficient substrate provision and residue removal to maintain stationary phase thereby the limited space will be the focus of microbial competition nadell et al 2016 the variation of biomass suggested many species dwindled leaving open niches for others aybar et al 2018 with fast growing species potentially occupying the voids nevertheless the average copy number of plankton and aggregate was significantly higher than biofilm fig s26 mann whitney test p 0 001 as the aggregate and planktonic communities accounted for a higher proportion of the sources for the biofilm fig 4 the fast growing species in the biofilm may originate from the transition from planktonic to sessile modes although planktonic species may be more sensitive to environmental variation due to its higher cv of total biomass in plankton fig s27 their growth rates are often relatively higher than those of aggregate and biofilm organisms but this invasion could also be harmful to anammox enrichment as its relative and absolute abundance have decreased at 56d fig s8 and s13 although species may be exchanged the microbial interactions evolved separately the clustering results of interaction pattern was highly similar with the cluster results of community composition but the unknown proportion of network based sourcetracker indicated that new interactions formed within the biofilm fig 5d which was nearly 50 unique interactions belonging to the biofilm during the entire development period at 56d the decrease of biomass indicated some species may have dispersed from the biofilm but not all of them as the biofilm was still visible on the surface of whole substrate fig s1 thereby we assume there are still massive species on the surface allowing transient species to invade the biofilm and interact with the founder cells many processes such as quorum sensing will play a role in cell to cell adhesion by regulating microbial interactions sauer et al 2002 wright et al 2013 the emerging interactions may result in a higher proportion from an unknown source led by the transition of species from planktonic to sessile mode 4 4 community pressure on the development of biofilm the community pressure maybe the third player to coordinate community succession in a complex ecosystem except traditionally considered bottom up and top down selections burian et al 2022 guo 2021 hydraulic pressure was highlighted by a previous study in inducing differential microhabitat in terms of suspended aggregate and attached biofilm niederdorfer et al 2016 in this full scale industrial wastewater treatment plant the pna tank was mixed by aeration equipment to control dissolved oxygen concentration which could accelerate the exchange of species therefore the dispersal of specific species could be enhanced thereby reducing the effect of dispersal limitation on the community partition however we still observed an important effect of dispersal limitation on the biofilm assembly which led to different community structures of distinct microhabitats even in the same environment with mechanical mixing zhou and ning 2017 the community pressure of biofilm which we define as the pressures from the adjacent neighbors could originate from the aggregate and planktonic communities this phenomenon was also observed in community coalescence by invasion behavior diaz colunga et al 2023 rillig et al 2015 which in a single community under ecological co selection herein the sterile carriers were introduced into the tank to evolve a new biofilm community separate from the original community our study proved that the interchange within different microhabitats may contribute to sustain the initial biofilm formation and resist perturbation even as community succession was more independent in the maturation stage regarding the carriers were commonly used as seed material to boost the startup of new full scale pna tank yang et al 2021 a mixed startup methods by adding carriers aggregate and plankton could be more effective according to our findings in the interaction of distinct microhabitats moreover the regulation of hydraulic pressure can control the biomass retention of aggregate plankton and biofilm separately as we know the interaction between distinct microhabitats a more precise control strategy can be proposed and developed such as the extended hydraulic retention time may preserve more planktonic species which could be supportive to biofilm recovery from perturbation caused by physiochemical fluctuation 5 conclusion in summary this study revisits the development stages of anammox biofilms resulting in a novel way to understand the role of microbial and microhabitats interactions by a long term observation of anammox biofilm formation and development in a full scale wastewater treatment plant the prokaryotic community interchange in terms of composition and correlation network was quantified to show the existence of community pressure within distinct microhabitats which was enhanced when community structure varied implying its potential in stabilizing community in response to perturbation the biofilm development was led by candidatus brocadiaceae in the early stage colonization the anammox species exhibited few links in the microbial network but still dominate the homogeneous process in the later stage maturation the final conclusions will shed a light on our understanding of biofilm development in the full scale wastewater treatment engineering as well as expand our vision in the community regulation via microhabitats inoculation

14956,biofilms are an efficient way to underpin the biological process of wastewater treatment however little is known about the driving forces of biofilm formation and development in industrial settings long term observation of anammox biofilms indicated the interplay between different microhabitats biofilm aggregate plankton was important in sustaining biofilm formation sourcetracker analysis showed that 88 77 2 26 of initial biofilm originated from the aggregate however independent evolution was led by anammox species in the later stage 182d and 245d noticeably the source proportion of aggregate and plankton increased when temperature varied suggesting an interchange of species between different microhabitats could be helpful to biofilm recovery the microbial interaction pattern and community variation displayed similar trends but the unknown source proportion of interaction was very high during the entire incubation 7 245d thereby the same species may develop different relationships within the distinct microhabitats the core phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidota accounted for 80 of interactions in all lifestyles which is consistent with the fact that bacteroidota played important role in the early stage of biofilm assembly although anammox species evolved few links with other otus candidatus brocadiaceae still outcompeted the ns9 marine group to dominate the homogeneous selection process in the later stage 56 245d of biofilm assembly implying that the functional species may be decoupled from the core species in the microbial network the conclusions will shed a light on the understanding of biofilm development in large scale biosystems of wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox biofilm assembly microbial network wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the anammox cored process is commonly considered as one of most energy efficient environmental biotechnology for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater and as such anammox ecology has been the focus of many research groups lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 although the simple calculation by broda 1977 showed that coupling ammonia and nitrite to produce gaseous nitrogen was thermodynamically feasible it took several decades for researchers to discover and confirm the existence of the anammox process broda 1977 oren 2015 unfortunately to date no anammox species has been successfully brought into pure culture the first attempt to enrich for an anammox community took several years as the growth rate was assumed to be below 0 001 h 1 kuenen 2020 currently 19 species belonging to 6 candidate genera brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua anammoxoglobus and anammoximicrobium exhibiting various growth rates with μmax between 0 1 0 4 d 1 have been identified through the assistance of omics technology zhang and okabe 2020 various wastewater treatment processes have been developed around the anammox reaction including partial nitritation anammox pn a one stage anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox the wide application of anammox has been achieved not only at lab scale but also in the real world by the end of 2014 there were more than 100 full scale industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants applying this technology in the mainstream or sidestream processes lackner et al 2014 however the extremely slow growth rate is still a nightmare for the implementation of anammox process resulting in a long startup period and prolonged retention time there are several ways to tackle the barriers created by extremely slow growth rate mainly by maximizing biomass retention as much as possible biofilm and granular systems set the stage for developing rapid startup anammox technology gilbert et al 2014 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 among them biofilms are currently widely used as it is feasible for these to form on the surface of various materials and are easily adapted to industrial environments therefore understanding biofilm assembly is key to developing strategies for constructing or regulating the anammox process generally community assembly is controlled by stochastic neutral and deterministic processes which have been proven to play important roles at different stages of anammox biofilm formation from colonization to maturation niederdorfer et al 2021 however the mechanisms of succession in anammox biofilms are still only vaguely understood community ecology considers four higher level process classes which are selection drift speciation and dispersal among them selection represents the deterministic effect drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance speciation referred to the creation of new species by genetic variation while dispersal is the result of species movement across space vellend 2010 it would be meaningful to understand the biofilm assembly which can affect the ecosystem functioning via shaping the community structure fukami et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 moreover community assembly is generally considered based on the pairwise turnovers of the whole communities rather than at the level of individual taxa stegen et al 2015 2013 but the latter is normally related to function the focus in wastewater treatment has been on discovering the core species to optimize the current process or the construction of novel engineering systems therefore the role of microbial taxonomy has been significantly highlighted in previous studies global water microbiome consortium et al 2019 saunders et al 2016 however it is necessary to determine the specific assembly process of anammox biofilms at the level of individual lineages nevertheless the biofilm plankton and aggregate communities are all existing for the practical implementation of anammox the exchange of species between different microhabitats also could lead to a substantial effect on the biofilm assembly but this has been understudied overall several questions have arisen as we have tried to understand how the employed unique species anammox alter the functional biofilm in artificially engineered systems which specific process control biofilm assembly of anammox in full scale application what is the role of anammox species in biofilm assembly do the different microhabitats matter in biofilm development to address these questions we used five different materials to form biofilms and enrich for anammox organisms within a full scale wastewater treatment plant specifically we selected a full scale partial nitrification anammox pna tank with stable performance as our target to enrich for an anammox biofilm to investigate the movement of microorganisms between microhabitats within the tank we separated the microbial samples into three categories water which contained the free living planktonic organisms sludge the organisms contained within aggregates and carriers the physical substrates upon which biofilms developed we sampled organisms from the three different microhabitats to investigate the biofilm assembly process time associated samples were taken from plankton aggregate and biofilm to reveal the time dependent variation of the prokaryotic community seven functional genes were analyzed over time to assess anammox activity the null model bayesian based sourcetracker and network analysis allowed us to monitor the time dependent variation in community composition and interaction of the different microhabitats 2 methods and materials 2 1 sampling strategy five different material types were placed as biofilm carriers in the anammox unit of a full scale wastewater treatment plant heibei china which had operated for over two years to remove ammonia from pharmaceutical wastewater the whole process was shown in fig s1 according to our investigation on carriers type at full scale level the polymers are commonly used substrate for enhancing anammox startup thereby we choose main five types of commercial carriers to further verify its effect on biofilm assembly in a full scale plant table s1 the carriers included fiber ball fb polyester polyurethane sponge ps polyurethane non woven fabric nf polypropylene small commercial sponge scs polyurethane and large commercial sponge lcs polyurethane all carriers were immersed into the wastewater in the middle point of the ditch fixed by iron wires six replicates were taken at 7d 21d 35d 56d 182d and 245d from all five carriers and the water and sludge of the unit fig s1 a small piece of carrier was cut off to collect biofilm from its surface by vertexing the sludge and water were mixed in the aeration tank thus a specific volume of this mixture 500 ml was taken and transferred into a low griffin beaker to separate the water and sludge by settling for 30 min the supernatant water was filtered through a 0 22 um filter 13 mm diameter the filter was the planktonic microbial sample the sediment in the beaker was collected as the sludge sample there were 6 biological replicates for individual samples at each time point the ph and temperature of wastewater were measured daily by a portable device phs 3c shanghai leici instrument factory china the ammonia n nitrite n nitrate n were detected by the national standard method sun et al 2022 the contact angle of all substrates was measured by dropping liquid on the surface of materials and quantified by specific equipment dsa100 kruss german 2 2 dna extraction sequencing and quantitative pcr all 240 samples were used to extract dna according to our previous study with primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 cai et al 2020 pcr thermocycling was performed on the adi geneamp 9700 model ca usa with an optimized program denaturation at 95 for 3 min 27 cycles of denaturation at 95 for 30 s annealing at 55 for 30 s extension at 72 for 45 s the final extension was annealing for10 min at 72 the pcr products were sent out for sequencing at the shanghai majorbio company china on the illumina miseq platform as only bacteria and archaea were amplified in the current study prokaryotic community will be used rather than microbial community the 16s rrna gene was used to determine the total biomass all quantitative date were referenced by the volume of biofilm water and sludge samples microorganisms size were ignored the coefficient of variation cv was calculated by the following equation cv standard deviation mean 2 3 prokaryotic community analysis the raw sequencing data in fastq format were uploaded to a publicly available galaxy pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 feng et al 2017 the filtered data were clustered through the unoise3 algorithm to resolve distinct sequences down to a singleton level edgar 2016 rdp classifier was employed to assign microbial taxonomy to the otu list with reference to the silva database version 138 1 wang et al 2007 all samples were resampled to 31 062 reads generating a total 15 463 otus that were used in the subsequent analysis the rarefaction curves for all samples indicated the depth of sequencing had reached the plateau stage fig s3 the otu table and mapping file were imported into the phyloseq r package and the alpha indices bray curtis based dissimilarity and nmds were calculated and visualized by the ggplot2 r package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 hopkins statistic k means and silhouette analyses were accomplished by cluster and factoextra r packages adonis based on bray curtis was calculated by the vegan r package with 0 05 as significance threshold conditionally rare taxa crt were identified by the coefficient of bimodality b 0 90 and relative abundance 0 05 described previously shade et al

additionally we defined the silencers colonizers dispersal and transient categories according to their absolute change we used the absolute number of each otu to reveal the increase or decrease trend firstly we defined the transient species if they were absence in more than three time points samples six time points in total we run the linear regression test eq 4 to infer the coefficient b value 4 y b x α b is the linear coefficient representing the change trend of individual otu along with time then we calculate the corresponding upper limitation at percentile 90 and lower limitation at percentile 10 if the b value is higher than the upper limitation we defined this otu belonged to the colonizers as it has showed obvious increase trend if b value is lower than the low limitation we defined it as dispersal species as it has been reduced clearly otherwise b values distributed in the middle from low to upper limitation were defined as silencers as their increase or decrease trend is slight the assembly process of biofilms was analyzed by the icamp r package ning et al 2020 bins are the group of phylogenetic relatives in icamp there were five processes defined in the method homogeneous selection hos heterogeneous selection hes homogenizing dispersal hd dispersal limitation dl drift and others dr 2 4 sourcetracker and microbial interaction network analysis a bayesian based source track method was employed to estimate the proportion of each source contributed to the development of the biofilms knights et al 2011 the sourcetracker method can identify the contribution proportion of each source to the sink we defined the water plankton sludge aggregate and pre biofilm the biofilm from previous time points samples as the source among plankton and aggregate include all samples taken from the current and previous time points the replicate biofilm samples from the specific time point as the sink in order to separately evaluate the contribution of community composition and microbial interaction from source to sink we used the otu table as input data to present the community composition network pattern based sourcetracker analysis was completed with the network absence presence dataset only significant correlation links were preserved and r value matrix all links were preserved as an input source to replace otu table supplementary excel sheet 1 and 2 we used the normalization method and ceiling r package to pretreat the r value matrix before entering the sourcetracker the microbial interaction was built upon the spearman correlation of absolute abundance which was calculated by multiplying qpcr result and taxonomic relative abundance vandeputte et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the threshold of significant correlation was set as p 0 05 fig s4 and the corresponding r threshold was shown in table s2 we used a bootstrap method 100 times random resample to test if the correlation was random defined by p 0 05 the network visualization was achieved by the gephi software the within module zi and participation coefficient pi score were calculated by the following equations 5 z i k i i n k σ 6 p i 1 c 1 n m k i i n k i 2 k i i n is the number of degrees of node i in its own module k and σ are the average and standard deviation of within module connectivity respectively in a specific module k i is the total links of node i in whole network n m is the number of modules in the network deng et al 2012 z p plot was visualized by the ggclusternet r package wen et al 2023 the connectors module hubs network hubs and peripherals were defined by the range of z p coordination peripheral nodes zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 deng et al 2012 matthews correlation coefficient was completed with mccr r package 3 results 3 1 operational performance of pna tank in the full scale wastewater treatment plant as shown in fig 1 a and s5 the ammonia concentration of influent is around 189 80 45 12 mg l there is a series of pna chamber the concentration decreased to 129 24 45 18 mg l in the second chamber and 70 67 41 24 mg l in the third chamber the final effluent showed a varying ammonia concentration 35 25 33 02 mg l thereby the total removal efficiency of ammonia could reach 82 82 12 23 the temperature varied at 54d decrease from 31 4 to 28 8 fig 1b although the value increased to around 30 but the lower temperature was observed at 59 64d the ph range is 6 71 7 58 during the sampling period 245 days fig s5 3 2 clustering of communities the hopkins statistic of otu abundance distribution was 0 99 which was higher than 0 5 indicating the distribution was uneven therefore the community composition of all samples could be easily clustered the silhouette width of the prokaryotic community was smaller than 0 4 fig s6 which indicated that the clustering results were unreliable kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 tobias hünefeldt et al 2021 according to the k means method results the best clustering number could not be confirmed fig s7 we defined several spatiotemporal categories according to the substrate type fb ps nf scs lcs material polyester polyurethane polypropylene shape cubic cloth spheric time 7 245 d stage 7 35d 56d 182 245d and microhabitat biofilm plankton aggregate all properties showed significant grouping p 0 01 time played a significant role adonis 33 40 of variance fig 1c microhabitat explained 18 21 of community composition and variation which was similar to the values of substrate shape material and type according to the community variation and nmds results of biofilm community fig 1d and s8 there is a clear separation in community variation from 56d the permanova test also verified three significant separations we divided the community stages into three categories colonization 7d 21d 35d succession 56d maturation 182d 245d niederdorfer et al 2021 regarding the aggregate and plankton community in fig 1d we also defined five clusters cluster1 c1 includes the samples from all carriers at 7d 21d and 35d cluster2 c2 represents the samples from all carriers at 182d and 245d cluster3 c3 is all samples taken at 56d cluster4 c4 is composed of sludge samples except 56d cluster5 c5 is a sum of samples from water except 56d as shown in figs 1e and s9 the early stage c1 showed significantly lower value of dissimilarity within groups than compared with c2 mann whitney test p 0 0001 the values were significantly lower than dissimilarity between and within other clusters mann whitney test p 0 0001 the planktonic community c5 exhibited significant dissimilarity to biofilm and aggregate fig s10 mann whitney test p 0 0001 3 3 development of communities at the taxonomic level bacteroidota and planctomycetota varied significantly with biofilm development fig s12 one sample wilcoxon test p 0 01 accordingly bacteroidota and planctomycetota were predominant in dispersal and colonizers in most biofilm community fig 2 a and b almost all taxa displayed a dynamic state dispersal can reach 58 88 5 55 at 245d in biofilm community colonizers decreased from 89 59 8 34 to 33 91 5 56 therefore all biofilm samples showed an extremely low abundance of silencers table s3 the richness of all samples as revealed by chao1 index increased slightly with time fig s11 the phylogenetic diversity pd was relatively stable over time for all microhabitats fig 2c the absolute abundance of specific anammox genera brocadia jettenia kuenenia increased beginning at 21d fig s13 however biofilm biomass decreased by 79 89 2 85 except for lcs and scs carriers which saw an increase of nearly 33 51 4 45 fig s14 and table s4 the cv of water was highest fig s15 dl and hos determined the assembly process of all communities fig s16 dl accounted for nearly 64 95 4 38 in the early stage colonization of plankton then decreased to 48 59 at 56d before increasing again to 82 20 at 245d table s5 a slight fluctuation was observed in the aggregate community as both dl and hos approached 50 48 68 8 05 vs 49 69 8 26 clearly hos contributed more to the biofilm assembly than dl for all substrates in biofilm and aggregate the contribution of the ns9 marine group to hos decreased with time especially for the biofilm of all carriers reaching a maximum 16 08 2 75 at 21d before declining to 0 79 0 27 at 245d the trueperaceae also exhibited a similar trend of hos proportion in both biofilm and aggregate conversely the candidatus brocadiaceae and akyh767 controlled the hos in the later stage 182d and 245d of the incubation it was noticeable that the portion contributed by candidatus brocadiaceae increased from 56d to 182d accounting for nearly 32 87 6 76 during the maturation stage fig 3 and supplementary excel file sheet3 the biofilm community originated from the sludge based on the high proportion of sludge at 7d 88 77 2 26 fig 4 the pre biofilm community mainly affected the maturation of biofilm while the planktonic community contributed very little during the early stage 3 92 2 67 the plankton constituted 28 06 6 38 in nf and 44 04 3 73 in fb at 56d meanwhile the aggregates were confirmed as 66 15 0 86 of the source of the other biofilm communities during the biofilm maturation stage the pre biofilm increased from 41 50 6 99 at 21d to 89 38 1 43 at 245d the plankton was affected equally by biofilm and aggregate during the initial days of biofilm development fig s17 the pre plankton exhibited a higher portion in the sourcetracker at 21d 65 26 6 60 but then subsequently decreased the role of biofilm was enhanced at 56d reaching 53 45 12 29 the remaining proportion was mainly composed of aggregate and pre plankton 3 4 microbial network comparisons between different microbial microhabitats and carriers figs s18 s19 and table s6 showed there was no significant change for most indices of network topological properties c1 exhibited significantly higher centralization betweenness average degree clustering coefficient and connectance than other clusters the percentage of shared links between biofilm plankton and aggregate were relatively low 10 of total as shown in fig s20 and the network degree of biofilm was larger than that of plankton and aggregate accounting for 38 52 of total as shown in fig s21 only 6 of total links belonged to the cluster3 network most interactions within microhabitat at 56d inherited from the cluster1 7 of total and passed to cluster2 11 of total as shown in fig 5 a the frequent links present in more than 80 of different carriers were constructed by the proteobacteria and bacteroidota as well as in the networks of plankton sludge and aggregate water the planctomycetota to which anammox organisms belong showed independent links with other taxa otu15375 which was assigned to the brocadiaceae displayed a higher z score during maturation of the biofilm fig s22 the nmds plot fig 5b indicated a similar clustering region of interaction matrix with community composition permanova r2 0 24 p 0 01 the matthews correlation coefficient mcc score fig 5c of c1 was significantly higher than other clusters mann whitney test p 0 0001 according to the sourcetracker results fig 5d of microbial interaction pattern based on absence presence data aggregates contributed 20 88 5 42 to the formation of microbial association during the early stage of emerging biofilm on different carriers 7 35 d the plankton accounted for less than 10 at all biofilm stages the results of r value data showed similar trend fig s23a in the succession stage of biofilm the microbial interactions of the biofilm were independent from the pre biofilm aggregate and plankton 65 04 11 79 of unknown the pre biofilm 33 19 0 94 and unknown 42 41 0 26 were predominant during the maturation stage of the biofilm temperature always exhibited higher r2 in linear regression analysis compared with ph table s7 ammonia and nitrate showed significantly results in fb scs w and s fig s24 the average 16s rrna gene copy number demonstrated the all biofilm communities increased at 56d fig s25 and s26 4 discussion 4 1 prokaryotic community was clustered by the time and microhabitat the carriers was commonly considered as a crucial strategy to extend the biomass retention and shorten the startup period in anammox application kosgey et al 2021 in previous studies the various carriers were used to enrich anammox species but the polymers were commonly used in the full scale implementation of anammox table s1 as it can provide higher specific surface area and lower cost the nitrogen removal performance and key anammox species growth have been well enhanced with distinct polymer carriers in previous studies adams et al 2020 but most studies will employ one kind of material as the carriers in full scale application the community analysis will focus on the variation of aob nob and anammox species our study provided a deep insight into the community variation of different polymer type and size all of carriers showed a slight difference in the community composition of biofilm compared with time and microhabitat effect even the previous study reported the size of porous could lead to varying community composition yang et al 2021 in addition to the highest contribution of colonization succession and maturation to the community variation 46 86 the substrate type introduced an additional factor to divide the samples into several groups after which the explanation displayed a plateau when attempting to divide samples into more groups fig s23 therefore microhabitat was considered as another factor to determine the clustering of communities fig 1d cluster 5 although surface properties and microbial social phenotypes were considered as deterministic factors modulating the biofilm community nadell et al 2016 herein the substrate type showed a slight difference compared with microhabitat under long term development a previous study also showed the first species to colonize a substrate were random regardless of surface topology paula et al 2020 thereby the carrier selection strategy of full scale application could have a wide range on the material size and type 4 2 core species in the anammox biofilm assembly the microbial competition in the community jungle could be the key to regulating the formation and development of biofilms hibbing et al 2010 wright et al 2013 the presence of colonizers and dispersal species implied that the lottery theory may play a role at the initial stage such that most species may colonize randomly on the surface of carriers but some will dwindle away as functional species develop according to the absolute variation of colonizers and dispersal the enriched anammox species may not only occupy more free space the biofilm growing visibly thicker as shown in fig s1 but also invade other habitats during its development specifically the bacteroidota dominated dispersal in the biofilm meanwhile planctomycete grew as the main colonizers this was accordant to the observations of previous study where bacterioidota exhibited opposite variation with planctomycete cao et al 2021 the bacteroidota are considered to be degraders of organic matter and thus are important to the removal of organic compounds from industrial wastewater their decrease indicated the biofilm s transformation into an autotrophic community in which the anammox organisms occupied a larger proportion of the available space according to the results of biofilm assembly process the bottom up selection pressure determined by environmental factors in terms of water nutrients ph and temperature was confirmed to be related to the heterogenous and homogeneous selection according to the mantel and linear regression test fig s24 and table s7 accounting for nearly half of biofilm assembly in the results of icamp the remaining portion almost entirely belonged to dispersal stochastic determination it is accordant that bacterioidota controlled biofilm homogeneous selection during the initial stage fig 3 switching from the ns9 marine group and trueperaceae to candidatus brocadiaceae in the maturation stage 182 245d the relevant colonizers in the biofilm also included patescibacteria chloroflexi and proteobacteria each of which were present at more than 10 respectively we assumed that patescibacteria provided lactate and formate in the anammox biofilm maintaining growth of the coexisting bacteria hosokawa et al 2021 the nitrogen catabolism species mainly belonged to the proteobacteria and their presence could be an auxiliary route for nitrogen removal cao et al 2019 therefore we assumed the decrease in actual number and dominance of bacterioidota may provide an opportunity for anammox to become enriched in the biofilm which was clearly higher than plankton and aggregates for the same functional niche fig 2 apart from the biofilm and aggregate proteobacteria was dominant in silencers and transients accounting for 50 of the total community indicating the nitrification process could mainly occur in the planktonic environment overall the core microbiome could contain several phyla which are the key to regulating the anammox community in the different microhabitat modes the decline of the bacterioidota would offer more space for planctomycete to grow within the biofilm but it may inhibit their relative abundance in aggregates 4 3 source track of distinct microhabitats biofilm formation is supposed to begin from small aggregates attached on the surface that grow to be larger microcolonies tolker nielsen 2015 the presence of microcolony in the initial biofilm could originate from sludge aggregates 88 77 2 26 of sourcetracker result it was speculated that hydraulic pressure moves the sludge on the surface of carriers via the aeration once the microcolony grows after 7d the pre biofilm exhibited a high proportion of contribution to biofilm development according to sourcetracker implying the independent biofilm development in the maturation stage fig 4 although the dispersal of species from the water environment also could occupy the surface to form the microcolony the plankton played only a minor role in biofilm development during the initial stage showing it may fail to compete with aggregates to attach on the substrate surface conversely the biofilm was recognized as one of the sources of plankton at 7d fig s17 which could be ascribed to the release of cells from the biofilm the higher proportion of pre plankton indicated that the plankton could be independent of the biofilm and aggregate at 21d and 35d fig s17 the subsequent increase of biofilm and aggregate suggested that plankton will be highly affected by the other microhabitats i e the planktonic microorganism could originate from the movement of species the planktonic species may be indispensable even without providing a specific contribution to performance although microbial aggregation of sludge and biofilm is one form of collective behavior in which large numbers of microorganisms enrich and play specific functions in a coordinated manner however a certain number of individuals are inevitably dispersed from the aggregate or biofilm to form the planktonic community a previous study highlighted the eco evolutionary significance of those loners which potentially foster the biodiversity across spatiotemporal scales via endow competitive advantage to strains with more fewer loners in face of shorter longer replenishment time rossine et al 2020 this was consistent with the increase of the planktonic proportion in sourcetracker at 56d the plankton may play an important ecological role in maintaining the robustness of all the communities water sludge and biofilm in the treatment tank although biofilm development was independent even in the presence of aeration which boost the movement of species perturbation may accelerate species exchange between different microhabitats the biomass and community structure of biofilm varied at 56d when temperature decreased the fast growing species may occupy the free space which was verified by the higher average estimated rrna copy number at 56d fig s25 considering full scale plants operated as a continuous model there is sufficient substrate provision and residue removal to maintain stationary phase thereby the limited space will be the focus of microbial competition nadell et al 2016 the variation of biomass suggested many species dwindled leaving open niches for others aybar et al 2018 with fast growing species potentially occupying the voids nevertheless the average copy number of plankton and aggregate was significantly higher than biofilm fig s26 mann whitney test p 0 001 as the aggregate and planktonic communities accounted for a higher proportion of the sources for the biofilm fig 4 the fast growing species in the biofilm may originate from the transition from planktonic to sessile modes although planktonic species may be more sensitive to environmental variation due to its higher cv of total biomass in plankton fig s27 their growth rates are often relatively higher than those of aggregate and biofilm organisms but this invasion could also be harmful to anammox enrichment as its relative and absolute abundance have decreased at 56d fig s8 and s13 although species may be exchanged the microbial interactions evolved separately the clustering results of interaction pattern was highly similar with the cluster results of community composition but the unknown proportion of network based sourcetracker indicated that new interactions formed within the biofilm fig 5d which was nearly 50 unique interactions belonging to the biofilm during the entire development period at 56d the decrease of biomass indicated some species may have dispersed from the biofilm but not all of them as the biofilm was still visible on the surface of whole substrate fig s1 thereby we assume there are still massive species on the surface allowing transient species to invade the biofilm and interact with the founder cells many processes such as quorum sensing will play a role in cell to cell adhesion by regulating microbial interactions sauer et al 2002 wright et al 2013 the emerging interactions may result in a higher proportion from an unknown source led by the transition of species from planktonic to sessile mode 4 4 community pressure on the development of biofilm the community pressure maybe the third player to coordinate community succession in a complex ecosystem except traditionally considered bottom up and top down selections burian et al 2022 guo 2021 hydraulic pressure was highlighted by a previous study in inducing differential microhabitat in terms of suspended aggregate and attached biofilm niederdorfer et al 2016 in this full scale industrial wastewater treatment plant the pna tank was mixed by aeration equipment to control dissolved oxygen concentration which could accelerate the exchange of species therefore the dispersal of specific species could be enhanced thereby reducing the effect of dispersal limitation on the community partition however we still observed an important effect of dispersal limitation on the biofilm assembly which led to different community structures of distinct microhabitats even in the same environment with mechanical mixing zhou and ning 2017 the community pressure of biofilm which we define as the pressures from the adjacent neighbors could originate from the aggregate and planktonic communities this phenomenon was also observed in community coalescence by invasion behavior diaz colunga et al 2023 rillig et al 2015 which in a single community under ecological co selection herein the sterile carriers were introduced into the tank to evolve a new biofilm community separate from the original community our study proved that the interchange within different microhabitats may contribute to sustain the initial biofilm formation and resist perturbation even as community succession was more independent in the maturation stage regarding the carriers were commonly used as seed material to boost the startup of new full scale pna tank yang et al 2021 a mixed startup methods by adding carriers aggregate and plankton could be more effective according to our findings in the interaction of distinct microhabitats moreover the regulation of hydraulic pressure can control the biomass retention of aggregate plankton and biofilm separately as we know the interaction between distinct microhabitats a more precise control strategy can be proposed and developed such as the extended hydraulic retention time may preserve more planktonic species which could be supportive to biofilm recovery from perturbation caused by physiochemical fluctuation 5 conclusion in summary this study revisits the development stages of anammox biofilms resulting in a novel way to understand the role of microbial and microhabitats interactions by a long term observation of anammox biofilm formation and development in a full scale wastewater treatment plant the prokaryotic community interchange in terms of composition and correlation network was quantified to show the existence of community pressure within distinct microhabitats which was enhanced when community structure varied implying its potential in stabilizing community in response to perturbation the biofilm development was led by candidatus brocadiaceae in the early stage colonization the anammox species exhibited few links in the microbial network but still dominate the homogeneous process in the later stage maturation the final conclusions will shed a light on our understanding of biofilm development in the full scale wastewater treatment engineering as well as expand our vision in the community regulation via microhabitats inoculation

14957,the proliferation of small bodied fishes in lakes is often accompanied by deterioration of water quality and ecosystem function however the potential impacts of different types of small bodied fish species e g obligate zooplanktivores and omnivores on subtropical lake ecosystems in particular have been overlooked mainly due to their small size shorter life spans and lower economic value therefore we conducted a mesocosm experiment to elucidate how plankton communities and water quality respond to different types of small bodied fishes including a common zooplanktivorous fish thin sharpbelly toxabramis swinhonis and other small bodied omnivorous fishes bitterling acheilognathus macropterus crucian carp carassius auratus and sharpbelly hemiculter leucisculus during the experiment the mean weekly total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand codmn turbidity chlorophyll a chl α and trophic level index tli values were generally higher in treatments where fish were present compared to treatments where fish were absent but responses varied at the end of the experiment phytoplankton abundance and biomass and the relative abundance and biomass of cyanophyta were higher while the abundance and biomass of large bodied zooplankton were lower in the fish present treatments moreover the mean weekly tp codmn chl α and tli values were generally higher in treatments with the obligate zooplanktivore thin sharpbelly when compared to treatments with omnivorous fishes also the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass was the lowest and the ratio of chl α to tp was the highest in treatments with thin sharpbelly collectively these general findings indicate that an overabundance of small bodied fishes can have adverse effects on water quality and plankton communities and that small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes likely induce stronger top down effects on plankton and water quality than omnivorous fishes our results emphasise that small bodied fishes should be monitored and controlled if overabundant when managing or restoring shallow subtropical lakes from the perspective of environmental protection the combined stocking of different piscivorous fish species that feed in different habitat types could be a way forward to control small bodied fishes with different feeding habits but more research is needed to assess the feasibility of this approach graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords small bodied fishes top down effects shallow lakes ecological restoration lake management data availability the datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction small bodied fishes play an important role in structuring aquatic ecosystems by transporting energy and nutrients from lower e g plankton and detritus to higher trophic levels e g piscivorous fishes and water birds cury et al 2000 however the proliferation of small bodied fishes in aquatic ecosystems can be accompanied by deterioration of water quality and ecosystem function yu et al 2021a for example small fishes may release nutrients and suspended solids into the water column for uptake by algae drenner et al 1998 or boost the growth of phytoplankton by predating on herbivorous zooplankton beklioğlu and moss 1998 he et al 2018 thereby exacerbating eutrophication as the intensification of eutrophication and climate change continues the density biomass and dominance of small bodied fishes will likely further increase which may lead to elevated adverse effects on these ecosystems jeppesen et al 2010 2012 many lakes are situated along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin mlyrb accounting for about 1 3 of the total surface area of lakes in china liu 1984 these lakes are typically characterised by shallow depths sometimes abundant aquatic vegetation and high biological productivity zhang 2005 ye et al 2014 over the past a few decades these lakes have been used for commercial fisheries xie et al 2005 li et al 2010 due to the overfishing of large bodied commercial species and intensive removal of piscivorous fishes e g topmouth culter culter alburnus and mandarin fish siniperca chuatsi short lived small bodied fishes such as crucian carp carassius auratus sharpbelly hemiculter leucisculus and thin sharpbelly toxabramis swinhonis now flourish in most of these lakes and usually constitute about 2 3 of total fish species 40 70 species often found in one lake xie et al 2005 zhang 2005 ye et al 2014 moreover comparisons across latitudinal gradients indicate higher species richness and densities of small bodied individuals that mature at younger ages and exhibit faster growth in warmer subtropical lakes such as those in the mlyrb jeppesen et al 2010 2012 thus it is necessary to understand how plankton communities and water quality respond to small bodied fishes and how to effectively control them in shallow subtropical lakes previous studies have shown that most small bodied fish species are either omnivorous or zooplanktivorous in shallow lakes within the mlyrb xie et al 2005 zhang 2005 and that these fishes can affect water quality through various pathways yu et al 2021a for example small bodied omnibenthivorous fishes such as crucian carp and pond loach misgurnus anguillicaudatus which live near the bottom and feed mainly on the benthos detritus and aquatic vegetation zhang 2005 can suspend sediments leading to an increase in turbidity and a release of nutrients back into the water column thus boosting the growth of algae gu et al 2017 ren et al 2022 small bodied omniplanktivorous fishes e g sharpbelly h leucisculus and bitterling acheilognathus macropterus feed on a variety of food items including zooplankton plant material benthic invertebrates and periphyton yu et al 2016 2020 adaptable feeding behavior allows these fishes to promote phytoplankton growth by predating on herbivorous zooplankton or by sediment disturbance yu et al 2020 pacheco et al 2021 additionally small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes e g thin sharpbelly t swinhonis coilia nasus and neosalanx taihuensis usually live in upper regions of the water column and select for large bodied zooplankton i e cladocerans and copepods zhang 2005 yu et al 2016 as a result they can exert heavy predation pressure on zooplankton communities post and mcqueen 1987 however most studies in lakes of the mlyrb have only examined the effects of a single species such as crucian carp huang et al 2020 or bitterling yu et al 2020 where few studies have compared the effects among multiple species simultaneously thus there is still uncertainty about which small bodied fish species have the greatest effects on water quality and plankton communities in shallow subtropical lakes of the mlyrb in temperate lakes zooplanktivorous fishes can exert strong top down effects on plankton communities timms and moss 1984 traditional biomanipulation which aims to reduce the biomass of zooplanktivorous fishes to increase grazing pressure on phytoplankton by zooplankton has been studied extensively in temperate lakes mehner et al 2004 søndergaard et al 2008 in shallow subtropical lakes of the mlyrb however studies have mostly evaluated the food web effects of small bodied omnibenthivorous fishes gu et al 2017 huang et al 2020 ren et al 2022 or omniplanktivorous fishes zhou and chen 2015 yu et al 2020 2021b with minimal consideration of zooplanktivorous fishes this is despite zooplanktivorous fishes outnumbering omnivorous fishes in many mlyrb lakes taihu lake liu et al 2021 gehu lake li et al 2022 and biandantang lake li et al 2018 are notable examples studies suggest that faster growth ye et al 2014 greater reproductive output dong et al 2019 and stronger predator defense mechanisms e g thin sharpbelly has a robust spiny dorsal fin li et al 2018 have contributed to the ability of small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes to become dominant in mlyrb lakes thus more attention to the impacts of zooplanktivorous fishes in these systems is needed small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes and omnivorous fishes have dominated fish communities in mlyrb lakes over the past a few decades xie et al 2005 zhang 2005 yet small bodied fishes remain overlooked in the context of lake restoration within the mlyrb due to their small size shorter life spans and low economic value devoted studies are need to assess their effects on water quality we hypothesize that i high abundances of small bodied fishes have adverse effects on plankton communities and water quality and ii small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes induce stronger top down effects on plankton and water quality than their omnivorous counterparts in shallow subtropical lakes to test these hypotheses we conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify how plankton communities and water quality respond to different small bodied fish species i e crucian carp c auratus omnibenthivorous sharpbelly h leucisculus omniplanktivorous bitterling a macropterus omniplanktivorous and thin sharpbelly t swinhonis zooplanktivorous and to compare the relative effects of a common zooplanktivorous fish to other omnivorous fishes results help inform potential measures for the restoration and management of shallow subtropical lakes within the mlyrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the mesocosm experiment was conducted from 30 may to 5 july 2020 at the lake bao an field research station of the

the observed response of plankton within each mesocosm 1 the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass bzoop bphyt and 2 the ratio of chl a to tp chl tp both metrics help quantify the degree of top down control as they reflect differential grazing pressure of zooplankton on phytoplankton higher values of bzoop bphyt or lower values of chl tp both reflecting higher grazing pressure of

a significant positive effect on chl a and an indirect positive effect on tp p 0 001 for all cases while its positive effect on turbidity was lower than that of bitterling crucian carp and sharpbelly fig 7d 4 discussion here we experimentally demonstrate that overabundant small bodied fishes can exert biologically relevant top down effects on plankton and water quality but responses varied depending on the feeding habits of different species specifically thin sharpbelly a common zooplanktivorous fish inhabiting mlyrb lakes exerted stronger effects than the omnivorous fishes examined however responses observed from omnivorous fishes also varied indicating that the overall strength of top down effects may vary at the whole lake scale depending on the abundance and community composition of fishes present thus efforts to restore shallow subtropical lakes may benefit from more explicit consideration of the role different small bodied fishes play in food webs for the remainder we discuss each of our primary study hypotheses concerning these food web effects and consequences for water quality 4 1 hypothesis 1 high abundances of small bodied fishes have adverse effects on plankton communities and water quality in shallow subtropical lakes when considering responses observed across treatments holistically we found strong evidence that small bodied fishes can degrade water quality during the experiment the mean weekly tn tp codmn tur chl α and tli values were generally higher in the fish present ama cau hle tsw treatments than in the fish absent nf treatment it is important to note however that these responses varied across species of small bodied fish and in some pairwise instances for some variables mean responses did not differ significantly from the nf treatment over the time frame examined more importantly negative changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were still observed in the fish present treatments including increases in undesirable cyanophytes and decreases is large bodied zooplankton i e cladocerans and copepods needed for maintaining more desirable water quality our results correspond to those of related studies he et al 2018 huang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 and support the conclusion that high abundances of small bodied fishes can have adverse effects on water quality and can lead to plankton communities being dominated by undesirable cyanophytes and small bodied zooplankton the mechanisms through which small bodied fishes affected water quality within the mesocosms of this study varied among species due to differences in feeding behaviors yu et al 2021 disturbance of sediments drenner et al 1998 and predation on zooplankton timms and moss 1984 can significantly affect nutrient concentrations in the water column and plankton communities previous studies have illustrated that high concentrations of suspended solids or high turbidity may induce sublethal physiological stress to fish less visibility in the water column can also reduce the feeding capacity and efficiency of fish shoup and wahl 2009 zhou and chen 2015 we found that the mean weekly values of turbidity were significantly higher in the cau and hle treatments than in the tsw treatment correspondingly the percent occurrence and percent weight of large bodied zooplankton consumed by crucian carp and sharpbelly in the cau and hle treatments were both lower than the zooplankton consumed by thin sharpbelly in the tsw treatment hence our results indicate that the significant increase of suspended solids and turbidity generated by crucian carp and sharpbelly disturbance in turn suppressed their own top down effect on large bodied zooplankton crucian carp being a common small omnibenthivorous fish dominates the fish community in many mlyrb lakes likely impacting water quality plankton communities and even submerged macrophytes primarily through bottom up effects thus control of this species or its removal is considered important in the ecological restoration of shallow subtropical lakes huang et al 2020 guo et al 2022a sharpbelly also a commonly dominant small bodied fish in mlyrb lakes consumes a wide range of food sources and generally lives in nearshore habitats where submerged macrophytes are abundant zhang 2005 compared to omnibenthivorous fishes most studies have ignored disturbances driven by fishes like sharpbelly that occupy nearshore habitats even though they can have deleterious effects on water quality and on submerged macrophytes zhou and chen 2015 ren et al 2022 bitterling is a common small bodied omnibenthivorous fish that often dominants species assemblages in shallow mlyrb lakes that have been restored yu et al 2016 the larvae of bitterling mainly feed on zooplankton while the adults prefer submerged macrophytes usui et al 2018 several studies have shown that bitterling can significantly increase nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass via excretion disturbance of sediments and by feeding on zooplankton yu et al 2020 2021b they can also hamper the growth of submerged macrophytes through direct grazing yu et al 2021b in our experiment the sem results revealed that bitterling had a negative effect on water quality and plankton communities by influencing both bottom up and top down processes but these adverse effects were less pronounced than those of sharpbelly crucian carp and thin sharpbelly even so the food web effects of bitterling in mlyrb lakes cannot be ignored 4 2 hypothesis 2 small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes induce stronger top down effects on plankton and water quality than small bodied omnivorous fishes in accordance with our second hypothesis thin sharpbelly an obligate zooplanktivore were a greater threat to plankton communities and water quality than crucian carp sharpbelly and bitterling by exhibiting stronger top down control of large bodied zooplankton through predation in our study the mean weekly tp codmn chl α and tli values were generally highest in the tsw treatment than in the cau hle and ama treatments although responses varied and some notable effects on water quality were also observed from the omnivorous fishes that were similar to thin sharpbelly importantly some of the largest shifts in the composition of phytoplankton more undesirable cyanophytes and zooplankton fewer large bodied species were observed in the tsw treatment when compared to the others which may better reflect the strength of top down control for example the ratio of bzoop bphyt was lowest and chl tp ratio was highest in the tsw treatment both being more integrative measures of top down forcing than any one water quality variable alone collectively these results further support the hypothesis that small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes likely exert stronger top down effects on zooplankton and water quality than that of small bodied omnivorous fishes but examining additional species of zooplanktivores would be beneficial for assessments of generalization beklioğlu and moss 1998 thin sharpbelly is a common small bodied zooplanktivorous fish that is widely distributed in the yangtze river yellow river and other freshwater bodies in china chen et al 1998 zheng 1998 for example thin sharpbelly represented 47 1 of total fish abundance in shijiu lake he et al 2021 69 5 in wuhu lake xiang 2019 72 5 in taibai lake xiang 2019 and over 80 in biandantang lake over the 2012 2014 period li et al 2018 similar patterns have been observed for other small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes such as c nasus li et al 2022 and n taihuensis yin et al 2022 in this study thin sharpbelly fed mainly on large bodied zooplankton especially bosmina coregoni and alona rectangular thereby reducing the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton and boosting the growth of phytoplankton our study illustrates that high abundances of small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes can exert strong negative effects on plankton and water quality which may lead to the deterioration of ecosystem function however few studies have examined the population demographics of small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes including life history population dynamics and reproductive biology zhang 2005 dong et al 2019 this information is needed to better understand the productivity of different zooplanktivorous fish populations and to identify effective strategies for regulating their proliferation and for restoring shallow subtropical lakes 4 3 implications for the management of shallow subtropical lakes our results indicate that the abundance of small bodied fishes especially zooplanktivorous fishes should be monitored and potentially controlled when restoring or managing shallow subtropical lakes stocking of piscivorous fishes has been applied to control the quantity of small bodied fishes but results have been mixed jeppesen et al 2012 in shallow lakes of the mlyrb specifically stocking of piscivorous fishes to control small bodied fishes has shown promise lin et al 2015 li et al 2018 guo et al 2022b but effectiveness may vary depending on the feeding strategy of different species of piscivorous fish guo et al 2022b for instance benthic oriented piscivorous fishes e g mandarin fish and snakehead fish channa argus mainly feed on small bodied fishes living nearshore or in deeper depths closer to the bottom e g crucian carp and bitterling zhang 2005 while pelagic oriented piscivorous fishes e g topmouth culter consume more surface oriented small bodied fishes in open water zones e g thin sharpbelly and c nasus zhang 2005 our results suggest that small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes such as thin sharpbelly and c nasus need stricter control than other small bodied fish species but all species examined in this study exhibited negative effects on water quality therefore stocking multiple species of piscivorous fish that exhibit a range of feeding strategies may be the most effective approach to regulating small bodied zooplanktivorous and omnivorous fishes collectively additional research particularly at a lake wide scale is needed to test the potential utility of this approach 5 conclusion a mesocosm experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of different small bodied fish species exhibiting alternative feeding habits zooplanktivores versus omnivores on water quality and plankton communities assess the strength of top down control i e predation on zooplankton and characterize the feeding selectivity of different species our results showed that 1 an overabundance of small bodied fishes deteriorates water quality decreases large bodied zooplankton biomass and increases phytoplankton biomass particularly cyanobacteria 2 mesocosms with thin sharpbelly an obligate zooplanktivore exhibited the poorest water quality the lowest ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass and the highest ratio of chl a to tp when compared to the three omnivorous small bodied fish species these results were driven by greater selective feeding on large bodied zooplankton by thin sharpbelly additional experiments at larger spatial scales or over longer durations may further clarify the top down effects of small bodied fishes our results provide new insights for informing the ecological restoration of shallow subtropical lakes particularly those supporting an overabundance of small bodied zooplanktivorous and omnivorous fishes funding the study was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant no 2019yfd0900601

14957,the proliferation of small bodied fishes in lakes is often accompanied by deterioration of water quality and ecosystem function however the potential impacts of different types of small bodied fish species e g obligate zooplanktivores and omnivores on subtropical lake ecosystems in particular have been overlooked mainly due to their small size shorter life spans and lower economic value therefore we conducted a mesocosm experiment to elucidate how plankton communities and water quality respond to different types of small bodied fishes including a common zooplanktivorous fish thin sharpbelly toxabramis swinhonis and other small bodied omnivorous fishes bitterling acheilognathus macropterus crucian carp carassius auratus and sharpbelly hemiculter leucisculus during the experiment the mean weekly total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chemical oxygen demand codmn turbidity chlorophyll a chl α and trophic level index tli values were generally higher in treatments where fish were present compared to treatments where fish were absent but responses varied at the end of the experiment phytoplankton abundance and biomass and the relative abundance and biomass of cyanophyta were higher while the abundance and biomass of large bodied zooplankton were lower in the fish present treatments moreover the mean weekly tp codmn chl α and tli values were generally higher in treatments with the obligate zooplanktivore thin sharpbelly when compared to treatments with omnivorous fishes also the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass was the lowest and the ratio of chl α to tp was the highest in treatments with thin sharpbelly collectively these general findings indicate that an overabundance of small bodied fishes can have adverse effects on water quality and plankton communities and that small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes likely induce stronger top down effects on plankton and water quality than omnivorous fishes our results emphasise that small bodied fishes should be monitored and controlled if overabundant when managing or restoring shallow subtropical lakes from the perspective of environmental protection the combined stocking of different piscivorous fish species that feed in different habitat types could be a way forward to control small bodied fishes with different feeding habits but more research is needed to assess the feasibility of this approach graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords small bodied fishes top down effects shallow lakes ecological restoration lake management data availability the

aquatic ecosystems by transporting energy and nutrients from lower e g plankton and detritus to higher trophic levels e g piscivorous fishes and water birds cury et al 2000 however the proliferation of small bodied fishes in aquatic ecosystems can be accompanied by deterioration of water quality and ecosystem function yu et al 2021a for example small fishes may release nutrients and suspended solids into the water column for uptake by algae drenner et al 1998 or boost the growth of phytoplankton by predating on herbivorous zooplankton beklioğlu and moss 1998 he et al 2018 thereby exacerbating eutrophication as the intensification of eutrophication and climate change continues the density biomass and dominance of small bodied fishes will likely further increase which may lead to elevated adverse effects on these ecosystems jeppesen et al 2010 2012 many lakes are situated along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin mlyrb accounting for about 1 3 of the total surface area of lakes in china liu 1984 these lakes are typically characterised by shallow depths sometimes abundant aquatic vegetation and high biological productivity zhang 2005 ye et al 2014 over the past a few decades these lakes have been used for commercial fisheries xie et al 2005 li et al 2010 due to the overfishing of large bodied commercial species and intensive removal of piscivorous fishes e g topmouth culter culter alburnus and mandarin fish siniperca chuatsi short lived small bodied fishes such as crucian carp carassius auratus sharpbelly hemiculter leucisculus and thin sharpbelly toxabramis swinhonis now flourish in most of these lakes and usually constitute about 2 3 of total fish species 40 70 species often found in one lake xie et al 2005 zhang 2005 ye et al 2014 moreover comparisons across latitudinal gradients indicate higher species richness and densities of small bodied individuals that mature at younger ages and exhibit faster growth in warmer subtropical lakes such as those in the mlyrb jeppesen et al 2010 2012 thus it is necessary to understand how plankton communities and water quality respond to small bodied fishes and how to effectively control them in shallow subtropical lakes previous studies have shown that most small bodied fish species are either omnivorous or zooplanktivorous in shallow lakes within the mlyrb xie et al 2005 zhang 2005 and that these fishes can affect water quality through various pathways yu et al 2021a for example small bodied omnibenthivorous fishes such as crucian carp and pond loach misgurnus anguillicaudatus which live near the bottom and feed mainly on the benthos detritus and aquatic vegetation zhang 2005 can suspend sediments leading to an increase in turbidity and a release of nutrients back into the water column thus boosting the growth of algae gu et al 2017 ren et al 2022 small bodied omniplanktivorous fishes e g sharpbelly h leucisculus and bitterling acheilognathus macropterus feed on a variety of food items including zooplankton plant material benthic invertebrates and periphyton yu et al 2016 2020 adaptable feeding behavior allows these fishes to promote phytoplankton growth by predating on herbivorous zooplankton or by sediment disturbance yu et al 2020 pacheco et al 2021 additionally small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes e g thin sharpbelly t swinhonis coilia nasus and neosalanx taihuensis usually live in upper regions of the water column and select for large bodied zooplankton i e cladocerans and copepods zhang 2005 yu et al 2016 as a result they can exert heavy predation pressure on zooplankton communities post and mcqueen 1987 however most studies in lakes of the mlyrb have only examined the effects of a single species such as crucian carp huang et al 2020 or bitterling yu et al 2020 where few studies have compared the effects among multiple species simultaneously thus there is still uncertainty about which small bodied fish species have the greatest effects on water quality and plankton communities in shallow subtropical lakes of the mlyrb in temperate lakes zooplanktivorous fishes can exert strong top down effects on plankton communities timms and moss 1984 traditional biomanipulation which aims to reduce the biomass of zooplanktivorous fishes to increase grazing pressure on phytoplankton by zooplankton has been studied extensively in temperate lakes mehner et al 2004 søndergaard et al 2008 in shallow subtropical lakes of the mlyrb however studies have mostly evaluated the food web effects of small bodied omnibenthivorous fishes gu et al 2017 huang et al 2020 ren et al 2022 or omniplanktivorous fishes zhou and chen 2015 yu et al 2020 2021b with minimal consideration of zooplanktivorous fishes this is despite zooplanktivorous fishes outnumbering omnivorous fishes in many mlyrb lakes taihu lake liu et al 2021 gehu lake li et al 2022 and biandantang lake li et al 2018 are notable examples studies suggest that faster growth ye et al 2014 greater reproductive output dong et al 2019 and stronger predator defense mechanisms e g thin sharpbelly has a robust spiny dorsal fin li et al 2018 have contributed to the ability of small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes to become dominant in mlyrb lakes thus more attention to the impacts of zooplanktivorous fishes in these systems is needed small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes and omnivorous fishes have dominated fish communities in mlyrb lakes over the past a few decades xie et al 2005 zhang 2005 yet small bodied fishes remain overlooked in the context of lake restoration within the mlyrb due to their small size shorter life spans and low economic value devoted studies are need to assess their effects on water quality we hypothesize that i high abundances of small bodied fishes have adverse effects on plankton communities and water quality and ii small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes induce stronger top down effects on plankton and water quality than their omnivorous counterparts in shallow subtropical lakes to test these hypotheses we conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify how plankton communities and water quality respond to different small bodied fish species i e crucian carp c auratus omnibenthivorous sharpbelly h leucisculus omniplanktivorous bitterling a macropterus omniplanktivorous and thin sharpbelly t swinhonis zooplanktivorous and to compare the relative effects of a common zooplanktivorous fish to other omnivorous fishes results help inform potential measures for the restoration and management of shallow subtropical lakes within the mlyrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the mesocosm experiment was conducted from 30 may to 5 july 2020 at the lake bao an field research station of the

the observed response of plankton within each mesocosm 1 the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass bzoop bphyt and 2 the ratio of chl a to tp chl tp both metrics help quantify the degree of top down control as they reflect differential grazing pressure of zooplankton on phytoplankton higher values of bzoop bphyt or lower values of chl tp both reflecting higher grazing pressure of

than did bitterling and crucian carp fig 7c lastly for the tsw treatment the sem explained 50 0 of the variation in tp χ 2 5 747 p 0 076 srmr 0 048 cfi 0 951 and demonstrated that thin sharpbelly had a significant positive effect on chl a and an indirect positive effect on tp p 0 001 for all cases while its positive effect on turbidity was lower than that of bitterling crucian carp and sharpbelly fig 7d 4 discussion here we experimentally demonstrate that overabundant small bodied fishes can exert biologically relevant top down effects on plankton and water quality but responses varied depending on the feeding habits of different species specifically thin sharpbelly a common zooplanktivorous fish inhabiting mlyrb lakes exerted stronger effects than the omnivorous fishes examined however responses observed from omnivorous fishes also varied indicating that the overall strength of top down effects may vary at the whole lake scale depending on the abundance and community composition of fishes present thus efforts to restore shallow subtropical lakes may benefit from more explicit consideration of the role different small bodied fishes play in food webs for the remainder we discuss each of our primary study hypotheses concerning these food web effects and consequences for water quality 4 1 hypothesis 1 high abundances of small bodied fishes have adverse effects on plankton communities and water quality in shallow subtropical lakes when considering responses observed across treatments holistically we found strong evidence that small bodied fishes can degrade water quality during the experiment the mean weekly tn tp codmn tur chl α and tli values were generally higher in the fish present ama cau hle tsw treatments than in the fish absent nf treatment it is important to note however that these responses varied across species of small bodied fish and in some pairwise instances for some variables mean responses did not differ significantly from the nf treatment over the time frame examined more importantly negative changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were still observed in the fish present treatments including increases in undesirable cyanophytes and decreases is large bodied zooplankton i e cladocerans and copepods needed for maintaining more desirable water quality our results correspond to those of related studies he et al 2018 huang et al 2020 yu et al 2020 and support the conclusion that high abundances of small bodied fishes can have adverse effects on water quality and can lead to plankton communities being dominated by undesirable cyanophytes and small bodied zooplankton the mechanisms through which small bodied fishes affected water quality within the mesocosms of this study varied among species due to differences in feeding behaviors yu et al 2021 disturbance of sediments drenner et al 1998 and predation on zooplankton timms and moss 1984 can significantly affect nutrient concentrations in the water column and plankton communities previous studies have illustrated that high concentrations of suspended solids or high turbidity may induce sublethal physiological stress to fish less visibility in the water column can also reduce the feeding capacity and efficiency of fish shoup and wahl 2009 zhou and chen 2015 we found that the mean weekly values of turbidity were significantly higher in the cau and hle treatments than in the tsw treatment correspondingly the percent occurrence and percent weight of large bodied zooplankton consumed by crucian carp and sharpbelly in the cau and hle treatments were both lower than the zooplankton consumed by thin sharpbelly in the tsw treatment hence our results indicate that the significant increase of suspended solids and turbidity generated by crucian carp and sharpbelly disturbance in turn suppressed their own top down effect on large bodied zooplankton crucian carp being a common small omnibenthivorous fish dominates the fish community in many mlyrb lakes likely impacting water quality plankton communities and even submerged macrophytes primarily through bottom up effects thus control of this species or its removal is considered important in the ecological restoration of shallow subtropical lakes huang et al 2020 guo et al 2022a sharpbelly also a commonly dominant small bodied fish in mlyrb lakes consumes a wide range of food sources and generally lives in nearshore habitats where submerged macrophytes are abundant zhang 2005 compared to omnibenthivorous fishes most studies have ignored disturbances driven by fishes like sharpbelly that occupy nearshore habitats even though they can have deleterious effects on water quality and on submerged macrophytes zhou and chen 2015 ren et al 2022 bitterling is a common small bodied omnibenthivorous fish that often dominants species assemblages in shallow mlyrb lakes that have been restored yu et al 2016 the larvae of bitterling mainly feed on zooplankton while the adults prefer submerged macrophytes usui et al 2018 several studies have shown that bitterling can significantly increase nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass via excretion disturbance of sediments and by feeding on zooplankton yu et al 2020 2021b they can also hamper the growth of submerged macrophytes through direct grazing yu et al 2021b in our experiment the sem results revealed that bitterling had a negative effect on water quality and plankton communities by influencing both bottom up and top down processes but these adverse effects were less pronounced than those of sharpbelly crucian carp and thin sharpbelly even so the food web effects of bitterling in mlyrb lakes cannot be ignored 4 2 hypothesis 2 small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes induce stronger top down effects on plankton and water quality than small bodied omnivorous fishes in accordance with our second hypothesis thin sharpbelly an obligate zooplanktivore were a greater threat to plankton communities and water quality than crucian carp sharpbelly and bitterling by exhibiting stronger top down control of large bodied zooplankton through predation in our study the mean weekly tp codmn chl α and tli values were generally highest in the tsw treatment than in the cau hle and ama treatments although responses varied and some notable effects on water quality were also observed from the omnivorous fishes that were similar to thin sharpbelly importantly some of the largest shifts in the composition of phytoplankton more undesirable cyanophytes and zooplankton fewer large bodied species were observed in the tsw treatment when compared to the others which may better reflect the strength of top down control for example the ratio of bzoop bphyt was lowest and chl tp ratio was highest in the tsw treatment both being more integrative measures of top down forcing than any one water quality variable alone collectively these results further support the hypothesis that small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes likely exert stronger top down effects on zooplankton and water quality than that of small bodied omnivorous fishes but examining additional species of zooplanktivores would be beneficial for assessments of generalization beklioğlu and moss 1998 thin sharpbelly is a common small bodied zooplanktivorous fish that is widely distributed in the yangtze river yellow river and other freshwater bodies in china chen et al 1998 zheng 1998 for example thin sharpbelly represented 47 1 of total fish abundance in shijiu lake he et al 2021 69 5 in wuhu lake xiang 2019 72 5 in taibai lake xiang 2019 and over 80 in biandantang lake over the 2012 2014 period li et al 2018 similar patterns have been observed for other small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes such as c nasus li et al 2022 and n taihuensis yin et al 2022 in this study thin sharpbelly fed mainly on large bodied zooplankton especially bosmina coregoni and alona rectangular thereby reducing the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton and boosting the growth of phytoplankton our study illustrates that high abundances of small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes can exert strong negative effects on plankton and water quality which may lead to the deterioration of ecosystem function however few studies have examined the population demographics of small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes including life history population dynamics and reproductive biology zhang 2005 dong et al 2019 this information is needed to better understand the productivity of different zooplanktivorous fish populations and to identify effective strategies for regulating their proliferation and for restoring shallow subtropical lakes 4 3 implications for the management of shallow subtropical lakes our results indicate that the abundance of small bodied fishes especially zooplanktivorous fishes should be monitored and potentially controlled when restoring or managing shallow subtropical lakes stocking of piscivorous fishes has been applied to control the quantity of small bodied fishes but results have been mixed jeppesen et al 2012 in shallow lakes of the mlyrb specifically stocking of piscivorous fishes to control small bodied fishes has shown promise lin et al 2015 li et al 2018 guo et al 2022b but effectiveness may vary depending on the feeding strategy of different species of piscivorous fish guo et al 2022b for instance benthic oriented piscivorous fishes e g mandarin fish and snakehead fish channa argus mainly feed on small bodied fishes living nearshore or in deeper depths closer to the bottom e g crucian carp and bitterling zhang 2005 while pelagic oriented piscivorous fishes e g topmouth culter consume more surface oriented small bodied fishes in open water zones e g thin sharpbelly and c nasus zhang 2005 our results suggest that small bodied zooplanktivorous fishes such as thin sharpbelly and c nasus need stricter control than other small bodied fish species but all species examined in this study exhibited negative effects on water quality therefore stocking multiple species of piscivorous fish that exhibit a range of feeding strategies may be the most effective approach to regulating small bodied zooplanktivorous and omnivorous fishes collectively additional research particularly at a lake wide scale is needed to test the potential utility of this approach 5 conclusion a mesocosm experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of different small bodied fish species exhibiting alternative feeding habits zooplanktivores versus omnivores on water quality and plankton communities assess the strength of top down control i e predation on zooplankton and characterize the feeding selectivity of different species our results showed that 1 an overabundance of small bodied fishes deteriorates water quality decreases large bodied zooplankton biomass and increases phytoplankton biomass particularly cyanobacteria 2 mesocosms with thin sharpbelly an obligate zooplanktivore exhibited the poorest water quality the lowest ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass and the highest ratio of chl a to tp when compared to the three omnivorous small bodied fish species these results were driven by greater selective feeding on large bodied zooplankton by thin sharpbelly additional experiments at larger spatial scales or over longer durations may further clarify the top down effects of small bodied fishes our results provide new insights for informing the ecological restoration of shallow subtropical lakes particularly those supporting an overabundance of small bodied zooplanktivorous and omnivorous fishes funding the study was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant no 2019yfd0900601

14958,in this study abiotic transformation of an important strobilurin fungicide kresoxim methyl was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions for the first time by studying its kinetics of hydrolysis and photolysis degradation pathways and toxicity of possibly formed transformation products tps the results indicated that kresoxim methyl showed a fast degradation in ph9 solutions with dt50 of 0 5 d but relatively stable under neutral or acidic environments in the dark it was prone to photochemical reactions under simulated sunlight and the photolysis behavior was easily affected by different natural substances such as humic acid ha fe3 and no3 which are ubiquitous in natural water showing the complexity of degradation mechanisms and pathways of this chemical compound the potential multiple photo transformation pathways via photoisomerization hydrolyzation of methyl ester hydroxylation cleavage of oxime ether and cleavage of benzyl ether were observed 18 tps generated from these transformations were structurally elucidated based on an integrated workflow combining suspect and nontarget screening by high resolution mass spectrum hrms and two of them were confirmed with reference standards most of tps as far as we know have never been described before the in silico toxicity assessment showed that some of tps were still toxic or very toxic to aquatic organisms although they exhibit lower aquatic toxicity compared to the parent compound therefore the potential hazards of the tps of kresoxim methyl merits further evaluation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords kresoxim methyl abiotic transformation transformation products hrms toxicity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fungicides are commonly used in seed treatment and foliar spraying to reduce the damage of fungal pathogens to a variety of crops however after application more than 60 of fungicides enter into soil han et al 2021 and can easily reach the aquatic compartments with surface runoff which may pose potential threat to aquatic organisms due to their highly toxicity cui et al 2017 zubrod et al 2019 in recent years due to the widely distribution of pesticides in different environmental compartments and their toxicity to non target organisms pesticide pollution has attracted considerable attention from research communities bollmann et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 therefore more information is urgently needed to better understand the environmental fate and behavior of fungicides zubrod et al 2019 there is emerging evidence indicated that fungicides can undergo various abiotic degradation photochemical transformation and hydrolysis forming numerous transformation products in natural water tps anagnostopoulou et al 2022 fenner et al 2013 photolysis plays an important role in the degradation of chemicals in the natural aqueous environment it is reported that the organic and inorganic components such as dissolved organic matter dom fe3 and no3 which are ubiquitous in natural water can affect the photodegradation of pesticide emidio et al 2017 humic acid ha is the main component of dom with concentrations of 0 mg l 50 mg l dissolved organic carbon xia et al 2009 no3 is usually present in natural waters with concentrations ranging from 10 5 to 10 3 m mao et al 2011 most often the concentration of fe3 was in the range of 10 6 10 4 m dong and hu 2016 it is necessary to explore the influence mechanism of different environmental factors on photodegradation of pesticides so as to predict the fate of pesticides in the environment kresoxim methyl is a representative strobilurin fungicide and widely used to control various crop diseases e g white mold rot early and late leaf spot with rapid and efficient bactericidal activity feng et al 2020 nevertheless environmental pollution and toxicity on non target organisms caused by long term use of strobilurin fungicides have raised serious public health problems li et al 2016 wang et al 2021 kresoxim methyl is often detected in different environmental compartments as reported in the literature it has a maximum concentration of 2 9 µg l in 20 central european streams liess and von der ohe 2005 some studies have shown that kresoxim methyl has high toxicity to aquatic organisms such as daphnia magna and zebrafish and it can cause damage to daphnia magna at environmentally relevant concentrations cui et al 2017 mao et al 2020 relevant studies reported that the tps may have similar or even higher toxicity than their parent forms serving as potential environmental pollutants under natural conditions gutowski et al 2015 hensen et al 2020 sinclair and boxall 2003 the main tp of kresoxim methyl reported in soil is acid of kresoxim methyl bf490 1 which is slightly more toxic than the parent compound in the acute oral rat study efsa 2010 therefore the consideration of only parent pesticides could lead to an underestimation of environmental risks of these contaminants however to date there is still great uncertainty about the structure and toxicity of potential tps of kresoxim methyl generated from abiotic transformation most tps of pesticides are unknown unknowns whose structures are unknown and they are usually not included in chemical databases thus the identification of these compounds requires advanced instruments and effective analytical strategies brunner et al 2019 in recent years integrated strategy of suspect and nontarget screening methods are successfully developed to identified tps of contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals psoma et al 2021 wang et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that the development and the use of non target screening method based on powerful high resolution mass spectrum hrms has been the driving force in the development of innovative analytical methods for identifying pesticide tps bletsou et al 2015 in contrast to purposefully matching of mass spectra peaks in targeted routine monitoring strategies non target screening involves all masses that detected in samples without any reference or prior information about the compounds krauss et al 2010 schymanski et al 2014b the hrms with higher selectivity and sensitivity can provide high quality accuracy and resolution in full scan mode and the accurate mass measurements of molecular ions and the high sensitivity detection of ms ms fragments are more conducive to the elucidation of unknown analyte structures huntscha et al 2014 furthermore pesticide transformation experiments in the laboratory can be regarded as systems with well controlled boundary conditions and unknown structures that are closely related to the parent compound unknow peaks that are significantly different from the control sample or that have regular changes over time can be considered as chemically significant structures in such cases identification of tps by hrms can usually be considered definitive krauss et al 2010 in addition in silico toxicity assessment as a promising and cost effective approach is becoming more and more popular because experimental in vivo or in vitro toxicity assessment methods are expensive and time consuming trawinski and skibinski 2017 quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model widely used in toxicity prediction of tps has been proved to be an effective method for preliminary toxicity assessment yang et al 2021 many tps of fungicides have not yet been identified there is a large knowledge gap about their environmental fate and ecotoxicity kang et al 2020 overall the objectives of this study were to 1 gain a more complete picture of kresoxim methyl abiotic transformation in aquatic environments and 2 to assess the toxicity of transformation products of kresoxim methyl by in silico quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model the influences of three typical classes of field substances ha fe3 and no3 that may affect the photochemical processes were firstly evaluated under simulated sunlight by using xenon arc lamp related hydrolysis and direct photolysis products were structurally characterized by uhplc q exactive ms to help to elucidate the transformation pathways of kresoxim methyl in aquatic environments furthermore preliminary assessment on tps ecotoxicity was performed with in silico quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model to the best of knowledge this is the first study to ascertain the abiotic transformation behavior and toxicity assessment of kresoxim methyl in aquatic environments the results will be of great significance for environmental fate prediction and risk assessment of kresoxim methyl 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and

of the most important factors affecting hydrolysis rate and pathway of pesticides liu et al 2015 the hydrolysis experiment was conducted in ultrapure water and different buffer solutions with different ph values 4 7 and 9 specific preparation methods of different buffer solutions were based on a previous study man et al 2021 prior to the experiment all solutions were autoclaved to avoid biodegradation and the ph of buffer solutions was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl prior to use 10 mg l of kresoxim methyl solutions were prepared with ultrapure water and various ph buffer solutions the relative high concentration was selected to facilitate the identification of tps a batch of 50 ml kresoxim methyl solutions were set up in brown glass bottles covered with bottle caps

various time intervals day 0 1 3 5 7 14 21 30 42 60 90 for the subsequent extraction and analysis 2 3 experiments of photodegradation the photodegradation of kresoxim methyl were conducted under simulated solar light 1000 w xenon lamp with light intensity of 4000 lux emitting wavelength of 290 800 nm in an arc lamp test apparatus xuezhongtan hangzhou china a cooling fan was used to maintain a mean internal temperature of 25 1 c inside the reactor the initial concentration of kresoxim methyl was 10 mg l unless specified direct photodegradation of kresoxim methyl was studied in ultrapure water and buffer solutions as described above to evaluate the effect of the different substances which are ubiquitous in natural waters on the photolytic behavior of kresoxim methyl experiments were carried out under the same conditions in the presence of ha fe3 and no3 with various concentrations the photodegradation of kresoxim methyl in natural water was also investigated quality indicators of natural water collected from river in beijing were shown in table s2 all photodegradation experiments were performed in quartz tubes and aliquots of sample solution 2 ml were collected at specified time intervals simultaneously dark controls were conducted under the same conditions for comparison without the application of light each experiment was performed in triplicate 2 4 sample preparation and extraction acetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent for the analysis of photodegradation and hydrolysis samples briefly 2 ml of acetonitrile was added into the centrifuge tube with 2 ml

processing analytical strategy raw data files were processed by compound discoverer 3 2 thermo fisher scientific which streamlines tps research with easily customizable workflows that include powerful unknown identification capabilities and advanced statistical tools nontarget screening analysis is a completely unbiased study because all the features detected can be explored and identified angeles et al 2021 in this study the comprehensive and semiautomated strategy combining suspect and nontarget screening was applied to identify the prospective tps of kresoxim methyl firstly a suspect list of empirical tps including the information of formula exact mass and structure was constructed and imported into the expected compounds library including kresoxim methyl s known tps that have already been reported in regulatory documents efsa fao or have been proposed in relevant degradation studies pushkareva et al 2018 in addition the plausible structures predicted by eawag bbd pathway prediction system http eawag bbd ethz ch predict were also included secondly a nontarget screening was performed the details are described below a diversity of common reaction processes in organic chemistry and biochemistry including phase i i e hydroxylation oxidation reduction desaturation and hydration and phase ii reactions i e methylation sulfation and formylation were proposed to provide more chances generating new different tps for untargeted analysis the processing workflow was based on the modified metid w stats expected and unknown w background removal processing workflow fig s1 for suspect and untargeted profiling the workflow is able to extract all chromatographic peaks that includes compounds provided by expected compound library or tps generated through specified transformation steps align the chromatographic retention times of the input data files and predict the compositions and assign the molecular formula for each compound the blank samples were used for the subtraction of the background compounds fragment ion search fish scoring annotates structures onto spectra of interest to aid unknown identification more specifically mass frontier will generate fragments based on two resources general fragmentation rules and a fragmentation library comprising lots of fragmentation mechanisms collected from the scientific literature that assist the user to robustly predict in silico fragmentation patterns for each proposed structure with a score based on how well the structure explains the fragments observed in the unknown peak to obtain a high confidence identification of tps a very strict criterion has been established and detailed settings of detected compounds are as follows precursor ion mass tolerance 5 ppm product ion mass error 10 ppm retention time rt tolerance 0 1 min intensity tolerance isotope search 30 s n threshold 3 minimum peak intensity 100 000 ionization m h m na and m k base ions m h the group expected compounds or group compounds nodes combine similar compounds from all samples based on molecular weight and rt and select the best ms1 scan and its fragments for compositions prediction and compound identification merge features node can combine the expected and unknown compounds that the analysis found in one or more of the input files by using their chromatographic rt and m z values fill gaps node automatically corrects possible peak detection or alignment errors by searching for missing peaks and eventually if the blank to sample ratio is greater than 5 the background compounds are removed after data processing in compound discoverer data filters were applied to reduce and eliminate potentially insignificant features 2 7 toxicity evaluation of tps the most extensively used predicted model ecological structure activity relationships ecosar which predicts toxicity based on chemical structure similarity was applied to predict the acute and chronic toxicity for aquatic organisms in this study ecosar v 1 11 distributed by the us environmental protection agency epa was used determination of embryonic sublethal toxicity was performed according to the oecd guidelines oecd 2013 with slight changes 3 result and discussion 3 1 validation of extraction method recovery experiments of kresoxim methyl and bf490 1 in blank water buffer solution spiked with 0 01 mg kg 0 1 mg kg 1 mg kg and 10 mg kg were carried out for analytical method validation three replicates in every spiked level were conducted and the average recoveries and relative standard deviations rsds in different buffer solutions were obtained as shown in table s3 the mean recoveries of kresoxim methyl and bf490 1 from different aqueous solutions were in the range of 72 1 104 8 and the rsds were in the range of 0 5 7 9 demonstrating that it is a reliable method to quantify the concentrations of kresoxim methyl and bf490 1 significantly the recovery of kresoxim methyl at high ph condition was relatively low compared to other conditions this may be related to hydrolysis of kresoxim methyl in alkaline solutions resulting in the loss of target compound 3 2 degradation kinetics under relevant environmental conditions 3 2 1 kinetics of hydrolysis the hydrolysis kinetics were fitted by first order degradation kinetics model sfo and double first order in parallel model dfop respectively the equations of sfo eq 1 and dfop eq 3 models are as follows 1 c c 0 e k t 2 dt 50 ln 2 k ct mg kg is the concentration at time t and c0 mg kg is the initial concentration k is the first order rate constant h 1 or day 1 consequently the half life dt50 was calculated according to eq 2 3 c c 0 g e k 1 t 1 g e k 2 t g is the distributed fraction of the tested substance that degrades at fast rate the solution phase the rate constants k1 and k2 corresponds to the fast sub process solution phase and the slow sub process sorbed phase respectively the fitting parameters were shown in table s4 fig s1 shows the variation of kresoxim methyl concentrations at different ph values as a function of time under the condition of ph 4 the initial concentration of kresoxim methyl was 9 92 mg l and the concentration was 7 08 mg l on 90th day however in ph9 buffer the concentration of kresoxim methyl decreased from 9 98 mg l at the beginning of the experiment to 0 11 mg l on 5th day at all ph values degradation follows apparent bi phasic kinetics since kresoxim methyl disappear rapidly in the start of the experiment and then to stabilize more and disappear much more slowly this behavior might be related to an initial rapid sorption of kresoxim methyl to the brown bottles man et al 2021 the dt50 of kresoxim methyl at ph 4 ph 7 and ph 9 were 262 0 d 134 0 d and 0 5 d respectively just as in the case of other strobilurin fungicides such as trifloxystrobin liu et al 2014 and azoxystrobin liu et al 2012 the degradation of kresoxim methyl in aquatic solution was significantly affected by ph and higher ph strongly accelerate the hydrolysis rate because of the existence of ester bonds in the structures the result is consistent with previous study khandelwal et al 2016 suggesting that under alkaline conditions the fast hydrolysis of the ester linkage making it more prone to degradation 3 2 2 kinetics of photolysis direct photolysis of kresoxim methyl in all solutions with different ph values under xenon lamp irradiation was well described by sfo kinetics and good correlation coefficients were obtained table s5 the photodegradation half lives in ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 and ultrapure water were 74 3 h 15 0 h 3 4 h and 9 0 h respectively this rapid degradation of kresoxim methyl in ultrapure water can be attributed to the direct absorption of photons promoting the formation of electronically excited states and leading to the subsequent breakdown of kresoxim methyl jose villaverde et al 2018 in view of the hydrolysis behavior under alkaline conditions the photodegradation process was accompanied by hydrolysis the initial ph of the ultrapure water was 7 79 which proved that the solution was alkaline this may be the main reason for the difference of degradation of kresoxim methyl in ultrapure water and in ph 7 buffer with the further degradation ph decreased on the whole at the end of the experiment the ph of solution was 6 78 this probably due to carbon dioxide in the air dissolving in water it may also be the result of the dissociation of the transformation products in water making the solution slightly acidic ha fe3 and no3 are three typical classes of substances that can greatly affect the photochemical processes of organic pollutants occurring in natural waters boule et al 1999 in this study indirect photo transformation of kresoxim methyl under the simulated sunlight irradiation were further studied with different concentration of ha fe3 and no3 and the results are shown in fig 1 dt50 was determined using sfo model and the corresponding degradation rate constant k and correlation coefficient r2 were shown in the table s6 a lot of studies have demonstrated that ha displays different photochemical behavior in natural aquatic system it can act not only as photosensitizer to promote the photo transformation but also as efficient free radical quenchers or light screening agent to inhibit the photochemical process carlos et al 2012 yu et al 2010 as shown in fig 1 the degradation of kresoxim methyl was significantly inhibited by ha with the dt50 values increasing from 20 03 h for control to 36 10 h for 10 ppm ha suggesting that ha served as an inhibitor rather than a photosensitizer low concentration 10 μm 20 μm of fe3 resulted in a slightly increase in dt50 compared to control and the potential photodegradation catalysis of fe3 under simulated sunlight irradiation has been reported dabic et al 2022 but higher concentration 20 μm of fe3 slowed down the degradation rate and the inhibition effect increased with the increasing concentration of fe3 the hydrolyzation of fe3 leading to a shade of color in water and it may weaken the light intensity through aqueous solution thus affecting the photodegradation liu et al 2003 in a recent study the authors showed that the complex formed between pollutant and fe3 in fact diminished its photodegradation sciscenko et al 2021 nitrate has proved to be an efficient photosensitizer of organic pollutants accelerating the photodegradation rate calza et al 2012 in this study the presence of no3 in the solution increased the efficiency of photodegradation and an increasing concentration of no3 resulted in a decrease in half life a significant reduction in the photodegradation half lives of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate was also observed in aquatic environments containing no3 goncalves et al 2011 these water constituents coexist in natural waters and may affect the photodegradation of kresoxim methyl simultaneously for example fe3 can react with ha to form stable complexes in water to make photochemical reactions occur rapidly liu et al 2020 kresoxim methyl photolysis in natural water also followed the first order kinetics the results showed that photodegradation of km in river water ph 7 55 was enhanced compared to that in ultrapure water ph 7 76 under simulated solar irradiation the river water contains organic matter and more inorganic ions while there is no substances in ultrapure water although high ph condition was more favorable for degradation in aquatic environment dom as well as inorganic ions such as no3 fe3 and hco3 can affect the photodegradation of kresoxim methyl therefore it is necessary to consider the multivariate effects of the naturally occurring constituents in the future walse et al 2004 3 3 structural elucidation of tps due to the lack of potential tp standards the identification of prospective products by lchrms ms employed time dependent growth of chromatographic peaks which were unique in treated samples as the primary screening criteria based on the established screening identification method 18 tps were finally identified in batch experiments the chromatographic and mass information used to identify the tps of kresoxim methyl is summarized in table 1 and the confidence levels for the identified tps follow the scheme proposed by schymanski et al schymanski et al 2014a tps are discussed by grouping them according to their formation reactions 3 3 1 photoisomerization approximately 2 8 min before kresoxim methyl a compound was detected at m z 314 1391 leading to a molecular mass of 313 1308 and the extracted ion chromatogram is shown in fig 2 a accurate mass measurement for this tp gave the empirical formula of c18h19no4 indicating that this tp has the same molecular weight and identical chemical structure with parent compound furthermore it showed almost the same fragment ions with slightly different abundances in msms spectrum fig 2 c as kresoxim methyl fig 2 c it was observed in aquatic solutions with light irradiation and was identified as z isomer at the oxime ether double bond the main fragment ions m z 91 0546 c7h7 161 0467 c9h7no2 206 0812 c11h12no3 223 0983 c15h13no 282 1146 c17h16no3 in ms2 spectra were also consistent with the predicted fragment patterns oxime ethers are stable in the dark but reactive in light sevilla moran et al 2008 and the chromophores containing the c n bond presented in the structure of kresoxim methyl can undergo photoinduced isomerization freneau et al 2016 in fact the e z isomerization of the oxime ether group of kresoxim methyl is assumed to be a reaction catalyzed by light angeles et al 2021 3 3 2 hydrolysis of methyl ester a compound with the exact mass c17h17no4 m h 300 1227 showing a distinct peak at a retention time of 11 80 min lacks one carbon and two hydrogen atoms in comparison to parent compound suggesting the cleavage of the ester bond it was identified as one of main tps bf490 1 referred to as acid of kresoxim methyl in hydrolysis samples it was reported in the literature jmpr evaluation 2001 as well as contained in the suspected lists it can be seen from the ms ms spectra fig s3 that under the same condition of mass spectrometry bf490 1 and kresoxim methyl show many similar fragments and this is true with azoxystrobin and azoxystrobin acid kern et al 2009 the standard of bf490 1 was purchased for structure confirmation since it was commercially available as shown in fig 3 a the comparison of the chromatographic behavior and ms ms spectrometry of bf490 1 standard with those of compound in samples finally confirmed the proposed structure additionally tp315 fig s4 was identified as the monohydroxy tp of bf490 1 tp331 m z 332 1135 was observed under irradiation with formula of c17h17no6 illustrating the loss of ch2 and the addition of two oxygen atoms it can be explained by the hydrolysis of ester with subsequent oxidation of aryl methyl to corresponding benzyl alcohol and hydroxylation of aromatic ring although the specific position of hydroxyl group was not determined the structure with the highest fish score was finally selected as the tentative structure fig s5 3 3 3 hydroxylation as we all know hydroxyl addition is a common photo transformation pathway and secondary products can be formed by subsequent photolysis or hydrolysis kolodziej et al 2013 in photodegradation experiment tp329 with retention time of 11 80 min was characterized by m z 330 1331 indicating the empirical formula was c18h20no5 with the mass error of 1 66 ppm the addition of one oxygen atom to parent compound indicated tp329 was the result of hydroxylation reaction hydroxylation of kresoxim methyl may result from oxygen substituent of aromatic ring or the oxidation of the aryl methyl group to benzyl alcohol considering its high fish coverage score and its possible role as an intermediate in the formation of other tps tp329 was identified as the consequence of the oxidation of aryl methyl group to the corresponding benzyl alcohol fig s6 tp327 was detected as one of major tps in the photolysis experiment in view of the formula c18h17no5 of tp327 and the observed ms ms fragments it was identified as a product coming from the oxidation of the aryl methyl moiety to the corresponding aryl aldehyde the ms2 spectrum showed main fragment ions at m z 209 0835 c14h11no 237 0781 c15h11no2 252 1016 c16h14no2 265 0732 c16h11no3 and 296 0915 c17h14no4 and these experimental fragments were also consistent with the predicted fragments fig 4 a the cleavage of oxime ether moiety presented in tp327 structure led to the formation of tp297b which fits to the elemental formula c17h15no4 m h m z 298 1069 mass error 1 38 ppm the matching of matching of experimental and theoretical fragment patterns were shown in fig s7 3 3 4 cleavage of oxime ether tp283 was detected only in aquatic solution under light irradiation this compound showed the m h mass at 284 1277 with the molecular formula c17h17no3 and mass accuracy of 1 53 ppm suggesting the loss of ch2o group from kresoxim methyl molecule tp283 was inferred to be the result of cleavage of oxime ether moiety of the parent compound and the ms ms spectra was shown in fig s8 according to the study by sevilla moran et al 2008 imine structure can be formed by cleavage of n o bond in the structure of oxime ether because the covalent bond is relatively weak 3 3 5 reduction of oxime ether the ionization of tp271 c16h17no3 eluted at 10 73 min in positive ion mode with a mass accuracy of 1 43 ppm afforded a protonated molecule m h at m z 272 1275 and a sodiated molecular m na at m z 294 1090 this is valuable for the confirmation of its molecular weight it was formed in the process of photodegradation and the concentration increased with the increase of incubation time compared with kresoxim methyl the total degree of unsaturation of tp271 was reduced by 1 which might be attributed to the hydrogenation of oxime ether the loss of ch2 and och3 indicated the cleavage of ester and oxime ether moiety therefore the structure of tp271 can be explained by the hydrolysis of ester to carboxylic acid and the reduction of oxime ether to primary amine huang et al 2007 the main fragments are consistent with the theoretical fragment patterns fig s9 3 3 6 oxidation of oxime ether a formula of c17h16o5 tp300 from m z 301 1073 mass error 1 41 ppm was detected by q extractive ms in photolysis experiments showing no n atom in its structure the outcome was most likely a result of the oxidation of the oxime ether to carbonyl and the same reaction has also been reported in the literature shusterman honger and becker 2015 on the other hand hydroxylation also occurred in the structure and the fragment m z 195 0802 c14h11o indicated the presence of a benzyl alcohol group according to the information of fragment ions the reasonable chemical structure of tp300 was proposed fig s10 another tp named tp223c was detected at 13 52 min with formula of c15h13no mass error 1 41 ppm in hydrolysis and photodegradation experiment the total degree of unsaturation was the same as the parent compound with the loss of three oxygen atoms and its main fragments m z 116 0496 with the formula of c8h6n and m z 209 0833 with the formula of c14h11on were generated by the cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether and the loss of aryl methyl group fig s11 the reasonable chemical structure of tp223c should consist of cyanogen moiety meanwhile referring to the metabolite structures of trifloxystrobin provided in jmpr jmpr evaluation 2004 the structure of this tp was identified as 2 o tolyloxy methyl benzonitrile and it was confirmed by the authentic standard the matching of the retention time and ms ms spectra was shown in fig 3 b 3 3 7 cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether bond the characteristic ion peak of the positively charged tp221 exhibited at m z 222 0759 m h representing a sum formula of c11h11no4 with the mass error of 1 05 ppm the loss of seven carbon atoms demonstrated the cleavage of the benzyl phenyl ether bridge of the parent molecular this tp was most likely a result of the cleavage of the benzyl phenyl ether followed by further oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde the fragmentation pattern of tp221 was predicted by mass frontier to verify the elucidated structure and most of the predicted fragments were coincident with those obtained from the experiment fig 4 b adachi et al 2018 investigated the photodegradation of mandestrobin and also found that the cleavage of benzyl ether bond preferentially occurred under direct photolysis tp207 tp134 tp163 tp191 and tp191b were all identified as a consequence of the cleavage of the benzyl phenyl ether bond with different further reactions such as oxidation cleavage or reduction of the oxime ether moiety and cyclodehydration the ms ms spectra are shown in fig 4 c fig s12 fig 4 d and fig s13 respectively interestingly the oxidation of oxime ether acetate moiety to carboxylic acid and subsequent intramolecular esterification resulted in the formation of tp134 the fragment patterns of these proposed structures were predicted based on the general fragmentation rules and fragmentation library and satisfactory spectral matching were obtained between an experimental fragmentation spectrum and a predicted fragmentation pattern 3 4 proposed transformation pathways the degradation pathways for abiotic transformation of kresoxim methyl were proposed shown in fig 5 on the basis of the chemical structures of those identified tps at the same time the order in which tps appear in the degradation process should be properly taken into account for hydrolysis experiment the only degradation pathway of hydrolyzation of methyl ester was observed under dark conditions the quantitative analysis results of the main tp bf490 1 indicated that kresoxim methyl was readily transformed to bf490 1 under alkaline conditions and on the 90th day the content of bf490 1 reached 96 2 of the applied amount of parent fig s16 however the amount of bf490 1 did not exceed 1 of the applied amount of parent throughout the whole experiment under acidic conditions which is consistent with the results of the disappearance of the parent compound phototransformation including different reactions is likely the major degradation pathway for kresoxim methyl in aquatic solutions like another strobilurin fungicide trifloxystrobin banerjee et al 2006 kresoxim methyl possesses methoxyacetamide structure which is vulnerable and easily to be subjected to chemical reactions and give birth to various tps it has been concluded that photodegradation of kresoxim methyl is mainly initiated by photoisomerization pathway1 p1 hydrolyzation of ester pathway 2 p2 hydroxylation pathway 3 p3 cleavage of oxime ether pathway 4 p4 and cleavage of benzyl ether pathway 5 p5 in pathway 1 kresoxim methyl is rapidly photolyzed to form z kresoxim methyl through the photoisomerization and this is a common transformation reaction under light irradiation in many structures that possess c c double bonds or c n double bonds banerjee et al 2005 kwon and armbrust 2005 sevilla moran et al 2010 the dynamics of z kresoxim methyl indicates that it is also sensitive to undergo photodegradation pathway 2 rises from the hydrolyzation of the ester moiety into carboxyl kresoxim methyl is rapidly transformed to bf490 1 which is the major tp in hydrolysis process successive decarboxylation and reduction of bf490 1 lead to the formation of tp223c and tp271 respectively bf490 1 can also be hydroxylated into the monohydroxy product tp315 which is transformed into tp301 through the process of hydrolyzation of oxime ether group in pathway 3 tp329 is one of monohydroxy species which was formed as a consequence of the hydroxylation of the aryl methyl moiety subsequently tp329 was transformed through oxidation of the benzyl alcohol resulting in the formation of corresponding aryl aldehyde tp327 which was further transformed to imine derivative tp297b by the cleavage of the n o bond the cleavage of oxime ether bond generating imine moiety has been also observed in cyclohexanedione herbicides such as sethoxydim sandin espana et al 2015 clethodim sevilla moran et al 2010 and alloxydim villaverde et al 2018 pathway 4 leads directly to tp283 and consequently to the cleavage of oxime ether moiety presented in kresoxim methyl structure then tp283 gives tp300 by the hydrolyzation of imine moiety huang and zhang huang and zhang 2019 reported that the hydrolyzation of imine moiety can results in carbonyl ketone it is noteworthy that the cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether with further oxidation of benzyl alcohol leads to the formation of tp191 pathway 5 is the formation of tp221 via cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether group with further oxidation of the benzyl alcohol then the reaction is followed by the cleavage of oxime ether moiety which results in the formation of tp191 moreover the formation of tp221 into cyclic ester tp134 may go through a multi step reaction which includes hydrolyzation oxidation and intramolecular esterification further oxidation of benzaldehyde of tp191 leads to the formation of tp207 which would be transformed to tp191b via intramolecular dehydration and the appearance of tp163 is a result of several steps such as hydrolyzation reduction and intramolecular dehydration 3 5 toxicity assessment as a variety of tps were produced during the photodegradation process of kresoxim methyl and it is important to investigate and compare the ecotoxicity of these tps with the parent compound in this study the aquatic toxicity of kresoxim methyl and its transformation intermediates was estimated by ecosar model the lowest toxicity values corresponding to the highest toxic potential were chosen for a more conservative assessment the obtained lc50 or ec50 values of kresoxim methyl were all far below 1 0 mg l which classified it as a very toxic compound lc50 ec50 1 0 mg l in accordance with the toxicity classification criteria of globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs table s7 cui et al 2017 reported that kresoxim methyl was very toxic to daphnia magna with 443 3 µg l of 48 h ec50 and 20 µg l of the lowest observed effect concentration for reproduction the experimental toxicities were well agreed with predicted values indicating that the ecosar program is suitable to evaluate the toxicities of kresoxim methyl and its tps in view of the serious acute and chronic toxicological effects of kresoxim methyl on aquatic organisms at three trophic levels the aquatic toxicity of its tps should be considered seriously as shown in fig 6 in silico toxicity prediction resulted in all tps possessing lower toxicity to aquatic organisms at three trophic levels compared with parent compound kresoxim methyl due to the increased lc50 or ec50 values however many of them were still classified as very toxic or toxic the toxicity of z kresoxim methyl was predicted to be the same with e kresoxim methyl because ecosar program estimates the toxicity of a compound on the basis of its chemical similarity with other compounds nika et al 2017 the actual difference in toxicity caused by isomer transformation needs further study the acute toxicities of some of tps with small molecular weight such as tp207 tp191 tp191b tp271 tp163 and tp134 were all in not harmful category and this may result from the significant change in the toxophoric region of the parent molecule however attention needs to be paid to the chronic toxicity of those tps with low chv values to assess their long term effects on aquatic organisms notably bf490 1 tp315 tp301 tp221 tp327 and tp329 were all very toxic to the three aquatic organisms which suggested that we may have underestimated the environmental hazards of kresoxim methyl and the role of its tps in the environment should be given more attention sublethal toxicity test of zebrafish embryos was conducted for the samples before 0 h during 12 h and after 48 h photodegradation to determine changes in toxicity during degradation of kresoxim methyl the results are shown in fig s16 high malformation rates fig s16 a were observed after treatment with 0 1 mg l of kresoxim methyl 0 h before photodegradation suggesting high toxicity to zebrafish embryos when embryos were exposed to the reaction solution of 48 h the malformation rate 96 hpf was significantly decreased p 0 05 but it still had a significant effect on the malformation rate of embryos compared to control group p 0 05 the inhibition of body length and heartbeat was significantly reduced by the mixture after photodegradation 48 h compared with the initial solution 0 h nonetheless it had a significant effect on heartbeat of zebrafish embryos compared with control group in general the analysis of sub lethal effects such as malformation rate body length and heartbeat demonstrated that the toxicity of samples after photodegradation to zebrafish embryos is significantly decreased compared with the samples before photodegradation it also proves that the degradation of kresoxim methyl is a process of toxicity reduction which is consistent with the predicted results however the mixed solution after photodegradation still has an adverse effect on zebrafish embryos so it is necessary to further strengthen the research on environmental risk assessment of kresoxim methyl and its transformation products 4 conclusion overall kresoxim methyl was unstable in alkaline solutions and readily transformed to the main tp bf490 1 in the dark it was prone to photochemical reactions under simulated sunlight and the photolysis behavior was easily affected by several natural water factors such as ha fe3 and no3 18 tps generated from different transformation pathways including photoisomerization hydrolyzation of methyl ester hydroxylation cleavage of oxime ether and cleavage of benzyl ether were tentatively identified and two of them were confirmed by authentic standards showing the good performance of the semi automated workflow ecosar analyses illustrated that some of tps were still toxic or very toxic to aquatic organisms even though they exhibit lower aquatic toxicity compared to the parent compound further investigations should be conducted regarding the environmental risk assessment of the formed tps from kresoxim methyl this study filled in the data gaps of environmental fate and risk assessment of kresoxim methyl to a certain extent the integrated strategy combining suspect and nontarget screening by hrms applied in this work provides a valuable reference for the identification of pesticide tps for a large number of fungicides used in the field we believe that it is necessary to strengthen the study of their natural degradation process in the environment more specifically continuous research is needed to systematically elucidate the fate and transformation of those fungicides with high risk to aquatic life and the toxicological impacts of their tps because some tps may retain the toxophore of the parent compound in the transformation process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14958,in this study abiotic transformation of an important strobilurin fungicide kresoxim methyl was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions for the first time by studying its kinetics of hydrolysis and photolysis degradation pathways and toxicity of possibly formed transformation products tps the results indicated that kresoxim methyl showed a fast degradation in ph9 solutions with dt50 of 0 5 d but relatively stable under neutral or acidic environments in the dark it was prone to photochemical reactions under simulated sunlight and the photolysis behavior was easily affected by different natural substances such as humic acid ha fe3 and no3 which are ubiquitous in natural water showing the complexity of degradation mechanisms and pathways of this chemical compound the potential multiple photo transformation pathways via photoisomerization hydrolyzation of methyl ester hydroxylation cleavage of oxime ether and cleavage of benzyl ether were observed 18 tps generated from these transformations were structurally elucidated based on an integrated workflow combining suspect and nontarget screening by high resolution mass spectrum hrms and two of them were confirmed with reference standards most of tps as far as we know have never been described before the in silico toxicity assessment showed that some of tps were still toxic or very toxic to aquatic organisms although they exhibit lower aquatic toxicity compared to the parent compound therefore the potential hazards of the tps of kresoxim methyl merits further evaluation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords kresoxim methyl abiotic transformation transformation products hrms toxicity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fungicides are commonly used in seed treatment and foliar spraying to reduce the damage of fungal pathogens to a variety of crops however after application more than 60 of fungicides enter into soil han et al 2021 and can easily reach the aquatic compartments with surface runoff which may pose potential threat to aquatic organisms due to their highly toxicity cui et al 2017 zubrod et al 2019 in recent years due to the widely distribution of pesticides in different environmental compartments and their toxicity to non target organisms pesticide pollution has attracted considerable attention from research communities bollmann et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 therefore more information is urgently needed to better understand the environmental fate and behavior of fungicides zubrod et al 2019 there is emerging evidence indicated that fungicides can undergo various abiotic degradation photochemical transformation and hydrolysis forming numerous transformation products in natural water tps anagnostopoulou et al 2022 fenner et al 2013 photolysis plays an important role in the degradation of chemicals in the natural aqueous environment it is reported that the organic and inorganic components such as dissolved organic matter dom fe3 and no3 which are ubiquitous in natural water can affect the photodegradation of pesticide emidio et al 2017 humic acid ha is the main component of dom with concentrations of 0 mg l 50 mg l dissolved organic carbon xia et al 2009 no3 is usually present in natural waters with concentrations ranging from 10 5 to 10 3 m mao et al 2011 most often the concentration of fe3 was in the range of 10 6 10 4 m dong and hu 2016 it is necessary to explore the influence mechanism of different environmental factors on photodegradation of pesticides so as to predict the fate of pesticides in the environment kresoxim methyl is a representative strobilurin fungicide and widely used to control various crop diseases e g white mold rot early and late leaf spot with rapid and efficient bactericidal activity feng et al 2020 nevertheless environmental pollution and toxicity on non target organisms caused by long term use of strobilurin fungicides have raised serious public health problems li et al 2016 wang et al 2021 kresoxim methyl is often detected in different environmental compartments as reported in the literature it has a maximum concentration of 2 9 µg l in 20 central european streams liess and von der ohe 2005 some studies have shown that kresoxim methyl has high toxicity to aquatic organisms such as daphnia magna and zebrafish and it can cause damage to daphnia magna at environmentally relevant concentrations cui et al 2017 mao et al 2020 relevant studies reported that the tps may have similar or even higher toxicity than their parent forms serving as potential environmental pollutants under natural conditions gutowski et al 2015 hensen et al 2020 sinclair and boxall 2003 the main tp of kresoxim methyl reported in soil is acid of kresoxim methyl bf490 1 which is slightly more toxic than the parent compound in the acute oral rat study efsa 2010 therefore the consideration of only parent pesticides could lead to an underestimation of environmental risks of these contaminants however to date there is still great uncertainty about the structure and toxicity of potential tps of kresoxim methyl generated from abiotic transformation most tps of pesticides are unknown unknowns whose structures are unknown and they are usually not included in chemical databases thus the identification of these compounds requires advanced instruments and effective analytical strategies brunner et al 2019 in recent years integrated strategy of suspect and nontarget screening methods are successfully developed to identified tps of contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals psoma et al 2021 wang et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that the development and the use of non target screening method based on powerful high resolution mass spectrum hrms has been the driving force in the development of innovative analytical methods for identifying pesticide tps bletsou et al 2015 in contrast to purposefully matching of mass spectra peaks in targeted routine monitoring strategies non target screening involves all masses that detected in samples without any reference or prior information about the compounds krauss et al 2010 schymanski et al 2014b the hrms with higher selectivity and sensitivity can provide high quality accuracy and resolution in full scan mode and the accurate mass measurements of molecular ions and the high sensitivity detection of ms ms fragments are more conducive to the elucidation of unknown analyte structures huntscha et al 2014 furthermore pesticide transformation experiments in the laboratory can be regarded as systems with well controlled boundary conditions and unknown structures that are closely related to the parent compound unknow peaks that are significantly different from the control sample or that have regular changes over time can be considered as chemically significant structures in such cases identification of tps by hrms can usually be considered definitive krauss et al 2010 in addition in silico toxicity assessment as a promising and cost effective approach is becoming more and more popular because experimental in vivo or in vitro toxicity assessment methods are expensive and time consuming trawinski and skibinski 2017 quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model widely used in toxicity prediction of tps has been proved to be an effective method for preliminary toxicity assessment yang et al 2021 many tps of fungicides have not yet been identified there is a large knowledge gap about their environmental fate and ecotoxicity kang et al 2020 overall the objectives of this study were to 1 gain a more complete picture of kresoxim methyl abiotic transformation in aquatic environments and 2 to assess the toxicity of transformation products of kresoxim methyl by in silico quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model the influences of three typical classes of field substances ha fe3 and no3 that may affect the photochemical processes were firstly evaluated under simulated sunlight by using xenon arc lamp related hydrolysis and direct photolysis products were structurally characterized by uhplc q exactive ms to help to elucidate the transformation pathways of kresoxim methyl in aquatic environments furthermore preliminary assessment on tps ecotoxicity was performed with in silico quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model to the best of knowledge this is the first study to ascertain the abiotic transformation behavior and toxicity assessment of kresoxim methyl in aquatic environments the results will be of great significance for environmental fate prediction and risk assessment of kresoxim methyl 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and

et al 2021 in this study the comprehensive and semiautomated strategy combining suspect and nontarget screening was applied to identify the prospective tps of kresoxim methyl firstly a suspect list of empirical tps including the information of formula exact mass and structure was constructed and imported into the expected compounds library including kresoxim methyl s known tps that have already been reported in regulatory documents efsa fao or have been proposed in relevant degradation studies pushkareva et al 2018 in addition the plausible structures predicted by eawag bbd pathway prediction system http eawag bbd ethz ch predict were also included secondly a nontarget screening was performed the details are described below a diversity of common reaction processes in organic chemistry and biochemistry including phase i i e hydroxylation oxidation reduction desaturation and hydration and phase ii reactions i e methylation sulfation and formylation were proposed to provide more chances generating new different tps for untargeted analysis the processing workflow was based on the modified metid w stats expected and unknown w background removal processing workflow fig s1 for suspect and untargeted profiling the workflow is able to extract all chromatographic peaks that includes compounds provided by expected compound library or tps generated through specified transformation steps align the chromatographic retention times of the input data files and predict the compositions and assign the molecular formula for each compound the blank samples were used for the subtraction of the background compounds fragment ion search fish scoring annotates structures onto spectra of interest to aid unknown identification more specifically mass frontier will generate fragments based on two resources general fragmentation rules and a fragmentation library comprising lots of fragmentation mechanisms collected from the scientific literature that assist the user to robustly predict in silico fragmentation patterns for each proposed structure with a score based on how well the structure explains the fragments observed in the unknown peak to obtain a high confidence identification of tps a very strict criterion has been established and detailed settings of detected compounds are as follows precursor ion mass tolerance 5 ppm product ion mass error 10 ppm retention time rt tolerance 0 1 min intensity tolerance isotope search 30 s n threshold 3 minimum peak intensity 100 000 ionization m h m na and m k base ions m h the group expected compounds or group compounds nodes combine similar compounds from all samples based on molecular weight and rt and select the best ms1 scan and its fragments for compositions prediction and compound identification merge features node can combine the expected and unknown compounds that the analysis found in one or more of the input files by using their chromatographic rt and m z values fill gaps node automatically corrects possible peak detection or alignment errors by searching for missing peaks and eventually if the blank to sample ratio is greater than 5 the background compounds are removed after data processing in compound discoverer data filters were applied to reduce and eliminate potentially insignificant features 2 7 toxicity evaluation of tps the most extensively used predicted model ecological structure activity relationships ecosar which predicts toxicity based on chemical structure similarity was applied to predict the acute and chronic toxicity for aquatic organisms in this study ecosar v 1 11 distributed by the us environmental protection agency epa was used determination of embryonic sublethal toxicity was performed according to the oecd guidelines oecd 2013 with slight changes 3 result and discussion 3 1 validation of extraction method recovery experiments of kresoxim methyl and bf490 1 in blank water buffer solution spiked with 0 01 mg kg 0 1 mg kg 1 mg kg and 10 mg kg were carried out for analytical method validation three replicates in every spiked level were conducted and the average recoveries and relative standard deviations rsds in different buffer solutions were obtained as shown in table s3 the mean recoveries of kresoxim methyl and bf490 1 from different aqueous solutions were in the range of 72 1 104 8 and the rsds were in the range of 0 5 7 9 demonstrating that it is a reliable method to quantify the concentrations of kresoxim methyl and bf490 1 significantly the recovery of kresoxim methyl at high ph condition was relatively low compared to other conditions this may be related to hydrolysis of kresoxim methyl in alkaline solutions resulting in the loss of target compound 3 2 degradation kinetics under relevant environmental conditions 3 2 1 kinetics of hydrolysis the hydrolysis kinetics were fitted by first order degradation kinetics model sfo and double first order in parallel model dfop respectively the equations of sfo eq 1 and dfop eq 3 models are as follows 1 c c 0 e k t 2 dt 50 ln 2 k ct mg kg is the concentration at time t and c0 mg kg is the initial concentration k is the first order rate constant h 1 or day 1 consequently the half life dt50 was calculated according to eq 2 3 c c 0 g e k 1 t 1 g e k 2 t g is the distributed fraction of the tested substance that degrades at fast rate the solution phase the rate constants k1 and k2 corresponds to the fast sub process solution phase and the slow sub process sorbed phase respectively the fitting parameters were shown in table s4 fig s1 shows the variation of kresoxim methyl concentrations at different ph values as a function of time under the condition of ph 4 the initial concentration of kresoxim methyl was 9 92 mg l and the concentration was 7 08 mg l on 90th day however in ph9 buffer the concentration of kresoxim methyl decreased from 9 98 mg l at the beginning of the experiment to 0 11 mg l on 5th day at all ph values degradation follows apparent bi phasic kinetics since kresoxim methyl disappear rapidly in the start of the experiment and then to stabilize more and disappear much more slowly this behavior might be related to an initial rapid sorption of kresoxim methyl to the brown bottles man et al 2021 the dt50 of kresoxim methyl at ph 4 ph 7 and ph 9 were 262 0 d 134 0 d and 0 5 d respectively just as in the case of other strobilurin fungicides such as trifloxystrobin liu et al 2014 and azoxystrobin liu et al 2012 the degradation of kresoxim methyl in aquatic solution was significantly affected by ph and higher ph strongly accelerate the hydrolysis rate because of the existence of ester bonds in the structures the result is consistent with previous study khandelwal et al 2016 suggesting that under alkaline conditions the fast hydrolysis of the ester linkage making it more prone to degradation 3 2 2 kinetics of photolysis direct photolysis of kresoxim methyl in all solutions with different ph values under xenon lamp irradiation was well described by sfo kinetics and good correlation coefficients were obtained table s5 the photodegradation half lives in ph 4 ph 7 ph 9 and ultrapure water were 74 3 h 15 0 h 3 4 h and 9 0 h respectively this rapid degradation of kresoxim methyl in ultrapure water can be attributed to the direct absorption of photons promoting the formation of electronically excited states and leading to the subsequent breakdown of kresoxim methyl jose villaverde et al 2018 in view of the hydrolysis behavior under alkaline conditions the photodegradation process was accompanied by hydrolysis the initial ph of the ultrapure water was 7 79 which proved that the solution was alkaline this may be the main reason for the difference of degradation of kresoxim methyl in ultrapure water and in ph 7 buffer with the further degradation ph decreased on the whole at the end of the experiment the ph of solution was 6 78 this probably due to carbon dioxide in the air dissolving in water it may also be the result of the dissociation of the transformation products in water making the solution slightly acidic ha fe3 and no3 are three typical classes of substances that can greatly affect the photochemical processes of organic pollutants occurring in natural waters boule et al 1999 in this study indirect photo transformation of kresoxim methyl under the simulated sunlight irradiation were further studied with different concentration of ha fe3 and no3 and the results are shown in fig 1 dt50 was determined using sfo model and the corresponding degradation rate constant k and correlation coefficient r2 were shown in the table s6 a lot of studies have demonstrated that ha displays different photochemical behavior in natural aquatic system it can act not only as photosensitizer to promote the photo transformation but also as efficient free radical quenchers or light screening agent to inhibit the photochemical process carlos et al 2012 yu et al 2010 as shown in fig 1 the degradation of kresoxim methyl was significantly inhibited by ha with the dt50 values increasing from 20 03 h for control to 36 10 h for 10 ppm ha suggesting that ha served as an inhibitor rather than a photosensitizer low concentration 10 μm 20 μm of fe3 resulted in a slightly increase in dt50 compared to control and the potential photodegradation catalysis of fe3 under simulated sunlight irradiation has been reported dabic et al 2022 but higher concentration 20 μm of fe3 slowed down the degradation rate and the inhibition effect increased with the increasing concentration of fe3 the hydrolyzation of fe3 leading to a shade of color in water and it may weaken the light intensity through aqueous solution thus affecting the photodegradation liu et al 2003 in a recent study the authors showed that the complex formed between pollutant and fe3 in fact diminished its photodegradation sciscenko et al 2021 nitrate has proved to be an efficient photosensitizer of organic pollutants accelerating the photodegradation rate calza et al 2012 in this study the presence of no3 in the solution increased the efficiency of photodegradation and an increasing concentration of no3 resulted in a decrease in half life a significant reduction in the photodegradation half lives of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate was also observed in aquatic environments containing no3 goncalves et al 2011 these water constituents coexist in natural waters and may affect the photodegradation of kresoxim methyl simultaneously for example fe3 can react with ha to form stable complexes in water to make photochemical reactions occur rapidly liu et al 2020 kresoxim methyl photolysis in natural water also followed the first order kinetics the results showed that photodegradation of km in river water ph 7 55 was enhanced compared to that in ultrapure water ph 7 76 under simulated solar irradiation the river water contains organic matter and more inorganic ions while there is no substances in ultrapure water although high ph condition was more favorable for degradation in aquatic environment dom as well as inorganic ions such as no3 fe3 and hco3 can affect the photodegradation of kresoxim methyl therefore it is necessary to consider the multivariate effects of the naturally occurring constituents in the future walse et al 2004 3 3 structural elucidation of tps due to the lack of potential tp standards the identification of prospective products by lchrms ms employed time dependent growth of chromatographic peaks which were unique in treated samples as the primary screening criteria based on the established screening identification method 18 tps were finally identified in batch experiments the chromatographic and mass information used to identify the tps of kresoxim methyl is summarized in table 1 and the confidence levels for the identified tps follow the scheme proposed by schymanski et al schymanski et al 2014a tps are discussed by grouping them according to their formation reactions 3 3 1 photoisomerization approximately 2 8 min before kresoxim methyl a compound was detected at m z 314 1391 leading to a molecular mass of 313 1308 and the extracted ion chromatogram is shown in fig 2 a accurate mass measurement for this tp gave the empirical formula of c18h19no4 indicating that this tp has the same molecular weight and identical chemical structure with parent compound furthermore it showed almost the same fragment ions with slightly different abundances in msms spectrum fig 2 c as kresoxim methyl fig 2 c it was observed in aquatic solutions with light irradiation and was identified as z isomer at the oxime ether double bond the main fragment ions m z 91 0546 c7h7 161 0467 c9h7no2 206 0812 c11h12no3 223 0983 c15h13no 282 1146 c17h16no3 in ms2 spectra were also consistent with the predicted fragment patterns oxime ethers are stable in the dark but reactive in light sevilla moran et al 2008 and the chromophores containing the c n bond presented in the structure of kresoxim methyl can undergo photoinduced isomerization freneau et al 2016 in fact the e z isomerization of the oxime ether group of kresoxim methyl is assumed to be a reaction catalyzed by light angeles et al 2021 3 3 2 hydrolysis of methyl ester a compound with the exact mass c17h17no4 m h 300 1227 showing a distinct peak at a retention time of 11 80 min lacks one carbon and two hydrogen atoms in comparison to parent compound suggesting the cleavage of the ester bond it was identified as one of main tps bf490 1 referred to as acid of kresoxim methyl in hydrolysis samples it was reported in the literature jmpr evaluation 2001 as well as contained in the suspected lists it can be seen from the ms ms spectra fig s3 that under the same condition of mass spectrometry bf490 1 and kresoxim methyl show many similar fragments and this is true with azoxystrobin and azoxystrobin acid kern et al 2009 the standard of bf490 1 was purchased for structure confirmation since it was commercially available as shown in fig 3 a the comparison of the chromatographic behavior and ms ms spectrometry of bf490 1 standard with those of compound in samples finally confirmed the proposed structure additionally tp315 fig s4 was identified as the monohydroxy tp of bf490 1 tp331 m z 332 1135 was observed under irradiation with formula of c17h17no6 illustrating the loss of ch2 and the addition of two oxygen atoms it can be explained by the hydrolysis of ester with subsequent oxidation of aryl methyl to corresponding benzyl alcohol and hydroxylation of aromatic ring although the specific position of hydroxyl group was not determined the structure with the highest fish score was finally selected as the tentative structure fig s5 3 3 3 hydroxylation as we all know hydroxyl addition is a common photo transformation pathway and secondary products can be formed by subsequent photolysis or hydrolysis kolodziej et al 2013 in photodegradation experiment tp329 with retention time of 11 80 min was characterized by m z 330 1331 indicating the empirical formula was c18h20no5 with the mass error of 1 66 ppm the addition of one oxygen atom to parent compound indicated tp329 was the result of hydroxylation reaction hydroxylation of kresoxim methyl may result from oxygen substituent of aromatic ring or the oxidation of the aryl methyl group to benzyl alcohol considering its high fish coverage score and its possible role as an intermediate in the formation of other tps tp329 was identified as the consequence of the oxidation of aryl methyl group to the corresponding benzyl alcohol fig s6 tp327 was detected as one of major tps in the photolysis experiment in view of the formula c18h17no5 of tp327 and the observed ms ms fragments it was identified as a product coming from the oxidation of the aryl methyl moiety to the corresponding aryl aldehyde the ms2 spectrum showed main fragment ions at m z 209 0835 c14h11no 237 0781 c15h11no2 252 1016 c16h14no2 265 0732 c16h11no3 and 296 0915 c17h14no4 and these experimental fragments were also consistent with the predicted fragments fig 4 a the cleavage of oxime ether moiety presented in tp327 structure led to the formation of tp297b which fits to the elemental formula c17h15no4 m h m z 298 1069 mass error 1 38 ppm the matching of matching of experimental and theoretical fragment patterns were shown in fig s7 3 3 4 cleavage of oxime ether tp283 was detected only in aquatic solution under light irradiation this compound showed the m h mass at 284 1277 with the molecular formula c17h17no3 and mass accuracy of 1 53 ppm suggesting the loss of ch2o group from kresoxim methyl molecule tp283 was inferred to be the result of cleavage of oxime ether moiety of the parent compound and the ms ms spectra was shown in fig s8 according to the study by sevilla moran et al 2008 imine structure can be formed by cleavage of n o bond in the structure of oxime ether because the covalent bond is relatively weak 3 3 5 reduction of oxime ether the ionization of tp271 c16h17no3 eluted at 10 73 min in positive ion mode with a mass accuracy of 1 43 ppm afforded a protonated molecule m h at m z 272 1275 and a sodiated molecular m na at m z 294 1090 this is valuable for the confirmation of its molecular weight it was formed in the process of photodegradation and the concentration increased with the increase of incubation time compared with kresoxim methyl the total degree of unsaturation of tp271 was reduced by 1 which might be attributed to the hydrogenation of oxime ether the loss of ch2 and och3 indicated the cleavage of ester and oxime ether moiety therefore the structure of tp271 can be explained by the hydrolysis of ester to carboxylic acid and the reduction of oxime ether to primary amine huang et al 2007 the main fragments are consistent with the theoretical fragment patterns fig s9 3 3 6 oxidation of oxime ether a formula of c17h16o5 tp300 from m z 301 1073 mass error 1 41 ppm was detected by q extractive ms in photolysis experiments showing no n atom in its structure the outcome was most likely a result of the oxidation of the oxime ether to carbonyl and the same reaction has also been reported in the literature shusterman honger and becker 2015 on the other hand hydroxylation also occurred in the structure and the fragment m z 195 0802 c14h11o indicated the presence of a benzyl alcohol group according to the information of fragment ions the reasonable chemical structure of tp300 was proposed fig s10 another tp named tp223c was detected at 13 52 min with formula of c15h13no mass error 1 41 ppm in hydrolysis and photodegradation experiment the total degree of unsaturation was the same as the parent compound with the loss of three oxygen atoms and its main fragments m z 116 0496 with the formula of c8h6n and m z 209 0833 with the formula of c14h11on were generated by the cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether and the loss of aryl methyl group fig s11 the reasonable chemical structure of tp223c should consist of cyanogen moiety meanwhile referring to the metabolite structures of trifloxystrobin provided in jmpr jmpr evaluation 2004 the structure of this tp was identified as 2 o tolyloxy methyl benzonitrile and it was confirmed by the authentic standard the matching of the retention time and ms ms spectra was shown in fig 3 b 3 3 7 cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether bond the characteristic ion peak of the positively charged tp221 exhibited at m z 222 0759 m h representing a sum formula of c11h11no4 with the mass error of 1 05 ppm the loss of seven carbon atoms demonstrated the cleavage of the benzyl phenyl ether bridge of the parent molecular this tp was most likely a result of the cleavage of the benzyl phenyl ether followed by further oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde the fragmentation pattern of tp221 was predicted by mass frontier to verify the elucidated structure and most of the predicted fragments were coincident with those obtained from the experiment fig 4 b adachi et al 2018 investigated the photodegradation of mandestrobin and also found that the cleavage of benzyl ether bond preferentially occurred under direct photolysis tp207 tp134 tp163 tp191 and tp191b were all identified as a consequence of the cleavage of the benzyl phenyl ether bond with different further reactions such as oxidation cleavage or reduction of the oxime ether moiety and cyclodehydration the ms ms spectra are shown in fig 4 c fig s12 fig 4 d and fig s13 respectively interestingly the oxidation of oxime ether acetate moiety to carboxylic acid and subsequent intramolecular esterification resulted in the formation of tp134 the fragment patterns of these proposed structures were predicted based on the general fragmentation rules and fragmentation library and satisfactory spectral matching were obtained between an experimental fragmentation spectrum and a predicted fragmentation pattern 3 4 proposed transformation pathways the degradation pathways for abiotic transformation of kresoxim methyl were proposed shown in fig 5 on the basis of the chemical structures of those identified tps at the same time the order in which tps appear in the degradation process should be properly taken into account for hydrolysis experiment the only degradation pathway of hydrolyzation of methyl ester was observed under dark conditions the quantitative analysis results of the main tp bf490 1 indicated that kresoxim methyl was readily transformed to bf490 1 under alkaline conditions and on the 90th day the content of bf490 1 reached 96 2 of the applied amount of parent fig s16 however the amount of bf490 1 did not exceed 1 of the applied amount of parent throughout the whole experiment under acidic conditions which is consistent with the results of the disappearance of the parent compound phototransformation including different reactions is likely the major degradation pathway for kresoxim methyl in aquatic solutions like another strobilurin fungicide trifloxystrobin banerjee et al 2006 kresoxim methyl possesses methoxyacetamide structure which is vulnerable and easily to be subjected to chemical reactions and give birth to various tps it has been concluded that photodegradation of kresoxim methyl is mainly initiated by photoisomerization pathway1 p1 hydrolyzation of ester pathway 2 p2 hydroxylation pathway 3 p3 cleavage of oxime ether pathway 4 p4 and cleavage of benzyl ether pathway 5 p5 in pathway 1 kresoxim methyl is rapidly photolyzed to form z kresoxim methyl through the photoisomerization and this is a common transformation reaction under light irradiation in many structures that possess c c double bonds or c n double bonds banerjee et al 2005 kwon and armbrust 2005 sevilla moran et al 2010 the dynamics of z kresoxim methyl indicates that it is also sensitive to undergo photodegradation pathway 2 rises from the hydrolyzation of the ester moiety into carboxyl kresoxim methyl is rapidly transformed to bf490 1 which is the major tp in hydrolysis process successive decarboxylation and reduction of bf490 1 lead to the formation of tp223c and tp271 respectively bf490 1 can also be hydroxylated into the monohydroxy product tp315 which is transformed into tp301 through the process of hydrolyzation of oxime ether group in pathway 3 tp329 is one of monohydroxy species which was formed as a consequence of the hydroxylation of the aryl methyl moiety subsequently tp329 was transformed through oxidation of the benzyl alcohol resulting in the formation of corresponding aryl aldehyde tp327 which was further transformed to imine derivative tp297b by the cleavage of the n o bond the cleavage of oxime ether bond generating imine moiety has been also observed in cyclohexanedione herbicides such as sethoxydim sandin espana et al 2015 clethodim sevilla moran et al 2010 and alloxydim villaverde et al 2018 pathway 4 leads directly to tp283 and consequently to the cleavage of oxime ether moiety presented in kresoxim methyl structure then tp283 gives tp300 by the hydrolyzation of imine moiety huang and zhang huang and zhang 2019 reported that the hydrolyzation of imine moiety can results in carbonyl ketone it is noteworthy that the cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether with further oxidation of benzyl alcohol leads to the formation of tp191 pathway 5 is the formation of tp221 via cleavage of benzyl phenyl ether group with further oxidation of the benzyl alcohol then the reaction is followed by the cleavage of oxime ether moiety which results in the formation of tp191 moreover the formation of tp221 into cyclic ester tp134 may go through a multi step reaction which includes hydrolyzation oxidation and intramolecular esterification further oxidation of benzaldehyde of tp191 leads to the formation of tp207 which would be transformed to tp191b via intramolecular dehydration and the appearance of tp163 is a result of several steps such as hydrolyzation reduction and intramolecular dehydration 3 5 toxicity assessment as a variety of tps were produced during the photodegradation process of kresoxim methyl and it is important to investigate and compare the ecotoxicity of these tps with the parent compound in this study the aquatic toxicity of kresoxim methyl and its transformation intermediates was estimated by ecosar model the lowest toxicity values corresponding to the highest toxic potential were chosen for a more conservative assessment the obtained lc50 or ec50 values of kresoxim methyl were all far below 1 0 mg l which classified it as a very toxic compound lc50 ec50 1 0 mg l in accordance with the toxicity classification criteria of globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs table s7 cui et al 2017 reported that kresoxim methyl was very toxic to daphnia magna with 443 3 µg l of 48 h ec50 and 20 µg l of the lowest observed effect concentration for reproduction the experimental toxicities were well agreed with predicted values indicating that the ecosar program is suitable to evaluate the toxicities of kresoxim methyl and its tps in view of the serious acute and chronic toxicological effects of kresoxim methyl on aquatic organisms at three trophic levels the aquatic toxicity of its tps should be considered seriously as shown in fig 6 in silico toxicity prediction resulted in all tps possessing lower toxicity to aquatic organisms at three trophic levels compared with parent compound kresoxim methyl due to the increased lc50 or ec50 values however many of them were still classified as very toxic or toxic the toxicity of z kresoxim methyl was predicted to be the same with e kresoxim methyl because ecosar program estimates the toxicity of a compound on the basis of its chemical similarity with other compounds nika et al 2017 the actual difference in toxicity caused by isomer transformation needs further study the acute toxicities of some of tps with small molecular weight such as tp207 tp191 tp191b tp271 tp163 and tp134 were all in not harmful category and this may result from the significant change in the toxophoric region of the parent molecule however attention needs to be paid to the chronic toxicity of those tps with low chv values to assess their long term effects on aquatic organisms notably bf490 1 tp315 tp301 tp221 tp327 and tp329 were all very toxic to the three aquatic organisms which suggested that we may have underestimated the environmental hazards of kresoxim methyl and the role of its tps in the environment should be given more attention sublethal toxicity test of zebrafish embryos was conducted for the samples before 0 h during 12 h and after 48 h photodegradation to determine changes in toxicity during degradation of kresoxim methyl the results are shown in fig s16 high malformation rates fig s16 a were observed after treatment with 0 1 mg l of kresoxim methyl 0 h before photodegradation suggesting high toxicity to zebrafish embryos when embryos were exposed to the reaction solution of 48 h the malformation rate 96 hpf was significantly decreased p 0 05 but it still had a significant effect on the malformation rate of embryos compared to control group p 0 05 the inhibition of body length and heartbeat was significantly reduced by the mixture after photodegradation 48 h compared with the initial solution 0 h nonetheless it had a significant effect on heartbeat of zebrafish embryos compared with control group in general the analysis of sub lethal effects such as malformation rate body length and heartbeat demonstrated that the toxicity of samples after photodegradation to zebrafish embryos is significantly decreased compared with the samples before photodegradation it also proves that the degradation of kresoxim methyl is a process of toxicity reduction which is consistent with the predicted results however the mixed solution after photodegradation still has an adverse effect on zebrafish embryos so it is necessary to further strengthen the research on environmental risk assessment of kresoxim methyl and its transformation products 4 conclusion overall kresoxim methyl was unstable in alkaline solutions and readily transformed to the main tp bf490 1 in the dark it was prone to photochemical reactions under simulated sunlight and the photolysis behavior was easily affected by several natural water factors such as ha fe3 and no3 18 tps generated from different transformation pathways including photoisomerization hydrolyzation of methyl ester hydroxylation cleavage of oxime ether and cleavage of benzyl ether were tentatively identified and two of them were confirmed by authentic standards showing the good performance of the semi automated workflow ecosar analyses illustrated that some of tps were still toxic or very toxic to aquatic organisms even though they exhibit lower aquatic toxicity compared to the parent compound further investigations should be conducted regarding the environmental risk assessment of the formed tps from kresoxim methyl this study filled in the data gaps of environmental fate and risk assessment of kresoxim methyl to a certain extent the integrated strategy combining suspect and nontarget screening by hrms applied in this work provides a valuable reference for the identification of pesticide tps for a large number of fungicides used in the field we believe that it is necessary to strengthen the study of their natural degradation process in the environment more specifically continuous research is needed to systematically elucidate the fate and transformation of those fungicides with high risk to aquatic life and the toxicological impacts of their tps because some tps may retain the toxophore of the parent compound in the transformation process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14959,iron sulfide fes has been widely used to reduce toxic cr vi into cr iii in anoxic aquatic environments where ph could strongly influence cr vi removal however it remains unclear how ph regulates the fate and transformation of fes under oxic conditions and the immobilization of cr vi the results of this study showed that typical ph conditions of natural aquatic environment significantly affected the mineral transformation of fes under acidic conditions fes was principally transformed to goethite amarantite and elemental sulfur with minor lepidocrocite through proton promoted dissolution and oxidation instead under basic conditions the main products were lepidocrocite and elemental sulfur via surface mediated oxidation in typical acidic or basic aquatic environment the pronounced pathway for the oxygenation of fes solids may alter their ability to remove cr vi longer oxygenation impeded cr vi removal at acidic ph and a decreasing ability to reduce cr vi caused a drop in cr vi removal performance cr vi removal decreased from 733 16 to 36 82 mg g 1 with the duration of fes oxygenation increasing to 5760 min at ph 5 0 in contrast newly generated pyrite from brief oxygenation of fes improved cr vi reduction at basic ph followed by a drop in cr vi removal performance due to the impaired reduction capacity with increasing to the complete oxygenation cr vi removal increased from 669 58 to 804 83 mg g 1 with increasing oxygenation time to 5 min and then decreased to 26 27 mg g 1 after the full oxygenation for 5760 min at ph 9 0 these findings provide insight into the dynamic transformation of fes in oxic aquatic environments with various phs and the impact on cr vi immobilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pollution remediation iron sulfides oxygenation mineral transformation hexavalent chromium ph effects data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iron sulfide fes minerals have been found widely in anoxic sediments and subsurface environments rickard and luther 2007 rickard et al 2017 under reductive conditions sulfate and fe iii may be reduced by sulfate reducing bacteria with the formation of nanoparticulate fes rickard and morse 2005 natural and synthetic fes nanoparticles nps can effectively immobilize or convert toxic contaminants including hexavalent chromium cr vi in aquatic environments and soil gong et al 2014 2016 wang et al 2019a fes as an electron donor can reduce toxic cr vi to cr iii which can be precipitated with the formation of solid cr oh 3 and crxfe1 x oh 3 wang et al 2019a the impacts of environmental conditions on cr vi immobilization by fes particles have been reported widely among them ph is a significant and critical factor jo et al 2008 park et al 2022 patterson et al 1997 wang et al 2019a lower ph can lead to a higher cr vi removal efficiency because 1 h acts as a reactant and higher h concentrations increase cr vi reduction as shown in eqs 1 4 park et al 2022 patterson et al 1997 wang et al 2019a and 2 higher h concentrations can protonate the surface of fes particles to become more positively charged with the enhanced adsorption of cr vi chiriţă et al 2008 jo et al 2008 the reductive immobilization of cr vi to cr iii by iron sulfides under anoxic conditions has been widely studied such as pyrite liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019b yang et al 2017 pyrrhotite ali et al 2014 yang et al 2017 greigite liu et al 2019 amorphous fes patterson et al 1997 and amorphous fes2 li et al 2016 and the effects of influencing factors including ph on the cr vi removal were explored the immobilization behaviors of cr vi by iron sulfides under oxic conditions begin to attract attention the intrusion of air supplies o2 due to natural or anthropogenic processes such as mixing at the water sediment interface water table fluctuation and groundwater recharge which leads to frequent transitions from anoxic to oxic in the sediments and

chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 however the influence of ph on the dynamic mineral transformation of fes under oxic conditions and its effect on the cr vi removal remains poorly understood 1 fes s

2007 sung and morgan 1980 in surface water ph values ranged from 5 5 to 9 0 generally lamit and tanaka 2022 luo et al 2022 whereas in groundwater they showed the main variation ranges of 5 0 8 7 xiao et al 2021 yan et al 2021 soil ph values ranged mainly from 4 5 to 8 5 in countries and regions such as china russia and north america chen et al 2019 hengl 2018 low ph values namely high h concentrations can accelerate the dissolution of fes solids into aqueous fe ii and s ii with the formation of h2s gas when the ph value is lower than 7 0 jeong et al 2010 wu et al 2020 whereas the dissolution may be weak and negligible when ph value exceeds 8 0 rickard and luther 2007 chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 in addition the oxidation of aqueous fe ii by do was accelerated with increasing ph value from 4 0 to 9 0 morgan and lahav 2007 and lepidocrocite γ feooh replaced goethite α feooh as the main solid product luo et al 2018 sung and morgan 1980 for the oxidation of aqueous sulfide by do the reaction rate increased and reached the peak of 23 6 m 0 9 h 1 at ph 8 0 followed by a drop to 7 4 m 0 9 h 1 with ph values ranging from 6 0 to 9 4 and s0 s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 are the main products chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 besides fes dissolution and solution phase oxidation at acidic ph solid surface reactions may occur at basic ph altering the composition of the secondary minerals of fes solids chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 in acidic solutions fes is oxidized through solution phase oxidation following fes dissolution to α feooh and elemental sulfur s0 eq 5 jeong et al 2010 or additional ferrihydrite and γ feooh chiriţă et al 2008 moreover mackinawite fes can be also oxidized into magnetite fe3o4 and s0 at acidic ph eq 6 zhang et al 2021 in contrast at neutral ph the oxygenation of fes yields γ feooh and s0 eq 7 cheng et al 2016 jeong et al 2010 or pyrite α feooh and s0 within 2 5 h eqs 5 and 8 benning et al 2000 at basic ph fes solids can form γ feooh and s0 in the solution upon exposure to air via solid surface oxidation eq 7 jeong et al 2010 mineral phases after the oxygenation of fes differ with ph from acidic to

adsorption on co precipitation with and incorporation into iron oxides and the fenton like mobilization of cr iii to cr vi for the minerals formed from the oxygenation of fes acidic conditions favored not only the cr vi reduction by fes pyrite and magnetite he and traina 2005 wang et al 2019a 2019b but the removal of cr vi using ferrihydrite α feooh and γ feooh through adsorption co precipitation and incorporation johnston and chrysochoou 2012 mamun et al 2017 wu et al 2016 xie et al 2015 in our recent work increasing h concentration could contribute to the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi in the oxic fes systems because it increased the higher yield of hydroxyl radicals oh as the main responsible oxidant through fenton like reactions wang et al 2022 nevertheless the immobilization behaviors of cr vi by minerals formed from fes at acidic and basic ph are poorly understood despite their importance in the drop in cr vi levels therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the roles of ph in the dynamic transformation of fes solids in a typical aquatic environment 2 to elucidate the pathways underlying the oxygenation of fes at typical phs and 3 to demonstrate the ph related cr vi immobilization behaviors by the resulting minerals from fes oxidation we choose the ph range from 5 0 to 9 0 as the representative environments from acidic to basic this work hypothesizes that h may act as a reactant and affect the mineral transformation of fes via proton promoted dissolution and oxidation or surface mediated oxidation and further alter the cr vi immobilization behaviors 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ammonium iron ii sulfate fe nh4 2 so4 2 and sodium sulfide nonahydrate na2s 9h2o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was purchased from chengdu kelong chemical reagent factory sterile water was prepared by putting submersible ultraviolet lamps 5 w 220 v with a wavelength of 254 nm into deionized di water 18 25 mω cm for 48 h all the other reagents used were of analytical grade or higher the suspensions of nano scale fes were prepared under anoxic conditions following our previous work wang et al 2022 and the resultant stock suspension of approximately 20 g l 1 was sealed and stored in the n2 filled glass containers before use 2 2 batch tests for the oxygenation of fes oxygenation of fes was carried out in a 1000 ml five neck reactor enwrapped with aluminum foil and the experimental setup was shown in fig s1 the batch kinetic tests were initiated by adding the pre determined volume of stock fes suspension into the reactor corresponding to an initial suspension of 1 0 g l 1 11 4 mm the suspension was stirred at 1000 rpm using a teflon coated magnetic stirrer and continuously bubbled with ultrapure nitrogen gas 99 999 pure for 60 min to maintain an initial do of nearly zero then the reactor was exposed to the atmosphere the solution ph was adjusted with 0 1 m hydrochloric acid and 0 1 m sodium hydroxide solutions to values from 5 0 7 0 to 9 0 the changes in ph were no more than 0 2 units during the oxygenation the total amounts of hcl added at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 24 3 18 6 and 5 9 ml respectively corresponding to the cl concentrations of 1 94 0 37 and 0 12 mm at the predetermined time do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured and three suspension samples were withdrawn one was transferred into a vial and photographed immediately to record the change of visual appearance until it had no significant change another sample was to determine s0 after methanol extraction as detailed in text s1 in supporting information fes solids can be dissolved into aqueous fe ii and s ii huang et al 2021b jeong et al 2010 in addition aqueous fe iii s0 s2o3 2 and so4 2 as the main solution phase products were reported in the oxidation of iron sulfides minerals by do cheng et al 2016 chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 moon et al 2017 thus a third sample was used to analyze aqueous fe ii total aqueous fe aqueous s ii s2o3 2 and so4 2 after filtered immediately through a 0 05 μm nylon membrane aqueous fe iii was calculated as the difference between total aqueous fe and aqueous fe ii text s1 shows the detailed analytical methods of aqueous species of fe and s additional parallel batch tests were also carried out to obtain the solids from the oxic fes system at a specific time the suspension in the reactor was filtered immediately through a 0 05 μm nylon membrane the resulting slurry was washed with deoxygenated water three times and freeze dried for 48 h the dried solids were then stored for the analysis of mössbauer spectroscopy xrd xps and tem as detailed in text s1 2 3 cr vi removal by pristine and oxygenated fes the oxygenated fes was prepared from the oxic fes systems after oxygenation times of 5 60 120 240 720 and 5760 min batch tests for cr vi removal were conducted at similar ph values with the oxygenation of fes in section 2 2 cr vi solution of 24 69 0 45 mm was bubbled with n2 for 30 min before the addition of 1 0 g l 1 pristine or oxygenated fes suspension at specific time intervals aqueous cr vi was measured after the sample was filtered with 0 05 μm nylon syringe filters at the equilibrium the solid products were filtered with a 0 22 μm nylon membrane washed three times with deoxygenated water and then freeze dried for 48 h before xrd and xps analysis simultaneously cr vi and total cr in both aqueous solution and solid products were determined as described in text s1 then the mass balance of cr species was analyzed to determine cr vi removal performances of pristine and oxygenated fes as detailed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of appearance and secondary minerals of fes in oxic solution at typical acidic and basic conditions iron bearing minerals usually have inherent visual appearances cornell and schwertmann 2003 as fes is transformed into various secondary minerals in an oxidizing environment benning et al 2000 boursiquot et al 2001 jeong et al 2010 its appearance changes as fig 1 shows there was a progressive appearance difference between acidic and basic conditions at ph 5 0 the color of fes suspension changed from black to blackish green over 120 min then turned to milky white at 150 min followed by a gradual change to brownish red after 240 min however at ph 9 0 the black color of fes suspension persisted for 150 min before turning progressively to grayish green by 180 min then to reddish brown at 240 min and finally to dark orange after 720 min at ph 7 0 the change in appearance was similar to that at ph 9 0 while it was accelerated thus ph substantially affects the change in the appearance of fes suspension orp increased and gradually approached the stable level of 242 8 mv at ph 5 0 149 5 mv at ph 7 0 and 20 2 mv at ph 9 0 with do surging to an equilibrium level of about 7 8 mg l 1 over 5760 min figs s2a and b the stable appearance orp and do following the oxygenation suggest that the fes was transformed completely fig s3 shows the composition of the secondary minerals formed from fes through xrd analysis α feooh amarantite γ feooh and s0 were the main mineral phases at ph 5 0 mössbauer spectroscopy proportions of 62 α feooh 30 amarantite and 8 γ feooh among the total solid fe fig s2c at ph 7 0 and 9 0 in contrast the final dominant minerals were γ feooh and s0 which agrees with the findings of previous work jeong et al 2010 therefore ph significantly affects the oxygenation of fes judging by the distinct differences in the visual appearance and secondary mineral composition in addition in the ph range from 5 0 to 9 0 these similar results of both visual appearance and secondary minerals at ph 7 0 and 9 0 prompted the subsequent work to focus on mineral transformation at acidic and basic ph levels 3 2 dynamic mineral transformation of fes 3 2 1 characteristics analysis of minerals fig s4 shows the difference in the mineralogy of fes between acidic and basic conditions during the oxygenation and the quantitative mineral phase composition is determined through the rietveld refinement of xrd patterns in which the least square method is used to fit the structural and peak shape parameters of the known reference phase will 2006 fig 2 and table s2 show the significant temporal evolution of fes based on the quantitative phase analysis at ph 5 0 the crystalline fes gradually decreased to an undetectable level within the initial 120 min with new pyrrhotite fe7s8 appearing after 5 min that increased to a maximum of 68 1 of the total at 15 min then dropped and disappeared at 240 min s0 emerged at 5 min and gradually increased to a maximum of 79 8 of the total at 240 min before decreasing to between 20 0 and 26 2 after 1440 min where it held nearly constant at 60 min a hydrosulfate green rust gr so4 phase appeared which gradually increased to a peak content of 23 0 at 120 min before decreasing to below the detection limit at 1440 min jeong et al 2010 amarantite and α feooh emerged at 120 min and persisted for the remainder of the experiment the α feooh content increased to 33 1 at 5760 min with a simultaneous rise in amarantite content to 36 7 γ feooh appeared at 240 min and remained at a relatively constant level of 8 6 13 3 for up to 5760 min the final solids of the fes transformation were dominated by α feooh amarantite of ferric sulfate mineral γ feooh and s0 goethite and ferric sulfate mineral are the typical minerals phases in acid rich environments such as acid mine drainage and acid sulfate soils frost et al 2013 luo et al 2018 park et al 2016 in contrast at ph 9 0 fes decreased to 6 6 within 120 min and entirely disappeared by 240 min fes2 fe7s8 fe3s4 s0 and fibroferrite appeared at 5 min when fes accounted for 41 3 of the total and fes2 for 50 7 s0 increased to 23 3 at 240 min where it stabilized fe7s8 and fes2 persisted until 15 min but both disappeared by 60 min a fe3s4 phase increased to 38 3 at 60 min and then decreased entirely by 240 min γ feooh emerged at 15 min and increased to a stable 76 7 81 9 after 240 min at 5760 min γ feooh and s0 were the dominant mineral phases jeong et al 2010 accounting for 77 4 and 22 6 respectively tem characterization is applied to show the morphological changes moreover to illustrate the spatial distribution of minerals tem is combined with xrd analysis following the procedures 1 identification of the interplanar spacing from the lattice fringe in the high resolution tem image 2 determination of the other interplanar spacing by the diffraction peak in the xrd pattern and 3 proofreading and matching of those interplanar spacings figs 3 and 4 illustrate the morphological changes and the spatial distribution of minerals during the oxygenation of fes the pristine fes occurred as nanosized ellipsoidal particles with characteristic lattice planes of 101 and 001 at ph 5 0 figs 3 and s5 the fes ellipsoids collapsed into irregular spheres with a concave surface within 60 min because of proton dissolution rickard and luther 2007 fe7s8 with lattice planes of 101 and 104 emerged on the concave surface and gr so4 appeared on the irregular spheres at 60 min confirmed by a 009 lattice plane after 120 min of oxygenation the particles became starfish shaped with α feooh with a 103 lattice plane on the disk gr so4 with a 110 lattice plane on the fringe of the disk amarantite with a 103 lattice plane on the wrists and plate like noncrystalline fe oh 3 on the fringe of wrists the fe to o atomic ratio in the eds analysis fig s6 was 0 33 with negligible s very close to that of fe oh 3 the noncrystalline phase was identified from the selected area electron diffraction pattern as the oxygenation time increased to 240 min flocs were present with lath like α feooh with a 111 lattice plane plate like gr so4 with a 110 lattice plane and needle like amarantite with a 010 lattice plane there were also irregular block like aggregates of α feooh and amarantite surrounded by a small amount of nano scale γ feooh platelets with a 210 lattice plane at the end of the experiments comparatively at ph 9 0 figs 4 and s7 the ellipsoidal nanoparticles formed a distinct core shell structure within 60 min jeong et al 2010 the layers of the amorphous phase fes2 with a 200 lattice plane and fe3s4 with a 400 lattice plane from outside to inside appeared after 5 min the amorphous phase might be identified as fe ii fe iii sulfate mineral by the coexisting fe o and s in eds analysis fig s8 and the presence of fe2 so4 3 and fe ii s bonds in xps analysis see fig s10c s0 was identified with a 202 lattice plane after 60 min of oxygenation a layer of fe3s4 with a 400 lattice plane was found between the fes core and the surrounding crystalline layer of γ feooh with a 020 lattice plane the block like oxygenated fes at 120 min also shows the core shell structure and a layer of γ feooh with a 210 lattice plane could be identified on the fe3s4 which disappeared after 120 min after 240 min of oxygenation nano scale crystalline γ feooh was observed in the mostly lath like and plate like morphologies cornell and schwertmann 2003 s0 as a product of fes oxygenation was not found in the high resolution tem images at any ph while confirmed by xrd analysis figs s3 s4 and 2 which was attributed to the sublimation of s0 under the high intensity electron beam irradiation matsubara et al 2009 as previously reported wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 cornell and schwertmann 2003 it is concluded that at ph 5 0 α feooh with the positively charged surface phpzc 8 2 could adsorb negatively charged s0 particles phpzc 3 0 3 6 to form the aggregates wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 the phpzc value of γ feooh is 7 1 7 5 usually cornell and schwertmann 2003 at ph 9 0 s0 with the negatively charged surface was not absorbed to γ feooh due to the electrostatic repulsion and it remained dispersed in the suspension in addition xps analysis reveals a similar pathway to the synergistic oxidation of s ii and fe ii at ph values of 5 0 and 9 0 figs s9 s11 text s2 fe ii is quickly oxidized by the do to fe iii which subsequently oxidizes s ii with fe ii regenerated eqs 9 and 10 cheng et al 2016 rickard and luther 2007 9 o 2 4 h 4 fe ii 2 h 2 o 4 fe iii 10 s ii 2 fe iii s 0 2 fe ii 3 2 2 aqueous fe and s species fig s12 shows the species of fe and s in aqueous solution at ph values of 5 0 and 9 0 profiles of fe ii and total fe in the aqueous solution overlapped fig s13 indicating that fe ii was the main species of aqueous fe change in aqueous fe ii was found to be distinct between ph 5 0 and ph 9 0 fig s12a at ph 5 0 aqueous fe ii rapidly increased to the peak value of 8 41 mm at 240 min where it accounted for 73 8 of total fe and the majority of total fe was present in the solution phase then it gradually decreased to below the detection level at 3600 min which indicates that fe ii might be oxidized to fe iii under persistent oxidizing conditions and or resorbed on the secondary minerals an et al 2017 however at ph 9 0 aqueous fe ii was below the detection limit with no significant fe present in the solution phase jeong et al 2010 aqueous fe iii remained at the low levels of 0 3 mm at ph 5 0 and below the detection limit at ph 9 0 fig s12a which was attributed to its consumption by the fe iii bearing phase formation as confirmed by xrd analysis figs s2 s3 and 2 baes and mesmer 1976 the change in aqueous s ii was similar to that of aqueous fe ii fig s12b at ph 5 0 aqueous s ii peaked at 5 44 mm after 5 min accounted for 47 7 of the total s and decreased to the undetectable level at 60 min simultaneously a strong rotten egg odor was smelled at the beginning of the reaction implying the rapid volatilization of the dissolved hydrogen sulfide released from fes dissolution eq 11 chiriţă et al 2008 rickard and luther 2007 instead at ph 9 0 no detectable level of aqueous s ii persisted during the oxygenation of fes combined with the negligible level of aqueous fe ii fig s12a the dissolution of fes might be weak and negligible at ph 9 0 jeong et al 2010 11 fes 2 h fe ii aq h 2 s aq the s0 increased rapidly to the highest concentration then dropped and finally remained fairly constant fig s12c at ph values of 5 0 and 9 0 s0 reached the peak concentrations of 9 08 mm at 120 min and 6 55 mm at 240 min accordingly corresponding to 79 6 and 57 5 of total s as the reaction proceed the final concentrations of 7 39 and 6 18 mm within 5760 min accordingly accounted for 64 8 and 54 2 of total s indicating that s ii in fes was mainly transformed to s0 moreover it was verified that acidic conditions could favor the formation of s0 and weaken the production of s2o3 2 and so4 2 eqs 12 15 chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 12 2 h 2 s aq o 2 2 s 0 2 h 2 o 13 2 h 2 s aq 2 o 2 s 2 o 3 2 h 2 o 2 h 14 h 2 s aq 2 o 2 so 4 2 2 h 15 2 s 0 2 s 2 o 3 2 7 o 2 4 h 2 o 6 so 4 2 8 h aqueous s2o3 2 increased initially and then decreased to the undetectable level under basic conditions whereas it remained below the detection limit for the full experiment duration under acidic conditions fig s12d at ph 9 0 s2o3 2 peaked at 1 09 mm within 720 min and then decreased and disappeared at 2880 min as shown in eqs 13 and 15 chen and morris 1972 jeong et al 2010 lefers et al 1978 s2o3 2 occurred as an intermediate in the oxidation of s ii to so4 2 the decline of s2o3 2 may have resulted from the conversion to so4 2 which was confirmed by the increasing so4 2 fig s12e in addition the increasing peak concentration of s2o3 2 with the rising ph indicated that basic conditions favored its formation eq 13 chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 aqueous so4 2 decreased and remained at very low levels after the initial rising under acidic conditions whereas it increased initially and tended to the stable level under acidic and basic conditions fig s12e at ph 5 0 aqueous so4 2 reached the maximum of 0 18 mm at 120 min then it decreased and remained at a low level of 0 02 mm because of the transfer to the solid phase with the formation of amarantite as a ferric sulfate mineral figs 2 and s4a at ph 9 0 aqueous so4 2 increased and reached constant levels of 0 46 mm 3 3 typical pathways of the oxygenation of fes pathways for the transformation of fes varied significantly with ph as proposed in fig 5 at acidic ph fes was oxidized mainly via solution phase oxidation following proton promoted dissolution fes first released fe ii and s ii into the solution through dissolution at high proton concentration eq 11 figs s12a and b rickard and luther 2007 simultaneously fes was partially transformed to fe7s8 figs 2 and 3 aqueous sulfide was volatilized partially as h2s gas and also oxidized rapidly to s0 and so4 2 eqs 12 15 figs s12b c and e chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 aqueous fe ii was oxidized gradually into fe iii by do with the formation of the low solubility fe iii bearing minerals including amorphous fe oh 3 α feooh amarantite and gr so4 baes and mesmer 1976 jeong et al 2010 in addition the amarantite and gr so4 generated could consume so4 2 leading to the decrease of so4 2 fig s12e as the reactions proceeded the oxidation of fe ii continued with the complete oxidation of s ii to s0 which decreased to a relatively stable level due to the low oxidation rate fig s12c jeong et al 2010 in addition gr so4 transformed to γ feooh and minor α feooh which might release so4 2 into the solution eq 16 inoue et al 2007 however so4 2 remained stable at nearly zero after first rising and then dropping fig s12e this could be attributed to the regeneration of amarantite fig 2 finally the dominant minerals were block like aggregates of α feooh amarantite and s0 and minor plate like γ feooh figs 2 and 3 in summary fes was principally transformed to amorphous fe oh 3 fe7s8 and gr so4 as the intermediates which finally yielded α feooh amarantite s0 and minor γ feooh additionally several processes were involved including the formation of h2s gas dissolution of fes solids the oxidation of released fe ii and s ii and precipitation reactions 16 fe ii 4 fe iii 2 oh 12 s o 4 o 2 6 feooh 2 h so 4 2 2 h 2 o at basic ph fes was mostly oxidized through surface mediated oxidation the dissolution of fes at low proton was weak and aqueous fe ii and s ii remained undetectable throughout the experiments figs s12a and b rickard and luther 2007 the rapid oxidation of fe ii under basic conditions led any fe ii in the fes to be oxidized initially to form an amorphous fe ii fe iii sulfate layer on fes particles figs 4 s8 and s10c jeong et al 2010 s ii reduced fe iii to form s0 generating synergy in the oxidation of fe ii and s ii eqs 9 and 10 cheng et al 2016 rickard and luther 2007 it could also reduce o2 with the formation of s2o3 2 and so4 2 multiple layers of amorphous fe ii fe iii sulfate mineral overlaying fes2 and fe3s4 appeared on fes particles with traces of fe7s8 fig 4 then multiple layers of γ feooh over fe3s4 appeared accompanied by a drop in fes and an increase in γ feooh and fe3s4 fig 2 as the oxidation reaction proceeded s2o3 2 and s0 in the solution could react to form so4 2 eq 15 figs s12c e chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 the secondary s0 and lath like and platelet like γ feooh minerals were present in the final reaction jeong et al 2010 in summary fes was transformed mainly via the intermediates of amorphous fe ii fe iii sulfate fe7s8 fes2 and fe3s4 into γ feooh and s0 with a minor amount of so4 2 3 4 immobilization of cr vi by pristine and oxygenated fes a kinetic study of cr vi removal shows that aqueous cr vi decreased rapidly in the initial 5 min and gradually to a stable level within 120 min fig 6 a and b the fes oxygenated for 60 min exhibited better cr vi removal than fes oxygenated for 120 min fig s14 fig 6c and d show the performance for cr vi removal by pristine and oxygenated fes longer oxygenation of fes slowed the cr vi removal at acidic ph instead fes oxygenated at basic ph showed an improvement before a subsequent drop at ph 5 0 cr vi removal performance slightly decreased from 733 16 to 683 53 mg g 1 with increasing oxygenation time to 60 min and rapidly to 36 82 mg g 1 after 5760 min of oxygenation fig 6c meanwhile at ph 9 0 it increased from 669 58 to 804 83 mg g 1 with increasing oxygenation time to 5 min and then decreased to 26 27 mg g 1 after 5760 min of oxygenation fig 6d thus there was a distinct difference in cr vi removal by oxygenated fes between acidic and basic conditions the exact reasons need subsequent elucidation xrd and xps analysis show that cr iii and cr vi were the main cr species using fes oxygenated for 240 min and cr existed as cr vi mainly using fes oxygenated for 5760 min figs s15 s18 table s3 indicating that reduction and sorption of cr vi were involved using fes oxygenated briefly while cr vi sorption occurred using fes oxygenated longer in addition fenton like reactions occur in the oxygenation of fes leading to the production of oh radicals cheng et al 2016 huang et al 2021a wang et al 2022 in the removal of cr vi by fes under oxic conditions the generation of oh was found fig s19 after a lag time it then increased and gradually decreased which was consistent with the production of oh in the oxygenation of fes cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the cumulative oh increased and reached the stable level when cr vi removal reached the equilibrium fig s19 oh as a strong oxidant can potentially oxidize cr iii to cr vi wang et al 2022 however the presence of methanol as a free radical quencher did not significantly affect the cr vi removal by either pristine or oxygenated fes fig 7 which indicates the negligible roles of ros reactive oxygen species in the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi during cr vi removal thus reduction and sorption mainly contributed to the immobilization of cr vi based on the mass balance of cr species fig 8 a and b table s4 performances for cr vi reduction and sorption are presented in fig 8c and d cr vi reduction showed a similar change to cr vi removal with a trend of downward at ph 5 0 and rise fall at 9 0 moreover for fes oxygenated less than 240 min both cr vi removal and reduction changed significantly and synchronously notably a close linear correlation between cr vi reduction and removal was obtained for the oxygenated fes r2 0 99 figs s20 indicating that cr vi reduction might play an important role in cr vi removal cr vi sorption remained at a minor level of 11 of cr vi removal by fes oxygenated within 240 min whereas by fes oxygenated for 5760 min sorption accounted for 70 figs s21 it was therefore concluded that reduction dominated the cr vi removal mainly for fes oxygenated briefly and sorption prevailed for fes oxygenated completely cr vi reduction by fes oxygenated less than 60 min was better than that with fes oxygenated longer indicating that the fes oxygenation time remarkably affects cr vi reduction thus the minerals present in the transformation pathways already explained in section 3 3 can result in the pronounced changes in cr vi reduction the longer oxygenation time of fes at acidic ph the lower cr vi reduction performance of the oxygenated fes the theoretical cr vi reduction capacity of fe7s8 was 1845 54 mg g 1 close to 1772 59 mg g 1 of fes and higher than 109 01 mg g 1 of gr so4 based on eqs 1 3 17 and 18 as shown in text s3 ali et al 2014 thomas et al 2018 wang et al 2019a yang et al 2017 when fes was oxygenated for 5 min fes and fe7s8 were the main mineral phases accounting for 94 6 with reductive mineral phases decreasing by 5 4 fig 2 that leads to a slight drop in cr vi reduction and removal figs 6c 8a and c when fes was oxygenated for 60 min the total weight percentage of reductive fes fe7s8 and gr so4 decreased to zero and finally iron oxyhydroxides amarantite and s0 were formed with negligible reduction capacity for cr vi fig 2 which resulted into the rapid decrease in cr vi reduction and removal

decreased rapidly fig 2 the newly generated phase of fes2 disappeared at 60 min whereas fe3s4 with the less cr vi reduction capacity and fes remained fig 2 that is why longer oxygenation time impaired cr vi reduction and removal figs 6d 8b and d 4 conclusions this study investigated the sensitivity of ph during the dynamic mineral transformation of fes under oxic conditions and the impacts of the corresponding transformation on cr vi immobilization increasing ph can change the mechanisms of fes oxygenation from proton dissolution and oxidation to surface mediated oxidation in the typical ph range from 5 0 to 9 0 fes was principally oxidized to α feooh amarantite and s0 with minor γ feooh under acidic conditions but γ feooh and s0 under basic conditions in typical acidic or basic environment the pronounced pathway for the oxygenation of fes solids may affect their ability to remove cr vi longer oxygenation of fes impeded the cr vi removal at ph 5 0 whereas cr vi removal by stepwise oxidized fes shows a rise fall trend at ph 9 0 at acidic ph a longer duration of fes oxygenation triggered the decreasing ability to reduce cr vi and led to a drop in cr vi removal at basic ph the brief oxygenation of fes would produce fes2 which can improve cr vi reduction and removal subsequently the impaired reduction capacity with the prolonged oxygenation time resulted in a declining removal of cr vi the findings of this study present a new understanding of the oxygenation of iron sulfides and the fate of cr in oxic aquatic environments under acidic or basic conditions moreover h modulated pre oxygenation may provide a better strategy and method to design the engineered nanomaterials of iron sulfides for remediation of cr vi contaminated water resulting in maximum

14959,iron sulfide fes has been widely used to reduce toxic cr vi into cr iii in anoxic aquatic environments where ph could strongly influence cr vi removal however it remains unclear how ph regulates the fate and transformation of fes under oxic conditions and the immobilization of cr vi the results of this study showed that typical ph conditions of natural aquatic environment significantly affected the mineral transformation of fes under acidic conditions fes was principally transformed to goethite amarantite and elemental sulfur with minor lepidocrocite through proton promoted dissolution and oxidation instead under basic conditions the main products were lepidocrocite and elemental sulfur via surface mediated oxidation in typical acidic or basic aquatic environment the pronounced pathway for the oxygenation of fes solids may alter their ability to remove cr vi longer oxygenation impeded cr vi removal at acidic ph and a decreasing ability to reduce cr vi caused a drop in cr vi removal performance cr vi removal decreased from 733 16 to 36 82 mg g 1 with the duration of fes oxygenation increasing to 5760 min at ph 5 0 in contrast newly generated pyrite from brief oxygenation of fes improved cr vi reduction at basic ph followed by a drop in cr vi removal performance due to the impaired reduction capacity with increasing to the complete oxygenation cr vi removal increased from 669 58 to 804 83 mg g 1 with increasing oxygenation time to 5 min and then decreased to 26 27 mg g 1 after the full oxygenation for 5760 min at ph 9 0 these findings provide insight into the dynamic transformation of fes in oxic aquatic environments with various phs and the impact on cr vi immobilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pollution

found widely in anoxic sediments and subsurface environments rickard and luther 2007 rickard et al 2017 under reductive conditions sulfate and fe iii may be reduced by sulfate reducing bacteria with the formation of nanoparticulate fes rickard and morse 2005 natural and synthetic fes nanoparticles nps can effectively immobilize or convert toxic contaminants including hexavalent chromium cr vi in aquatic environments and soil gong et al 2014 2016 wang et al 2019a fes as an electron donor can reduce toxic cr vi to cr iii which can be precipitated with the formation of solid cr oh 3 and crxfe1 x oh 3 wang et al 2019a the impacts of environmental conditions on cr vi immobilization by fes particles have been reported widely among them ph is a significant and critical factor jo et al 2008 park et al 2022 patterson et al 1997 wang et al 2019a lower ph can lead to a higher cr vi removal efficiency because 1 h acts as a reactant and higher h concentrations increase cr vi reduction as shown in eqs 1 4 park et al 2022 patterson et al 1997 wang et al 2019a and 2 higher h concentrations can protonate the surface of fes particles to become more positively charged with the enhanced adsorption of cr vi chiriţă et al 2008 jo et al 2008 the reductive immobilization of cr vi to cr iii by iron sulfides under anoxic conditions has been widely studied such as pyrite liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019b yang et al 2017 pyrrhotite ali et al 2014 yang et al 2017 greigite liu et al 2019 amorphous fes patterson et al 1997 and amorphous fes2 li et al 2016 and the effects of influencing factors including ph on the cr vi removal were explored the immobilization behaviors of cr vi by iron sulfides under oxic conditions begin to attract attention the intrusion of air supplies o2 due to natural or anthropogenic processes such as mixing at the water sediment interface water table fluctuation and groundwater recharge which leads to frequent transitions from anoxic to oxic in the sediments and shallow subsurface environments cheng et al 2016 liao et al 2020 ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 wu et al 2020 fes a reducing metastable mineral can be oxidized upon exposure to oxic conditions chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 however the influence of ph on the dynamic mineral transformation of fes under oxic conditions and its effect on the cr vi removal remains poorly understood 1 fes s

2007 sung and morgan 1980 in surface water ph values ranged from 5 5 to 9 0 generally lamit and tanaka 2022 luo et al 2022 whereas in groundwater they showed the main variation ranges of 5 0 8 7 xiao et al 2021 yan et al 2021 soil ph values ranged mainly from 4 5 to 8 5 in countries and regions such as china russia and north america chen et al 2019 hengl 2018 low ph values namely high h concentrations can accelerate the dissolution of fes solids into aqueous fe ii and s ii with the formation of h2s gas when the ph value is lower than 7 0 jeong et al 2010 wu et al 2020 whereas the dissolution may be weak and negligible when ph value exceeds 8 0 rickard and luther 2007 chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 in addition the oxidation of aqueous fe ii by do was accelerated with increasing ph value from 4 0 to 9 0 morgan and lahav 2007 and lepidocrocite γ feooh replaced goethite α feooh as the main solid product luo et al 2018 sung and morgan 1980 for the oxidation of aqueous sulfide by do the reaction rate increased and reached the peak of 23 6 m 0 9 h 1 at ph 8 0 followed by a drop to 7 4 m 0 9 h 1 with ph values ranging from 6 0 to 9 4 and s0 s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 are the main products chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 besides fes dissolution and solution phase oxidation at acidic ph solid surface reactions may occur at basic ph altering the composition of the secondary minerals of fes solids chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 in acidic solutions fes is oxidized through solution phase oxidation following fes dissolution to α feooh and elemental sulfur s0 eq 5 jeong et al 2010 or additional ferrihydrite and γ feooh chiriţă et al 2008 moreover mackinawite fes can be also oxidized into magnetite fe3o4 and s0 at acidic ph eq 6 zhang et

fes solids can form γ feooh and s0 in the solution upon exposure to air via solid surface oxidation eq 7 jeong et al 2010 mineral phases after the oxygenation of fes differ with ph from acidic to

adsorption on co precipitation with and incorporation into iron oxides and the fenton like mobilization of cr iii to cr vi for the minerals formed from the oxygenation of fes acidic conditions favored not only the cr vi reduction by fes pyrite and magnetite he and traina 2005 wang et al 2019a 2019b but the removal of cr vi using ferrihydrite α feooh and γ feooh through adsorption co precipitation and incorporation johnston and chrysochoou 2012 mamun et al 2017 wu et al 2016 xie et al 2015 in our recent work increasing h concentration could contribute to the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi in the oxic fes systems because it increased the higher yield of hydroxyl radicals oh as the main responsible oxidant through fenton like reactions wang et al 2022 nevertheless the immobilization behaviors of cr vi by minerals formed from fes at acidic and basic ph are poorly understood despite their importance in the drop in cr vi levels therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the roles of ph in the dynamic transformation of fes solids in a typical aquatic environment 2 to elucidate the pathways underlying the oxygenation of fes at typical phs and 3 to demonstrate the ph related cr vi immobilization behaviors by the resulting minerals from fes oxidation we choose the ph range from 5 0 to 9 0 as the representative environments from acidic to basic this work hypothesizes that h may act as a reactant and affect the mineral transformation of fes via proton promoted dissolution and oxidation or surface mediated oxidation and further alter the cr vi immobilization behaviors 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ammonium iron ii sulfate fe nh4 2 so4 2 and sodium sulfide nonahydrate na2s 9h2o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was purchased from chengdu kelong chemical reagent factory sterile water was prepared by putting submersible ultraviolet lamps 5 w 220 v with a wavelength of 254 nm into deionized di water 18 25 mω cm for 48 h all the other reagents used were of analytical grade or higher the suspensions of nano scale fes were prepared under anoxic conditions following our previous work wang et al 2022 and the resultant stock suspension of approximately 20 g l 1 was sealed and stored in the n2 filled glass containers before use 2 2 batch tests for the oxygenation of fes oxygenation of fes was carried out in a 1000 ml five neck reactor enwrapped with aluminum foil and the experimental setup was shown in fig s1 the batch kinetic tests were initiated by adding the pre determined volume of stock fes suspension into the reactor corresponding to an initial suspension of 1 0 g l 1 11 4 mm the suspension was stirred at 1000 rpm using a teflon coated magnetic stirrer and continuously bubbled with ultrapure nitrogen gas 99 999 pure for 60 min to maintain an initial do of nearly zero then the reactor was exposed to the atmosphere the solution ph was adjusted with 0 1 m hydrochloric acid and 0 1 m sodium hydroxide solutions to values from 5 0 7 0 to 9 0 the changes in ph were no more than 0 2 units during the oxygenation the total amounts of hcl added at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 24 3 18 6 and 5 9 ml respectively corresponding to the cl concentrations of 1 94 0 37 and 0 12 mm at the predetermined time do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured and three suspension samples were withdrawn one was transferred into a vial and photographed immediately to record the change of visual appearance until it had no significant change another sample was to determine s0 after methanol extraction as detailed in text s1 in supporting information fes solids can be dissolved into aqueous fe ii and s ii huang et al 2021b jeong et al 2010 in addition aqueous fe iii s0 s2o3 2 and so4 2 as the main solution phase products were reported in the oxidation of iron sulfides minerals by do cheng et al 2016 chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 moon et al 2017 thus a third sample was used to analyze aqueous fe ii total aqueous fe aqueous s ii s2o3 2 and so4 2 after filtered immediately through a 0 05 μm nylon membrane aqueous fe iii was calculated as the difference between total aqueous fe and aqueous fe ii text s1 shows the detailed analytical methods of aqueous species of fe and s additional parallel batch tests were also carried out to obtain the solids from the oxic fes system at a specific time the suspension in the reactor was filtered immediately through a 0 05 μm nylon membrane the resulting slurry was washed with deoxygenated water three times and freeze dried for 48 h the dried solids were then stored for the analysis of mössbauer spectroscopy xrd xps and tem as detailed in text s1 2 3 cr vi removal by pristine and oxygenated fes the oxygenated fes was prepared from the oxic fes systems after oxygenation times of 5 60 120 240 720 and 5760 min batch tests for cr vi removal were conducted at similar ph values with the oxygenation of fes in section 2 2 cr vi solution of 24 69 0 45 mm was bubbled with n2 for 30 min before the addition of 1 0 g l 1 pristine or oxygenated fes suspension at specific time intervals aqueous cr vi was measured after the sample was filtered with 0 05 μm nylon syringe filters at the equilibrium the solid products were filtered with a 0 22 μm nylon membrane washed three times with deoxygenated water and then freeze dried for 48 h before xrd and xps analysis simultaneously cr vi and total cr in both aqueous solution and solid products were determined as described in text s1 then the mass balance of cr species was analyzed to determine cr vi removal performances of pristine and oxygenated fes as detailed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of appearance and secondary minerals of fes in oxic solution at typical acidic and basic conditions iron bearing minerals usually have inherent visual appearances cornell and schwertmann 2003 as fes is transformed into various secondary minerals in an oxidizing environment benning et al 2000 boursiquot et al 2001 jeong et al 2010 its appearance changes as fig 1 shows there was a progressive appearance difference between acidic and basic conditions at ph 5 0 the color of fes suspension changed from black to blackish green over 120 min then turned to milky white at 150 min followed by a gradual change to brownish red after 240 min however at ph 9 0 the black color of fes suspension persisted for 150 min before turning progressively to grayish green by 180 min then to reddish brown at 240 min and finally to dark orange after 720 min at ph 7 0 the change in appearance was similar to that at ph 9 0 while it was accelerated thus ph substantially affects the change in the appearance of fes suspension orp increased and gradually approached the stable level of 242 8 mv at ph 5 0 149 5 mv at ph 7 0 and 20 2 mv at ph 9 0 with do surging to an equilibrium level of about 7 8 mg l 1 over 5760 min figs s2a and b the stable appearance orp and do following the oxygenation suggest that the fes was transformed completely fig s3 shows the composition of the secondary minerals formed from fes through xrd analysis α feooh amarantite γ feooh and s0 were the main mineral phases at ph 5 0 mössbauer spectroscopy proportions of 62 α feooh 30 amarantite and 8 γ feooh among the total solid fe fig s2c at ph 7 0 and 9 0 in contrast the final dominant minerals were γ feooh and s0 which agrees with the findings of previous work jeong et al 2010 therefore ph significantly affects the oxygenation of fes judging by the distinct differences in the visual appearance and secondary mineral composition in addition in the ph range from 5 0 to 9 0 these similar results of both visual appearance and secondary minerals at ph 7 0 and 9 0 prompted the subsequent work to focus on mineral transformation at acidic and basic ph levels 3 2 dynamic mineral transformation of fes 3 2 1 characteristics analysis of minerals fig s4 shows the difference in the mineralogy of fes between acidic and basic conditions during the oxygenation and the quantitative mineral phase composition is determined through the rietveld refinement of xrd patterns in which the least square method is used to fit the structural and peak shape parameters of the known reference phase will 2006 fig 2 and table s2 show the significant temporal evolution of fes based on the quantitative phase analysis at ph 5 0 the crystalline fes gradually decreased to an undetectable level within the initial 120 min with new pyrrhotite fe7s8 appearing after 5 min that increased to a maximum of 68 1 of the total at 15 min then dropped and disappeared at 240 min s0 emerged at 5 min and gradually increased to a maximum of 79 8 of the total at 240 min before decreasing to between 20 0 and 26 2 after 1440 min where it held nearly constant at 60 min a hydrosulfate green rust gr so4 phase appeared which gradually increased to a peak content of 23 0 at 120 min before decreasing to below the detection limit at 1440 min jeong et al 2010 amarantite and α feooh emerged at 120 min and persisted for the remainder of the experiment the α feooh content increased to 33 1 at 5760 min with a simultaneous rise in amarantite content to 36 7 γ feooh appeared at 240 min and remained at a relatively constant level of 8 6 13 3 for up to 5760 min the final solids of the fes transformation were dominated by α feooh amarantite of ferric sulfate mineral γ feooh and s0 goethite and ferric sulfate mineral are the typical minerals phases in acid rich environments such as acid mine drainage and acid sulfate soils frost et al 2013 luo et al 2018 park et al 2016 in contrast at ph 9 0 fes decreased to 6 6 within 120 min and entirely disappeared by 240 min fes2 fe7s8 fe3s4 s0 and fibroferrite appeared at 5 min when fes accounted for 41 3 of the total and fes2 for 50 7 s0 increased to 23 3 at 240 min where it stabilized fe7s8 and fes2 persisted until 15 min but both disappeared by 60 min a fe3s4 phase increased to 38 3 at 60 min and then decreased entirely by 240 min γ feooh emerged at 15 min and increased to a stable 76 7 81 9 after 240 min at 5760 min γ feooh and s0 were the dominant mineral phases jeong et al 2010 accounting for 77 4 and 22 6 respectively tem characterization is applied to show the morphological changes moreover to illustrate the spatial distribution of minerals tem is combined with xrd analysis following the procedures 1 identification of the interplanar spacing from the lattice fringe in the high resolution tem image 2 determination of the other interplanar spacing by the diffraction peak in the xrd pattern and 3 proofreading and matching of those interplanar spacings figs 3 and 4 illustrate the morphological changes and the spatial distribution of minerals during the oxygenation of fes the pristine fes occurred as nanosized ellipsoidal particles with characteristic lattice planes of 101 and 001 at ph 5 0 figs 3 and s5 the fes ellipsoids collapsed into irregular spheres with a concave surface within 60 min because of proton dissolution rickard and luther 2007 fe7s8 with lattice planes of 101 and 104 emerged on the concave surface and gr so4 appeared on the irregular spheres at 60 min confirmed by a 009 lattice plane after 120 min of oxygenation the particles became starfish shaped with α feooh with a 103 lattice plane on the disk gr so4 with a 110 lattice plane on the fringe of the disk amarantite with a 103 lattice plane on the wrists and plate like noncrystalline fe oh 3 on the fringe of wrists the fe to o atomic ratio in the eds analysis fig s6 was 0 33 with negligible s very close to that of fe oh 3 the noncrystalline phase was identified from the selected area electron diffraction pattern as the oxygenation time increased to 240 min flocs were present with lath like α feooh with a 111 lattice plane plate like gr so4 with a 110 lattice plane and needle like amarantite with a 010 lattice plane there were also irregular block like aggregates of α feooh and amarantite surrounded by a small amount of nano scale γ feooh platelets with a 210 lattice plane at the end of the experiments comparatively at ph 9 0 figs 4 and s7 the ellipsoidal nanoparticles formed a distinct core shell structure within 60 min jeong et al 2010 the layers of the amorphous phase fes2 with a 200 lattice plane and fe3s4 with a 400 lattice plane from outside to inside appeared after 5 min the amorphous phase might be identified as fe ii fe iii sulfate mineral by the coexisting fe o and s in eds analysis fig s8 and the presence of fe2 so4 3 and fe ii s bonds in xps analysis see fig s10c s0 was identified with a 202 lattice plane after 60 min of oxygenation a layer of fe3s4 with a 400 lattice plane was found between the fes core and the surrounding crystalline layer of γ feooh with a 020 lattice plane the block like oxygenated fes at 120 min also shows the core shell structure and a layer of γ feooh with a 210 lattice plane could be identified on the fe3s4 which disappeared after 120 min after 240 min of oxygenation nano scale crystalline γ feooh was observed in the mostly lath like and plate like morphologies cornell and schwertmann 2003 s0 as a product of fes oxygenation was not found in the high resolution tem images at any ph while confirmed by xrd analysis figs s3 s4 and 2 which was attributed to the sublimation of s0 under the high intensity electron beam irradiation matsubara et al 2009 as previously reported wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 cornell and schwertmann 2003 it is concluded that at ph 5 0 α feooh with the positively charged surface phpzc 8 2 could adsorb negatively charged s0 particles phpzc 3 0 3 6 to form the aggregates wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 the phpzc value of γ feooh is 7 1 7 5 usually cornell and schwertmann 2003 at ph 9 0 s0 with the negatively charged surface was not absorbed to γ feooh due to the electrostatic repulsion and it remained dispersed in the suspension in addition xps analysis reveals a similar pathway to the synergistic oxidation of s ii and fe ii at ph values of 5 0 and 9 0 figs s9 s11 text s2 fe ii is quickly oxidized by the do to fe iii which subsequently oxidizes s ii with fe ii regenerated eqs 9 and 10 cheng et al 2016 rickard and luther 2007 9 o 2 4 h 4 fe ii 2 h 2 o 4 fe iii 10 s ii 2 fe iii s 0 2 fe ii 3 2 2 aqueous fe and s species fig s12 shows the species of fe and s in aqueous solution at ph values of 5 0 and 9 0 profiles of fe ii and total fe in the aqueous solution overlapped fig s13 indicating that fe ii was the main species of aqueous fe change in aqueous fe ii was found to be distinct between ph 5 0 and ph 9 0 fig s12a at ph 5 0 aqueous fe ii rapidly increased to the peak value of 8 41 mm at 240 min where it accounted for 73 8 of total fe and the majority of total fe was present in the solution phase then it gradually decreased to below the detection level at 3600 min which indicates that fe ii might be oxidized to fe iii under persistent oxidizing conditions and or resorbed on the secondary minerals an et al 2017 however at ph 9 0 aqueous fe ii was below the detection limit with no significant fe present in the solution phase jeong et al 2010 aqueous fe iii remained at the low levels of 0 3 mm at ph 5 0 and below the detection limit at ph 9 0 fig s12a which was attributed to its consumption by the fe iii bearing phase formation as confirmed by xrd analysis figs s2 s3 and 2 baes and mesmer 1976 the change in aqueous s ii was similar to that of aqueous fe ii fig s12b at ph 5 0 aqueous s ii peaked at 5 44 mm after 5 min accounted for 47 7 of the total s and decreased to the undetectable level at 60 min simultaneously a strong rotten egg odor was smelled at the beginning of the reaction implying the rapid volatilization of the dissolved hydrogen sulfide released from fes dissolution eq 11 chiriţă et al 2008 rickard and luther 2007 instead at ph 9 0 no detectable level of aqueous s ii persisted during the oxygenation of fes combined with the negligible level of aqueous fe ii fig s12a the dissolution of fes might be weak and negligible at ph 9 0 jeong et al 2010 11 fes 2 h fe ii aq h 2 s aq the s0 increased rapidly to the highest concentration then dropped and finally remained fairly constant fig s12c at ph values of 5 0 and 9 0 s0 reached the peak concentrations of 9 08 mm at 120 min and 6 55 mm at 240 min accordingly corresponding to 79 6 and 57 5 of total s as the reaction proceed the final concentrations of 7 39 and 6 18 mm within 5760 min accordingly accounted for 64 8 and 54 2 of total s indicating that s ii in fes was mainly transformed to s0 moreover it was verified that acidic conditions could favor the formation of s0 and weaken the production of s2o3 2 and so4 2 eqs 12 15 chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 12 2 h 2 s aq o 2 2 s 0 2 h 2 o 13 2 h 2 s aq 2 o 2 s 2 o 3 2

remained below the detection limit for the full experiment duration under acidic conditions fig s12d at ph 9 0 s2o3 2 peaked at 1 09 mm within 720 min and then decreased and disappeared at 2880 min as shown in eqs 13 and 15 chen and morris 1972 jeong et al 2010 lefers et al 1978 s2o3 2 occurred as an intermediate in the oxidation of s ii to so4 2 the decline of s2o3 2 may have resulted from the conversion to so4 2 which was confirmed by the increasing so4 2 fig s12e in addition the increasing peak concentration of s2o3 2 with the rising ph indicated that basic conditions favored its formation eq 13 chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 aqueous so4 2 decreased and remained at very low levels after the initial rising under acidic conditions whereas it increased initially and tended to the stable level under acidic and basic conditions fig s12e at ph 5 0 aqueous so4 2 reached the maximum of 0 18 mm at 120 min then it decreased and remained at a low level of 0 02 mm because of the transfer to the solid phase with the formation of amarantite as a ferric sulfate mineral figs 2 and s4a at ph 9 0 aqueous so4 2 increased and reached constant levels of 0 46 mm 3 3 typical pathways of the oxygenation of fes pathways for the transformation of fes varied significantly with ph as proposed in fig 5 at acidic ph fes was oxidized mainly via solution phase oxidation following proton promoted dissolution fes first released fe ii and s ii into the solution through dissolution at high proton concentration eq 11 figs s12a and b rickard and luther 2007 simultaneously fes was partially transformed to fe7s8 figs 2 and 3 aqueous sulfide was volatilized partially as h2s gas and also oxidized rapidly to s0 and so4 2 eqs 12 15 figs s12b c and e chiriţă et al 2008 jeong et al 2010 aqueous fe ii was oxidized gradually into fe iii by do with the formation of the low solubility fe iii bearing minerals including amorphous fe oh 3 α feooh amarantite and gr so4 baes and mesmer 1976 jeong et al 2010 in addition the amarantite and gr so4 generated could consume so4 2 leading to the decrease of so4 2 fig s12e as the reactions proceeded the oxidation of fe ii continued with the complete oxidation of s ii to s0 which decreased to a relatively stable level due to the low oxidation rate fig s12c jeong et al 2010 in addition gr so4 transformed to γ feooh and minor α feooh which might release so4 2 into the solution eq 16 inoue et al 2007 however so4 2 remained stable at nearly zero after first rising and then dropping fig s12e this could be attributed to the regeneration of amarantite fig 2 finally the dominant minerals were block like aggregates of α feooh amarantite and s0 and minor plate like γ feooh figs 2 and 3 in summary fes was principally transformed to amorphous fe oh 3 fe7s8 and gr so4 as the intermediates which finally yielded α feooh amarantite s0 and minor γ feooh additionally several processes were involved including the formation of h2s gas dissolution of fes solids the oxidation of released fe ii and s ii and precipitation reactions 16 fe ii 4 fe iii 2 oh 12 s o 4 o 2 6 feooh 2 h so 4 2 2 h 2 o at basic ph fes was mostly oxidized through surface mediated oxidation the dissolution of fes at low proton was weak and aqueous fe ii and s ii remained undetectable throughout the experiments figs s12a and b rickard and luther 2007 the rapid oxidation of fe ii under basic conditions led any fe ii in the fes to be oxidized initially to form an amorphous fe ii fe iii sulfate layer on fes particles figs 4 s8 and s10c jeong et al 2010 s ii reduced fe iii to form s0 generating synergy in the oxidation of fe ii and s ii eqs 9 and 10 cheng et al 2016 rickard and luther 2007 it could also reduce o2 with the formation of s2o3 2 and so4 2 multiple layers of amorphous fe ii fe iii sulfate mineral overlaying fes2 and fe3s4 appeared on fes particles with traces of fe7s8 fig 4 then multiple layers of γ feooh over fe3s4 appeared accompanied by a drop in fes and an increase in γ feooh and fe3s4 fig 2 as the oxidation reaction proceeded s2o3 2 and s0 in the solution could react to form so4 2 eq 15 figs s12c e chen and morris 1972 lefers et al 1978 the secondary s0 and lath like and platelet like γ feooh minerals were present in the final reaction jeong et al 2010 in summary fes was transformed mainly via the intermediates of amorphous fe ii fe iii sulfate fe7s8 fes2 and fe3s4 into γ feooh and s0 with a minor amount of so4 2 3 4 immobilization of cr vi by pristine and oxygenated fes a kinetic study of cr vi removal shows that aqueous cr vi decreased rapidly in the initial 5 min and gradually to a stable level within 120 min fig 6 a and b the fes oxygenated for 60 min exhibited better cr vi removal than fes oxygenated for 120 min fig s14 fig 6c and d show the performance for cr vi removal by pristine and oxygenated fes longer oxygenation of fes slowed the cr vi removal at acidic ph instead fes oxygenated at basic ph showed an improvement before a subsequent drop at ph 5 0 cr vi removal performance slightly decreased from 733 16 to 683 53 mg g 1 with increasing oxygenation time to 60 min and rapidly to 36 82 mg g 1 after 5760 min of oxygenation fig 6c meanwhile at ph 9 0 it increased from 669 58 to 804 83 mg g 1 with increasing oxygenation time to 5 min and then decreased to 26 27 mg g 1 after 5760 min of oxygenation fig 6d thus there was a distinct difference in cr vi removal by oxygenated fes between acidic and basic conditions the exact reasons need subsequent elucidation xrd and xps analysis show that cr iii and cr vi were the main cr species using fes oxygenated for 240 min and cr existed as cr vi mainly using fes oxygenated for 5760 min figs s15 s18 table s3 indicating that reduction and sorption of cr vi were involved using fes oxygenated briefly while cr vi sorption occurred using fes oxygenated longer in addition fenton like reactions occur in the oxygenation of fes leading to the production of oh radicals cheng et al 2016 huang et al 2021a wang et al 2022 in the removal of cr vi by fes under oxic conditions the generation of oh was found fig s19 after a lag time it then increased and gradually decreased which was consistent with the production of oh in the oxygenation of fes cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the cumulative oh increased and reached the stable level when cr vi removal reached the equilibrium fig s19 oh as a strong oxidant can potentially oxidize cr iii to cr vi wang et al 2022 however the presence of methanol as a free radical quencher did not significantly affect the cr vi removal by either pristine or oxygenated fes fig 7 which indicates the negligible roles of ros reactive oxygen species in the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi during cr vi removal thus reduction and sorption mainly contributed to the immobilization of cr vi based on the mass balance of cr species fig 8 a and b table s4 performances for cr vi reduction and sorption are presented in fig 8c and d cr vi reduction showed a similar change to cr vi removal with a trend of downward at ph 5 0 and rise fall at 9 0 moreover for fes oxygenated less than 240 min both cr vi removal and reduction changed significantly and synchronously notably a close linear correlation between cr vi reduction and removal was obtained for the oxygenated fes r2 0 99 figs s20 indicating that cr vi reduction might play an important role in cr vi removal cr vi sorption remained at a minor level of 11 of cr vi removal by fes oxygenated within 240 min whereas by fes oxygenated for 5760 min sorption accounted for 70 figs s21 it was therefore concluded that reduction dominated the cr vi removal mainly for fes oxygenated briefly and sorption prevailed for fes oxygenated completely cr vi reduction by fes oxygenated less than 60 min was better than that with fes oxygenated longer indicating that the fes oxygenation time remarkably affects cr vi reduction thus the minerals present in the transformation pathways already explained in section 3 3 can result in the pronounced changes in cr vi reduction the longer oxygenation time of fes at acidic ph the lower cr vi reduction performance of the oxygenated fes the theoretical cr vi reduction capacity of fe7s8 was 1845 54 mg g 1 close to 1772 59 mg g 1 of fes and higher than 109 01 mg g 1 of gr so4 based on eqs 1 3 17 and 18 as shown in text s3 ali et al 2014 thomas et al 2018 wang et al 2019a yang et al 2017 when fes was oxygenated for 5 min fes and fe7s8 were the main mineral phases accounting for 94 6 with reductive mineral phases decreasing by 5 4 fig 2 that leads to a slight drop in cr vi reduction and removal figs 6c 8a and c when fes was oxygenated for 60 min the total weight percentage of reductive fes fe7s8 and gr so4 decreased to zero and finally iron oxyhydroxides amarantite and s0 were formed with negligible reduction capacity for cr vi fig 2 which resulted into the rapid decrease in cr vi reduction and removal

dropped figs 8b and d cr vi reduction performances of fes oxygenated for the first 5 min were 774 23 mg g 1 exceeding 609 70 mg g 1 of pristine fes with increasing oxygenation time to 5 min the main mineral present was reductive fes fes2 fe7s8 and fe3s4 figs 2 and s4b text s3 shows that their theoretical cr vi reduction capacities are 1772 59 2166 50 1845 54 and 526 99 mg g 1 based on eqs 1 3 17 19 and 20 ali et al 2014 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019a 2019b yang et al 2017 fes2 thus may show a better cr vi reduction than fes significantly after 5 min of oxygenation fes fes2 and fe7s8 accounted for 94 2 with negligible fe3s4 newly generated fes2 improved cr vi reduction and removal figs 6d 8b and d as fes was oxygenated for 60 min the percentage of reductive mineral phases decreased rapidly fig 2 the newly generated phase of fes2 disappeared at 60 min whereas fe3s4 with the less cr vi reduction capacity and fes remained fig 2 that is why longer oxygenation time impaired cr vi reduction and removal figs 6d 8b and d 4 conclusions this study investigated the sensitivity of ph during the dynamic mineral transformation of fes under oxic conditions and the impacts of the corresponding transformation on cr vi immobilization increasing ph can change the mechanisms of fes oxygenation from proton dissolution and oxidation to surface mediated oxidation in the typical ph range from 5 0 to 9 0 fes was principally oxidized to α feooh amarantite and s0 with minor γ feooh under acidic conditions but γ feooh and s0 under basic conditions in typical acidic or basic environment the pronounced pathway for the oxygenation of fes solids may affect their ability to remove cr vi longer oxygenation of fes impeded the cr vi removal at ph 5 0 whereas cr vi removal by stepwise oxidized fes shows a rise fall trend at ph 9 0 at acidic ph a longer duration of fes oxygenation triggered the decreasing ability to reduce cr vi and led to a drop in cr vi removal at basic ph the brief oxygenation of fes would produce fes2 which can improve cr vi reduction and removal subsequently the impaired reduction capacity with the prolonged oxygenation time resulted in a declining removal of cr vi the findings of this study present a new understanding of the oxygenation of iron sulfides and the fate of cr in oxic aquatic environments under acidic or basic conditions moreover h modulated pre oxygenation may provide a better strategy and method to design the engineered nanomaterials of iron sulfides for remediation of cr vi contaminated water resulting in maximum
