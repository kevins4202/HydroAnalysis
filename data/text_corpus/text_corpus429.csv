2145,multiple uncertainties from water resource allocation have posed new challenges to balanced regional development on the one hand in the context of global water shortage crisis groundwater as an important water supply module is facing severe risk of shortage on the other hand the regional authorities need to coordinate the contradictory water demand brought by the heterogeneous water use objectives from multiple water use levels and these demands are also subject to complex uncertainties how to mitigate the risks posed by uncertainties ensure regional water security and balance participants is attracting the keen attention of decision makers around the world therefore this study establishes a decentralized bi level multi objective regional water resources allocation rwra optimization model under hybrid uncertainty aiming at an optimal quartet trade off of equity sustainability equilibrium and efficiency to deal with the hybrid uncertainty in the model water demand is set as a random fuzzy number and the groundwater constraint is combined with fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp then the decentralized bi level multi objective model is solved by the bi level interactive method based on the satisfactory solution incorporated with the chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm the proposed model and solution approach are then applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china to verify the validity and utility of the model the results show that 1 the model can effectively meet the different objectives requirements of regional authority and sub areas 2 groundwater constraint parameters has a significant impact on the model results especially the gini coefficient decreases by 13 6 when groundwater is used as a water source supplement 3 from single level model to decentralized bi level model the satisfactory balance of the two levels increases from 0 1457 to 0 793 which indicates that the decentralized bi level model makes the two levels more balanced than the single level model based on the results some management recommendations for participants are finally provided keywords regional water resources allocation hybrid uncertainty bi level multi objective optimization multiple water sources chaotic particle swarm optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increased economic activity along with population growth coupled with the heightened effects of climate change are exacerbating water scarcity in many countries moghadam et al 2022 groundwater as the world s largest freshwater reserves cuthbert et al 2019 moreover is facing a huge crisis according to the united nations world water development report 2022 groundwater making the invisible visible due to long term over exploitation and pollution caused by human activities the global total groundwater reserves have severely depleted and its sustainability is at risk therefore in the context of global water resources shortage and groundwater crisis it is necessary to put forward higher requirements for river basin water resources management to ensure regional sustainable development the optimal allocation of water resources has become one of the most effective ways to cope with the increasing global demand for water and insufficient water supply mirdashtvan et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 izady et al 2021 one of the purposes of this study is to develop an optimization model for regional water resources allocation rwra so as to improve the effectiveness of regional water resources management regional authority the macro control role in the rwra should be the primary dm in the model however many studies only focus on regional authority feng 2021 xu et al 2019 ignoring the influence of other decision makers dms on the rwra as the followers of the regional authority the sub areas the water allocators of their subordinate sectors also play an important role in rwra yao et al 2019 therefore considering the different or even contradictory requirements between regional authority and sub areas a decentralized bi level programming is applied to the optimal model and the regional authority is considered as the upper dm while the lower dms are the sub areas since rwra involves many factors i e equity sustainability and economy it is imperative to take multi objective into account for example in water allocation of agricultural sectors hatamkhani and moridi 2021 have used gdp and williamson coefficient to measure economic efficiency and social equality the comprehensive water allocation strategy developed by naghdi et al 2021 considered social standards economic efficiency and environmentality and regarded maximizing the percentage of supply demand and minimizing the extent of groundwater extraction as objectives of their model then in order to ensure the balanced development of economic social and environmental benefits yuan et al 2022 proposed a multi objective optimization model for united allocation of water resources and wastewater emission licenses which takes into account the maximizing of economic benefits per unit of wastewater emission all of the above papers make significant contributions to the development of the research on water resources management in consequence for the decentralized bi level decision system of rwra proposed in this paper the upper level dm i e the regional authority seeks to achieve two objectives equity and sustainability hu et al 2016b jin yan et al 2021 while the lower dms i e sub areas considerations are equilibrium and efficiency tu et al 2015 2022 moreover the gini coefficient is introduced to measure the equity of sub areas by calculating the economic benefits obtained from water allocation and the chemical oxygen demand cod coefficient is used to measure sustainability based on pollutant emission then minimization of the maximum water shortage rate among sectors and maximization of economic efficiency are taken as the two objectives of lower level dms at this point the decentralized bi level multi objective model in rwra has been built due to the effects of human activities and climate change many uncertainties persist in hydrological models resulting in inaccurate and unreliable predictions tu et al 2022 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2014 ma et al 2021 yuhong and yao 2021 wu et al 2021 at present the uncertainty methods based on parameters have been widely used in many studies for the optimal water resources allocation to cope with them for example to deal with the uncertainty in the irrigation water allocation chen et al 2019 added two stage stochastic programming and interval parameter programming methods to their model there is also the application of the conditional value at risk cvar inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp model with imprecise probabilities ips and random boundary intervals rbis to agricultural water management li et al 2020a furthermore in the rwra system since the water demand of sectors change with the development of society and technology probability distribution is often considered to deal with the uncertain risks tu et al 2015 however due to the insufficient fitting data the probability distribution of the hypothesis obtained cannot accurately describe the demand from this the fuzzy set theory is introduced to deal with the probability distribution of the hypothesis and the hypothesis will be more flexible and realistic based on above the water demand of each sector is treated as a random fuzzy variable besides there are also studies using uncertainty methods to deal with constraints in models zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 among them fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp can effectively reflect the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints under uncertainty fccp has been used in many studies in water resources and environmental management zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 in the field of irrigation water management fccp has been repeatedly applied to groundwater constraints zhang et al 2018 dai et al 2021 however few studies have done so in rwra sum up a decentralized bi level multi objective model under hybrid uncertainty is developed which considers multiple water sources i e basin water groundwater and other water and pursues a quartet trade off i e equity sustainability equilibrium and efficiency in order to find a solution that satisfies both the bi level dms the bi level interactive method based on the satisfactory solution presented in nishizaki and sakawa 2009 can be used here this method aims to transform the bi level model to a single level model and then solves the single level model with the complexity of the decision environment in reality intelligent optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm are widely used to solve optimal models louati et al 2011 chen et al 2020 the pso algorithm proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 has many superior performances i e a fast convergence speed being simple and easy to implement that seeks to optimize an objective function using a population based search clerc and kennedy 2002 kannan et al 2004 liang et al 2006 alrashidi and el hawary 2009 zarghami and hajykazemian 2013 as an improvement of pso chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm liu et al 2005 zhu et al 2013 has the following superiorities to the pso algorithm the adaptive inertia weight is used to accelerate the convergence speed which is improved on the basis of the pso algorithm the chaotic search in the neighborhood is used to avoid falling into the local optimum therefore in this study the cpso algorithm was applied to solve the single level model comparisons with other literatures are shown in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that this study is more practical and comprehensive in a nutshell the main contributions of this study can be listed as 1 this paper takes hybrid uncertainty into account in the rwra system in view of society development and water use characteristics the water demand is expressed as a random fuzzy variable the groundwater constraint is combined with fccp method to ensure the sustainable development of groundwater and realize its flexible allocation 2 a decentralized bi level multi objective optimization model for rwra involving quartet trade off is established which not only comprehensively considers the various interest pursuit of upper and lower dms but also reflects the interaction and contradiction between the two levels the proposed model is applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china and the practicability and effectiveness of proposal are verified 3 scenario analysis of rwra under different total available water and groundwater uncertainty is carried out which enables dms to adjust the rwra plans in different basin water flow then the policy suggestions that suitable for the long term development of the region are put forward the structure of this paper is divided into five parts in section 2 the conceptual framework and key features of this study are described in section 3 the handling of uncertainty in parameters and constraints in the optimization model is discussed a decentralized bi level multi objective model of rwra is established and a bi level interaction method combined with cpso algorithm is proposed as the solution method in section 4 the proposed model and solution method for rwra are applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 problem statement a conceptual framework is constructed before modeling as shown in fig 1 in order to accurately describe that regional authority and sub areas have their own objectives and there is an interactive and even contradictory relationship between them this study establishes a decentralized bi level rwra system in addition because of many factors uncertain parameters and constraints often exists in rwra system and this model needs to be placed under uncertainty first of all the dms in this model are bi level construction the upper level dm is regional authority and the lower level dms are sub areas regional authority as the superior unit allocates water resources to the sub areas earlier considering the interests at the macro level of society the objectives of the regional authority are seen as equity and sustainability tanyimboh and seyoum 2016 gini coefficient can be introduced to evaluate equity among sub areas by measure the equality of economic benefits from water resources allocation besides regional authority should ensure sufficient ecological water and reduce pollutant discharge to achieve sustainability objective in this study regional authority will prioritize the allocation of ecological water and cod coefficient is applied to measure the pollutant discharge sub areas receive the basin water allocated by regional authority and then combine obtained basin water with groundwater and other water sources as multiple water sources to allocate to subordinate sectors unlike their superior they focus on the overall development of themselves with the objectives of equilibrium and efficiency for sectors they want to get enough water while minimizing the gap with other sectors therefore in order to achieve its own stability it is necessary for a sub area to keep sectors in equilibrium minimization of the maximum water shortage rate among sectors can effectively meet the water needs of them as well as maintaining their balance in addition the sub areas want the allocated water to be used as efficiently as possible which can be measured by the water economic efficiency of sectors to summarize the two levels of the model contain four objectives which formed a structure of quartet trade off hybrid uncertainty naturally exist in hydrological models because some parameters will change due to human activity and climate change babaeyan koopaei et al 2002 li et al 2020c which makes them unpredictable and requires flexibility in handling water demand change with social and technological developments which can be considered to follow a probability distribution on account of the lack of historical data the probability distribution obtained by directly fitting the historical data is not enough to predict reality accurately thus the fuzzy number is introduced to combine with the obtained probability distribution to represent the water demand as a random fuzzy variable groundwater as one of the main allocatable water sources in sub areas is facing the crisis of depletion and pollution sub areas need to make groundwater as a regulatory tool to cope with different water flow of the basin while avoiding excessive exploitation or pollution from this it can be seen that the quota of groundwater is affected by many factors how to ensure the sustainable development of groundwater and realize its flexible allocation is a crucial problem for dms therefore in this study combining the fccp with groundwater constraint can effectively achieve the goal that is while limiting the use of groundwater sub areas can also allocate groundwater flexibly by adjusting the parameters in fccp the above two methods of dealing with hybrid uncertainty will be explained in detail in section 3 3 methodology in this section the modeling process and solution approach of the decentralized bi level multi objective model under hybrid uncertainty are presented in detail the main parameters used in the model are shown in table 2 3 1 handling of hybrid uncertainty in parameters and constraints in the model random fuzzy water demand and fccp constraint for groundwater are considered the handling methods are given as below 3 1 1 random fuzzy water demand as mentioned above water demand is considered to follow some probability distribution firstly the initial parameters are fit estimated from collected raw data for example assuming that the water demand of a certain sector in a certain area obeys a normal distribution n μ σ 2 while its water demand in the next year may increase or decrease due to economic development scientific and technological progress human consciousness and other reasons experts have given a vague assessment of the probability distribution s mean between the minimum and maximum with a most probable value therefore the probability distribution can be taken as a fuzzy variable l m u where l m u are the mean minimum most probable and maximum values respectively thus sectoral water demand can be viewed as a random fuzzy variable d i j where i is the sub area index i 1 2 m and j is the sector index j 1 2 n it can be known that d i j n μ i j σ i j 2 where μ i j l i j m i j u i j the expected value of μ i j l i j m i j u i j can be converted to a deterministic value by using expected value operator in xu and zhou 2013 1 e d i j μ i j l i j m i j u i j 1 δ 2 l i j 1 2 m i j δ 2 u i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where δ 0 1 is the optimistic pessimistic parameter 3 1 2 fccp constraint for groundwater in fuzzy set theory fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp can effectively tackle system s random uncertainty it is widely used to deal with separate fuzzy uncertainties in the left and right sides of constraints li et al 2020b not only does it take into account multiple uncertainties in the model and calculation process but it can also lead to different decisions based on different levels of confidence for each sector the proportion of the groundwater quota to the total allocated water and the sub areas groundwater supplies vary with time and conditions which will be set to fuzzy numbers in summary groundwater constrain is expressed as fccp to optimize the system satisfaction of the model the main formula and transform method of fccp will be introduced below firstly the model of fccp can be formulated as follows 2 max j 1 n c j x j s t cr j 1 n a i j x j b i ɛ i i 1 2 m x j 0 j 1 2 n where i represents the index of constraints j represents the index of decision variables x j denotes the non fuzzy decision variable c j is the fuzzy coefficient in the objective function a i j and b i are the fuzzy coefficients in constraints ɛ i is the credibility level and cr ɛ shows that the credibility of constraint should be greater than or equal to level ɛ then in order to transform the uncertain constraint i e c r j 1 n a i j x j b i ɛ i i 1 2 m into the corresponding deterministic one a and b are assumed to be triangle fuzzy variables i e a a 1 a 2 a 3 and b b 1 b 2 b 3 based on its definition the credibility of a fuzzy event characterized by a b can be described as 3 cr a b 1 if a 3 b 1 a 3 2 a 2 2 b 2 b 1 2 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 if a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 b 3 a 1 2 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 if a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 0 if a 1 b 3 detailed derivation for credibility formulation has been given by lu et al 2016 to solve the fccp model 2 the credibility constraint should be converted to a set of equivalent crisp sub constraints zhang et al 2015 in credibility constraint based on the credibility concept and definition and the theory of fuzzy operations the left hand can be expressed as 4 a i j 1 n a i j x j j 1 n a i j 1 x j j 1 n a i j 2 x j j 1 n a i j 3 x j i 1 2 m let μ a i cr j 1 n a i j x j b i denote the credibility of variable of b i and j 1 n a i j x j i 1 2 m normally for credibility to be significant it should be greater than 0 5 for each 0 5 δ i μ a i 1 we have 5 j 1 n a i j 3 x j 2 j 1 n a i j 2 x j 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 j 1 n a i j 3 x j j 1 n a i j 2 x j b i 2 b i 1 δ i i 1 2 m thus we have 6 j 1 n 2 δ i a i j 3 a i j 2 2 a i j 2 a i j 3 x j 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 δ i b i 2 b i 1 i 1 2 m 3 2 upper level for rwra water resources allocation generally follows three principles efficiency equity and sustainability the upper level is regional authority who acts on behalf of the public interest therefore the two principles of equity and sustainability are the primary considerations in this decentralized bi level water resources allocation system 3 2 1 objectives on rwra in the upper level in the decentralized bi level water resources allocation optimization model regional authority acts first allocating water to various sub areas often balancing equity and sustainability 1 gini coefficient minimization the gini coefficient is an effective measure for equity assessment of resource allocation issues the gini coefficient was proposed by gini 1921 it is an important analytical indicator for measuring the degree of income distribution gap and it is also an important analytical indicator commonly used in the world to comprehensively examine the income distribution gap among residents so far it is currently used to measure differences in resource allocation the gini coefficient is usually calculated using the lorenz curve represents the response relationship between the cumulative income proportion and the corresponding cumulative population proportion suppose the area between the absolute bisector and the lorentz curve is a and the area under the lorentz curve is b the value of the gini coefficient is equal to a a b a lorentz curve for water allocation can be drawn as shown in fig 2 the x axis represents the cumulative economic benefits share while the y axis represents the cumulative share of the total water allocated use the relative mean difference to estimate the gini coefficient of water allocation measured by the equitably sharing of water used per unit of economic benefits hu et al 2016b the gini coefficient formula for water allocation is as follows 7 min f 1 1 2 m i 1 m q i e b i l 1 m k 1 m q l e b l q k e b k where e b i j 1 n e b i j 2 cod coefficient minimization the use of water for production activities inevitably produces waste water and the discharge of waste water directly affects the environment of the region which is an important issue that the regional authorities must consider the cod coefficient is widely used to measure waste water discharge problems sun et al 2020 thus it is introduced to measure the sustainability objective and it is described as follows 8 min f 2 i 1 m j 1 n 0 1 r i j p i j q i j 3 2 2 constraints on rwra in the upper level 1 water availability constraints the annual initial water volume of region a w varies with conditions but historical data can be used to derive the initial water volume of the basin through technical forecasting babel et al 2005 divakar et al 2011 the volume of water allocated to each sub area cannot exceed the initial volume of water for the region 9 i 1 m q i a w 2 technical constraints the water delivered from the start to the destination should between the minimum and the maximum capacities 10 z i min q i z i max 3 storage constraints the summation of the allocated water in the sub area i other water sources and total groundwater should not exceed the maximum storage capacity 11 1 α i l o s s q i w s i e t g w i s i max 3 3 lower level for rwra sub areas allocate water to subordinate sectors industrial agricultural and domestic who usually have more self interest in mind therefore its interests are different with regional authority 3 3 1 objectives on rwra in the lower level in order to make subordinate sectors as satisfied as possible and achieve more efficiency it is usually necessary for sub areas to coordinate the equilibrium and efficiency of each sector 1 maximum water shortage rate minimization these sub areas as higher level units to allocate water resources to various sectors it is necessary to consider the equilibrium of sectors which is closely related to the water shortage rate in order to meet the sectors water needs as well as to balance the sectors the maximum water shortage rate across sectors needs to be minimized 12 min max j f i e d i j q i j e d i j where d i j is a random number that obeys a normal distribution n μ i j σ i j 2 2 economic efficiency maximization when allocating water resources to jurisdictions lower level dms concern a lot about the economic benefits that can be obtained for a sub area its economic benefits e b i are the sum of the economic benefits of all subordinate sectors divakar et al 2011 shangguan et al 2002 while as for each sector the economic benefits derived from the allocated water resources are usually a function of the amount of water received 13 e b i j 1 n e b i j where 14 e b i j a e b i j q i j where a e b i j can be estimated by historical data to allocate water resources rationally for maximum economic efficiency sub areas need to maximize the ratio of the economic benefits obtained to the maximum economic benefits equal to the maximum average economic benefit among the jurisdictions in sub area i multiplied by the total available water allocated to sub area i possible hu et al 2016a 15 max g i

of sub areas 17 1 α i l o s s q i w s i e t g w i j 1 n q i j w e c i min 3 groundwater fccp constraints it is required that the groundwater allocated to the sector must not exceed the groundwater that can be supplied since the proportion of the groundwater quota to the total allocated water and the sub areas groundwater supplies vary with different conditions which are set as fuzzy numbers placed on either side of the fccp constraint β i j and t g w i 18 cr j 1 n β i j q i j t g w i ɛ i 3 4 global decentralized bi level multi objective model of rwra based on the above descriptions the global decentralized bi level multi objective model of rwra is established as follows 19 min f 1 1 2 m i 1 m q i e b i l 1 m k 1 m q l e b l q k e b k min f 2 i 1 m j 1 n 0 1 r i j p i j q i j s t i 1

there is connection between the upper and lower dms rather than being independent in this paper a bi level interactive approach combined with cpso algorithm is proposed to solve this problem that is in the bi level interactive approach based on satisfactory solution the upper and lower bounds of each objective solution are obtained using the cpso algorithm 3 5 1 bi level interactive approach based on satisfactory solution in the proposed model there are actually interactive relationships among the dms the decision of the regional authority is based on the interests of its own and the sub areas cooperation among the sub areas is also needed to ensure regional sustainable development at this point the stackelberg solution which is often used to deal with bi level multi objective models is no longer applicable because it can only be used for completely non cooperative problems colson et al 2007 moreover this model is a nonconvex np hard problem the structure of multiple followers also increases difficulties to the solution in such case dms usually choose to find a satisfactory solution therefore considering a satisfactory solution instead of a stackelberg solution is scientific and reasonable in addition the decision making process of the two levels can be connected by satisfaction degrees sds and the interaction between the upper and lower levels can be realized by dealing with them according to the above reasons a bi level interactive approach is applied to solve the above model the procedures of bi level interactive approach based on satisfactory solution can be illustrated as follows step 1 solve the upper and lower bounds for each objective take f 1 as an example in the model there are 20 min f 1 s t x d suppose x 0 1 x 0 2 x i 1 x i 2 i i is the optimal solution for each single objective model then the upper and lower bound solutions of f 1 are as follows 21 f 1 max max f 1 x 0 2 f 1 x i 1 f 1 x i 2 22 f 1 min f 1 x 0 1 similarly the remaining can be found f 2 max max f 2 x 0 1 f 2 x i 1 f 2 x i 2 f 2 min f 2 x 0 2 f i max max f i x 0 1 f i x 0 2 f i x j 1 f i x i 2 f i min f i x i 2 g i max g i x i 2 g i min min g i x 0 1 g i x 0 2 g i x i 1 g i x j 2 where j 1 2 n j i step 2 get the satisfaction degree sd functions the first upper level objective satisfaction degree is as follows 23 s 0 f 1 x 1 if f 1 x f 1 min f 1 max f 1 x f 1 max f 1 min if f 1 min f 1 x f 1 max 0 if f 1 x f 1 max accordingly s 0 f 2 x s i f i x s i g i x can be found step 3 build a new model based on satisfactory solutions the following equation is used to maximize the minimal satisfaction degrees of all sectors 24 max min ω 1 1 λ i 1 ω 2 1 λ i 2 s t s 0 f 1 x λ 0 1 s 0 f 2 x λ 0 2 s i f i x λ i 1 s i g i x λ i 2 x d where λ 0 1 λ 0 2 are the minimal satisfaction degrees specified by regional authority msds step 4 evaluate equity between the upper and lower levels 1 if λ i 1 and λ i 2 is less than the minimal satisfaction set by lower level sectors the upper level dm need to lower their minimal satisfaction accordingly 2 set ω min ω 1 1 s i f i x ω 2 1 s i g i x ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x where ω 1 0 and ω 2 0 is the weight of f 1 and f 2 ω 1 1 and ω 2 1 is the weight of f i and g i as the satisfactory balance between the upper and lower levels if ω exceeds ω max the upper dm need to raise the minimal satisfaction on the contrary if ω is less than ω min the upper dm need to reduce the minimal satisfaction in addition ω min and ω max is set by regional authority to adjust the equity of water allocation between upper and lower levels sakawa et al 1998 finally a satisfactory solution x that meets the above conditions is obtained the pseudo code is shown in algorithm 1 3 5 2 cpso algorithm in the first step of the above method multiple single level single objective models should be solved which are still very complex and basically impossible to get accurate solutions to this end a modified pso algorithm will be applied which called cpso algorithm to solve these models compared with the pso algorithm the cpso algorithm adopts adaptive inertia weight and chaotic search which is more conducive to searching for the global optimal solution the procedures of cpso based on the logistic equation can be illustrated as follows step 1 initialize the position and velocity of the particles in the population randomly step 2 calculate the fitness values of every particles and save the p b e s t k and g b e s t k step 3 determine the position and velocity for the next iteration 25 v k 1 w v k c 1 r 1 p best k x k c 2 r 2 g best k x k 26 x k 1 x k v k 1 where v k represents the velocity vectors of a certain particle x k represents the current position of the particle p best k represents the best previous position of the particle searched by itself g best k represents the best previous position among all particles in the population r 1 and r 2 are two pseudo random numbers with range 0 1 w represents the inertia weight that indicates the effects of the previous velocity of the particle on its current one c 1 and c 2 are two positive numbers which are called acceleration coefficients generally set w 1 c 1 c 2 2 in order to overcome the shortcomings of fixed parameters in pso the formula of the adaptive inertia weight factor adopted by the cpso algorithm is optimized as follows 27 w w min w max w min f f min f avg f min if f f avg w max if f f avg where w min and w max represents the minimum and maximum value of w respectively f represents the current objective value of the particle f avg and f min are the average and minimum objective values of all particles respectively step 4 calculate the objective values of all the particles and save some of the best solutions step 5 execute chaotic local search update the p best k and g best k in order to solve the problem that pso algorithm is often trapped in local optima cpso algorithm uses chaos disturbance when particles are trapped in local optima 28 z j k 1 μ z j k 1 z j k k 0 1 max i t e r 0 z j 0 1 where μ is called control variate which is generally set as μ 4 z j k denotes the j th chaotic variable and k represents the generation number obviously z j k is distributed in the interval 0 1 0 under the conditions that the initial z j 0 0 1 and z j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 29 x j x j η j z j k where x j represents the best solution at the current time η j is called the adjustment coefficient z j k is called chaos variable with range 1 1 30 η j γ k max k 1 k max 2 x j where γ is called radius of the neighborhood γ 0 1 k max represents the maximum number of iteration k represents the current number of iterations step 6 if the iterations number reaches the maximum saving the best solutions otherwise let k k 1 and go back to step 2 the pseudo code of cpso algorithm can be seen in algorithm 2 4 case study the above model and solution approach are applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china then the results and discussion will be described in this section 4 1 case description the dongjiang river is one of the three major water systems in the pearl river basin of china the main stream of the dongjiang river flows from northeast to southwest with a total length of 562 km of which 435 km in guangdong province the total area of the above watershed is 35 340 km 2 of which 31 840 km 2 is in guangdong province accounting for 90 1 of the total basin area as shown in fig 3 the dongjiang river is the main water supply source in guangzhou gz i 1 shenzhen sz i 2 heyuan hy i 3 huizhou hz i 4 and dongguan dg i 5 in guangdong province with a total water supply population of nearly 30 2 million people in this part the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province is taken as the study site after the water resources are allocated from the dongjiang river to the cities the cities reallocate the water resources to the subordinate sectors industrial j 1 agricultural j 2 and domestic sectors j 3 affected by pollution and climate change several severe continuous drought crises befell to the dongjiang river basin in recent years which seriously restrict the development of it in addition guangdong province is adjacent to the sea results in some areas in the lower reaches of the dongjiang river basin such as guangzhou and dongguan will face severe salt tides when the drought come consequently the groundwater in the sub areas changes largely which has caused great uncertainty in order to solve the above problems and release the potential of the dongjiang river basin the proposed model and solution approach will be applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china and suggestions for the dms of rwra will be provided so as to help its favorable and stable development 4 2 data collection the data of this case comes from the guangdong provincial water resources bulletin and guangdong provincial statistical yearbook issued by the guangdong provincial department of water resources and the guangdong provincial bureau of statistics detailed information for the regional authority on the upper level and the sub areas on the lower level is shown in tables 3 and 4 the parameters of the fccp constraint are shown in table 5 the mlab module in matplotlib in python is used to fit the discrete data points then as shown in table 6 the normal distribution that the random fuzzy water demand obeys are gotten extrapolating from the collected data the total available water is 137 1 0 9 m 3 in the fccp constraint the initial confidence of the 5 sub areas is set as ɛ 1 ɛ 2 ɛ 3 ɛ 4 ɛ 5 0 9 4 3 results analysis and discussion 4 3 1 results interpretation after careful test the most suitable parameters for the cpso algorithm are selected as ω 0 8 c 1 0 5 c 2 0 5 maximum number of iterations m a x i t e r 150 the upper and lower bounds of single objective solutions are shown in table 7 according to the results the satisfaction function can be listed initial msds are set to 0 6 and 0 8 the weight of objectives in the two levels are ω 1 0 0 6 ω 2 0 0 4 ω 1 1 0 35 ω 2 1 0 65 the upper and lower bounds of the satisfactory balance of the upper and lower levels are set as 1 and 0 6 then the satisfactory solution is calculated as shown in table 8 where s ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x it can be seen that the gini coefficient is 0 105 the cod coefficient is 20 394 the water shortage rate of the lower level is all lower than 0 and the lowest satisfaction rate of the lower level is 0 581 the satisfactory balance of the upper and lower levels can be calculated 31 ω min ω 1 1 s i f i x ω 2 1 s i g i x ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x 0 793 which indicates that the two levels are relatively satisfied and balanced 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis on weight of objectives the above results are based on the msds of the upper level objectives being 0 4 and 0 8 this part will make some changes to them the first objective λ 0 1 selects 0 7 0 6 0 5 0 4 and the second objective λ 0 2 selects 0 8 0 7 0 6 0 5 thus forming 16 new candidate results as shown in tables 9 11 table 9 shows the changes in the solutions of objectives with the msds changes it shows that the solutions of the upper objectives change with the msds indicating that msds are decisive methods for regional authority to pursue its interests table 10 shows the corresponding changes in the sds of the two levels it can be clearly seen that the change in the solutions of objectives are not obvious and the ranking of the water shortage rate of sub areas are hardly affected table 11 reflects the holistic satisfaction of the two level theoretically the lower msds of the upper dm the larger the decision making space of the lower dms and the satisfaction of lower dms will increase accordingly but the proposed results show a more complicated variation it can be from table 9 that the change of msds has a more significant impact on the second objective of lower level therefore fig 4 is plotted and some facts can be found when the msd of the first objective of the upper level is given as the msd of the second objective of the upper level decreases the solution of the second objective of the lower level clearly shows an upward trend this means that equilibrium objective minimization of maximum water shortage rate among sub areas do not appear to be affected by equity and sustainability objectives at the regional authority however when regional authority relaxes their requirements for sustainability objective the economic efficiency of sub areas will increase accordingly clearly the results of rwra in this model depend heavily on the preferences of regional authority for their objectives that is if they pursue more sustainability they tend to set higher msd of the first objective but they need to be aware of the conflict with sub areas as they become more sustainability sub areas become less satisfied with their economic efficiency objectives at the same time regional authority can reduce the amount of sewage discharged per unit of water by formulating environmental policies such as promoting production emission reduction and efficient agricultural irrigation technologies and encouraging residents to conserve water to ameliorate this contradiction it can be seen from table 11 and fig 5 that the average sd of upper level and sds of lower level are changing with the msds compared with hy and dg the changes in satisfaction of gz sz and hz are relatively moderate indicating that the sensitivity of the three sub areas is less than that of the other two sub areas regional authority can use this conclusion as a reference for water allocation in addition there is no single situation that maximizes all sds and fig 6 shows that when the msds are set to 0 4 and 0 6 the satisfactory balance between the two levels is the highest explain that the objectives of them play the same important role in this scheme when the msds are set to 0 5 and 0 8 respectively the satisfactory balance of the two level is the lowest indicating that in this scheme the upper level dm s objectives play a much greater role than the lower level dms objectives based on above the regional authority should evaluate the position of sub areas in the allocation system after formulating the msds if the satisfaction of sub areas are valued and the two levels is expected to be as balanced as possible then the upper dm needs to judge whether the results can reach the expected state in advance 4 3 3 scenario analysis in the following scenarios changes will be made to some key parameters total available water and groundwater constraint parameters and their impact will be analyzed in addition the objective weights of the two levels are still set as 0 4 0 6 0 35 0 65 in order to test the utilization of multiple water sources under drought and flood conditions a variety of different total available water scenarios are introduced into the proposed model since in the above data the total available water is in especially wet years so the following analysis only adjusts the total available water downward in addition μ indicates the rate of change based on the original data and represents the parameters value down regulation when the total available water was adjusted downwards it can be found that the water shortage rate of sub areas were positive after the 20 downward adjustment indicating that the water allocated to the sub areas did not meet their demands that is basin water is insufficient at this time which means the region is in drought in this case groundwater constraint parameters will be adjusted and the impact on results of rwra will be explored 1 scenario 1 different total available water the total available water aw is the decisive factor of rwra as shown in table 12 changes in total available water have a significant impact on the results it can be seen that for the upper level objectives when aw decreases the total pollution discharge decreases and the cod coefficient decreases accordingly while gini coefficient does not seem to be affected for lower level dms objectives after the amount of allocated water decreases water shortage rate and economic efficiency increases and decreases accordingly at the same time the sds of lower level dms are also on the decline when the aw is reduced by 10 the water shortage rate of sub area 2 i e sz is positive and the whole results are slightly changed compared to the full negative number when the aw is reduced by 20 the water shortage rates of sub areas are all positive numbers indicating that the allocated water cannot meet their satisfactory therefore in order to achieve a satisfactory situation the sub areas need to increase aw through other ways such as making more use of other water sources desalinating seawater and increasing industrial water recycling and so on sub areas can also enhance water storage capacity and retain more precipitation by building water facilities such as reservoirs fig 7 shows the change in the proportion of q i in each sub area under different aw it can be seen that although the allocated water obtained by each sub area changes the proportion shows delicate difference when water resources are in scarcity the proportion of water obtained in the large scale sub areas decreases indicating that the upper level dm sacrificed some other interests in order to ensure the water demand of the subordinate sub areas of the small scale sub areas 2 scenario 2 different groundwater constraint parameters when the aw is insufficient μ 0 2 groundwater as another water source for each sub area should be used as a supplement to the water allocation the confidence ɛ in the fccp constraint is set as 0 6 some parameters of the groundwater constraint are adjusted to found some variation in the results the optimistic pessimistic adjustment index of the fuzzy number of the total groundwater t g w i are changed and the reconstructed results are analyzed table 13 shows the results after δ was changed and fig 8 shows the solution of water shortage rates in different δ it can be seen that when δ changes from 0 5 to 0 3 0 8 and 1 there are some variations compared to μ 0 2 in table 12 as this parameter goes up the first objective of the upper level i e equity objective is getting preferable that is for sub areas when the amount of available groundwater for allocation increases the total amount of available water for allocation also increases in result it is more effortless for regional authority to consider equity on the basis of meeting the water demand of sub areas in addition the total amount of pollutant discharge in the region is gradually increasing which is caused by the increase of allocated water there is slight change in the allocated water amount from regional authority to sub areas but from sub areas to sectors it is obviously increasing gradually the water shortage rates of sub areas are significantly improved after the groundwater supply is replenished from 4 positive numbers to all negative numbers this shows that when the groundwater is used as a supplement to the available water for allocation the amount of water that can be obtained by each sub area will also increase and it is easier to meet their demands the economic efficiency of sub areas and the satisfaction of each sub area has also improved when the surface water is decreasing groundwater can be controlled by fccp constraint which can efficaciously guarantee the safety of water use however if the changing range exceed the model control force the groundwater will face the crisis of overexploitation as well as the regional water environment and groundwater reserves will be affected therefore to protect groundwater regional authority need to pay attention to the reserve of surface water at ordinary times so that the safety of water can be ensured and excessive use of groundwater can be avoided when drought comes in addition groundwater as one of the main sources of rwra plays a major role in maintaining the underground environment which should be protected from unsustainability in regional perspective regional authority should strictly implement the relevant policies for the protection of groundwater so that all sectors will reduce the pollution of groundwater as much as possible develop a powerful integrated control system for groundwater and promote the scientific development of groundwater resources regular monitor the groundwater safety levels and response in time 4 3 4 comparison analysis with single level multi objective model the traditional rwra systems are usually solved by using a single level multi objective models in these models regional authority as the only dm in rwra allocates water resources with overall interests of the region the single level model looks like this 32 min f 1 1 2 m i 1 m q i e b i l 1 m k 1 m q l e b l q k e b k min f 2 i 1 m j 1 n 0 1 r i j p i j q i j s t i 1 m q i a w z i min q i z i max i 1 2 m 1 α i l o s s q i w s i e t g w i s i max i 1 2 m q i j d i j min i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 1 α i l o s s q i w s i e t g w i j 1 n q i j w e c i min i 1 2 m c r j 1 n β i j q i j t g w i λ i i 1 2 m solve in the same way for the single level model 33 max λ s t s 0 f 1 x λ s 0 f 2 x λ x d where λ is satisfaction degrees of sub areas and d is the feasible region of the solution of the single level model likewise the cpso algorithm is applied to solve the single level model after the results are obtained they are compared with the results of the decentralized bi level model the results are all calculated by the solution methods in section 3 5 as shown in the tables 14 and 15 the satisfactory balance of the two levels is 34 ω min ω 1 1 s i f i x ω 2 1 s i g i x ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x 0 1457 obviously although the single level model performs better in the satisfaction of the upper level objectives the negligence of the lower level objectives leads to much lower satisfaction of the lower level objectives than the bi level model as a result the satisfaction of the two levels are extremely unbalanced in rwra it is often not enough to start from the macro level of the region because each sub area pursues its own economic benefits and other objectives if the upper level dm ignores these interests the water allocated to the lower level is often unsatisfactory in this case therefore it is more reasonable to use the bi level model for rwra 4 3 5 further discussion as mentioned above the proposed bi level multi objective model can effectively solve the problems in the case study in reality however managers usually have different preferences corresponding to different countermeasures for example if dm prefers the gini coefficient which is determined not only by allocated water but also by the water use efficiency of sub areas incidentally the urban development level of sub areas in the case site is not such different and the economic benefit level per unit of water is relatively balanced at this point allocated water can greatly affect the gini coefficient of the region however in reality there may be a large gap between the rich sub areas and the poor sub areas which causes large difference in water use efficiency accordingly dm needs to improve the structure of gini coefficient not only for guarantee the equity of water allocation but also for improving the efficiency of water use for agricultural irrigation and industrial production in poor sub areas similarly water allocation is not the only way for lower dms to improve economic objective because economic efficiency of a sub area is not only related to the allocated water but also related to the maximum average value of the economic benefit among all sectors in the sub area a more balanced average economic benefit among sectors would also help to improve economic efficiency typically the average economic benefit is highest in the industrial sector therefore dms can start from two aspects i e optimizing the water allocation and improving the water use efficiency in the agricultural and domestic sectors 5 conclusions in this study a decentralized bi level multi objective optimal model for rwra considering equity sustainability equilibrium and efficiency trade off is constructed the upper level dm i e regional authority introduces the gini coefficient to ensure the equity among the sub areas while considering the sustainability of the whole region and the objectives of lower level dms i e sub areas are equilibrium maximum and economic efficiency maximum the model incorporates groundwater of sub areas into water supply and combines groundwater constraint with the fccp method to flexibly cope with uncertainties in water allocation in addition water demand is set as random fuzzy number to adapt to the uncertain water use situation for the solution of the model the bi level interactive method based on the satisfactory solution is used here to transform the bi level model to a single level model then the proposed cpso algorithm is applied to solve the single level model furthermore the validity and practicability of the proposal is verified by a practical case study on dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china a series of results analysis and discussion are then carried out leading to the following conclusions 1 regional authority s sustainability objective conflict with sub areas efficiency objectives ie when pollutant discharge requirements are relaxed economic efficiency increases therefore dm must make trade offs and set appropriate emission standards to achieve better overall benefits 2 the total available water is a decisive parameter in the process of water resources allocation the water resources allocation scheme changes with the total available water the regional authority must have different rwra schemes for different total available water 3 groundwater can be an effective supplement to sub areas in the event of a lack of surface water combining groundwater constraint with fccp can flexibly deal with the uncertainties when basin water is insufficient sub areas can increase the supply of groundwater properly to meet the demands of sectors to ensure the sustainable and sufficient supply of groundwater sub areas shall try to protect the groundwater from over exploitation and pollution 4 compared with the single level optimal rwra model the bi level optimization model takes into account the objectives of the lower level dms so that there is a better balance between the two levels and the lower level dms will be more satisfied with the results of rwra in the future more uncertainty considerations for complex real world situations can be added on the basis of this framework in addition the proposed solution methods can also be further optimized to obtain solutions that meet the different needs of dms credit authorship

2145,multiple uncertainties from water resource allocation have posed new challenges to balanced regional development on the one hand in the context of global water shortage crisis groundwater as an important water supply module is facing severe risk of shortage on the other hand the regional authorities need to coordinate the contradictory water demand brought by the heterogeneous water use objectives from multiple water use levels and these demands are also subject to complex uncertainties how to mitigate the risks posed by uncertainties ensure regional water security and balance participants is attracting the keen attention of decision makers around the world therefore this study establishes a decentralized bi level multi objective regional water resources allocation rwra optimization model under hybrid uncertainty aiming at an optimal quartet trade off of equity sustainability equilibrium and efficiency to deal with the hybrid uncertainty in the model water demand is set as a random fuzzy number and the groundwater constraint is combined with fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp then the decentralized bi level multi objective model is solved by the bi level interactive method based on the satisfactory solution incorporated with the chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm the proposed model and solution approach are then applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china to verify the validity and utility of the model the results show that 1 the model can effectively meet the different objectives requirements of regional authority and sub areas 2 groundwater constraint parameters has a significant impact on the model results especially the gini coefficient decreases by 13 6 when groundwater is used as a water source supplement 3 from single level model to decentralized bi level model the satisfactory balance of the two levels increases from 0 1457 to 0 793 which indicates that the decentralized bi level model makes the two levels more balanced than the single level model based on the results some management recommendations for participants are finally provided keywords regional water resources allocation hybrid uncertainty bi level multi objective optimization multiple water sources chaotic particle swarm optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increased economic activity along with population growth coupled with the heightened effects of climate change are exacerbating water scarcity in many countries moghadam et al 2022 groundwater as the world s largest freshwater reserves cuthbert et al 2019 moreover is facing a huge crisis according to the united nations world water development report 2022 groundwater making the invisible visible due to long term over exploitation and pollution caused by human activities the global total groundwater reserves have severely depleted and its sustainability is at risk therefore in the context of global water resources shortage and groundwater crisis it is necessary to put forward higher requirements for river basin water resources management to ensure regional sustainable development the optimal allocation of water resources has become one of the most effective ways to cope with the increasing global demand for water and insufficient water supply mirdashtvan et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 izady et al 2021 one of the purposes of this study is to develop an optimization model for regional water resources allocation rwra so as to improve the effectiveness of regional water resources management regional authority the macro control role in the rwra should be the primary dm in the model however many studies only focus on regional authority feng 2021 xu et al 2019 ignoring the influence of other decision makers dms on the rwra as the followers of the regional authority the sub areas the water allocators of their subordinate sectors also play an important role in rwra yao et al 2019 therefore considering the different or even contradictory requirements between regional authority and sub areas a decentralized bi level programming is applied to the optimal model and the regional authority is considered as the upper dm while the lower dms are the sub areas since rwra involves many factors i e equity sustainability and economy it is imperative to take multi objective into account for example in water allocation of agricultural sectors hatamkhani and moridi 2021 have used gdp and williamson coefficient to measure economic efficiency and social equality the comprehensive water allocation strategy developed by naghdi et al 2021 considered social standards economic efficiency and environmentality and regarded maximizing the percentage of supply demand and minimizing the extent of groundwater extraction as objectives of their model then in order to ensure the balanced development of economic social and environmental benefits yuan et al 2022 proposed a multi objective optimization model for united allocation of water resources and wastewater emission licenses which takes into account the maximizing of economic benefits per unit of wastewater emission all of the above papers make significant contributions to the development of the research on water resources management in consequence for the decentralized bi level decision system of rwra proposed in this paper the upper level dm i e the regional authority seeks to achieve two objectives equity and sustainability hu et al 2016b jin yan et al 2021 while the lower dms i e sub areas considerations are equilibrium and efficiency tu et al 2015 2022 moreover the gini coefficient is introduced to measure the equity of sub areas by calculating the economic benefits obtained from water allocation and the chemical oxygen demand cod coefficient is used to measure sustainability based on pollutant emission then minimization of the maximum water shortage rate among sectors and maximization of economic efficiency are taken as the two objectives of lower level dms at this point the decentralized bi level multi objective model in rwra has been built due to the effects of human activities and climate change many uncertainties persist in hydrological models resulting in inaccurate and unreliable predictions tu et al 2022 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2014 ma et al 2021 yuhong and yao 2021 wu et al 2021 at present the uncertainty methods based on parameters have been widely used in many studies for the optimal water resources allocation to cope with them for example to deal with the uncertainty in the irrigation water allocation chen et al 2019 added two stage stochastic programming and interval parameter programming methods to their model there is also the application of the conditional value at risk cvar inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp model with imprecise probabilities ips and random boundary intervals rbis to agricultural water management li et al 2020a furthermore in the rwra system since the water demand of sectors change with the development of society and technology probability distribution is often considered to deal with the uncertain risks tu et al 2015 however due to the insufficient fitting data the probability distribution of the hypothesis obtained cannot accurately describe the demand from this the fuzzy set theory is introduced to deal with the probability distribution of the hypothesis and the hypothesis will be more flexible and realistic based on above the water demand of each sector is treated as a random fuzzy variable besides there are also studies using uncertainty methods to deal with constraints in models zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 among them fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp can effectively reflect the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints under uncertainty fccp has been used in many studies in water resources and environmental management zhang et al 2020 xu et al 2020 in the field of irrigation water management fccp has been repeatedly applied to groundwater constraints zhang et al 2018 dai et al 2021 however few studies have done so in rwra sum up a decentralized bi level multi objective model under hybrid uncertainty is developed which considers multiple water sources i e basin water groundwater and other water and pursues a quartet trade off i e equity sustainability equilibrium and efficiency in order to find a solution that satisfies both the bi level dms the bi level interactive method based on the satisfactory solution presented in nishizaki and sakawa 2009 can be used here this method aims to transform the bi level model to a single level model and then solves the single level model with the complexity of the decision environment in reality intelligent optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm are widely used to solve optimal models louati et al 2011 chen et al 2020 the pso algorithm proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 has many superior performances i e a fast convergence speed being simple and easy to implement that seeks to optimize an objective function using a population based search clerc and kennedy 2002 kannan et al 2004 liang et al 2006 alrashidi and el hawary 2009 zarghami and hajykazemian 2013 as an improvement of pso chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso algorithm liu et al 2005 zhu et al 2013 has the following superiorities to the pso algorithm the adaptive inertia weight is used to accelerate the convergence speed which is improved on the basis of the pso algorithm the chaotic search in the neighborhood is used to avoid falling into the local optimum therefore in this study the cpso algorithm was applied to solve the single level model comparisons with other literatures are shown in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that this study is more practical and comprehensive in a nutshell the main contributions of this study can be listed as 1 this paper takes hybrid uncertainty into account in the rwra system in view of society development and water use characteristics the water demand is expressed as a random fuzzy variable the groundwater constraint is combined with fccp method to ensure the sustainable development of groundwater and realize its flexible allocation 2 a decentralized bi level multi objective optimization model for rwra involving quartet trade off is established which not only comprehensively considers the various interest pursuit of upper and lower dms but also reflects the interaction and contradiction between the two levels the proposed model is applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china and the practicability and effectiveness of proposal are verified 3 scenario analysis of rwra under different total available water and groundwater uncertainty is carried out which enables dms to adjust the rwra plans in different basin water flow then the policy suggestions that suitable for the long term development of the region are put forward the structure of this paper is divided into five parts in section 2 the conceptual framework and key features of this study are described in section 3 the handling of uncertainty in parameters and constraints in the optimization model is discussed a decentralized bi level multi objective model of rwra is established and a bi level interaction method combined with cpso algorithm is proposed as the solution method in section 4 the proposed model and solution method for rwra are applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 problem statement a conceptual framework is constructed before modeling as shown in fig 1 in order to accurately describe that regional authority and sub areas have their own objectives and there is an interactive and even contradictory relationship between them this study establishes a decentralized bi level rwra system in addition because of many factors uncertain parameters and constraints often exists in rwra system and this model needs to be placed under uncertainty first of all the dms in this model are bi level construction the upper level dm is regional authority and the lower level dms are sub areas regional authority as the superior unit allocates water resources to the sub areas earlier considering the interests at the macro level of society the objectives of the regional authority are seen as equity and sustainability tanyimboh and seyoum 2016 gini coefficient can be introduced to evaluate equity among sub areas by measure the equality of economic benefits from water resources allocation besides regional authority should ensure sufficient ecological water and reduce pollutant discharge to achieve sustainability objective in this study regional authority will prioritize the allocation of ecological water and cod coefficient is applied to measure the pollutant discharge sub areas receive the basin water allocated by regional authority and then combine obtained basin water with groundwater and other water sources as multiple water sources to allocate to subordinate sectors unlike their superior they focus on the overall development of themselves with the objectives of equilibrium and efficiency for sectors they want to get enough water while minimizing the gap with other sectors therefore in order to achieve its own stability it is necessary for a sub area to keep sectors in equilibrium minimization of the maximum water shortage rate among sectors can effectively meet the water needs of them as well as maintaining their balance in addition the sub areas want the allocated water to be used as efficiently as possible which can be measured by the water economic efficiency of sectors to summarize the two levels of the model contain four objectives which formed a structure of quartet trade off hybrid uncertainty naturally exist in hydrological models because some parameters will change due to human activity and climate change babaeyan koopaei et al 2002 li et al 2020c which makes them unpredictable and requires flexibility in handling water demand change with social and technological developments which can be considered to follow a probability distribution on account of the lack of historical data the probability distribution obtained by directly fitting the historical data is not enough to predict reality accurately thus the fuzzy number is introduced to combine with the obtained probability distribution to represent the water demand as a random fuzzy variable groundwater as one of the main allocatable water sources in sub areas is facing the crisis of depletion and pollution sub areas need to make groundwater as a regulatory tool to cope with different water flow of the basin while avoiding excessive exploitation or pollution from this it can be seen that the quota of groundwater is affected by many factors how to ensure the sustainable development of groundwater and realize its flexible allocation is a crucial problem for dms therefore in this study combining the fccp with groundwater constraint can effectively achieve the goal that is while limiting the use of groundwater sub areas can also allocate groundwater flexibly by adjusting the parameters in fccp the above two methods of dealing with hybrid uncertainty will be explained in detail in section 3 3 methodology in this section the modeling process and solution approach of the decentralized bi level multi objective model under hybrid uncertainty are presented in detail the main parameters used in the model are shown in table 2 3 1 handling of hybrid uncertainty in parameters and constraints in the model random fuzzy water demand and fccp constraint for groundwater are considered the handling methods are given as below 3 1 1 random fuzzy water demand as mentioned above water demand is considered to follow some probability distribution firstly the initial parameters are fit estimated from collected raw data for example assuming that the water demand of a certain sector in a certain area obeys a normal distribution n μ σ 2 while its water demand in the next year may increase or decrease due to economic development scientific and technological progress human consciousness and other reasons experts have given a vague assessment of the probability distribution s mean between the minimum and maximum with a most probable value therefore the probability distribution can be taken as a fuzzy variable l m u where l m u are the mean minimum most probable and maximum values respectively thus sectoral water demand can be viewed as a random fuzzy variable d i j where i is the sub area index i 1 2 m and j is the sector index j 1 2 n it can be known that d i j n μ i j σ i j 2 where μ i j l i j m i j u i j the expected value of μ i j l i j m i j u i j can be converted to a deterministic value by using expected value operator in xu and zhou 2013 1 e d i j μ i j l i j m i j u i j 1 δ 2 l i j 1 2 m i j δ 2 u i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where δ 0 1 is the optimistic pessimistic parameter 3 1 2 fccp constraint for groundwater in fuzzy set theory fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp can effectively tackle system s random uncertainty it is widely used to deal with separate fuzzy uncertainties in the left and right sides of constraints li et al 2020b not only does it take into account multiple uncertainties in the model and calculation process but it can also lead to different decisions based on different levels of confidence for each sector the proportion of the groundwater quota to the total allocated water and the sub areas groundwater supplies vary with time and conditions which will be set to fuzzy numbers in summary groundwater constrain is expressed as fccp to optimize the system satisfaction of the model the main formula and transform method of fccp will be introduced below firstly the model of fccp can be formulated as follows 2 max j 1 n c j x j s t cr j 1 n a i j x j b i ɛ i i 1 2 m x j 0 j 1 2 n where i represents the index of constraints j represents the index of decision variables x j denotes the non fuzzy decision variable c j is the fuzzy coefficient in the objective function a i j and b i are the fuzzy coefficients in constraints ɛ i is the credibility level and cr ɛ shows that the credibility of constraint should be greater than or equal to level ɛ then in order to transform the uncertain constraint i e c r j 1 n a i j x j b i ɛ i i 1 2 m into the corresponding deterministic one a and b are assumed to be triangle fuzzy variables i e a a 1 a 2 a 3 and b b 1 b 2 b 3 based on its definition the credibility of a fuzzy event characterized by a b can be described as 3 cr a b 1 if a 3 b 1 a 3 2 a 2 2 b 2 b 1 2 a 3 a 2 b 2 b 1 if a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 b 3 a 1 2 b 3 b 2 a 2 a 1 if a 2 b 2 a 1 b 3 0 if a 1 b 3 detailed derivation for credibility formulation has been given by lu et al 2016 to solve the fccp model 2 the credibility constraint should be converted to a set of equivalent crisp sub constraints zhang et al 2015 in credibility constraint based on the credibility concept and definition and the theory of fuzzy operations the left hand can be expressed as 4 a i j 1 n a i j x j j 1 n a i j 1 x j j 1 n a i j 2 x j j 1 n a i j 3 x j i 1 2 m let μ a i cr j 1 n a i j x j b i denote the credibility of variable of b i and j 1 n a i j x j i 1 2 m normally for credibility to be significant it should be greater than 0 5 for each 0 5 δ i μ a i 1 we have 5 j 1 n a i j 3 x j 2 j 1 n a i j 2 x j 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 j 1 n a i j 3 x j j 1 n a i j 2 x j b i 2 b i 1 δ i i 1 2 m thus we have 6 j 1 n 2 δ i a i j 3 a i j 2 2 a i j 2 a i j 3 x j 2 b i 2 b i 1 2 δ i b i 2 b i 1 i 1 2 m 3 2 upper level for rwra water resources allocation generally follows three principles efficiency equity and sustainability the upper level is regional authority who acts on behalf of the public interest therefore the two principles of equity and sustainability are the primary considerations in this decentralized bi level water resources allocation system 3 2 1 objectives on rwra in the upper level in the decentralized bi level water resources allocation optimization model regional authority acts first allocating water to various sub areas often balancing equity and sustainability 1 gini coefficient minimization the gini coefficient is an effective measure for equity assessment of resource allocation issues the gini coefficient was proposed by gini 1921 it is an important analytical indicator for measuring the degree of income distribution gap and it is also an important analytical indicator commonly used in the world to comprehensively examine the income distribution gap among residents so far it is currently used to measure differences in resource allocation the gini coefficient is usually calculated using the lorenz curve represents the response relationship between the cumulative income proportion and the corresponding cumulative population proportion suppose the area between the absolute bisector and the lorentz curve is a and the area under the lorentz curve is b the value of the gini coefficient is equal to a a b a lorentz curve for water allocation can be drawn as shown in fig 2 the x axis represents the cumulative economic benefits share while the y axis represents the cumulative share of the total water allocated use the relative mean difference to estimate the gini coefficient of water allocation measured by the equitably sharing of water used per unit of economic benefits hu et al 2016b the gini coefficient formula for water allocation is as follows 7 min f 1 1 2 m i 1 m q i e b i l 1 m k 1 m q l e b l q k e

agricultural and domestic who usually have more self interest in mind therefore its interests are different with regional authority 3 3 1 objectives on rwra in the lower level in order to make subordinate sectors as satisfied as possible and achieve more efficiency it is usually necessary for sub areas to coordinate the equilibrium and efficiency of each sector 1 maximum water shortage rate minimization these sub areas as higher level units to allocate water resources to various sectors it is necessary to consider the equilibrium of sectors which is closely related to the water shortage rate in order to meet the sectors water needs as well as to balance the sectors the maximum water shortage rate across sectors needs to be minimized 12 min max j f i e d i j q i j e d i j where d i j

there is connection between the upper and lower dms rather than being independent in this paper a bi level interactive approach combined with cpso algorithm is proposed to solve this problem that is in the bi level interactive approach based on satisfactory solution the upper and lower bounds of each objective solution are obtained using the cpso algorithm 3 5 1 bi level interactive approach based on satisfactory solution in the proposed model there are actually interactive relationships among the dms the decision of the regional authority is based on the interests of its own and the sub areas cooperation among the sub areas is also needed to ensure regional sustainable development at this point the stackelberg solution which is often used to deal with bi level multi objective models is no longer applicable because it can only be used for completely non cooperative problems colson et al 2007 moreover this model is a nonconvex np hard problem the structure of multiple followers also increases difficulties to the solution in such case dms usually choose to find a satisfactory solution therefore considering a satisfactory solution instead of a stackelberg solution is scientific and reasonable in addition the decision making process of the two levels can be connected by satisfaction degrees sds and the interaction between the upper and lower levels can be realized by dealing with them according to the above reasons a bi level interactive approach is applied to solve the above model the procedures of bi level interactive approach based on satisfactory solution can be illustrated as follows step 1 solve the upper and lower bounds for each objective take f 1 as an example in the model there are 20 min f 1 s t x d suppose x 0 1 x 0 2 x i 1 x i 2 i i is the optimal solution for each single objective model then the upper and lower bound solutions of f 1 are as follows 21 f 1 max max f 1 x 0 2 f 1 x i 1 f 1 x i 2 22 f 1 min f 1 x 0 1 similarly the remaining can be found f 2 max max f 2 x 0 1 f 2 x i 1 f 2 x i 2 f 2 min f 2 x 0 2 f i max max f i x 0 1 f i x 0 2 f i x j 1 f i x i 2 f i min f i x i 2 g i max g i x i 2 g i min min g i x 0 1 g i x 0 2 g i x i 1 g i x j 2 where j 1 2 n j i step 2 get the satisfaction degree sd functions the first upper level objective satisfaction degree is as follows 23 s 0 f 1 x 1 if f 1 x f 1 min f 1 max f 1 x f 1 max f 1 min if f 1 min f 1 x f 1 max 0 if f 1 x f 1 max accordingly s 0 f 2 x s i f i x s i g i x can be found step 3 build a new model based on satisfactory solutions the following equation is used to maximize the minimal satisfaction degrees of all sectors 24 max min ω 1 1 λ i 1 ω 2 1 λ i 2 s t s 0 f 1 x λ 0 1 s 0 f 2 x λ 0 2 s i f i x λ i 1 s i g i x λ i 2 x d where λ 0 1 λ 0 2 are the minimal satisfaction degrees specified by regional authority msds step 4 evaluate equity between the upper and lower levels 1 if λ i 1 and λ i 2 is less than the minimal satisfaction set by lower level sectors the upper level dm need to lower their minimal satisfaction accordingly 2 set ω min ω 1 1 s i f i x ω 2 1 s i g i x ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x where ω 1 0 and ω 2 0 is the weight of f 1 and f 2 ω 1 1 and ω 2 1 is the weight of f i and g i as the satisfactory balance between the upper and lower levels if ω exceeds ω max the upper dm need to raise the minimal satisfaction on the contrary if ω is less than ω min the upper dm need to reduce the minimal satisfaction in addition ω min and ω max is set by regional authority to adjust the equity of water allocation between upper and lower levels sakawa et al 1998 finally a satisfactory solution x that meets the above conditions is obtained the pseudo code is shown in algorithm 1 3 5 2 cpso algorithm in the first step of the above method multiple single level single objective models should be solved which are still very complex and basically impossible to get accurate solutions to this end a modified pso algorithm will be applied which called cpso algorithm to solve these models compared with the pso algorithm the cpso algorithm adopts adaptive inertia weight and chaotic search which is more conducive to searching for the global optimal solution the procedures of cpso based on the logistic equation can be illustrated as follows step 1 initialize the position and velocity of the particles in the population randomly step 2 calculate the fitness values of every particles and save the p b e s t k and g b e s t k step 3 determine the position and velocity for the next iteration 25 v k 1 w v k c 1 r 1 p best k x k c 2 r 2 g best k x k 26 x k 1 x k v k 1 where v k represents the velocity vectors of a certain particle x k represents the current position of the particle p best k represents the best previous position of the particle searched by itself g best k represents the best previous position among all particles in the population r 1 and r 2 are two pseudo random numbers with range 0 1 w represents the inertia weight that indicates the effects of the previous velocity of the particle on its current one c 1 and c 2 are two positive numbers which are called acceleration coefficients generally set w 1 c 1 c 2 2 in order to overcome the shortcomings of fixed parameters in pso the formula of the adaptive inertia weight factor adopted by the cpso algorithm is optimized as follows 27 w w min w max w min f f min f avg f min if f f avg w max if f f avg where w min and w max represents the minimum and maximum value of w respectively f represents the current objective value of the particle f avg and f min are the average and minimum objective values of all particles respectively step 4 calculate the objective values of all the particles and save some of the best solutions step 5 execute chaotic local search update the p best k and g best k in order to solve the problem that pso algorithm is often trapped in local optima cpso algorithm uses chaos disturbance when particles are trapped in local optima 28 z j k 1 μ z j k 1 z j k k 0 1 max i t e r 0 z j 0 1 where μ is called control variate which is generally set as μ 4 z j k denotes the j th chaotic variable and k represents the generation number obviously z j k is distributed in the interval 0 1 0 under the conditions that the initial z j 0 0 1 and z j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 29 x j x j η j z j k where x j represents the best solution at the current time η j is called the adjustment coefficient z j k is called chaos variable with range 1 1 30 η j γ k max k 1 k max 2 x j where γ is called radius of the neighborhood γ 0 1 k max represents the maximum number of iteration k represents the current number of iterations step 6 if the iterations number reaches the maximum saving the best solutions otherwise let k k 1 and go back to step 2 the pseudo code of cpso algorithm can be seen in algorithm 2 4 case study the above model and solution approach are applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china then the results and discussion will be described in this section 4 1 case description the dongjiang river is one of the three major water systems in the pearl river basin of china the main stream of the dongjiang river flows from northeast to southwest with a total length of 562 km of which 435 km in guangdong province the total area of the above watershed is 35 340 km 2 of which 31 840 km 2 is in guangdong province accounting for 90 1 of the total basin area as shown in fig 3 the dongjiang river is the main water supply source in guangzhou gz i 1 shenzhen sz i 2 heyuan hy i 3 huizhou hz i 4 and dongguan dg i 5 in guangdong province with a total water supply population of nearly 30 2 million people in this part the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province is taken as the study site after the water resources are allocated from the dongjiang river to the cities the cities reallocate the water resources to the subordinate sectors industrial j 1 agricultural j 2 and domestic sectors j 3 affected by pollution and climate change several severe continuous drought crises befell to the dongjiang river basin in recent years which seriously restrict the development of it in addition guangdong province is adjacent to the sea results in some areas in the lower reaches of the dongjiang river basin such as guangzhou and dongguan will face severe salt tides when the drought come consequently the groundwater in the sub areas changes largely which has caused great uncertainty in order to solve the above problems and release the potential of the dongjiang river basin the proposed model and solution approach will be applied to the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china and suggestions for the dms of rwra will be provided so as to help its favorable and stable development 4 2 data collection the data of this case comes from the guangdong provincial water resources bulletin and guangdong provincial statistical yearbook issued by the guangdong provincial department of water resources and the guangdong provincial bureau of statistics detailed information for the regional authority on the upper level and the sub areas on the lower level is shown in tables 3 and 4 the parameters of the fccp constraint are shown in table 5 the mlab module in matplotlib in python is used to fit the discrete data points then as shown in table 6 the normal distribution that the random fuzzy water demand obeys are gotten extrapolating from the collected data the total available water is 137 1 0 9 m 3 in the fccp constraint the initial confidence of the 5 sub areas is set as ɛ 1 ɛ 2 ɛ 3 ɛ 4 ɛ 5 0 9 4 3 results analysis and discussion 4 3 1 results interpretation after careful test the most suitable parameters for the cpso algorithm are selected as ω 0 8 c 1 0 5 c 2 0 5 maximum number of iterations m a x i t e r 150 the upper and lower bounds of single objective solutions are shown in table 7 according to the results the satisfaction function can be listed initial msds are set to 0 6 and 0 8 the weight of objectives in the two levels are ω 1 0 0 6 ω 2 0 0 4 ω 1 1 0 35 ω 2 1 0 65 the upper and lower bounds of the satisfactory balance of the upper and lower levels are set as 1 and 0 6 then the satisfactory solution is calculated as shown in table 8 where s ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x it can be seen that the gini coefficient is 0 105 the cod coefficient is 20 394 the water shortage rate of the lower level is all lower than 0 and the lowest satisfaction rate of the lower level is 0 581 the satisfactory balance of the upper and lower levels can be calculated 31 ω min ω 1 1 s i f i x ω 2 1 s i g i x ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x 0 793 which indicates that the two levels are relatively satisfied and balanced 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis on weight of objectives the above results are based on the msds of the upper level objectives being 0 4 and 0 8 this part will make some changes to them the first objective λ 0 1 selects 0 7 0 6 0 5 0 4 and the second objective λ 0 2 selects 0 8 0 7 0 6 0 5 thus forming 16 new candidate results as shown in tables 9 11 table 9 shows the changes in the solutions of objectives with the msds changes it shows that the solutions of the upper objectives change with the msds indicating that msds are decisive methods for regional authority to pursue its interests table 10 shows the corresponding changes in the sds of the two levels it can be clearly seen that the change in the solutions of objectives are not obvious and the ranking of the water shortage rate of sub areas are hardly affected table 11 reflects the holistic satisfaction of the two level theoretically the lower msds of the upper dm the larger the decision making space of the lower dms and the satisfaction of lower dms will increase accordingly but the proposed results show a more complicated variation it can be from table 9 that the change of msds has a more significant impact on the second objective of lower level therefore fig 4 is plotted and some facts can be found when the msd of the first objective of the upper level is given as the msd of the second objective of the upper level decreases the solution of the second objective of the lower level clearly shows an upward trend this means that equilibrium objective minimization of maximum water shortage rate among sub areas do not appear to be affected by equity and sustainability objectives at the regional authority however when regional authority relaxes their requirements for sustainability objective the economic efficiency of sub areas will increase accordingly clearly the results of rwra in this model depend heavily on the preferences of regional authority for their objectives that is if they pursue more sustainability they tend to set higher msd of the first objective but they need to be aware of the conflict with sub areas as they become more sustainability sub areas become less satisfied with their economic efficiency objectives at the same time regional authority can reduce the amount of sewage discharged per unit of water by formulating environmental policies such as promoting production emission reduction and efficient agricultural irrigation technologies and encouraging residents to conserve water to ameliorate this contradiction it can be seen from table 11 and fig 5 that the average sd of upper level and sds of lower level are changing with the msds compared with hy and dg the changes in satisfaction of gz sz and hz are relatively moderate indicating that the sensitivity of the three sub areas is less than that of the other two sub areas regional authority can use this conclusion as a reference for water allocation in addition there is no single situation that maximizes all sds and fig 6 shows that when the msds are set to 0 4 and 0 6 the satisfactory balance between the two levels is the highest explain that the objectives of them play the same important role in this scheme when the msds are set to 0 5 and 0 8 respectively the satisfactory balance of the two level is the lowest indicating that in this scheme the upper level dm s objectives play a much greater role than the lower level dms objectives based on above the regional authority should evaluate the position of sub areas in the allocation system after formulating the msds if the satisfaction of sub areas are valued and the two levels is expected to be as balanced as possible then the upper dm needs to judge whether the results can reach the expected state in advance 4 3 3 scenario analysis in the following scenarios changes will be made to some key parameters total available water and groundwater constraint parameters and their impact will be analyzed in addition the objective weights of the two levels are still set as 0 4 0 6 0 35 0 65 in order to test the utilization of multiple water sources under drought and flood conditions a variety of different total available water scenarios are introduced into the proposed model since in the above data the total available water is in especially wet years so the following analysis only adjusts the total available water downward in addition μ indicates the rate of change based on the original data and represents the parameters value down regulation when the total available water was adjusted downwards it can be found that the water shortage rate of sub areas were positive after the 20 downward adjustment indicating that the water allocated to the sub areas did not meet their demands that is basin water is insufficient at this time which means the region is in drought in this case groundwater constraint parameters will be adjusted and the impact on results of rwra will be explored 1 scenario 1 different total available water the total available water aw is the decisive factor of rwra as shown in table 12 changes in total available water have a significant impact on the results it can be seen that for the upper level objectives when aw decreases the total pollution discharge decreases and the cod coefficient decreases accordingly while gini coefficient does not seem to be affected for lower level dms objectives after the amount of allocated water decreases water shortage rate and economic efficiency increases and decreases accordingly at the same time the sds of lower level dms are also on the decline when the aw is reduced by 10 the water shortage rate of sub area 2 i e sz is positive and the whole results are slightly changed compared to the full negative number when the aw is reduced by 20 the water shortage rates of sub areas are all positive numbers indicating that the allocated water cannot meet their satisfactory therefore in order to achieve a satisfactory situation the sub areas need to increase aw through other ways such as making more use of other water sources desalinating seawater and increasing industrial water recycling and so on sub areas can also enhance water storage capacity and retain more precipitation by building water facilities such as reservoirs fig 7 shows the change in the proportion of q i in each sub area under different aw it can be seen that although the allocated water obtained by each sub area changes the proportion shows delicate difference when water resources are in scarcity the proportion of water obtained in the large scale sub areas decreases indicating that the upper level dm sacrificed some other interests in order to ensure the water demand of the subordinate sub areas of the small scale sub areas 2 scenario 2 different groundwater constraint parameters when the aw is insufficient μ 0 2 groundwater as another water source for each sub area should be used as a supplement to the water allocation the confidence ɛ in the fccp constraint is set as 0 6 some parameters of the groundwater constraint are adjusted to found some variation in the results the optimistic pessimistic adjustment index of the fuzzy number of the total groundwater t g w i are changed and the reconstructed results are analyzed table 13 shows the results after δ was changed and fig 8 shows the solution of water shortage rates in different δ it can be seen that when δ changes from 0 5 to 0 3 0 8 and 1 there are some variations compared to μ 0 2 in table 12 as this parameter goes up the first objective of the upper level i e equity objective is getting preferable that is for sub areas when the amount of available groundwater for allocation increases the total amount of available water for allocation also increases in result it is more effortless for regional authority to consider equity on the basis of meeting the water demand of sub areas in addition the total amount of pollutant discharge in the region is gradually increasing which is caused by the increase of allocated water there is slight change in the allocated water amount from regional authority to sub areas but from sub areas to sectors it is obviously increasing gradually the water shortage rates of sub areas are significantly improved after the groundwater supply is replenished from 4 positive numbers to all negative numbers this shows that when the groundwater is used as a supplement to the available water for allocation the amount of water that can be obtained by each sub area will also increase and it is easier to meet their demands the economic efficiency of sub areas and the satisfaction of each sub area has also improved when the surface water is decreasing groundwater can be controlled by fccp constraint which can efficaciously guarantee the safety of water use however if the changing range exceed the model control force the groundwater will face the crisis of overexploitation as well as the regional water environment and groundwater reserves will be affected therefore to protect groundwater regional authority need to pay attention to the reserve of surface water at ordinary times so that the safety of water can be ensured and excessive use of groundwater can be avoided when drought comes in addition groundwater as one of the main sources of rwra plays a major role in maintaining the underground environment which should be protected from unsustainability in regional perspective regional authority should strictly implement the relevant policies for the protection of groundwater so that all sectors will reduce the pollution of groundwater as much as possible develop a powerful integrated control system for groundwater and promote the scientific development of groundwater resources regular monitor the groundwater safety levels and response in time 4 3 4 comparison analysis with single level multi objective model the traditional rwra systems are usually solved by using a single level multi objective models in these models regional authority as the only dm in rwra allocates water resources with overall interests of the region the single level model looks like this 32 min f 1 1 2 m i 1 m q i e b i l 1 m k 1 m q l e b l q k e b k min f 2 i 1 m j 1 n 0 1 r i j p i j q i j s t i 1 m q i a w z i min q i z i max i 1 2 m 1 α i l o s s q i w s i e t g w i s i max i 1 2 m q i j d i j min i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 1 α i l o s s q i w s i e t g w i j 1 n q i j w

is the feasible region of the solution of the single level model likewise the cpso algorithm is applied to solve the single level model after the results are obtained they are compared with the results of the decentralized bi level model the results are all calculated by the solution methods in section 3 5 as shown in the tables 14 and 15 the satisfactory balance of the two levels is 34 ω min ω 1 1 s i f i x ω 2 1 s i g i x ω 1 0 s 0 f 1 x ω 2 0 s 0 f 2 x 0 1457 obviously although the single level model performs better in the satisfaction of the upper level objectives the negligence of the lower level objectives leads to much lower satisfaction of the lower level objectives than the bi level model as a result the satisfaction of the two levels are extremely unbalanced in rwra it is often not enough to start from the macro level of the region because each sub area pursues its own economic benefits and other objectives if the upper level dm ignores these interests the water allocated to the lower level is often unsatisfactory in this case therefore it is more reasonable to use the bi level model for rwra 4 3 5 further discussion as mentioned above the proposed bi level multi objective model can effectively solve the problems in the case study in reality however managers usually have different preferences corresponding to different countermeasures for example if dm prefers the gini coefficient which is determined not only by allocated water but also by the water use efficiency of sub areas incidentally the urban development level of sub areas in the case site is not such different and the economic benefit level per unit of water is relatively balanced at this point allocated water can greatly affect the gini coefficient of the region however in reality there may be a large gap between the rich sub areas and the poor sub areas which causes large difference in water use efficiency accordingly dm needs to improve the structure of gini coefficient not only for guarantee the equity of water allocation but also for improving the efficiency of water use for agricultural irrigation and industrial production in poor sub areas similarly water allocation is not the only way for lower dms to improve economic objective because economic efficiency of a sub area is not only related to the allocated water but also related to the maximum average value of the economic benefit among all sectors in the sub area a more balanced average economic benefit among sectors would also help to improve economic efficiency typically the average economic benefit is highest in the industrial sector therefore dms can start from two aspects i e optimizing the water allocation and improving the water use efficiency in the agricultural and domestic sectors 5 conclusions in this study a decentralized bi level multi objective optimal model for rwra considering equity sustainability equilibrium and efficiency trade off is constructed the upper level dm i e regional authority introduces the gini coefficient to ensure the equity among the sub areas while considering the sustainability of the whole region and the objectives of lower level dms i e sub areas are equilibrium maximum and economic efficiency maximum the model incorporates groundwater of sub areas into water supply and combines groundwater constraint with the fccp method to flexibly cope with uncertainties in water allocation in addition water demand is set as random fuzzy number to adapt to the uncertain water use situation for the solution of the model the bi level interactive method based on the satisfactory solution is used here to transform the bi level model to a single level model then the proposed cpso algorithm is applied to solve the single level model furthermore the validity and practicability of the proposal is verified by a practical case study on dongjiang river basin in guangdong province of china a series of results analysis and discussion are then carried out leading to the following conclusions 1 regional authority s sustainability objective conflict with sub areas efficiency objectives ie when pollutant discharge requirements are relaxed economic efficiency increases therefore dm must make trade offs and set appropriate emission standards to achieve better overall benefits 2 the total available water is a decisive parameter in the process of water resources allocation the water resources allocation scheme changes with the total available water the regional authority must have different rwra schemes for different total available water 3 groundwater can be an effective supplement to sub areas in the event of a lack of surface water combining groundwater constraint with fccp can flexibly deal with the uncertainties when basin water is insufficient sub areas can increase the supply of groundwater properly to meet the demands of sectors to ensure the sustainable and sufficient supply of groundwater sub areas shall try to protect the groundwater from over exploitation and pollution 4 compared with the single level optimal rwra model the bi level optimization model takes into account the objectives of the lower level dms so that there is a better balance between the two levels and the lower level dms will be more satisfied with the results of rwra in the future more uncertainty considerations for complex real world situations can be added on the basis of this framework in addition the proposed solution methods can also be further optimized to obtain solutions that meet the different needs of dms credit authorship

chengguan district lanzhou gansu province 730000 china hydrological connectivity is of great significance to the protection of wetlands and the rational development of water resources climate change and overdevelopment have led to the reduction of the zoige wetland area the destruction of its ecosystem structure and the severe degradation of wetland hydrological connectivity this study proposes an analysis framework to explore the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff based on the dynamic prediction of wetland spatial patterns and the quantification of wetland hydrological connectivity and nonlinear fitting the zoige wetland was selected for application and verification under the ecological protection scenario plan1 the wetland experienced an expansion of meadow wetland mw under the natural development scenario plan2 the degradation of shallow wetland sw is the most significant the optimal threshold distances tds for studying the hydrological connectivity in the hei river basin hrb and bai river basin brb were 1200 m and 1800 m respectively the hydrological connectivity of the hrb was significantly greater with a value that was approximately 30 50 times that of the brb in the same year the iic and pc of the two basins gradually decreased during the historical period and showed increasing and decreasing trends under the plan1 and plan2 scenarios respectively the effect of wetland hydrological connectivity on runoff was significantly different in the two basins wetlands developed extensively in the hrb and connectivity had an inhibitory effect on the runoff and the runoff generating efficiency of precipitation while the wetland was even more fragmented in the brb and the increase in connectivity promoted the generation of runoff because biodiversity is sensitive to change the patches in the middle reaches of the hrb and the lower reaches of the brb are the areas that should receive the highest wetland protection priority in the future keywords basin comparison hydrological connectivity zoige wetland runoff the importance of patches data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the interactive relationship between landscape patterns and ecological processes is an important research topic in landscape ecology cho et al 2013 wu et al 2019 studying the dynamics of the landscape pattern of ecosystems helps humans better understand the basic laws of the interaction of the regional surface system and provides a scientific basis for the management and decision making related to the landscape ecosystem yushanjiang et al 2018 stephens et al 2021 in recent years landscape stability biodiversity and ecosystem functions have been destroyed and this destruction has seriously affected ecosystem stability and greatly threatened the survival and development of humans chhogyel et al 2020 yang et al 2017 furthermore the landscape pattern is becoming fragmented leading to the reduction or even loss of habitat connectivity thus increasing the resistance of the landscape pattern to biochemical movements and increasing the possibility of species and population extinction jiang et al 2014 qian et al 2020 therefore maintaining landscape connectivity is considered key in nature and biodiversity conservation yu et al 2020 shen et al 2019a research on the temporal and spatial characteristics of landscape ecosystems evolution laws and influence mechanisms stability evaluation spatial differentiation and ecological restoration have become research hotspots in the fields of ecology and regional human land relationships zhao et al 2019a tannier et al 2012 wu et al 2020 the hydrological connectivity of a landscape is defined as the function of the landscape to promote or prevent the movement of substances bishop taylor et al 2018 yan and niu 2019 luo et al 2020 and this is a key indicator for protecting biodiversity and maintaining the stability and integrity of ecosystems cui et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b velazquez et al 2017 especially in areas where wetlands are widely developed wetlands have a very large ecological environmental effect serving as corridors filters and barriers wang et al 2020 related research on the hydrological connectivity of wetlands can improve the effectiveness of wetland restoration and has important significance for the analysis of runoff variation and the protection of ecological service functions lee and abdullah 2019 feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a with the gradual deepening of scholars understanding of landscape connectivity different methods have been developed to quantify and integrate connectivity into landscape program strategies and concepts du et al 2019 thorslund et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the least cost path model morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa obstacle impact index multi index evaluation method and other methods are widely used in hydrological connectivity research in the fields of hydrology and ecology ernst 2014 velazquez et al 2019 lesschen et al 2009 the mutual transfer of material energy and information flows between wetlands relies on water as the medium for connectivity and the connection mode between the three ensures good aquatic ecosystem development qi et al 2017 wang et al 2021 singh and sinha 2019 in addition to focusing on the entire landscape scale important hydrological patches as key connectivity nodes are of great significance for protecting or enhancing the hydrological connectivity within a river network ala aho et al 2018 saco et al 2020 qi et al 2017 szabo et al 2012 the gradual intensification of wetland fragmentation leads to patch dispersion which attenuates the functions of water migration and material exchange among plaques yang et al 2019 michalek et al 2021 covino 2017 therefore exploring the changes in the importance of patch functions and their impact on hydrological processes can improve the restoration of wetlands and the rational use of water resources allen et al 2020 wu et al 2021 hiatt and passalacqua 2015 changes in the wetland landscape pattern can significantly change the spatial distribution of moisture affect the runoff generation and convergence mechanism of a basin and then affect the hydrological cycle and water balance nieuwenhuyse et al 2011 bracken and croke 2007 richards and brenner 2004 used a spatial analysis program to analyze the digital terrain of the huron river in america and found that landscape connectivity had a great effect on runoff and that artificial drainage greatly increased runoff by connecting isolated areas on the landscape callow and smettem 2009 believed that the construction of dams led to an average reduction of 39 5 in hydrological connectivity and greatly changed the movement of flow and sediment in recent years the economic and urbanization development of the zoige plateau in china coupled with overgrazing and the drainage of ditches has led to a gradual increase in wetland fragmentation which has greatly affected the hydrological process of the basin and the rational allocation of water resources you et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 the heihe river basin hrb and baihe river basin brb in this region are connected and form a system the special ecological geographical pattern is a natural platform that can be used for comprehensive research on the hydrological connectivity of alpine wetlands through a comparative analysis of the basins this study proposes a research framework including the prediction and analysis of wetland spatial pattern dynamics the quantification of wetland hydrological connectivity and an analysis of its relationship with runoff the heihe and baihe river basins were used as the study area the specific objectives were as follows 1 predict wetland dynamic changes under different scenarios 2 explore wetland hydrological connectivity and patch importance changes under reasonable threshold distances and 3 perform a comparative analysis of the impact of wetland connectivity on the runoff and protection priority of wetland patches 2 study area the hei and bai rivers originate from the zoige plateau in the northeastern corner of the tibetan plateau and their geographic locations are generally between 102 10 103 25 e and 32 10 34 10 n fig 1 the two basins have abundant rainfall with an average annual precipitation amount of 752 mm and 840 mm respectively they are important water resource formation regions in the upper reaches of the yellow river the mainstream of the hei river has a total length of 261 km a drainage area of 7427 km2 and an average annual runoff of 1 01 billion m3 the mainstream of the bai river has a length of 187 km a drainage area of 5488 km2 and flat terrain within the region the confluence of the bai river and the yellow river forms the first bay of nine curves with an average runoff of 1 96 billion m3 zhang et al 2020b both basins have a continental plateau alpine humid climate which is cold and humid with a short spring and autumn a long winter and no summer furthermore seasonal variations are not obvious the catchment of the two rivers comprises approximately 2 3 of the zoige plateau and the main geomorphic types in the region are low hills valley terraces marsh depressions etc the vegetation types are mostly grassland and there are many marsh wetlands e g zoige wetland distributed in the floodplain as an important marsh wetland on the tibetan plateau these wetlands are a large discrete sponge in that they store abundant water resources in recent years due to the drainage effect of artificial ditches and natural channels the integrity of the zoige wetland has been destroyed which has aggravated the shrinkage of the wetland and has had a significant impact on the runoff in the source region of the yellow river 3 data and methods 3 1 data the landsat tm etm oli images path and row 131 036 131 037 131 038 and 130 037 were processed to obtain land use data through visual interpretation and decision tree classification visual interpretation was used to identify and extract marsh wetland and construction land information the decision tree classification method is based on four variables i e normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and digital elevation model dem to classify the other land types finally eight land use types were classified for the study area alpine grassland meadow wetland mw shallow wetland sw deep wetland dw lake aeolian sediment construction land and gravel land the data came from hou et al 2020 in our study mw sw dw lakes and rivers were classified as wetlands and other land uses were classified as non wetlands we collected the actual measured monthly runoff discharge sequence from the dashui and tangke gauge stations located downstream of the two rivers 1981 2016 the data came from the sichuan hydrological bureau and the data series were used to analyze and calculate the runoff indices the precipitation data came from the meteorological stations around the two basins and data were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn 3 2 methods this study constructed a research framework to investigate the effects of hydrological connectivity on runoff the ca markov model and mspa model were used to analyze the spatial dynamic changes in wetlands under different future scenarios based on this two hydrological connectivities iic and pc were calculated and the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff was explored through nonlinear fitting fig 2 3 2 1 ca markov model the ca markov model combines the advantages of time dimension analysis of the markov model and space dimension analysis of the cellular automata ca model it can realize the ability of dynamic and multiscenario simulations of land use and has high accuracy making it an important research method used in nonlinear science khoi and murayama 2010 anand et al 2018 in this paper we used the ecological protection scenario plan1 and the natural development scenario plan2 to predict wetlands the plan1 scenario was designed to assess the phenomena of overgrazing and grassland degradation in the two basins under the plan1 scenario the stable wetland was not degraded the hrb and brb accounted for 64 65 and 51 22 respectively according to the social and economic statistical yearbook and ecological protection policy of aba tibetan and qiang autonomous prefecture the annual grazing intensity was reduced by 5 the transferred amount of wetland in the transfer matrix was allocated proportionally and construction land could not occupy wetlands the plan2 scenario directly used the transition probability matrix from 2000 to 2009 for prediction the wetland area of the hrb and brb decreased significantly from 2000 to 2009 fig s1 to ensure the accuracy of the prediction results this transfer matrix was selected to simulate the land use in 2016 and evaluate the accuracy table s1 except for dw and lakes which had small areas the relative error of the other wetland simulations was within 20 and the kappa coefficient was 0 84 thus the prediction result was relatively satisfactory the prediction period was 2019 2049 in our study and the time interval was 10 years 3 2 2 gravity center migration gravity center migration was used to study the shift trajectory of the relative equilibrium point in the study region wang and zhang 2022 in our study we used the gravity center migration model to analyze the migration of the wetland center of gravity at different times and to draw a map of the spatial gravity center migration of the wetland its quantitative expression is as follows 1 x t i 1 n c ti x i i 1 n c ti 2 y t i 1 n c ti y i i 1 n c ti where x t and y t represent the longitude and latitude of the wetland spatial center of gravity in year t respectively in degrees c ti is the area of wetland patch i in km2 and x i and y i represent the longitude and latitude of patch i s gravity center respectively in degrees 3 2 3 mspa model the mspa model was initially used in the study of forest landscape patterns and then gradually developed into the analysis of spatiotemporal grid changes ecological network connectivity analysis and the construction of ecological network plates ritters et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 this model divides the image into the core islet bridge edge and perforation areas through processes such as corrosion expansion opening and closing vogt et al 2006 among them the core area has a relatively complete ecological system and is a large patch suitable for the communication of organisms and it corresponds to the green area in fig 3 islets have no connection with other foreground pixels and have poor exchange of material between internal species most islets were scattered in non wetlands perforation refers to the transition area between the core area and the internal non green landscape edge refers to the transition area between the core area and peripheral the non green landscape a bridge is a connecting channel between the core areas and a necessary corridor for material migration and energy exchange 3 2 4 hydrological connectivity after the spatial pattern analysis was completed hydrological connectivity including the integral index of connectivity iic and probability of connectivity index pc was calculated using conefor sensinode software saura and torné 2009 saura and pascual hortal 2007 the iic is used to describe the change in overall landscape connectivity with a value range of 0 to 1 and the formula is as follows 3 iic i 1 n j 1 n a i a j 1 n l ij a l 2 where n is the number of patches a i and a j are the areas of patches i and j units of km2 and n l ij is the number of connections in the shortest path for patches i and j a l is the total area of the basin and the unit is km2 the pc represents the maximum connection probability between habitat patches under the influence of the horizontal movement of the landscape it considers the dispersal behavior of the habitat landscape and is an effective way to evaluate the functional connectivity of the landscape the formula is as follows 4 pc i 1 n j 1 n a i a j p ij a l 2 where p ij is the maximum value of the potential diffusion probability of all connected paths between patches i and j notably the connectivity values obtained by choosing different threshold distances were different therefore before calculating the connectivity index it was necessary to filter the optimal distance threshold for the calculation of landscape connectivity through the number of links nl and number of components nc this value is usually determined by how the curves of nl and nc change with the td when the amplitude of change of nl and nc is small the td is optimal qi and fan 2016 nl is the number of connections between habitat nodes in the landscape if the distance between any two patches is less than the set distance threshold a link relationship is considered nc is a whole entity composed of functionally or structurally interconnected patches an isolated node or patch is a component and there are no functional relationships between different components in addition this study calculated the importance of patches the diic and dpc were used mainly for evaluating the contribution of patches to connectivity the larger the index values were the more important the influence of the patch on the hydrological connectivity 5 diic iic iic remove iic 100 6 dpc pc pc remove pc 100 where iic and pc represent the connectivity indices when all patches exist in the wetland and iic remove and pc remove represent the integral index of connectivity and the probability of connectivity index after removing the remaining patches respectively 4 results 4 1 land use prediction and dynamics the distribution of wetlands was significantly different in the hrb and brb according to the plan1 ecological protection prediction results fig 4 a and b the restoration of wetlands in the upper reaches of the hrb was obvious and both sw and dw had development the wetlands in the central and northern parts were more clearly connected the area of wetland in the hrb increased at a growth rate of 160 180 km2 10 years fig 4e the area of mw increased most significantly but the area of sw showed a slight shrinking trend the wetlands expanded outward with the original distribution in the brb the mw upstream and the sw in the middle and lower reaches developed significantly but the dw was still very small the wetland area in the brb increased at a rate of 120 150 km2 10 years under the plan1 scenario fig 4f under the plan2 natural development scenario the wetlands in the two basins showed a significant decreasing trend fig 4c and d the largest wetland patch in the northern part of the hrb showed a fragmentation trend and the wetland in the central area gradually moved away from the mainstream even though the southeast wetland maintained a few mws until 2049 combined with fig 4e the wetland reduction rate of the hrb increased compared with the historical period 97 km2 10 years and both sw and mw decreased significantly wetlands in the upper and lower reaches of the brb decreased significantly with a rate of approximately 60 km2 10 years in general the increases and decreases were the most serious outside the wetlands which eventually led to the wetlands being connected or fragmented the gravity center of the wetland in the hrb migrated to the southeast in the historical period fig 4g which is generally consistent with the migration direction under the plan2 scenario and the migration rate will gradually increase in the future indicating that the degradation of wetlands is dominated by the northern part of the basin under the plan1 scenario the gravity center of the wetland migrated in the opposite direction northwest indicating that the wetland recovery rate was more significant downstream under the plan2 scenario the wetland in the brb will generally develop to the south before 2029 same as in the historical period and then begin to develop to the northeast fig 4h indicating that the degradation of the wetland will initially be concentrated downstream and will then begin to intensify in the southern part of the basin under the plan1 scenario the wetland started to recover and the gravity center of the wetland expanded in the downstream northwest direction during the historical period the wetlands were converted mainly from sw to mw and mw and from dw to sw table 1 although the transfer area from sw to mw was large the net increase in mw was still small mainly due to the transfer of mw to non wetland and sw with values of 283 32 km2 and 104 32 km2 respectively most of the area of dw was converted to sw and the stable area was only 27 69 km2 the final change rates of mw dw sw and lake were 17 67 71 56 24 88 and 11 94 respectively table s2 the transfer within the wetland of the brb was mainly the mutual conversion between sw and mw but mw sw and lake all transitioned to non wetlands to varying degrees the final dw increased slightly while mw sw and lake decreased by 13 76 20 07 and 33 65 respectively under the plan1 scenario the stable part of the wetland in the two basins increased significantly and the internal conversion of the wetland decreased significantly mainly due to the conversion of non wetland to mw and sw the non wetland in the hrb and brb decreased by 10 51 and 9 42 respectively under the plan2 scenario large areas of wetlands were transferred to non wetlands the net reduction in mw and sw in the hrb reached 133 34 km2 and 135 16 km2 respectively and the net reduction in mw and sw in the brb reached 92 73 km2 and 93 36 km2 respectively 4 2 landscape dynamics based on the mspa model the wetland patches were divided into five landscape patterns core edge perforation bridge and islet during the historical period the wetlands in the hrb were significantly degraded which was represented by the gradual disappearance of some isolated islets and the gradual separation of larger cores into multiple small cores which were interconnected through bridges fig 5 in addition the internal perforations continued to expand so the area of the core decreased the edges of the wetland core in the brb were gradually dispersed and part of the interior was transformed into non wetland under the plan1 scenario new cores were formed on the edge of the wetland the wetland gradually became fuller and connected to form whole patches and the area of perforation in some regions increased in the natural development scenario the wetland area gradually declined the distances between the patches became longer and they were divided into different cores the islets were scattered and gradually increased according to the area statistics fig 6 the area of the core was the largest and showed a decreasing trend in both basins edges showed an increasing and decreasing trend in the hrb and brb respectively and the edge area was second only to core area the areas of islet perforation and bridge fluctuated between 10 and 25 km2 in the historical period during the forecast period the change laws of various landscape types tended to be consistent under the plan1 scenario islets were gradually annexed by the core and the islet area decreased the perforation area increased indicating that despite the expansion of the core internal perforation may block the hydrological connectivity of patches to a certain extent the restoration of wetlands improves the area and perimeter of the core except for the bridge area the change trend of plan2 was opposite to that of plan1 comparing the two basins the variation range of wetland core areas in the hrb was 1400 2600 km2 while it was only 500 1300 km2 in the brb 4 3 hydrological connectivity and importance of patches 4 3 1 hydrological connectivity taking the hrb as an example fig 7 a the nc rapidly decreased within the td of 0 1000 m while the nl increased at a relatively fast rate in this range the improvement of connectivity can promote the stability of the ecosystem obviously the td was not suitable when the td was 1000 2000 m the curvature of nc and nl slowed indicating that the hydrological connectivity was relatively stable in this interval it was less affected by the change in the td which was conducive to the analysis of landscape connectivity when the td was 2000 6000 m the nl and nc began to increase at a rapid rate and the landscape stability was still poor which was not suitable for landscape pattern and process analysis when the td was greater than 6000 m the nc gradually decreased to 1 and all ecological patches belonged to the same component all habitat patches in the basin could be regarded as interconnected but this scenario was obviously unreasonable given the actual habitat conditions finally 1200 m and 1800 m were determined as the tds for the study of the hydrological connectivity in the two basins the wetland in the brb was more fragmented and thus the td was larger than that of the hrb which was reasonable the change trend of wetland hydrological connectivity with certain tds is shown in fig 7c and d from 1990 to 2016 both the iic and the pc in the hrb showed a downward trend but the rate of change gradually decreased the ranges of the two index changes were 0 004 0 011 and 0 008 0 017 respectively under the plan1 scenario the pc continued to increase at a change rate of 0 0016 10 years while the iic had a slight downward trend from 2029 to 2039 by 2049 the pc and iic will reach 0 0146 and 0 008 respectively but they will not quite recover to the levels of the historical period under the plan2 scenario the two hydrological connectivities will decline and the values of pc and iic will be only 0 004 and 0 002 in 2049 the connectivity of the brb was much less than that of the hrb however under the plan1 scenario the hydrological connectivity was restored and exceeded the level of the historical period and the pc and iic reached 0 0007 and 0 0005 respectively under the plan2 scenario both connectivity indices declined at a relatively gradual rate which means that the hydrological connectivity of fragmented wetlands is sensitive to restoration policies 4 3 2 importance of patches taking the top 10 patches in 1990 by area the dpc and the diic as an example 12 in the hrb 14 in the brb the importance of patches was studied fig 8 the area of p1 in the hrb was much larger than that in the other patches and the importance for hydrological connectivity was also ranked 1st with dpc and diic values of 55 51 and 58 26 respectively the area of p2 was only 54 of p1 but the dpc still reached 51 00 the p3 to p10 areas had a small difference but the p3 to p6 areas were most important indicating the second stage of importance the remaining patches were of little importance and the value ranges of dpc and diic were roughly maintained between 3 50 7 69 and 2 34 5 51 the difference between the areas of p1 and p2 in the brb was small but p2 ranked first regarding the importance of patches with dpc and diic values of 33 42 and 30 43 respectively p4 p7 and p8 mainly located in the upper reaches of the brb were not included in the top 10 dpcs and diics instead p11 p14 which were located in the lower reaches of the basin played a more important role in hydrological connectivity 4 3 3 change in the importance of patches from 1990 to 2016 the importance of patches in the hrb was almost completely reduced fig 9 among them the importance of major patches in the middle and lower reaches of the basin decreased from 15 21 to 20 86 and the importance of small patches that split due to the fragmentation process decreased more significantly 53 79 57 77 the importance of wetland patches in the brb changed very little except for the significant increase in wetland patches linked to the hrb 11 54 and the sharp decrease downstream due to the complete patches being broken apart 9 53 the change in the importance of the remaining patches remained between 2 00 and 2 00 the spatial variation in dpc was consistent with that in diic in the two basins the changes in diic and dpc under the plan1 scenario in the future were opposite to those in the historical period except for a few patches that decreased significantly the importance of other patches all increased to a certain extent and the increase was most significant in the middle of the hrb δdiic 11 32 δdpc 7 12 under the plan2 scenario the importance of almost all patches showed a decreasing trend especially for the large patches in the north and center of the hrb and the reduction ranges of diic and dpc reached 30 87 42 23 however some small patches still showed an increasing trend in the middle reaches of the hrb even reaching 40 15 which may have been due to the difference in the spatial distribution of wetlands or the effect of internal perforation comparing the change in wetland types 1990 2016 within the key patches and the importance of patches fig 10 the changes in the diic dpc of patches in the hrb were generally consistent with the dynamics of wetlands within the patches most patches were dominated by the dynamic changes in sw which affected the importance of the patches the diic dpc of different patches in the brb fluctuated greatly and the importance of the largest patch p1 increased however the wetland area of this patch was greatly reduced the dynamic change in dw was relatively small its change was mainly in the center of the wetland and the effect of its change on hydrological connectivity was not obvious sw and mw had large areas and were distributed mostly in the periphery of the core areas of wetlands the wetland fragmentation process mostly started around the edges therefore these two types of wetlands had a relatively severe impact on the importance of patches 4 4 the effect of hydrological connectivity on runoff 4 4 1 the relationship between runoff and hydrological connectivity we compared the optimum fitting of the runoff depth cv the maximum runoff coefficient maxrc the minimum runoff coefficient minrc and the minimum runoff depth minrd with the iic pc to explore the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff fig 11 the increase in connectivity in the hrb promoted runoff but runoff gradually decreased after the connectivity reached 0 009 while the relationship was the opposite in the brb the optimal curve types for cv and connectivity were represented by the logarithmic function and quadratic function in the hrb and brb respectively the increase in hydrological connectivity gradually led to the homogenization of the annual distribution of runoff in the hrb while the increase in hydrological connectivity in the brb made the coefficient of variation in runoff first decrease and then increase for the relationship between maxrc and iic pc there was a diametrically opposite trend in the two basins the maxrc of the hrb decreased with increasing hydrological connectivity which means that the water storage of wetlands slowed infiltration and the efficiency of rainfall runoff generation was suppressed due to the small area of wetland in the brb precipitation easily meets the water storage capacity of the wetland and the internal water content of the wetland better supplements the production and flow outside of precipitation connectivity has the same effect on the minrc the increase in connectivity allows less precipitation to supplement the amount of water contained in the wetland but fails to form runoff the minrd of the hrb decreased with increasing connectivity and in the brb although there was also a decreasing trend the continued increase in hydrological connectivity led to an increase in baseflow 4 4 2 the effect of patches on runoff we analyzed the relationship between key patches and runoff depth fig s2 in the first stage p10 p12 the diic dpc was relatively small and the volatility was also small runoff changed but the importance of patches did not change in the second stage the importance of patches p3 p9 began to fluctuate and the fluctuation range of the same runoff changes was smaller than that of the third stage the points showed the characteristics of a convex curve and there was a large fault between the two stages the impact of dpc on runoff was different and the fluctuation range of the second level p3 p9 expanded there were generally two levels in the brb the first level contained most of the patches p3 p14 and the total magnitude of the fluctuations in the importance of these patches was the same as that of the second level p1 p2 to a certain extent this result reflects that the runoff changes in the brb are more susceptible to the influence of p1 and p2 at the patch scale 5 discussion 5 1 reasons for the change in hydrological connectivity climate warming is the most important natural cause that affects the landscape and ecological functions of the zoige wetland zhen et al 2017 in recent years the zoige wetland has shown a trend of drought luo et al 2019 the increase in temperature has caused a large amount of water loss in the wetland feng et al 2015 the wetlands have become fragmented and smaller and the hydrological connectivity has been reduced irregular floods or rainstorms are also important forces affecting the hydrological connectivity of wetlands mosquera et al 2015 bao et al 2021 in rainy weather the wetland is connected to the surrounding rivers and lakes and the wetland recovers or expands in our study we researched the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff but the two effects were mutual when the surface runoff decreased upstream the highlands gradually became exposed and dried up in the lower reaches of the basin gradually forming isolated bare land desertification and reducing connectivity the number of lakes in the zoige plateau decreased from 36 to 18 after drying up the bare lake bottom was gradually desertified by wind erosion wei et al 2020 the mainstream and tributaries of the upper reaches of the hei river have a large undercut depth and the source erosion rate is significant the river channel was continuously cut through and the bank collapsed resulting in the fragmentation and loosening of tightly structured peat wetlands zhao et al 2019c fang 2023 with population growth and economic development in the study area the human demand for local natural resources has increased and the phenomenon of large scale canal digging for water extraction is very serious currently more than 700 drainage ditches have been excavated in zoige county and hongyuan county with a total length of more than 1 000 km cui et al 2020 the ditches are intertwined vertically and horizontally leading to direct changes in the hydrological connectivity of marsh wetlands tian et al 2011 under the stress of drainage and increased ditches the wetland water yield has been severely reduced and a large amount of surface water has been drained peat swamps are dehydrated causing erosion collapse cracks and patching the original integrity of patches has been destroyed and the connectivity has weakened pang et al 2010 ma et al 2016 in addition overgrazing has aggravated the degradation process of marsh wetlands turning marshes into meadow wetlands meadows and even areas with signs of desertification thus overgrazing has seriously affected the hydrological connectivity of the wetlands shen et al 2019b 5 2 the impact of connectivity on runoff as a key node for water storage and connection in the basin water system wetlands can effectively regulate river runoff to reduce flood disasters and ensure water use in dry seasons and hydrological connectivity plays a key role yeo et al 2019 baustian et al 2019 changes in hydrological connectivity can have a significant impact on river hydrological dynamics including seasonal hydrological changes the relationship between water discharge and replenishment river flow velocity flow and even water age water change cycle hwang et al 2012 our research shows that changes in hydrological connectivity caused by changes in wetland patterns have a strong correlation with changes in runoff parameters with the increase in connectivity of the hrb the drainage function of wetlands begins to increase achieving the role of replenishing runoff however with a further increase in connectivity runoff can be better transported horizontal between wetlands moreover the increase in wetland area makes the water storage capacity more obvious and causes a decrease in runoff li et al 2021 there were different effects in the brb and fragmented wetlands promoted an increase in production and flow during the restoration process wetland development has played a buffer role in the hrb meng et al 2020 which homogenizes the distribution of runoff during the year the efficiency of rainfall runoff generation maxrc and baseflow are also reduced however the brb where the wetland is fragmented had the opposite conclusion the brb receives more precipitation than the hrb but the wetland range is much smaller when hydrological connectivity increases runoff generation efficiency is significantly improved kright et al 2018 higgisson et al 2020 5 3 priority of wetland patch protection in both basins sw was the most extensive wetland type and it surrounded dw and lakes and was connected to the surrounding mws combined with the wetland changes under different scenarios the dynamics of sw were the most dramatic while the changes in dw were relatively small from the perspective of patches p1 and p2 located in the middle reaches of the hrb had large areas diic and dpc with the process of natural succession they gradually became fragmented their importance decreased and their effect on runoff was obvious there are also many important nature reserves such as hua lake that are rich in biodiversity and sensitive to the impact of climate change and human activities sun et al 2016 combined with the results of wetland area and hydrological connectivity changes in different scenarios ecological protection plays an important role in the restoration of these patches so it is crucial to strengthen the ecological protection of the areas where these patches are located in the past 30 years this result is similar to the result of wetland degradation risk and vulnerability assessment of the zoige wetland by jiang et al 2017 the distribution of ditches was mainly concentrated in patches p4 p7 the area of these patches was approximately 1 2 105 km2 the current patches were of moderate importance and their importance increased most significantly under the plan1 scenario these patches should also receive more attention in the future jozwiakowski 2009 the patches of wetlands in the brb that require key protection are mainly concentrated in the lower reaches these patches are highly hydrologically connected and will change significantly under different scenarios these changes are of great significance to the downstream ecological environment the relationship between connectivity and runoff shows that future planning for the zoige wetland needs to be carried out from the perspectives of protection and development the restoration of wetlands can provide corresponding ecological service functions but the excessive development of wetlands will also lead to a decrease in runoff which may adversely affect the social economy and human survival cui et al 2012 therefore finding a balance between development and protection is necessary for the development of the zoige wetland zhou et al 2020 5 4 framework assessment and uncertainty based on graph theory network analysis landscape connectivity indices were combined with different runoff indices to study the influence and difference of hydrological connectivity on runoff from the perspective of watershed comparison and multiscenario analysis based on previous research results gomi et al 2010 found that the land use landscape pattern significantly affected the surface flow contribution of storm runoff in rivers based on the isotope tracer method yeo et al 2019 argued that wetlands have a strong seasonal relationship with downstream runoff and play a certain role in buffering floods in general the research results were similar to those in the hrb and brb but the effects of different wetland landscape patterns on runoff were still different this research framework analyzes the impact of wetlands on runoff from the perspective of watershed comparison and multi scene analysis providing a certain reference for future wetland protection and sustainable development our study considered the watershed as the research object and divided some wetlands such as p1 in the hrb and p2 in the brb this approach affected the integrity of the wetland to a certain extent and led to a certain deviation in the calculation of wetland connectivity and the importance of patches the wetland prediction was based on the land use transfer matrix in the historical period although it has been verified this approach still has some uncertainty except for some variables added in the process of predicting land use other factors such as climate and human activities were not considered in the research therefore this research requires more adjustments in data and technical means the limitations of this part of the study have not yet been resolved in addition when studying the effect of patches on runoff changes the impact of climate and human factors on runoff was not considered 6 conclusion this study proposed an analysis framework to explore the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff based on the dynamic prediction of wetland spatial patterns quantification of wetland hydrological connectivity and nonlinear fitting taking the hrb and brb as the study areas the differences in the impacts of wetland hydrological connectivity on runoff were studied through a basin comparison which provides a reference for wetland protection and future management 1 under the plan1 scenario the future expansion of the wetland will be mainly based on the increase in mw and the wetland will generally migrate to the northwest in both basins the areas of the cores and edges will expand but the areas of the perforations and bridges will decline slightly under the plan2 scenario the decline of the wetland is the most significant in sw except for bridge area and the change trend is opposite to that in plan1 2 the best thresholds for studying the hydrological connectivity of the wetlands in the hrb and brb were 1200 m and 1800 m respectively the iic and pc of the two basins gradually decreased during the historical period and showed increasing and decreasing trends under plan1 and plan2 respectively the hydrological connectivity of the hrb wetland was greater than that of the brb 3 4 times 3 the importance of patches also showed the same changes under the two scenarios patches in the middle and lower reaches of the basin played the most critical role in hydrological connectivity and had significant effects on runoff changes they are the key wetland patches to be protected in the future 4 the relationship between connectivity and runoff was different in the two watersheds the connectivity of the hrb had an inhibitory effect on runoff and the runoff generation efficiency of precipitation however the increase in connectivity in the brb promoted an increase in runoff credit authorship contribution statement lei wu writing

chengguan district lanzhou gansu province 730000 china hydrological connectivity is of great significance to the protection of wetlands and the rational development of water resources climate change and overdevelopment have led to the reduction of the zoige wetland area the destruction of its ecosystem structure and the severe degradation of wetland hydrological connectivity this study proposes an analysis framework to explore the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff based on the dynamic prediction of wetland spatial patterns and the quantification of wetland hydrological connectivity and nonlinear fitting the zoige wetland was selected for application and verification under the ecological protection scenario plan1 the wetland experienced an expansion of meadow wetland mw under the natural development scenario plan2 the degradation of shallow wetland sw is the most significant the optimal threshold distances tds for studying the hydrological connectivity in the hei river basin hrb and bai river basin brb were 1200 m and 1800 m respectively the hydrological connectivity of the hrb was significantly greater with a value that was approximately 30 50 times that of the brb in the same year the iic and pc of the two basins gradually decreased during the historical period and showed increasing and decreasing trends under the plan1 and plan2 scenarios respectively the effect of wetland hydrological connectivity on runoff was significantly different in the two basins wetlands developed extensively in the hrb and connectivity had an inhibitory effect on the runoff and the runoff generating efficiency of precipitation while the wetland was even more fragmented in the brb and the increase in connectivity promoted the generation of runoff because biodiversity is sensitive to change the patches in the middle reaches of the hrb and the lower reaches of the brb are the areas that should receive the highest wetland protection priority in the future keywords basin comparison hydrological connectivity zoige wetland runoff the importance of patches data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the interactive relationship between landscape patterns and ecological processes is an important research topic in landscape ecology cho et al 2013 wu et al 2019 studying the dynamics of the landscape pattern of ecosystems helps humans better understand the basic laws of the interaction of the regional surface system and provides a scientific basis for the management and decision making related to the landscape ecosystem yushanjiang et al 2018 stephens et al 2021 in recent years landscape stability biodiversity and ecosystem functions have been destroyed and this destruction has seriously affected ecosystem stability and greatly threatened the survival and development of humans chhogyel et al 2020 yang et al 2017 furthermore the landscape pattern is becoming fragmented leading to the reduction or even loss of habitat connectivity thus increasing the resistance of the landscape pattern to biochemical movements and increasing the possibility of species and population extinction jiang et al 2014 qian et al 2020 therefore maintaining landscape connectivity is considered key in nature and biodiversity conservation yu et al 2020 shen et al 2019a research on the temporal and spatial characteristics of landscape ecosystems evolution laws and influence mechanisms stability evaluation spatial differentiation and ecological restoration have become research hotspots in the fields of ecology and regional human land relationships zhao et al 2019a tannier et al 2012 wu et al 2020 the hydrological connectivity of a landscape is defined as the function of the landscape to promote or prevent the movement of substances bishop taylor et al 2018 yan and niu 2019 luo et al 2020 and this is a key indicator for protecting biodiversity and maintaining the stability and integrity of ecosystems cui et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b velazquez et al 2017 especially in areas where wetlands are widely developed wetlands have a very large ecological environmental effect serving as corridors filters and barriers wang et al 2020 related research on the hydrological connectivity of wetlands can improve the effectiveness of wetland restoration and has important significance for the analysis of runoff variation and the protection of ecological service functions lee and abdullah 2019 feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a with the gradual deepening of scholars understanding of landscape connectivity different methods have been developed to quantify and integrate connectivity into landscape program strategies and concepts du et al 2019 thorslund et al 2018 liu et al 2019 the least cost path model morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa obstacle impact index multi index evaluation method and other methods are widely used in hydrological connectivity research in the fields of hydrology and ecology ernst 2014 velazquez et al 2019 lesschen et al 2009 the mutual transfer of material energy and information flows between wetlands relies on water as the medium for connectivity and the connection mode between the three ensures good aquatic ecosystem development qi et al 2017 wang et al 2021 singh and sinha 2019 in addition to focusing on the entire landscape scale important hydrological patches as key connectivity nodes are of great significance for protecting or enhancing the hydrological connectivity within a river network ala aho et al 2018 saco et al 2020 qi et al 2017 szabo et al 2012 the gradual intensification of wetland fragmentation leads to patch dispersion which attenuates the functions of water migration and material exchange among plaques yang et al 2019 michalek et al 2021 covino 2017 therefore exploring the changes in the importance of patch functions and their impact on hydrological processes can improve the restoration of wetlands and the rational use of water resources allen et al 2020 wu et al 2021 hiatt and passalacqua 2015 changes in the wetland landscape pattern can significantly change the spatial distribution of moisture affect the runoff generation and convergence mechanism of a basin and then affect the hydrological cycle and water balance nieuwenhuyse et al 2011 bracken and croke 2007 richards and brenner 2004 used a spatial analysis program to analyze the digital terrain of the huron river in america and found that landscape connectivity had a great effect on runoff and that artificial drainage greatly increased runoff by connecting isolated areas on the landscape callow and smettem 2009 believed that the construction of dams led to an average reduction of 39 5 in hydrological connectivity and greatly changed the movement of flow and sediment in recent years the economic and urbanization development of the zoige plateau in china coupled with overgrazing and the drainage of ditches has led to a gradual increase in wetland fragmentation which has greatly affected the hydrological process of the basin and the rational allocation of water resources you et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 the heihe river basin hrb and baihe river basin brb in this region are connected and form a system the special ecological geographical pattern is a natural platform that can be used for comprehensive research on the hydrological connectivity of alpine wetlands through a comparative analysis of the basins this study proposes a research framework including the prediction and analysis of wetland spatial pattern dynamics the quantification of wetland hydrological connectivity and an analysis of its relationship with runoff the heihe and baihe river basins were used as the study area the specific objectives were as follows 1 predict wetland dynamic changes under different scenarios 2 explore wetland hydrological connectivity and patch importance changes under reasonable threshold distances and 3 perform a comparative analysis of the impact of wetland connectivity on the runoff and protection priority of wetland patches 2 study area the hei and bai rivers originate from the zoige plateau in the northeastern corner of the tibetan plateau and their geographic locations are generally between 102 10 103 25 e and 32 10 34 10 n fig 1 the two basins have abundant rainfall with an average annual precipitation amount of 752 mm and 840 mm respectively they are important water resource formation regions in the upper reaches of the yellow river the mainstream of the hei river has a total length of 261 km a drainage area of 7427 km2 and an average annual runoff of 1 01 billion m3 the mainstream of the bai river has a length of 187 km a drainage area of 5488 km2 and flat terrain within the region the confluence of the bai river and the yellow river forms the first bay of nine curves with an average runoff of 1 96 billion m3 zhang et al 2020b both basins have a continental plateau alpine humid climate which is cold and humid with a short spring and autumn a long winter and no summer furthermore seasonal variations are not obvious the catchment of the two rivers comprises approximately 2 3 of the zoige plateau and the main geomorphic types in the region are low hills valley terraces marsh depressions etc the vegetation types are mostly grassland and there are many marsh wetlands e g zoige wetland distributed in the floodplain as an important marsh wetland on the tibetan plateau these wetlands are a large discrete sponge in that they store abundant water resources in recent years due to the drainage effect of artificial ditches and natural channels the integrity of the zoige wetland has been destroyed which has aggravated the shrinkage of the wetland and has had a significant impact on the runoff in the source region of the yellow river 3 data and methods 3 1 data the landsat tm etm oli images path and row 131 036 131 037 131 038 and 130 037 were processed to obtain land

discharge sequence from the dashui and tangke gauge stations located downstream of the two rivers 1981 2016 the data came from the sichuan hydrological bureau and the data series were used to analyze and calculate the runoff indices the precipitation data came from the meteorological stations around the two basins and data were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn 3 2 methods this study constructed a research framework to investigate the effects of hydrological connectivity on runoff the ca markov model and mspa model were used to analyze the spatial dynamic changes in wetlands under different future scenarios based on this two hydrological connectivities iic and pc were calculated and the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff was explored through nonlinear fitting fig 2 3 2 1 ca markov model the ca markov model combines the advantages of time dimension analysis of the markov model and space dimension analysis of the cellular automata ca model it can realize the ability of dynamic and multiscenario simulations of land use and has high accuracy making it an important research method used in nonlinear science khoi and murayama 2010 anand et al 2018 in this paper we used the ecological protection scenario plan1 and the natural development scenario plan2 to predict wetlands the plan1 scenario was designed to assess the phenomena of overgrazing and grassland degradation in the two basins under the plan1 scenario the stable wetland was not degraded the hrb and brb accounted for 64 65 and 51 22 respectively according to the social and economic statistical yearbook and ecological protection policy of aba tibetan and qiang autonomous prefecture the annual grazing intensity was reduced by 5 the transferred amount of wetland in the transfer matrix was allocated proportionally and construction land could not occupy wetlands the plan2 scenario directly used the transition probability matrix from 2000 to 2009 for prediction the wetland area of the hrb and brb decreased significantly from 2000 to 2009 fig s1 to ensure the accuracy of the prediction results this transfer matrix was selected to simulate the land use in 2016 and evaluate the accuracy table s1 except for dw and lakes which had small areas the relative error of the other wetland simulations was within 20 and the kappa coefficient was 0 84 thus the prediction result was relatively satisfactory the prediction period was 2019 2049 in our study and the time interval was 10 years 3 2 2 gravity center migration gravity center migration was used to study the shift trajectory of the relative equilibrium point in the study region wang and zhang 2022 in our study we used the gravity center migration model to analyze the migration of the wetland center of gravity at different times and to draw a map of the spatial gravity center migration of the wetland its quantitative expression is as follows 1 x t i 1 n c ti x i i 1 n c ti 2 y t i 1 n c ti y i i 1 n c ti where x t and y t represent the longitude and latitude of the wetland spatial center of gravity in year t respectively in degrees c ti is the area of wetland patch i in km2 and x i and y i represent the longitude and latitude of patch i s gravity center respectively in degrees 3 2 3 mspa model the mspa model was initially used in the study of forest landscape patterns and then gradually developed into the analysis of spatiotemporal grid changes ecological network connectivity analysis and the construction of ecological network plates ritters et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 this model divides the image into the core islet bridge edge and perforation areas through processes such as corrosion expansion opening and closing vogt et al 2006 among them the core area has a relatively complete ecological system and is a large patch suitable for the communication of organisms and it corresponds to the green area in fig 3 islets have no connection with other foreground pixels and have poor exchange of material between internal species most islets were scattered in non wetlands perforation refers to the transition area between the core area and the internal non green landscape edge refers to the transition area between the core area and peripheral the non green landscape a bridge is a connecting channel between the core areas and a necessary corridor for material migration and energy exchange 3 2 4 hydrological connectivity after the spatial pattern analysis was completed hydrological connectivity including the integral index of connectivity iic and probability of connectivity index pc was calculated using conefor sensinode software saura and torné 2009 saura and pascual hortal 2007 the iic is used to describe the change in overall landscape connectivity with a value range of 0 to 1 and the formula is as follows 3 iic i 1 n j 1 n a i a j 1 n l ij a l 2 where n is the number of patches a i and a j are the areas of patches i and j units of km2 and n l ij is the number of connections in the shortest path for patches i and j a l is the total area of the basin and the unit is km2 the pc represents the maximum connection probability between habitat patches under the influence of the horizontal movement of the landscape it considers the dispersal behavior of the habitat landscape and is an effective way to evaluate the functional connectivity of the landscape the formula is as follows 4 pc i 1 n j 1 n a i a j p ij a l 2 where p ij is the maximum value of the potential diffusion probability of all connected paths between patches i and j notably the connectivity values obtained by choosing different threshold distances were different therefore before calculating the connectivity index it was necessary to filter the optimal distance threshold for the calculation of landscape connectivity through the number of links nl and number of components nc this value is usually determined by how the curves of nl and nc change with the td when the amplitude of change of nl and nc is small the td is optimal qi and fan 2016 nl is the number of connections between habitat nodes in the landscape if the distance between any two patches is less than the set distance threshold a link relationship is considered nc is a whole entity composed of functionally or structurally interconnected patches an isolated node or patch is a component and there are no functional relationships between different components in addition this study calculated the importance of patches the diic and dpc were used mainly for evaluating the contribution of patches to connectivity the larger the index values were the more important the influence of the patch on the hydrological connectivity 5 diic iic iic remove iic 100 6 dpc pc pc remove pc 100 where iic and pc represent the connectivity indices when all patches exist in the wetland and iic remove and pc remove represent the integral index of connectivity and the probability of connectivity index after removing the remaining patches respectively 4 results 4 1 land use prediction and dynamics the distribution of wetlands was significantly different in the hrb and brb according to the plan1 ecological protection prediction results fig 4 a and b the restoration of wetlands in the upper reaches of the hrb was obvious and both sw and dw had development the wetlands in the central and northern parts were more clearly connected the area of wetland in the hrb increased at a growth rate of 160 180 km2 10 years fig 4e the area of mw increased most significantly but the area of sw showed a slight shrinking trend the wetlands expanded outward with the original distribution in the brb the mw upstream and the sw in the middle and lower reaches developed significantly but the dw was still very small the wetland area in the brb increased at a rate of 120 150 km2 10 years under the plan1 scenario fig 4f under the plan2 natural development scenario the wetlands in the two basins showed a significant decreasing trend fig 4c and d the largest wetland patch in the northern part of the hrb showed a fragmentation trend and the wetland in the central area gradually moved away from the mainstream even though the southeast wetland maintained a few mws until 2049 combined with fig 4e the wetland reduction rate of the hrb increased compared with the historical period 97 km2 10 years and both sw and mw decreased significantly wetlands in the upper and lower reaches of the brb decreased significantly with a rate of approximately 60 km2 10 years in general the increases and decreases were the most serious outside the wetlands which eventually led to the wetlands being connected or fragmented the gravity center of the wetland in the hrb migrated to the southeast in the historical period fig 4g which is generally consistent with the migration direction under the plan2 scenario and the migration rate will gradually increase in the future indicating that the degradation of wetlands is dominated by the northern part of the basin under the plan1 scenario the gravity center of the wetland migrated in the opposite direction northwest indicating that the wetland recovery rate was more significant downstream under the plan2 scenario the wetland in the brb will generally develop to the south before 2029 same as in the historical period and then begin to develop to the northeast fig 4h indicating that the degradation of the wetland will initially be concentrated downstream and will then begin to intensify in the southern part of the basin under the plan1 scenario the wetland started to recover and the gravity center of the wetland expanded in the downstream northwest direction during the historical period the wetlands were converted mainly from sw to mw and mw and from dw to sw table 1 although the transfer area from sw to mw was large the net increase in mw was still small mainly due to the transfer of mw to non wetland and sw with values of 283 32 km2 and 104 32 km2 respectively most of the area of dw was converted to sw and the stable area was only 27 69 km2 the final change rates of mw dw sw and lake were 17 67 71 56 24 88 and 11 94 respectively table s2 the transfer within the wetland of the brb was mainly the mutual conversion between sw and mw but mw sw and lake all transitioned to non wetlands to varying degrees the final dw increased slightly while mw sw and lake decreased by 13 76 20 07 and 33 65 respectively under the plan1 scenario the stable part of the wetland in the two basins increased significantly and the internal conversion of the wetland decreased significantly mainly due to the conversion of non wetland to mw and sw the non wetland in the hrb and brb decreased by 10 51 and 9 42 respectively under the plan2 scenario large areas of wetlands were transferred to non wetlands the net reduction in mw and sw in the hrb reached 133 34 km2 and 135 16 km2 respectively and the net reduction in mw and sw in the brb reached 92 73 km2 and 93 36 km2 respectively 4 2 landscape dynamics based on the mspa model the wetland patches were divided into five landscape patterns core edge perforation bridge and islet during the historical period the wetlands in the hrb were significantly degraded which was represented by the gradual disappearance of some isolated islets and the gradual separation of larger cores into multiple small cores which were interconnected through bridges fig 5 in addition the internal perforations continued to expand so the area of the core decreased the edges of the wetland core in the brb were gradually dispersed and part of the interior was transformed into non wetland under the plan1 scenario new cores were formed on the edge of the wetland the wetland gradually became fuller and connected to form whole patches and the area of perforation in some regions increased in the natural development scenario the wetland area gradually declined the distances between the patches became longer and they were divided into different cores the islets were scattered and gradually increased according to the area statistics fig 6 the area of the core was the largest and showed a decreasing trend in both basins edges showed an increasing and decreasing trend in the hrb and brb respectively and the edge area was second only to core area the areas of islet perforation and bridge fluctuated between 10 and 25 km2 in the historical period during the forecast period the change laws of various landscape types tended to be consistent under the plan1 scenario islets were gradually annexed by the core and the islet area decreased the perforation area increased indicating that despite the expansion of the core internal perforation may block the hydrological connectivity of patches to a certain extent the restoration of wetlands improves the area and perimeter of the core except for the bridge area the change trend of plan2 was opposite to that of plan1 comparing the two basins the variation range of wetland core areas in the hrb was 1400 2600 km2 while it was only 500 1300 km2 in the brb 4 3 hydrological connectivity and importance of patches 4 3 1 hydrological connectivity taking the hrb as an example fig 7 a the nc rapidly decreased within the td of 0 1000 m while the nl increased at a relatively fast rate in this range the improvement of connectivity can promote the stability of the ecosystem obviously the td was not suitable when the td was 1000 2000 m the curvature of nc and nl slowed indicating that the hydrological connectivity was relatively stable in this interval it was less affected by the change in the td which was conducive to the analysis of landscape connectivity when the td was 2000 6000 m the nl and nc began to increase at a rapid rate and the landscape stability was still poor which was not suitable for landscape pattern and process analysis when the td was greater than 6000 m the nc gradually decreased to 1 and all ecological patches belonged to the same component all habitat patches in the basin could be regarded as interconnected but this scenario was obviously unreasonable given the actual habitat conditions finally 1200 m and 1800 m were determined as the tds for the study of the hydrological connectivity in the two basins the wetland in the brb was more fragmented and thus the td was larger than that of the hrb which was reasonable the change trend of wetland hydrological connectivity with certain tds is shown in fig 7c and d from 1990 to 2016 both the iic and the pc in the hrb showed a downward trend but the rate of change gradually decreased the ranges of the two index changes were 0 004 0 011 and 0 008 0 017 respectively under the plan1 scenario the pc continued to increase at a change rate of 0 0016 10 years while the iic had a slight downward trend from 2029 to 2039 by 2049 the pc and iic will reach 0 0146 and 0 008 respectively but they will not quite recover to the levels of the historical period under the plan2 scenario the two hydrological connectivities will decline and the values of pc and iic will be only 0 004 and 0 002 in 2049 the connectivity of the brb was much less than that of the hrb however under the plan1 scenario the hydrological connectivity was restored and exceeded the level of the historical period and the pc and iic reached 0 0007 and 0 0005 respectively under the plan2 scenario both connectivity indices declined at a relatively gradual rate which means that the hydrological connectivity of fragmented wetlands is sensitive to restoration policies 4 3 2 importance of patches taking the top 10 patches in 1990 by area the dpc and the diic as an example 12 in the hrb 14 in the brb the importance of patches was studied fig 8 the area of p1 in the hrb was much larger than that in the other patches and the importance for hydrological connectivity was also ranked 1st with dpc and diic values of 55 51 and 58 26 respectively the area of p2 was only 54 of p1 but the dpc still reached 51 00 the p3 to p10 areas had a small difference but the p3 to p6 areas were most important indicating the second stage of importance the remaining patches were of little importance and the value ranges of dpc and diic were roughly maintained between 3 50 7 69 and 2 34 5 51 the difference between the areas of p1 and p2 in the brb was small but p2 ranked first regarding the importance of patches with dpc and diic values of 33 42 and 30 43 respectively p4 p7 and p8 mainly located in the upper reaches of the brb were not included in the top 10 dpcs and diics instead p11 p14 which were located in the lower reaches of the basin played a more important role in hydrological connectivity 4 3 3 change in the importance of patches from 1990 to 2016 the importance of patches in the hrb was almost completely reduced fig 9 among them the importance of major patches in the middle and lower reaches of the basin decreased from 15 21 to 20 86 and the importance of small patches that split due to the fragmentation process decreased more significantly 53 79 57 77 the importance of wetland patches in the brb changed very little except for the significant increase in wetland patches linked to the hrb 11 54 and the sharp decrease downstream due to the complete patches being broken apart 9 53 the change in the importance of the remaining patches remained between 2 00 and 2 00 the spatial variation in dpc was consistent with that in diic in the two basins the changes in diic and dpc under the plan1 scenario in the future were opposite to those in the historical period except for a few patches that decreased significantly the importance of other patches all increased to a certain extent and the increase was most significant in the middle of the hrb δdiic 11 32 δdpc 7 12 under the plan2 scenario the importance of almost all patches showed a decreasing trend especially for the large patches in the north and center of the hrb and the reduction ranges of diic and dpc reached 30 87 42 23 however some small patches still showed an increasing trend in the middle reaches of the hrb even reaching 40 15 which may have been due to the difference in the spatial distribution of wetlands or the effect of internal perforation comparing the change in wetland types 1990 2016 within the key patches and the importance of patches fig 10 the changes in the diic dpc of patches in the hrb were generally consistent with the dynamics of wetlands within the patches most patches were dominated by the dynamic changes in sw which affected the importance of the patches the diic dpc of different patches in the brb fluctuated greatly and the importance of the largest patch p1 increased however the wetland area of this patch was greatly reduced the dynamic change in dw was relatively small its change was mainly in the center of the wetland and the effect of its change on hydrological connectivity was not obvious sw and mw had large areas and were distributed mostly in the periphery of the core areas of wetlands the wetland fragmentation process mostly started around the edges therefore these two types of wetlands had a relatively severe impact on the importance of patches 4 4 the effect of hydrological connectivity on runoff 4 4 1 the relationship between runoff and hydrological connectivity we compared the optimum fitting of the runoff depth cv the maximum runoff coefficient maxrc the minimum runoff coefficient minrc and the minimum runoff depth minrd with the iic pc to explore the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff fig 11 the increase in connectivity in the hrb promoted runoff but runoff gradually decreased after the connectivity reached 0 009 while the relationship was the opposite in the brb the optimal curve types for cv and connectivity were represented by the logarithmic function and quadratic function in the hrb and brb respectively the increase in hydrological connectivity gradually led to the homogenization of the annual distribution of runoff in the hrb while the increase in hydrological connectivity in the brb made the coefficient of variation in runoff first decrease and then increase for the relationship between maxrc and iic pc there was a diametrically opposite trend in the two basins the maxrc of the hrb decreased with increasing hydrological connectivity which means that the water storage of wetlands slowed infiltration and the efficiency of rainfall runoff generation was suppressed due to the small area of wetland in the brb precipitation easily meets the water storage capacity of the wetland and the internal water content of the wetland better supplements the production and flow outside of precipitation connectivity has the same effect on the minrc the increase in connectivity allows less precipitation to supplement the amount of water contained in the wetland but fails to form runoff the minrd of the hrb decreased with increasing connectivity and in the brb although there was also a decreasing trend the continued increase in hydrological connectivity led to an increase in baseflow 4 4 2 the effect of patches on runoff we analyzed the relationship between key patches and runoff depth fig s2 in the first stage p10 p12 the diic dpc was relatively small and the volatility was also small runoff changed but the importance of patches did not change in the second stage the importance of patches p3 p9 began to fluctuate and the fluctuation range of the same runoff changes was smaller than that of the third stage the points showed the characteristics of a convex curve and there was a large fault between the two stages the impact of dpc on runoff was different and the fluctuation range of the second level p3 p9 expanded there were generally two levels in the brb the first level contained most of the patches p3 p14 and the total magnitude of the fluctuations in the importance of these patches was the same as that of the second level p1 p2 to a certain extent this result reflects that the runoff changes in the brb are more susceptible to the influence of p1 and p2 at the patch scale 5 discussion 5 1 reasons for the change in hydrological connectivity climate warming is the most important natural cause that affects the landscape and ecological functions of the zoige wetland zhen et al 2017 in recent years the zoige wetland has shown a trend of drought luo et al 2019 the increase in temperature has caused a large amount of water loss in the wetland feng et al 2015 the wetlands have become fragmented and smaller and the hydrological connectivity has been reduced irregular floods or rainstorms are also important forces affecting the hydrological connectivity of wetlands mosquera et al 2015 bao et al 2021 in rainy weather the wetland is connected to the surrounding rivers and lakes and the wetland recovers or expands in our study we researched the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff but the two effects were mutual when the surface runoff decreased upstream the highlands gradually became exposed and dried up in the lower reaches of the basin gradually forming isolated bare land desertification and reducing connectivity the number of lakes in the zoige plateau decreased from 36 to 18 after drying up the bare lake bottom was gradually desertified by wind erosion wei et al 2020 the mainstream and tributaries of the upper reaches of the hei river have a large undercut depth and the source erosion rate is significant the river channel was continuously cut through and the bank collapsed resulting in the fragmentation and loosening of tightly structured peat wetlands zhao et al 2019c fang 2023 with population growth and economic development in the study area the human demand for local natural resources has increased and the phenomenon of large scale canal digging for water extraction is very serious currently more than 700 drainage ditches have been excavated in zoige county and hongyuan county with a total length of more than 1 000 km cui et al 2020 the ditches are intertwined vertically and horizontally leading to direct changes in the hydrological connectivity of marsh wetlands tian et al 2011 under the stress of drainage and increased ditches the wetland water yield has been severely reduced and a large amount of surface water has been drained peat swamps are dehydrated causing erosion collapse cracks and patching the original integrity of patches has been destroyed and the connectivity has weakened pang et al 2010 ma et al 2016 in addition overgrazing has aggravated the degradation process of marsh wetlands turning marshes into meadow wetlands meadows and even areas with signs of desertification thus overgrazing has seriously affected the hydrological connectivity of the wetlands shen et al 2019b 5 2 the impact of connectivity on runoff as a key node for water storage and connection in the basin water system wetlands can effectively regulate river runoff to reduce flood disasters and ensure water use in dry seasons and hydrological connectivity plays a key role yeo et al 2019 baustian et al 2019 changes in hydrological connectivity can have a significant impact on river hydrological dynamics including seasonal hydrological changes the relationship between water discharge and replenishment river flow velocity flow and even water age water change cycle hwang et al 2012 our research shows that changes in hydrological connectivity caused by changes in wetland patterns have a strong correlation with changes in runoff parameters with the increase in connectivity of the hrb the drainage function of wetlands begins to increase achieving the role of replenishing runoff however with a further increase in connectivity runoff can be better transported horizontal between wetlands moreover the increase in wetland area makes the water storage capacity more obvious and causes a decrease in runoff li et al 2021 there were different effects in the brb and fragmented wetlands promoted an increase in production and flow during the restoration process wetland development has played a buffer role in the hrb meng et al 2020 which homogenizes the distribution of runoff during the year the efficiency of rainfall runoff generation maxrc and baseflow are also reduced however the brb where the wetland is fragmented had the opposite conclusion the brb receives more precipitation than the hrb but the wetland range is much smaller when hydrological connectivity increases runoff generation efficiency is significantly improved kright et al 2018 higgisson et al 2020 5 3 priority of wetland patch protection in both basins sw was the most extensive wetland type and it surrounded dw and lakes and was connected to the surrounding mws combined with the wetland changes under different scenarios the dynamics of sw were the most dramatic while the changes in dw were relatively small from the perspective of patches p1 and p2 located in the middle reaches of the hrb had large areas diic and dpc with the process of natural succession they gradually became fragmented their importance decreased and their effect on runoff was obvious there are also many important nature reserves such as hua lake that are rich in biodiversity and sensitive to the impact of climate change and human activities sun et al 2016 combined with the results of wetland area and hydrological connectivity changes in different scenarios ecological protection plays an important role in the restoration of these patches so it is crucial to strengthen the ecological protection of the areas where these patches are located in the past 30 years this result is similar to the result of wetland degradation risk and vulnerability assessment of the zoige wetland by jiang et al 2017 the distribution of ditches was mainly concentrated in patches p4 p7 the area of these patches was approximately 1 2 105 km2 the current patches were of moderate importance and their importance increased most significantly under the plan1 scenario these patches should also receive more attention in the future jozwiakowski 2009 the patches of wetlands in the brb that require key protection are mainly concentrated in the lower reaches these patches are highly hydrologically connected and will change significantly under different scenarios these changes are of great significance to the downstream ecological environment the relationship between connectivity and runoff shows that future planning for the zoige wetland needs to be carried out from the perspectives of protection and development the restoration of wetlands can provide corresponding ecological service functions but the excessive development of wetlands will also lead to a decrease in runoff which may adversely affect the social economy and human survival cui et al 2012 therefore finding a balance between development and protection is necessary for the development of the zoige wetland zhou et al 2020 5 4 framework assessment and uncertainty based on graph theory network analysis landscape connectivity indices were combined with different runoff indices to study the influence and difference of hydrological connectivity on runoff from the perspective of watershed comparison and multiscenario analysis based on previous research results gomi et al 2010 found that the land use landscape pattern significantly affected the surface flow contribution of storm runoff in rivers based on the isotope tracer method yeo et al 2019 argued that wetlands have a strong seasonal relationship with downstream runoff and play a certain role in buffering floods in general the research results were similar to those in the hrb and brb but the effects of different wetland landscape patterns on runoff were still different this research framework analyzes the impact of wetlands on runoff from the perspective of watershed comparison and multi scene analysis providing a certain reference for future wetland protection and sustainable development our study considered the watershed as the research object and divided some wetlands such as p1 in the hrb and p2 in the brb this approach affected the integrity of the wetland to a certain extent and led to a certain deviation in the calculation of wetland connectivity and the importance of patches the wetland prediction was based on the land use transfer matrix in the historical period although it has been verified this approach still has some uncertainty except for some variables added in the process of predicting land use other factors such as climate and human activities were not considered in the research therefore this research requires more adjustments in data and technical means the limitations of this part of the study have not yet been resolved in addition when studying the effect of patches on runoff changes the impact of climate and human factors on runoff was not considered 6 conclusion this study proposed an analysis framework to explore the impact of hydrological connectivity on runoff based on the dynamic prediction of wetland spatial patterns quantification of wetland hydrological connectivity and nonlinear fitting taking the hrb and brb as the study areas the differences in the impacts of wetland hydrological connectivity on runoff were studied through a basin comparison which provides a reference for wetland protection and future management 1 under the plan1 scenario the future expansion of the wetland will be mainly based on the increase in mw and the wetland will generally migrate to the northwest in both basins the areas of the cores and edges will expand but the areas of the perforations and bridges will decline slightly under the plan2 scenario the decline of the wetland is the most significant in sw except for bridge area and the change trend is opposite to that in plan1 2 the best thresholds for studying the hydrological connectivity of the wetlands in the hrb and brb were 1200 m and 1800 m respectively the iic and pc of the two basins gradually decreased during the historical period and showed increasing and decreasing trends under plan1 and plan2 respectively the hydrological connectivity of the hrb wetland was greater than that of the brb 3 4 times 3 the importance of patches also showed the same changes under the two scenarios patches in the middle and lower reaches of the basin played the most critical role in hydrological connectivity and had significant effects on runoff changes they are the key wetland patches to be protected in the future 4 the relationship between connectivity and runoff was different in the two watersheds the connectivity of the hrb had an inhibitory effect on runoff and the runoff generation efficiency of precipitation however the increase in connectivity in the brb promoted an increase in runoff credit authorship contribution statement lei wu writing

2147,the formation and utilization of non rainfall water can modulate isotope variation characteristics of the atmosphere plants and soil water reservoirs this is especially significant for water resource management in arid desert areas where non rainfall is an important supplemental water source in this study we analyzed the isotope variation and interaction characteristics of rainfall non rainfall atmospheric water vapor xylem water leaf water and shallow soil water during non rainfall events over two years in a revegetation desert area in northwest china the results indicated that air temperature was the most important meteorological factor influencing isotope characteristics of rainfall non rainfall and atmospheric water vapor the isotope composition was also affected by rainfall and non rainfall amounts which decreased with event quantity back trajectory analysis showed that the variation of rainfall d values were induced by different moisture sources from arid gobi and local evapotranspiration the non rainfall water line is close to local meteoric water line with both having similar origins non rainfall was mainly formed by radiative cooling of evaporated water produced shortly after rain and participated in the local water recycling the atmospheric plant and soil water all had high d values which indicated that evaporated water was a significant water source of different water reservoirs in this area the leaf water of artemisia ordosica was largely replenished by non rainfall water compared to xylem water during non rainfall events so foliar water uptake was an important survival mechanism for artemisia ordosica to adapt to drought environment during non rainfall formation non rainfall water contributed to 8 16 of the xylem water and the less rainfall the higher the contribution rate our results are especially meaningful for arid desert regions where global climate change increases the importance of non rainfall water keywords isotope non rainfall

climate zones has important implications for gas exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems kim and lee 2011 kaseke et al 2017 which can reach and even exceed annual rainfall and serve as a sustainable and stable water source to maintain plant biological soil crust small animal and microbiology survival in arid and semiarid environments kidron et al 2011 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 especially during periods of drought it can be directly absorbed by plant roots from soil and can reduce the evaporation loss of soil moisture which helps mediate water status in water stressed plants and the relationship between soil and plants aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 wang et al 2019 furthermore many types of organisms from trees to cryptogam goldsmith et al 2013 pan et al 2016 have developed diverse and creative evolutionary adaptations to utilize non rainfall water goldsmith et al 2013 from water trapping trichomes kim et al 2018 to enlisting the help of fungal hyphae burgess and dawson 2004 the drylands which comprise 40 of the global terrestrial ecosystem will experience reduced rainfall under future global change increasing the role of non rainfall water in these areas kaseke et al 2017 tian et al 2021 non rainfall is the link between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere the relationship study between non rainfall and different water reservoirs is an important supplement of the hydrological process of ecosystem the stable isotope composition characteristics of water are natural and traditional hydrological tracers which reflect features of physical phase change zhang et al 2010 thus they work in tracing different hydrometeorological processes associated with different types of waters e g rainfall snowfall dew fog surface water plant water and ice core dansgaard 1964 jouzel and merlivat 1984 wang et al 2010 putman and bowen 2019 lanning et al 2020 non rainfall formation has the potential to modulate the spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic contents of atmospheric water vapor oxygen and carbon dioxide wen et al 2012 the variation of precipitation non rainfall and atmosphere water vapor isotopes mirrors complex atmospheric behavior the isotopic content of non rainfall water is controlled by atmospheric humidity the vapor isotope content in the air and the equilibrium and kinetic fractionations wen et al 2012 although stable isotopes have been applied widely to fog research fischer and still 2007 the application to other non rainfall water research is minimal kaseke et al 2017 the published studies on the non rainfall phenomenon are mostly devoted to quantifying intensity and duration richards 2004 agama and berlinera 2006 pan et al 2010 2018 yet several studies have been carried out on the isotopic compositions of non rainfall water and their relationships to other ecosystem water pools and fluxes wen et al 2012 for example bariac et al 1989 and welp et al 2008 examined the interaction between the isotopic compositions of dew water atmospheric water vapor and leaf water for a small number of dew events and found that the isotopic composition of water vapor above a soybean canopy was depleted during dew formation and enriched during evaporation in the morning kim and lee 2011 used a laboratory dark plant chamber to investigate the dew effect on leaf water isotopic compositions still little is known about the detailed relationship and isotope variation characteristics of non rainfall and other water reservoirs liu et al 2007 water is the most important limit factor for plants in arid area understanding identifying vegetation water use of both rainfall and non rainfall components is essential for developing sound ecological models of arid environments schröder et al 2009 and key to understanding plant function under current or future climates feddes et al 2001 as a water source non rainfall can be directly absorbed through leaves which can then alter leaf level energy balance reduce transpiration rate and improve photosynthesis limm et al 2009 rao et al 2009 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 a laboratory study showed that stomata stayed open in the presence of non rainfall and that non rainfall served as an intermediary that facilitated the exchange of the h2 18o and hdo molecules between leaf water and atmospheric vapor kim and lee 2011 by using stable isotopes soderberg 2010 confirmed that fog contributed to 5 20 of the xylem water of main plants in namib desert and these plants directly absorbed fog water through their stems or leaves however several questions that remain to be answered are to what extent non rainfall can meet the water requirements of desert plants and how plants absorb and allocate non rainfall water in arid desert areas like many dryland ecosystems worldwide the tennger desert relies on non rainfall as an important supplemental water source liu et al 2006 pan et al 2010 2018 non rainfall water may originate from the condensation of atmospheric water transpiration of plant leaves and evaporation of soil water quantifying the contribution of these water fluxes by isotope technology is important for ecosystem water cycle given the large abundance and importance of non rainfall in tennger desert this area provides an ideal location to study the relationship between different water reservoirs during non rainfall events however due to the difficulty of continuously measuring and collecting non rainfall for long time in field experiments so far the isotope composition of non rainfall and their relationship to other water fluxes have not been known in this area non rainfall formed mainly on the ground surface and it was evaporated completely after sunrise pan et al 2018 we know very little about the ecological effect of non rainfall to desert shrubs and their absorption and utilization strategies in arid environments through field experiments over two years the study took artemisia ordosica as target plant the goals are to 1 determine the effect of meteorological factors and event size on isotope characteristics of different water sources 2 reveal the isotopic interactions between non rainfall water and ecosystem water pools and fluxes and 3 verify the absorption and utilization mode of non rainfall by desert shrub and assess their contribution quantity to achieve these goals we measured the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of rain non rainfall vapor water soil water leaf and xylem water during non rainfall events by isotope variation characteristics this research provides a better understanding of the correlation for different water pools in arid desert climates determines the ecological contribution of non rainfall to desert shrubs these findings will also assist in predicting dryland responses to global climate change by providing information about non rainfall water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is a revegetated desert ecosystem 37 27 n 104 57 e 1339 m a s l at the shapotou desert experimental research station sders which borders the tengger desert in ningxia northwestern china fig 1 this area is located within a transitional zone between desert steppe and steppified desert and a transitional belt between desert and oasis the mean annual

which is concentrated in september and octorber pan et al 2010 2018 the natural landscape is characterized by reticulated chains of barchan dunes with a vegetation cover of 1 and the predominant native plants are hedysarum scoparium agriophyllum squarrosum and psammochloa cillosa biological soil crusts bscs were nearly non existent in this area before revegetation efforts began 62 years before this study pan et al 2018 in order to fix moving sand dunes a non irrigated sand binding vegetation protective system was established by planting xerophytic shrubs within a matrix of straw checkerboards first straw checkerboards spacing 1 1 m2 were established by inserting straw vertically into soil to a depth of 15 20 cm to increase surface roughness and reduce wind erosion xerophytic shrub seedlings mainly artemisia ordosica caragana korshinskii and hedysarum scoparium were planted within the straw checkerboard with 160 individuals per 100 m2 in 1956 the afforested area was further extended in 1964 1981 and each following year with the same approaches along the east west baotou lanzhou railway li et al 2007 a desert shrub ecosystem with a dwarf shrub and biological soil crust cover formed on the stabilized sand dunes over the course of this project after 60 years of evolution artemisia ordosica and caragana korshinskii are the main artificial sand fixing shrubs in this area for this study an isotope sample collection experiment was carried out in the soil water balance experimental field of sders a 30 year revegetated desert ecosystem 2 2 samples collection rainfall non rainfall water vapor water leaf xylem and soil samples were collected during september and october in 2018 and 2019 event based rainfall and non rainfall samples were collected twenty seven rain events occurred during the study period fifteen non rainfall events a high enough amount for isotope analysis were sampled by specially designed collectors fig 1 the fine nylon screen 1 m2 was hung at four different directions with a horizontal collection tank inclined slightly for every screen a tube perpendicular to each collection tank was connected to a 0 5 l collection bottle at every direction the unit area non rainfall amount was measured and calculated to reduce evaporation effects on isotopes all dew samples were sealed in glass vials 15 ml before dawn when condensation was still occurring all of the rainfall samples were collected immediately after each event or at the earliest possible time in the morning if the rainfall event was finished after midnight other samples were taken during non rainfall collection vapor water was collected using a 1 l aluminum foil gas sampling bag above the canopy average height 0 75 m soil cores were collected at depths of 0 20 cm 20 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm near the artemisia ordosica plants the xylem was cut from the upper middle and lower parts of the plants and the epidermis was gently removed using tweezers the veins of collected leaves at top canopy were removed all samples were collected in three duplicates vapor samples were stored at room temperature rainfall non rainfall were refrigerated soil xylem and leaf samples were frozen until water was extracted by a vacuum distillation method 2 3 isotopic analysis water in the xylem leaf and soil samples was extracted using a fully automatic vacuum condensation extraction system li 2100 lica united technology limited beijing china the extraction rate of water from samples was 98 the isotopic compositions δ18o and δd of all water pools were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the values were reported in standard δ notation representing deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water standard v smow expressed as δ sample r sample r v s m o w r v s m o w 1000 where r sample and r v s m o w are the isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o in samples and the v smow respectively the precisions sd of δd and δ18o were 1 and 0 2 respectively the analyses of each sample were repeated five times and the mean and standard deviation were calculated deuterium excess d in abbreviation value was calculated as dansgaard 1964 d δd 8 δ18o the abnormal values such as the xylem water data at september 26th 2019 which may be caused due to the high temperature of temperature controller during water extraction process were discarded for analysis 2 4 meteorological factor measurement and calculation the presence of free water on each leaf surface leaf wetness was estimated using a dielectric leaf wetness sensor campbell 237 usa rainfall was measured by a siphon rain gauge with an observational error of 0 2 mm for rainfall 10 mm and 0 02 mm for rainfall 10 mm from the automatic weather station milos 520 vaisala finland in sders the air temperature and relative humidity rh at canopy edges were measured using the auto weather station ws std1 britain within the measurement field based on long term meteorological observations the dew point temperature was calculated using the penman monteith equation with the following function t dew 116 91 237 3 l n e a 16 78 l n e a e

and t a is air temperature c meanwhile the temperature differences t a t dew was calculated as the difference between the air temperature t a and dew point temperature t dew to represent the difficult degrees of dew formation 2 5 backward trajectories for precipitation sources the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit was used to diagnose the backward track of the air parcels in the sampled rain events draxler et al 1999 stein et al 2015 the model is available from the noaa air resources laboratory at http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php this model has previously been used together with water isotope measurements to analyze moisture sources and isotopic signatures of precipitation producing air masses with considerable success lee et al 2003 bershaw et al 2012 the sample based and historical meteorological data were inputted into the trajectory model by uploading them through the data portal provided in the hysplit interface the data resolution was 2 5 2 5 and backward trajectories of 24 h were performed for each rain event 2 6 data analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using origin 8 0 originlab northampton usa and spss 13 0 spss 13 0 inc chicago usa software packages the local meteoric water line lmwl see craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 and the δd δ18o relationship of other waters were obtained by linear regression analyses the relative contribution rate of non rainfall and soil water to plants were calculated using the packages mixsiar and jags in the r4 2 1 platform r development core team 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics of non rainfall formation based on the leaf wetness sensor non rainfall water formation frequencies accounted for 55 and 40 of the measured periods in 2018 and 2019 respectively for comparison the total annual rainfall was 228 and 190 mm respectively the measured non rainfall amounts of two months accounted for 12 and 9 of annual precipitation during the two experimental years we presented the nocturnal air temperature dew point temperature and rh during non rainfall collection in september and october when the amount of dew formation was large enough for isotope analysis fig 2 the average air temperature was 10 7 c range from 6 18 c to 19 98 c and the dew point temperature was 9 48 c 6 17 c to 15 16 c generally the air temperature was close to or slightly above the dew point temperature during non rainfall collection the average rh was 93 38 with a range of 75 79 to 100 3 2 influence of meteorological parameters and event sizes on isotope composition of input water sources correlation analyses were carried out to identify relationships between isotopic compositions of water sources and various local meteorological factors air temperature ta precipitation and non rainfall amounts amounts rh vapour pressure deficit or vpd based on event based databases of precipitation non rainfall and atmospheric vapor table 1 a positive correlation was identified between ta and δ18o for precipitation non rainfall and vapor water p 0 01 the negative correlation was significant between ta and d for precipitation and atmospheric vapor p 0 01 while the influence of ta on d values was not significant for non rainfall p 0 05 the heavy rain was usually depleted in stable isotopes whereas the light rain was usually enriched the correlation coefficient between the δ18o and precipitation amounts was 0 553 exceeding 0 01 correlated confidence limits using a t test the amount effect on δ18o was not significant for non rainfall p 0 05 there wasn t significant amount effect on d values for precipitation and non rainfall p 0 05 δ18o and rh were weakly negatively correlated while d was weakly positively correlated with rh for precipitation p 0 05 for precipitation the δ18o was weakly positive correlated with vpd and a weak negative correlation occurred between d and vpd p 0 05 table i in order to confirm if the amounts effect was determined by event sizes we summarized the influence of event sizes on isotopic composition of water sources table 2 with decreasing event sizes δ18o and δd showed an increasing trend d values increased at first and then decreased meanwhile changes in the slope and intercept of the linear correlations between δd and δ18o across the entire sample period decreased slightly as the size class decreased this occurred in all classes except for smallest size class 0 0 5 mm the largest event size 5mm collectively displayed the highest slope and intercept for the linear regression between δd and δ18o and lowest d value 3 3 isotopic variation characteristics of ecosystem water pools during non rainfall despite sampling over a relatively short time frame rain isotope values varied tremendously δd ranged from 90 21 to 35 42 and δ18o from 16 24 to 8 54 the large variation reflected the particular rainfall event with large rain amounts associated with the depleted isotope values during our experiment period such as on september 1st 2018 and october 15th 2019 fig 3 a the d values of rainfall ranged from 10 54 to 42 24 with an average value of 31 06 the mean values were significantly lower in september 28 than october 36 26 p 0 01 fig 3b the δd and δ18o variations of non rainfall water showed similar trends and larger variation ranging from 92 18 to 30 12 for δd and 16 84 to 6 29 for δ18o the temporal variation characteristics of isotopic compositions for non rainfall water were synchronous with leaf water and atmospheric water vapor fig 4 a and b correlation analysis indicated that the isotope values of non rainfall water and leaf water were significantly correlated r2 0 87 p 0 01 for δd and r2 0 98 p 0 01 for δ18o the isotope values of non rainfall water and atmospheric water vapor were also significantly correlated r2 0 58 p 0 05 for δd and r2 0 99 p 0 01 for δ18o the correlations between the non rainfall water δd and δ18o with those of the xylem water and soil water were not significant p 0 05 the d values of non rainfall water ranged from 6 62 to 46 99 which were consistent with precipitation although the d values of atmospheric water vapor was not significantly different from that of precipitation p 0 05 the amplitude ranged from 16 67 to 80 00 a much wider range than rainfall the d values of leaf water were higher than non rainfall water the xylem water and soil moisture had lower d values compared to precipitation and non rainfall generally both the rain and non rainfall water in the desert area had high d values 31 06 and 31 85 respectively which were more than three times the values at iaea wmo stations in china 5 3 to 23 6 with an average of 10 17 iaea 2004 the high d values also occurred in vapor water 32 89 leaf water 48 25 xylem water 17 89 and soil water 14 72 fig 4c the δd δ18o relationship of precipitation local meteoric water line lmwl was well fitted as δd 5 73δ18o 2 4 r2 0 86 p 0 01 which deviated from the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 for non rainfall water the relationship between δd and δ18o was fitted as δd 5 13δ18o 0 68 r2 0 75 p 0 01 with an intercept even smaller than that of lmwl the atmospheric water vapor xylem water and soil moisture had a δd δ18o line with a lower slope compared to lmwl leaf water had highest d values which were closer to non rainfall water precipitation non rainfall and vapour water had very similar d values the d values of xylem water were relatively lower and near to the soil water fig 5 3 4 contribution of non rainfall water to xerophyte the leaf water of artemisia ordosica during a non rainfall event may be a mixture of non rainfall water xylem water and the initial water left in the leaf from the previous day fig 6 showed the linear dependence of the isotope values for leaf water δl on xylem water δx and non rainfall water δnrw the mean δd values of leaf water non rainfall water and xylem water were 70 36 58 88 and 21 07 respectively the corresponding δ18o values were 14 83 11 34 and 4 87 the δl was closer to and better correlated with δnrw r2 0 75 and 0 98 for δd and δ18o respectively p 0 01 than δx indicating that non rainfall water was a more importance water source for the leaves than the xylem water during the non rainfall events table 3 showed the contribution proportion of non rainfall and soil moisture at different depths to artemisia ordosica plants during non rainfall events although surface 100 cm soil layer was the main water contribution layer for artemisia ordosica plants the relative contribution of non rainfall was near 12 during measurement period furthermore the contribution rate of non rainfall was higher during periods of scarce rainfall the non rainfall contributed as much as 16 for artemisia ordosica plants at october 2018 when the precipitation was only 3 mm 4 discussion 4 1 meteorological factors affect the isotope variation of input water sources the input water sources are important link to the water cycle in ecosystem their isotope variation characteristics mirror complex atmospheric behavior the formation of precipitation non rainfall and atmosphere vapor water is controlled by some meteorological factors like circulation pattern and vapor condition accordingly their isotope values are also influenced by meteorological factors some studies from subtropical regions in china showed negative correlations between precipitation δ18o and air temperature zhang et al 2007 liu et al 2008 peng et al 2010 xie et al 2011 wu et al 2015 there are few related researches in arid desert area in china different from the subtropical regions the positive correlation was identified between air temperature and δ18o of precipitation non rainfall and vapor water in our study their d values were all negatively correlated to air temperature table 1 this result was consistent with research of dansgaard 1964 which found a significant positive relationship between isotopic values of precipitation and air temperature and this temperature effect was mainly in high and mid high latitude regions furthermore the isotope concentrations of non rainfall and atmosphere vapor also linked to temperature effect the temperature during phase change controls the fractionation rate of stable isotopes in input water sources and influences the regional atmospheric circulation so the stable isotope compositions in different water sources can be quantitatively recovered as temperature proxy in this area our results also found that lighter isotopic values are closely linked with large rainfall fig 3 a negative relationship existed between δ18o and precipitation amount table 1 that was to say the δ18o in precipitation and the precipitation water in atmosphere were governed by similar geographical and meteorological parameters so they changed together under the same circulation the precipitation amount effect significantly negative relationship between isotopic compositions and precipitation amount mainly in tropical and low latitude regions lee et al 2003 baldini et al 2010 was also significant in experimental arid desert area similar to precipitation amount rh was negatively correlated to δ18o and positively correlated to d values of precipitation table 1 rh is of the important impact on evaporation enrichment of stable isotopes in precipitation which dominates the raindrop evaporation lower rh will induce greater raindrop evaporation on precipitation research relating the isotopic compositions of precipitation and meteorological factors in southwest china had also identified atmospheric humidity as an important factor affecting the enrichment of heavy stable isotopes δ18o and δd in precipitation zhang et al 2007 vpd indicates evaporation between water drop and atmosphere as the greater vpd the atmosphere is drier the stronger evaporation of raindrop induced enriched stable isotope compositions in precipitation so vpd had marked positive correlations with the δ18o in precipitation meanwhile a weak negative correlation existed between d values and vpd table 1 so evaporative conditions were important in influencing isotope composition during the descent process at the experimental site generally meteorological factors affected the isotope variation of input water sources by influencing regional evaporation conditions the amount effect of rainfall and non rainfall was influenced by event quantity isotope concentration δd and δ18o values decreased with event quantity table 1 these results are consistent with peng et al 2007 who showed that the category and amount ranges of snow and rainwater samples affected the isotopic compositions of samples meanwhile changes in the slope and intercept from linear correlations between δd and δ18o over the entire sample period decreased slightly as the size class decreased except for smallest size class 0 0 5 mm table 2 datta et al 1991 identified statistical correlations between low precipitation quantity and low slope and intercept in a 23 year record of monthly isotopic compositions for new delhi india peng et al 2007 also showed that heavy rainfall events produced regression equations between δd and δ18o with higher slopes and intercepts than smaller rainfall events these patterns were suggested to result from evaporation and subsequent isotopic enrichment wu et al 2015 because the air column becomes gradually saturated during heavy long lasting rainfall events evaporation will stop causing inferred weak isotopic fractionation effects thus rainwater does not become enriched with heavy isotopes during such rainfall events the lowest slope and intercept were observed for the 0 5 1 mm event size which indicated that the water had experienced larger secondary evaporation effects during their descent for the events of 0 5 mm which mostly consisted of non rainfall the meteorological conditions higher rh and lower air temperature during their formation influenced the amount effect like the research at manaus brazil the δ18o in surface dew displayed a positive correlation with dew amount zhang et al 2010 generally air temperature was the most important meteorological factor influencing the isotope concentration of precipitation non rainfall and vapor water in arid desert area 4 2 isotopic relationship of ecosystem water reservoirs can improve the prediction accuracy of hydrometeorological processes the d values combine both δd and δ18o which contain more information than the isotopic values taken separately voelker et al 2014 the d values have been used to assess how evaporation has led to local precipitation and to find loci of evaporation in the amazon and in tropical seasonal rain forests in southwest china liu et al 2007 in montane ecosystems high d values in fogs as a result of terrestrially evaporated water have also been documented ingraham and matthews 1988 ingraham and mark 2000 the different hydrothermal transmission process controls the source of input water in desert area fluctuations in the d values of precipitation in fig 3 may be attributed to variations in water vapor from different moisture sources this can be tested using the hysplit model the typical precipitation events occurring at different months during the experimental period were analyzed to ascertain if the precipitation origin was different for different events which can induce a difference in the isotope ratio fig 7 the moisture contributing to precipitation in october was mainly sourced from remote westerly arid gobi land masses where the low vapor pressure may result in high d values during september tremendous amounts of moisture were brought in from local evapotranspiration of a relatively humid area in southwest which was generated under high vapor pressure therefore the trajectory analysis allowed for the association of moisture sources with the isotopic compositions of precipitation events the stable isotope abundance of different water body reflects the physical phase change features in the atmosphere condensation can be considered as the inverse of evaporation the atmospheric humidity the isotope content of atmosphere water vapor and the equilibrium or the kinetic fractionations controlled the isotopic contents of non rainfall water the isotope studies of non rainfall contribute to better understand the fractionation processes associated with evaporation during non rainfall formation process the variation of stable isotopes in non rainfall water was consistent with that in precipitation and atmosphere water vapor and compared with rainfall and water vapor the isotopes of non rainfall are enriched figs 3 and 4 these results indicated that the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation process was important during non rainfall formation in this area contrary to equilibrium fractionation the condensed liquid water of kinetic fractionation was depleted in δ18o and less enriched in δd due to diffusion of water isotopologues across a super saturated boundary layer formed when the air temperature is lower than the dew point deshpande et al 2013 although higher rh during experiment period the air temperature was higher than dew point at most observation date which may limited the kinetic fractionation the research of wen et al 2012 in a cropland and grassland in china also pointed out that the effect of equilibrium fractionation on the δd and δ18o of dew is greater than that of the kinetic fractionation although humidity deviated from the saturation conditions by up to 120 on the leaf surface the δ18o values in surface dew in brazil also consistently tracked atmospheric vapor δ18o values which is generally regarded as the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation process zhang et al 2009 however the kinetic fractionation degree will increase with increasing degree of super saturation or when non rainfall formed due to a sudden drop in temperature atmospheric water vapour which was collected above the canopy was isotopically highly depleted compared to all other water sources fig 4 the rh was higher and air temperature was lower during non rainfall events around the canopy fig 2 such meteorological factors induced low δd and δ18o values of atmospheric water vapor table 1 the measured δd and δ18o of individual water pools were highly correlated as expected fig 5 they followed the gmwl very closely the lmwl had a smaller slope and lower intercept than the gmwl indicating that the stable isotope during precipitation was affected by secondary evaporation and that there was a strong effect of local vapor evaporation the slope and intercept values of lmwl were also lower than the results from may to september in this area pan et al 2020a 2020b the different lmwls were controlled by numerous local geographic and meteorological factors including moisture sources air mass trajectory evapotranspiration effects on local and synoptic scales local climatic conditions precipitation formation processes and secondary evaporation during precipitation descent wu et al 2015 non rainfall water line was close to lmwl there was no significant difference between d values of local meteoric water and non rainfall water fig 5 which can yield information concerning their similar origin cui et al 2009 thus non rainfall should be included for the determination of lmwl the high d values in rainfall non rainfall soil water vapor water leaf and xylem water clearly demonstrated that evaporated water is a significant source of different input water in desert area fig 5 the surface soil water and plant water could also be the source of non rainfall radiation water through evapotranspiration in desert regions the highest d values of leaf water indicated higher transpiration rate the evaporation rates of precipitation non rainfall and vapour water were also high with higher d values these water sources were involved in the atmosphere water cycle through evapotranspiration the d values of xylem water and soil water were only less than half other water source the evaporation and transpiration were relatively lower during non rainfall events the non rainfall water line was above the gmwl and with higher d values the isotope contents of non rainfall were also higher than vapor samples indicating direct condensation from water vapor fig 5 however there was a significant inverse variation characteristic between d and δ18o values of non rainfall fig 4 which indicated that the collected non rainfall may have experienced evaporation so the residual water was left with more enriched isotopic content but lower d values that was to say non rainfall played an important role in linking small scale water consumption by plants to large scale regional water cycle and hydrological process and the isotopic effects can as a diagnostic tool for an in depth understanding of the hydrometeorological processes stable isotopic composition and variation characteristics of different ecosystem water pools provided information about moisture origin and the possible evaporation and utilization process for input water source in desert area 4 3 non rainfall water is an important supplement to plant water in desert area air temperature rh and dew point temperature are key factors that affect non rainfall frequency and amounts non rainfall formed when air temperature was close to dew point temperature and rh was high fig 2 precipitation also may affect or be associated with non rainfall frequency with increasing precipitation associated with more moisture lower temperature and higher rh thus favoring non rainfall formation the formation frequency of non rainfall was higher in 2018 55 compared to in 2019 40 due to the different of rainfall amounts furthermore the precipitation trend matched non rainfall frequency during the experimental measurements figs 3 and 4 this indicated that some non rainfall was formed by radiative cooling of evaporated water from wet surface produced shortly after rain therefore secondarily evaporated water was a significant source of both rain and non rainfall in the experimental area just like long term observations in china dou et al 2021 non rainfall formation was more sensitive to rh and air temperature than to precipitation figs 2 and 3 due to the environmental determinants of non rainfall deposition its frequency and amount may change rapidly with climate change near surface warming is generally strong in the arid regions by 0 4 c per decade due to a coupling of changes in temperatures water vapor and downward longwave radiation zhou 2016 wei etal 2017 large warming over arid regions together with large decreases in surface rh makes non rainfall events less likely the decreased non rainfall frequency combines with the increased evaporative demand for moisture may worsen the deficit in surface water balance making arid regions more sensitive to global warming and causing arid regions to become even drier so under the background of climate change non rainfall water plays an increasingly important role in the ecohydrological process of dryland ecosystem the ecological importance of non rainfall had been widely researched in semiarid and arid area agama and berlinera 2006 beysens 2018 kidron and starinsky 2019 however it is uncertain whether non rainfall can be directly used for the growth and development of shrub vegetation because of their less formation amounts according to the traditional spac theory plants can only absorb water through roots the non rainfall mainly formed in shallow soil layers which can t reach the water absorbing layer of shrub roots at all zhang et al 2008 in order to adapt to arid habitats plants have developed a series of water absorption and utilization strategies in non rainfall formation environment foliar water uptake was a widespread water acquisition strategy in plants which had been described as affecting plant water and carbon relations in 70 species from numerous different ecosystems burkhardt et al 2012 eller et al 2013 goldsmith et al 2013 cassana et al 2015 previous research also verified that the leaves of some desert plants can absorb non rainfall water yan et al 2015 zhuang et al 2021 which had important implications for species survival and distribution in desert areas artemisia ordosica is a widely distributed plant species in arid sandy areas which is a unique and excellent sand fixing semi shrub in china and plays a very important role in the reconstruction and restoration of desert ecosystem the information about how artemisia ordosica plants use non rainfall and the utilization quantity are still lacking in revegetation desert area by comparing the isotope composition of leaf water and non rainfall water we determined that non rainfall water was an important water source of leaf water for artemisia ordosica in desert areas fig 6 the absorption of non rainfall water by leaves may be an important strategy for artemisia ordosica to cope with dry environment artemisia ordosica plants can absorb water via leaf trichomes cuticles and stomata gui et al 2021 this will change the water balance of plants foliar absorption of non rainfall becomes an important water supplement for root water uptake which will change our understanding of current indicators of hydrologic pressure and sensitivity in order to evaluate the stability of dryland ecosystem the contribution rate of different water sources to plants need to quantify stable isotopes of water can determine how much different supplement water sources are used by plant species this have been applied widely to fog research fischer and still 2007 especially in tropical rainforest area eller et al 2013 liu et al 2014 binks et al 2019 boanares et al 2019 the application to other non rainfall water sources research is minimal in the present study we found that non rainfall supplied 8 16 mean 12 of artemisia ordosica plant water requirement in revegetation desert area of tengger desert by stable isotope analysis table 3 this contribution rate was even greater than the water contribution of some soil layers and the lower the rainfall the higher the contribution rate of non rainfall water non rainfall made up for the water deficit of plants caused by the lack of rainfall in dry environments and seasons quantifying the role of non rainfall water in plant water balance is the key to understanding plant function under current or future climates 5 conclusions this study analyzed the isotope variability characteristics of atmosphere plant and soil water reservoirs during the non rainfall formation period of two years in a revegetation arid desert area of northwest china correlation analyses indicated that air temperature was positively correlated with δ18o of precipitation non rainfall and vapor water and negative correlated with d values of precipitation and atmospheric vapor water the δ18o of precipitation was significantly negatively correlated with amount while the amount effect was not significant for δ18o of non rainfall and d values of precipitation and non rainfall moreover the amount effect of precipitation and non rainfall was determined by event size the d values were highest when input water was 1 5 mm the values decreased when the event sizes were 5 mm or 1 mm rh and vpd only affected the isotope values of precipitation compared to non rainfall and atmosphere water during non rainfall formation the isotope values δd and δ18o were more depleted after large rain amounts the isotope variation trend of non rainfall was similar with precipitation and was significantly correlated with leaf water and atmospheric water vapor due to higher evaporation rate in desert area the lmwl was deviated from the gmwl and the slope and intercept of other water lines were smaller than lmwl furthermore the atmosphere plant and soil water all had high d values the isotope values of leaf water were more enriched than that of precipitation and non rainfall water and were better correlated with non rainfall water than xylem water non rainfall contributed nearly 12 of artemisia ordosica plant water requirement during measurement period and the contribution rate was higher under drought conditions this

2147,the formation and utilization of non rainfall water can modulate isotope variation characteristics of the atmosphere plants and soil water reservoirs this is especially significant for water resource management in arid desert areas where non rainfall is an important supplemental water source in this study we analyzed the isotope variation and interaction characteristics of rainfall non rainfall atmospheric water vapor xylem water leaf water and shallow soil water during non rainfall events over two years in a revegetation desert area in northwest china the results indicated that air temperature was the most important meteorological factor influencing isotope characteristics of rainfall non rainfall and atmospheric water vapor the isotope composition was also affected by rainfall and non rainfall amounts which decreased with event quantity back trajectory analysis showed that the variation of rainfall d values were induced by different moisture sources from arid gobi and local evapotranspiration the non rainfall water line is close to local meteoric water line with both having similar origins non rainfall was mainly formed by radiative cooling of evaporated water produced shortly after rain and participated in the local water recycling the atmospheric plant and soil water all had high d values which indicated that evaporated water was a significant water source of different water reservoirs in this area the leaf water of artemisia ordosica was largely replenished by non rainfall water compared to xylem water during non rainfall events so foliar water uptake was an important survival mechanism for artemisia ordosica to adapt to drought environment during non rainfall formation non rainfall water contributed to 8 16 of the xylem water and the less rainfall the higher the contribution rate our results are especially meaningful for arid desert regions where global climate change increases the importance of non rainfall water keywords isotope non rainfall water reservoirs meteorological factors contribution rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction non rainfall that refers to dew fog and frost here occurs in most climate zones has important implications for gas exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems kim and lee 2011 kaseke et al 2017 which can reach and even exceed annual rainfall and serve as a sustainable and stable water source to maintain plant biological soil crust small animal and microbiology survival in arid and semiarid environments kidron et al 2011 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 especially during periods of drought it can be directly absorbed by plant roots from soil and can reduce the evaporation loss of soil moisture which helps mediate water status in water stressed plants and the relationship between soil and plants aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 wang et al 2019 furthermore many types of organisms from trees to cryptogam goldsmith et al 2013 pan et al 2016 have developed diverse and creative evolutionary adaptations to utilize non rainfall water goldsmith et al 2013 from water trapping trichomes kim et al 2018 to enlisting the help of fungal hyphae burgess and dawson 2004 the drylands which comprise 40 of the global terrestrial ecosystem will experience reduced rainfall under future global change increasing the role of non rainfall water in these areas kaseke et al 2017 tian et al 2021 non rainfall is the link between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere the relationship study between non rainfall and different water reservoirs is an important supplement of the hydrological process of ecosystem the stable isotope composition characteristics of water are natural and traditional hydrological tracers which reflect features of physical phase change zhang et al 2010 thus they work in tracing different hydrometeorological processes associated with different types of waters e g rainfall snowfall dew fog surface water plant water and ice core dansgaard 1964 jouzel and merlivat 1984 wang et al 2010 putman and bowen 2019 lanning et al 2020 non rainfall formation has the potential to modulate the spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic contents of atmospheric water vapor oxygen and carbon dioxide wen et al 2012 the variation of precipitation non rainfall and atmosphere water vapor isotopes mirrors complex atmospheric behavior the isotopic content of non rainfall water is controlled by atmospheric humidity the vapor isotope content in the air and the equilibrium and kinetic fractionations wen et al 2012 although stable isotopes have been applied widely to fog research fischer and still 2007 the application to other non rainfall water research is minimal kaseke et al 2017 the published studies on the non rainfall phenomenon are mostly devoted to quantifying intensity and duration richards 2004 agama and berlinera 2006 pan et al 2010 2018 yet several studies have been carried out on the isotopic compositions of non rainfall water and their relationships to other ecosystem water pools and fluxes wen et al 2012 for example bariac et al 1989 and welp et al 2008 examined the interaction between the isotopic compositions of dew water atmospheric water vapor and leaf water for a small number of dew events and found that the isotopic composition of water vapor above a soybean canopy was depleted during dew formation and enriched during evaporation in the morning kim and lee 2011 used a laboratory dark plant chamber to investigate the dew effect on leaf water isotopic compositions still little is known about the detailed relationship and isotope variation characteristics of non rainfall and other water reservoirs liu et al 2007 water is the most important limit factor for plants in arid area understanding identifying vegetation water use of both rainfall and non rainfall components is essential for developing sound ecological models of arid environments schröder et al 2009 and key to understanding plant function under current or future climates feddes et al 2001 as a water source non rainfall can be directly absorbed through leaves which can then alter leaf level energy balance reduce transpiration rate and improve photosynthesis limm et al 2009 rao et al 2009 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 a laboratory study showed that stomata stayed open in the presence of non rainfall and that non rainfall served as an intermediary that facilitated the exchange of the h2 18o and hdo molecules between leaf water and atmospheric vapor kim and lee 2011 by using stable isotopes soderberg 2010 confirmed that fog contributed to 5 20 of the xylem water of main plants in namib desert and these plants directly absorbed fog water through their stems or leaves however several questions that remain to be answered are to what extent non rainfall can meet the water requirements of desert plants and how plants absorb and allocate non rainfall water in arid desert areas like many dryland ecosystems worldwide the tennger desert relies on non rainfall as an important supplemental water source liu et al 2006 pan et al 2010 2018 non rainfall water may originate from the condensation of atmospheric water transpiration of plant leaves and evaporation of soil water quantifying the contribution of these water fluxes by isotope technology is important for ecosystem water cycle given the large abundance and importance of non rainfall in tennger desert this area provides an ideal location to study the relationship between different water reservoirs during non rainfall events however due to the difficulty of continuously measuring and collecting non rainfall for long time in field experiments so far the isotope composition of non rainfall and their relationship to other water fluxes have not been known in this area non rainfall formed mainly on the ground surface and it was evaporated completely after sunrise pan et al 2018 we know very little about the ecological effect of non rainfall to desert shrubs and their absorption and utilization strategies in arid environments through field experiments over two years the study took artemisia ordosica as target plant the goals are to 1 determine the effect of meteorological factors and event size on isotope characteristics of different water sources 2 reveal the isotopic interactions between non rainfall water and ecosystem water pools and fluxes and 3 verify the absorption and utilization mode of non rainfall by desert shrub and assess their contribution quantity to achieve these goals we measured the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of rain non rainfall vapor water soil water leaf and xylem water during non rainfall events by isotope variation characteristics this research provides a better understanding of the correlation for different water pools in arid desert climates determines the ecological contribution of non rainfall to desert shrubs these findings will also assist in predicting dryland responses to global climate change by providing information about non rainfall water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is a revegetated desert ecosystem 37 27 n 104 57 e 1339 m a s l at the shapotou desert experimental research station sders which borders the tengger desert in

which is concentrated in september and octorber pan et al 2010 2018 the natural landscape is characterized by reticulated chains of barchan dunes with a vegetation cover of 1 and the predominant native plants are hedysarum scoparium agriophyllum squarrosum and psammochloa cillosa biological soil crusts bscs were nearly non existent in this area before revegetation efforts began 62 years before this study pan et al 2018 in order to fix moving sand dunes a non irrigated sand binding vegetation protective system was established by planting xerophytic shrubs within a matrix of straw checkerboards first straw checkerboards spacing 1 1 m2 were established by inserting straw vertically into soil to a depth of 15 20 cm to increase surface roughness and reduce wind erosion xerophytic shrub seedlings mainly artemisia ordosica caragana korshinskii and hedysarum scoparium were planted within the straw checkerboard with 160 individuals per 100 m2 in 1956 the afforested area was further extended in 1964 1981 and each following year with the same approaches along the east west baotou lanzhou railway li et al 2007 a desert shrub ecosystem with a dwarf shrub and biological soil crust cover formed on the stabilized sand dunes over the course of this project after 60 years of evolution artemisia ordosica and caragana korshinskii are the main artificial sand fixing shrubs in this area for this study an isotope sample collection experiment was carried out in the soil water balance experimental field of sders a 30 year revegetated desert ecosystem 2 2 samples collection rainfall non rainfall water vapor water leaf xylem and soil samples were collected during september and october in 2018 and 2019 event based rainfall and non rainfall samples were collected twenty seven rain events occurred during the study period fifteen non rainfall events a high enough amount for isotope analysis were sampled by specially designed collectors fig 1 the fine nylon screen 1 m2 was hung at four different directions with a horizontal collection tank inclined slightly for every screen a tube perpendicular to each collection tank was connected to a 0 5 l collection bottle at every direction the unit area non rainfall amount was measured and calculated to reduce evaporation effects on isotopes all dew samples were sealed in glass vials 15 ml before dawn when condensation was still occurring all of the rainfall samples were collected immediately after each event or at the earliest possible time in the morning if the rainfall event was finished after midnight other samples were taken during non rainfall collection vapor water was collected using a 1 l aluminum foil gas sampling bag above the canopy average height 0 75 m soil cores were collected at depths of 0 20 cm 20 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm near the artemisia ordosica plants the xylem was cut from the upper middle and lower parts of the plants and the epidermis was gently removed using tweezers the veins of collected leaves at top canopy were removed all samples were collected in three duplicates vapor samples were stored at room temperature rainfall non rainfall were refrigerated soil xylem and leaf samples were frozen until water was extracted by a vacuum distillation method 2 3 isotopic analysis water in the xylem leaf and soil samples was extracted using a fully automatic vacuum condensation extraction system li 2100 lica united technology limited beijing china the extraction rate of water from samples was 98 the isotopic compositions δ18o and δd of all water pools were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the values were reported in standard δ notation representing deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water standard v smow expressed as δ sample r sample r v s m o w r v s m o w 1000 where r sample and r v s m o w are the isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o in samples and the v smow respectively the precisions sd of δd and δ18o were 1 and 0 2 respectively the analyses of each sample were repeated five times and the mean and standard deviation were calculated deuterium excess d in abbreviation value was calculated as dansgaard 1964 d δd 8 δ18o the abnormal values such as the xylem water data at september 26th 2019 which may be caused due to the high temperature of temperature controller during water extraction process were discarded for analysis 2 4 meteorological factor measurement and calculation the presence of free water on each leaf surface leaf wetness was estimated using a dielectric leaf wetness sensor campbell 237 usa rainfall was measured by a siphon rain gauge with an observational error of 0 2 mm for rainfall 10 mm and 0 02 mm for rainfall 10 mm from the automatic weather station milos 520 vaisala finland in sders the air temperature and relative humidity rh at canopy edges were measured using the auto weather station ws std1 britain within the measurement field based on long term meteorological observations the dew point temperature was calculated using the penman monteith equation with the following function t dew 116 91 237 3 l n e a 16 78 l n e a e

and t a is air temperature c meanwhile the temperature differences t a t dew was calculated as the difference between the air temperature t a and dew point temperature t dew to represent the difficult degrees of dew formation 2 5 backward trajectories for precipitation sources the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit was used to diagnose the backward track of the air parcels in the sampled rain events draxler et al 1999 stein et al 2015 the model is available from the noaa air resources laboratory at http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php this model has previously been used together with water isotope measurements to analyze moisture sources and isotopic signatures of precipitation producing air masses with considerable success lee et al 2003 bershaw et al 2012 the sample based and historical meteorological data were inputted into the trajectory model by uploading them through the data portal provided in the hysplit interface the data resolution was 2 5 2 5 and backward trajectories of 24 h were performed for each rain event 2 6 data analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using origin 8 0 originlab northampton usa and spss 13 0 spss 13 0 inc chicago usa software packages the local meteoric water line lmwl see craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 and the δd δ18o relationship of other waters were obtained by linear regression analyses the relative contribution rate of non rainfall and soil water to plants were calculated using the packages mixsiar and jags in the r4 2 1 platform r development core team 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics of non rainfall formation based on the leaf wetness sensor non rainfall water formation frequencies accounted for 55 and 40 of the measured periods in 2018 and 2019 respectively for comparison the total annual rainfall was 228 and 190 mm respectively the measured non rainfall amounts of two months accounted for 12 and 9 of annual precipitation during the two experimental years we presented the nocturnal air temperature dew point temperature and rh during non rainfall collection in september and october when the amount of dew formation was large enough for isotope analysis fig 2 the average air temperature was 10 7 c range from 6 18 c to 19 98 c and the dew point temperature was 9 48 c 6 17 c to 15 16 c generally the air temperature was close to or slightly above the dew point temperature during non rainfall collection the average rh was 93 38 with a range of 75 79 to 100 3 2 influence of meteorological parameters and event sizes on isotope composition of input water sources correlation analyses were carried out to identify relationships between isotopic compositions of water sources and various local meteorological factors air temperature ta precipitation and non rainfall amounts amounts rh vapour pressure deficit or vpd based on event based databases of precipitation non rainfall and atmospheric vapor table 1 a positive correlation was identified between ta and δ18o for precipitation non rainfall and vapor water p 0 01 the negative correlation was significant between ta and d for precipitation and atmospheric vapor p 0 01 while the influence of ta on d values was not significant for non rainfall p 0 05 the heavy rain was usually depleted in stable isotopes whereas the light rain was usually enriched the correlation coefficient between the δ18o and precipitation amounts was 0 553 exceeding 0 01 correlated confidence limits using a t test the amount effect on δ18o was not significant for non rainfall p 0 05 there wasn t significant amount effect on d values for precipitation and non rainfall p 0 05 δ18o and rh were weakly negatively correlated while d was weakly positively correlated with rh for precipitation p 0 05 for precipitation the δ18o was weakly positive correlated with vpd and a weak negative correlation occurred between d and vpd p 0 05 table i in order to confirm if the amounts effect was determined by event sizes we summarized the influence of event sizes on isotopic composition of water sources table 2 with decreasing event sizes δ18o and δd showed an increasing trend d values increased at first and then decreased meanwhile changes in the slope and intercept of the linear correlations between δd and δ18o across the entire sample period decreased slightly as the size class decreased this occurred in all classes except for smallest size class 0 0 5 mm the largest event size 5mm collectively displayed the highest slope and intercept for the linear regression between δd and δ18o and lowest d value 3 3 isotopic variation characteristics of ecosystem water pools during non rainfall despite sampling over a relatively short time frame rain isotope values varied tremendously δd ranged from 90 21 to 35 42 and δ18o from 16 24 to 8 54 the large variation reflected the particular rainfall event with large rain amounts associated with the depleted isotope values during our experiment period such as on september 1st 2018 and october 15th 2019 fig 3 a the d values of rainfall ranged from 10 54 to 42 24 with an average value of 31 06 the mean values were significantly lower in september 28 than october 36 26 p 0 01 fig 3b the δd and δ18o variations of non rainfall water showed similar trends and larger variation ranging from 92 18 to 30 12 for δd and 16 84 to 6 29 for δ18o the temporal variation characteristics of isotopic compositions for non rainfall water were synchronous with leaf water and atmospheric water vapor fig 4 a and b correlation analysis indicated that the isotope values of non rainfall water and leaf water were significantly correlated r2 0 87 p 0 01 for δd and r2 0 98 p 0 01 for δ18o the isotope values of non rainfall water and atmospheric water vapor were also significantly correlated r2 0 58 p 0 05 for δd and r2 0 99 p 0 01 for δ18o the correlations between the non rainfall water δd and δ18o with those of the xylem water and soil water were not significant p 0 05 the d values of non rainfall water ranged from 6 62 to 46 99 which were consistent with precipitation although the d values of atmospheric water vapor was not significantly different from that of precipitation p 0 05 the amplitude ranged from 16 67 to 80 00 a much wider range than rainfall the d values of leaf water were higher than non rainfall water the xylem water and soil moisture had lower d values compared to precipitation and non rainfall generally both the rain and non rainfall water in the desert area had high d values 31 06 and 31 85 respectively which were more than three times the values at iaea wmo stations in china 5 3 to 23 6 with an average of 10 17 iaea 2004 the high d values also occurred in vapor water 32 89 leaf water 48 25 xylem water 17 89 and soil water 14 72 fig 4c the δd δ18o relationship of precipitation local meteoric water line lmwl was well fitted as δd 5 73δ18o 2 4 r2 0 86 p 0 01 which deviated from the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 for non rainfall water the relationship between δd and δ18o was fitted as δd 5 13δ18o 0 68 r2 0 75 p 0 01 with an intercept even smaller than that of lmwl the atmospheric water vapor xylem water and soil moisture had a δd δ18o line with a lower slope compared to lmwl leaf water had highest d values which were closer to non rainfall water precipitation non rainfall and vapour water had very similar d values the d values of xylem water were relatively lower and near to the soil water fig 5 3 4 contribution of non rainfall water to xerophyte the leaf water of artemisia ordosica during a non rainfall event may be a mixture of non rainfall water xylem water and the initial water left in the leaf from the previous day fig 6 showed the linear dependence of the isotope values for leaf water δl on xylem water δx and non rainfall water δnrw the mean δd values of leaf water non rainfall water and xylem water were 70 36 58 88 and 21 07 respectively the corresponding δ18o values were 14 83 11 34 and 4 87 the δl was closer to and better correlated with δnrw r2 0 75 and 0 98 for δd and δ18o respectively p 0 01 than δx indicating that non rainfall water was a more importance water source for the leaves than the xylem water during the non rainfall events table 3 showed the contribution proportion of non rainfall and soil moisture at different depths to artemisia ordosica plants during non rainfall events although surface 100 cm soil layer was the main water contribution layer for artemisia ordosica plants the relative contribution of non rainfall was near 12 during measurement period furthermore the contribution rate of non rainfall was higher during periods of scarce rainfall the non rainfall contributed as much as 16 for artemisia ordosica plants at october 2018 when the precipitation was only 3 mm 4 discussion 4 1 meteorological factors affect the isotope variation of input water sources the input water sources are important link to the water cycle in ecosystem their isotope variation characteristics mirror complex atmospheric behavior the formation of precipitation non rainfall and atmosphere vapor water is controlled by some meteorological factors like circulation pattern and vapor condition accordingly their isotope values are also influenced by meteorological factors some studies from subtropical regions in china showed negative correlations between precipitation δ18o and air temperature zhang et al 2007 liu et al 2008 peng et al 2010 xie et al 2011 wu et al 2015 there are few related researches in arid desert area in china different from the subtropical regions the positive correlation was identified between air temperature and δ18o of precipitation non rainfall and vapor water in our study their d values were all negatively correlated to air temperature table 1 this result was consistent with research of dansgaard 1964 which found a significant positive relationship between isotopic values of precipitation and air temperature and this temperature effect was mainly in high and mid high latitude regions furthermore the isotope concentrations of non rainfall and atmosphere vapor also linked to temperature effect the temperature during phase change controls the fractionation rate of stable isotopes in input water sources and influences the regional atmospheric circulation so the stable isotope compositions in different water sources can be quantitatively recovered as temperature proxy in this area our results also found that lighter isotopic values are closely linked with large rainfall fig 3 a negative relationship existed between δ18o and precipitation amount table 1 that was to say the δ18o in precipitation and the precipitation water in atmosphere were governed by similar geographical and meteorological parameters so they changed together under the same circulation the precipitation amount effect significantly negative relationship between isotopic compositions and precipitation amount mainly in tropical and low latitude regions lee et al 2003 baldini et al 2010 was also significant in experimental arid desert area similar to precipitation amount rh was negatively correlated to δ18o and positively correlated to d values of precipitation table 1 rh is of the important impact on evaporation enrichment of stable isotopes in precipitation which dominates the raindrop evaporation lower rh will induce greater raindrop evaporation on precipitation research relating the isotopic compositions of precipitation and meteorological factors in southwest china had also identified atmospheric humidity as an important factor affecting the enrichment of heavy stable isotopes δ18o and δd in precipitation zhang et al 2007 vpd indicates evaporation between water drop and atmosphere as the greater vpd the atmosphere is drier the stronger evaporation of raindrop induced enriched stable isotope compositions in precipitation so vpd had marked positive correlations with the δ18o in precipitation meanwhile a weak negative correlation existed between d values and vpd table 1 so evaporative conditions were important in influencing isotope composition during the descent process at the experimental site generally meteorological factors affected the isotope variation of input water sources by influencing regional evaporation conditions the amount effect of rainfall and non rainfall was influenced by event quantity isotope concentration δd and δ18o values decreased with event quantity table 1 these results are consistent with peng et al 2007 who showed that the category and amount ranges of snow and rainwater samples affected the isotopic compositions of samples meanwhile changes in the slope and intercept from linear correlations between δd and δ18o over the entire sample period decreased slightly as the size class decreased except for smallest size class 0 0 5 mm table 2 datta et al 1991 identified statistical correlations between low precipitation quantity and low slope and intercept in a 23 year record of monthly isotopic compositions for new delhi india peng et al 2007 also showed that heavy rainfall events produced regression equations between δd and δ18o with higher slopes and intercepts than smaller rainfall events these patterns were suggested to result from evaporation and subsequent isotopic enrichment wu et al 2015 because the air column becomes gradually saturated during heavy long lasting rainfall events evaporation will stop causing inferred weak isotopic fractionation effects thus rainwater does not become enriched with heavy isotopes during such rainfall events the lowest slope and intercept were observed for the 0 5 1 mm event size which indicated that the water had experienced larger secondary evaporation effects during their descent for the events of 0 5 mm which mostly consisted of non rainfall the meteorological conditions higher rh and lower air temperature during their formation influenced the amount effect like the research at manaus brazil the δ18o in surface dew displayed a positive correlation with dew amount zhang et al 2010 generally air temperature was the most important meteorological factor influencing the isotope concentration of precipitation non rainfall and vapor water in arid desert area 4 2 isotopic relationship of ecosystem water reservoirs can improve the prediction accuracy of hydrometeorological processes the d values combine both δd and δ18o which contain more information than the isotopic values taken separately voelker et al 2014 the d values have been used to assess how evaporation has led to local precipitation and to find loci of evaporation in the amazon and in tropical seasonal rain forests in southwest china liu et al 2007 in montane ecosystems high d values in fogs as a result of terrestrially evaporated water have also been documented ingraham and matthews 1988 ingraham and mark 2000 the different hydrothermal transmission process controls the source of input water in desert area fluctuations in the d values of precipitation in fig 3 may be attributed to variations in water vapor from different moisture sources this can be tested using the hysplit model the typical precipitation events occurring at different months during the experimental period were analyzed to ascertain if the precipitation origin was different for different events which can induce a difference in the isotope ratio fig 7 the moisture contributing to precipitation in october was mainly sourced from remote westerly arid gobi land masses where the low vapor pressure may result in high d values during september tremendous amounts of moisture were brought in from local evapotranspiration of a relatively humid area in southwest which was generated under high vapor pressure therefore the trajectory analysis allowed for the association of moisture sources with the isotopic compositions of precipitation events the stable isotope abundance of different water body reflects the physical phase change features in the atmosphere condensation can be considered as the inverse of evaporation the atmospheric humidity the isotope content of atmosphere water vapor and the equilibrium or the kinetic fractionations controlled the isotopic contents of non rainfall water the isotope studies of non rainfall contribute to better understand the fractionation processes associated with evaporation during non rainfall formation process the variation of stable isotopes in non rainfall water was consistent with that in precipitation and atmosphere water vapor and compared with rainfall and water vapor the isotopes of non rainfall are enriched figs 3 and 4 these results indicated that the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation process was important during non rainfall formation in this area contrary to equilibrium fractionation the condensed liquid water of kinetic fractionation was depleted in δ18o and less enriched in δd due to diffusion of water isotopologues across a super saturated boundary layer formed when the air temperature is lower than the dew point deshpande et al 2013 although higher rh during experiment period the air temperature was higher than dew point at most observation date which may limited the kinetic fractionation the research of wen et al 2012 in a cropland and grassland in china also pointed out that the effect of equilibrium fractionation on the δd and δ18o of dew is greater than that of the kinetic fractionation although humidity deviated from the saturation conditions by up to 120 on the leaf surface the δ18o values in surface dew in brazil also consistently tracked atmospheric vapor δ18o values which is generally regarded as the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation process zhang et al 2009 however the kinetic fractionation degree will increase with increasing degree of super saturation or when non rainfall formed due to a sudden drop in temperature atmospheric water vapour which was collected above the canopy was isotopically highly depleted compared to all other water sources fig 4 the rh was higher and air temperature was lower during non rainfall events around the canopy fig 2 such meteorological factors induced low δd and δ18o values of atmospheric water vapor table 1 the measured δd and δ18o of individual water pools were highly correlated as expected fig 5 they followed the gmwl very closely the lmwl had a smaller slope and lower intercept than the gmwl indicating that the stable isotope during precipitation was affected by secondary evaporation and that there was a strong effect of local vapor evaporation the slope and intercept values of lmwl were also lower than the results from may to september in this area pan et al 2020a 2020b the different lmwls were controlled by numerous local geographic and meteorological factors including moisture sources air mass trajectory evapotranspiration effects on local and synoptic scales local climatic conditions precipitation formation processes and secondary evaporation during precipitation descent wu et al 2015 non rainfall water line was close to lmwl there was no significant difference between d values of local meteoric water and non rainfall water fig 5 which can yield information concerning their similar origin cui et al 2009 thus non rainfall should be included for the determination of lmwl the high d values in rainfall non rainfall soil water vapor water leaf and xylem water clearly demonstrated that evaporated water is a significant source of different input water in desert area fig 5 the surface soil water and plant water could also be the source of non rainfall radiation water through evapotranspiration in desert regions the highest d values of leaf water indicated higher transpiration rate the evaporation rates of precipitation non rainfall and vapour water were also high with higher d values these water sources were involved in the atmosphere water cycle through evapotranspiration the d values of xylem water and soil water were only less than half other water source the evaporation and transpiration were relatively lower during non rainfall events the non rainfall water line was above the gmwl and with higher d values the isotope contents of non rainfall were also higher than vapor samples indicating direct condensation from water vapor fig 5 however there was a significant inverse variation characteristic between d and δ18o values of non rainfall fig 4 which indicated that the collected non rainfall may have experienced evaporation so the residual water was left with more enriched isotopic content but lower d values that was to say non rainfall played an important role in linking small scale water consumption by plants to large scale regional water cycle and hydrological process and the isotopic effects can as a diagnostic tool for an in depth understanding of the hydrometeorological processes stable isotopic composition and variation characteristics of different ecosystem water pools provided information about moisture origin and the possible evaporation and utilization process for input water source in desert area 4 3 non rainfall water is an important supplement to plant water in desert area air temperature rh and dew point temperature are key factors that affect non rainfall frequency and amounts non rainfall formed when air temperature was close to dew point temperature and rh was high fig 2 precipitation also may affect or be associated with non rainfall frequency with increasing precipitation associated with more moisture lower temperature and higher rh thus favoring non rainfall formation the formation frequency of non rainfall was higher in 2018 55 compared to in 2019 40 due to the different of rainfall amounts furthermore the precipitation trend matched non rainfall frequency during the experimental measurements figs 3 and 4 this indicated that some non rainfall was formed by radiative cooling of evaporated water from wet surface produced shortly after rain therefore secondarily evaporated water was a significant source of both rain and non rainfall in the experimental area just like long term observations in china dou et al 2021 non rainfall formation was more sensitive to rh and air temperature than to precipitation figs 2 and 3 due to the environmental determinants of non rainfall deposition its frequency and amount may change rapidly with climate change near surface warming is generally strong in the arid regions by 0 4 c per decade due to a coupling of changes in temperatures water vapor and downward longwave radiation zhou 2016 wei etal 2017 large warming over arid regions together with large decreases in surface rh makes non rainfall events less likely the decreased non rainfall frequency combines with the increased evaporative demand for moisture may worsen the deficit in surface water balance making arid regions more sensitive to global warming and causing arid regions to become even drier so under the background of climate change non rainfall water plays an increasingly important role in the ecohydrological process of dryland ecosystem the ecological importance of non rainfall had been widely researched in semiarid and arid area agama and berlinera 2006 beysens 2018 kidron and starinsky 2019 however it is uncertain whether non rainfall can be directly used for the growth and development of shrub vegetation because of their less formation amounts according to the traditional spac theory plants can only absorb water through roots the non rainfall mainly formed in shallow soil layers which can t reach the water absorbing layer of shrub roots at all zhang et al 2008 in order to adapt to arid habitats plants have developed a series of water absorption and utilization strategies in non rainfall formation environment foliar water uptake was a widespread water acquisition strategy in plants which had been described as affecting plant water and carbon relations in 70 species from numerous different ecosystems burkhardt et al 2012 eller et al 2013 goldsmith et al 2013 cassana et al 2015 previous research also verified that the leaves of some desert plants can absorb non rainfall water yan et al 2015 zhuang et al 2021 which had important implications for species survival and distribution in desert areas artemisia ordosica is a widely distributed plant species in arid sandy areas which is a unique and excellent sand fixing semi shrub in china and plays a very important role in the reconstruction and restoration of desert ecosystem the information about how artemisia ordosica plants use non rainfall and the utilization quantity are still lacking in revegetation desert area by comparing the isotope composition of leaf water and non rainfall water we determined that non rainfall water was an important water source of leaf water for artemisia ordosica in desert areas fig 6 the absorption of non rainfall water by leaves may be an important strategy for artemisia ordosica to cope with dry environment artemisia ordosica plants can absorb water via leaf trichomes cuticles and stomata gui et al 2021 this will change the water balance of plants foliar absorption of non rainfall becomes an important water supplement for root water uptake which will change our understanding of current indicators of hydrologic pressure and sensitivity in order to evaluate the stability of dryland ecosystem the contribution rate of different water sources to plants need to quantify stable isotopes of water can determine how much different supplement water sources are used by plant species this have been applied widely to fog research fischer and still 2007 especially in tropical rainforest area eller et al 2013 liu et al 2014 binks et al 2019 boanares et al 2019 the application to other non rainfall water sources research is minimal in the present study we found that non rainfall supplied 8 16 mean 12 of artemisia ordosica plant water requirement in revegetation desert area of tengger desert by stable isotope analysis table 3 this contribution rate was even greater than the water contribution of some soil layers and the lower the rainfall the higher the contribution rate of non rainfall water non rainfall made up for the water deficit of plants caused by the lack of rainfall in dry environments and seasons quantifying the role of non rainfall water in plant water balance is the key to understanding plant function under current or future climates 5 conclusions this study analyzed the isotope variability characteristics of atmosphere plant and soil water reservoirs during the non rainfall formation period of two years in a revegetation arid desert area of northwest china correlation analyses indicated that air temperature was positively correlated with δ18o of precipitation non rainfall and vapor water and negative correlated with d values of precipitation and atmospheric vapor water the δ18o of precipitation was significantly negatively correlated with amount while the amount effect was not significant for δ18o of non rainfall and d values of precipitation and non rainfall moreover the amount effect of precipitation and non rainfall was determined by event size the d values were highest when input water was 1 5 mm the values decreased when the event sizes were 5 mm or 1 mm rh and vpd only affected the isotope values of precipitation compared to non rainfall and atmosphere water during non rainfall formation the isotope values δd and δ18o were more depleted after large rain amounts the isotope variation trend of non rainfall was similar with precipitation and was significantly correlated with leaf water and atmospheric water vapor due to higher evaporation rate in desert area the lmwl was deviated from the gmwl and the slope and intercept of other water lines were smaller than lmwl furthermore the atmosphere plant and soil water all had high d values the isotope values of leaf water were more enriched than that of precipitation and non rainfall water and were better correlated with non rainfall water than xylem water non rainfall contributed nearly 12 of artemisia ordosica plant water requirement during measurement period and the contribution rate was higher under drought conditions this

2148,traditional agricultural or eco hydrological models usually ignore soil deformation and its impact on hydrothermal properties when simulating soil water heat and salt transport under freeze thaw conditions as a result significant errors may occur when these models are used in areas with considerable frost heave such as arid areas with shallow groundwater tables in this study the simultaneous heat and water model shaw model was modified with considering soil deformation and its impact on hydrothermal properties during the freeze thaw period the modified shaw model was then validated using the experimental data collected at the hetao irrigation district in the upper yellow river basin comparison between the simulated and observed data showed that the modified shaw model performed well and obviously better than the original shaw model in simulating the soil water heat and salt transport as compared with the shaw model the modified shaw model averagely decreased the rmse value by 37 5 and 23 for soil water content and soil temperature respectively the modified model can be used as a decision tool for water management and salinity control of farmland in cold areas with significant frost heave keywords freeze thaw soil deformation soil hydrothermal property soil water heat salt dynamics model modification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal soil freeze thaw is a widespread naturally occurring phenomenon in the mid and high latitudes and alpine regions over 50 of the land surface in the northern hemisphere experiences seasonal freeze thaw cycles to varying degrees hayashi 2013 wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 during the freeze thaw period temperature driven phase transitions in soil water can significantly alter soil hydrothermal properties and soil water potential hansson et al 2004 stuurop et al 2021 influencing soil water and salt transport and potentially leading to soil salinization iwata et al 2010 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 therefore accurate simulations of soil water heat and salt transport under freeze thaw conditions are critical to improve the strategies of agricultural water management and salinity control in cold regions especially in arid areas with shallow groundwater tables aasgt where soil salinization is a major hindrance to sustainablemanagement of agricultural systems lu et al 2019 liu et al 2022 wu et al 2019 in the past decades many numerical models e g shaw flerchinger 1989 coupmodel jasson and karlberg 2004 and hydrus 1d freezing module hansson et al 2004 have been developed and widely applied for the simulation of soil water heat and salt transport as well as other agricultural or eco hydrological processes in cold regions kurylyk and watanabe 2013 most of these models have included the following assumptions 1 darcy fluid flow in unsaturated ice free soils is similar to water flow in partially frozen soils 2 there is an impedance factor that reflects the effects of pore ice on hydraulic conductivity 3 soils are non deformable that is the frost heave and its influence on soil hydrothermal properties have not been accounted for 4 a generalized or extended clapeyron equation is used to describe the mutual relationships among liquid water ice and temperature under the freeze thaw condition where the ice pressure is commonly considered as zero gauge pressure and the reference pressure is barometric hansson et al 2004 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 smith et al 2019 stuurop et al 2021 yang and wang 2019 zheng et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 yu et al 2018 yu et al 2020 in addition by integrating the advanced treatments of the atmospheric surface layer with the soil profile simulations these models can also be used to simulate hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration snowmelt and runoff under freeze thaw conditions hansson et al 2004 wu et al 2019 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 in most cases if soil deformation e g frost heave is not evident during the freeze thaw period it is reasonable to assume soil is non deformable however soil deformation in aasgt is significant under freeze thaw conditions since shallow groundwater might promote an increased water flow to the freezing zone xie et al 2021 thereby enhancing frost heave guo et al 2018 hermansson and guthrie 2005 for example guo et al 2018 conducted a field experiment to investigate the concrete lining damage in field canals caused by frost heave they found afrost heave of up to 12 cm or about 12 of the frost depth in the hetao irrigation district hid a typical arid area with shallow groundwater tables in the upper yellow river basin yrb of northwest china significant soil deformation may notably change soil hydrothermal properties resulting in a considerable bias in estimating soil water heat salt dynamics alaoui et al 2011 liu et al 2022 sahin et al 2008 wuest 2009 for example liu et al 2022 found soil deformation significantly changed soil bulk density in three land use types in hid the largest soil bulk density change in farmland and natural land was 0 48 g cm 3 and 0 43 g cm 3 respectively correspondingly if soil bulk density change was not considered the estimated values of soil hydrothermal properties including soil volumetric heat capacity thermal conductivity air entry potential saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity might be significantly biased resulting in noticeable errors in simulating water movement heat transfer and salt transport in soils under freeze thaw conditions therefore it is necessary to modify the aforementioned models with the consideration of soil deformation and its impact on hydrothermal properties in aasgt the shaw model was originally developed to simulate soil freeze thaw processes and the complex transfer of water heat and solute within a one dimensional plant snow residue soil system flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 compared with other agricultural or eco hydrological models the shaw model also considered the impact of snow and residue on soil freeze thaw processes the dynamic effects of salt on soil freezing point depression and the vapor transfer induced by soil temperature change flerchinger et al 2003 hansson et al 2004 jasson and karlberg 2004 therefore it has been regarded as one of the most detailed models to study soil freeze thaw processes and is widely used to evaluate the impacts of management and climate on biological and hydrological processes hayhoe 1994 nassar et al 2000 li et al 2013 lu et al 2019 additionally the shaw model showed its flexibility for further development due to its open source code and the advantage of combining other modules thus in this study the shaw model is selected to develop the process that describes soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties the objectives of this study are 1 to expand the shaw model s ability of simulating soil water heat and salt transport in freeze thaw deformed soils with considering soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties and 2 to evaluate the performance of the modified shaw model by comparing its simulation results with the experimental data 2 model modification 2 1 shaw model description the shaw model is a one dimensional water heat synchronization model it is capable of simulating complex wintertime phenomena of freezing effects on water and solute migration solute effects on frost formation and frozen soil related runoff flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 in the model transfer within the soil profile is solved concurrently with the surface energy and water balance which includes solar and long wave radiation exchange evaporation and sensible and latent heat transfer flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 the technical documentation for the shaw model contains a detailed description of the model s principle and algorithms flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 and the major processes of soil water heat and solute transport can be found in appendix a 2 2 model modification by considering soil deformation in the model modification we first used the approach proposed by liu et al 2022 to determine the impact of soil deformation on soil bulk density then the effects of soil deformation on soil hydrothermal properties were indirectly determined by the change in soil bulk density liu et al 2022 proposed a method for calculating soil bulk density change in freeze thaw deformed soil and demonstrated its feasibility through field experiments in their research they ignored the differences between soil saturated water content and soil porosity and assumed that frost heave only occurred as the total volume of liquid water and frozen water reached a certain proportion cp of the initial soil porosity thus when the total volume ice plus liquid exceeds the cp of the porosity the saturated water content and porosity of the deformed frozen soil can be determined as follows 1 n n θ i θ l c p n 2 θ s θ s θ i θ l c p n where n is the soil porosity of the deformed frozen soil n is the initial soil porosity θi is the soil volumetric ice content m3 m 3 θl is the liquid soil water content m3 m 3 θs is the saturated soil water content of the deformed frozen soil m3 m 3 θs is the initial saturated soil water content the specific gravity of soil is defined as its density to that of water and it is generally constant federico et al 2018 the following formula can be used to calculate soil specific gravity using soil bulk density and soil porosity 3 g s ρ b 1 n ρ b 1 n where gs is the specific gravity of soil ρ b and ρ b are the soil bulk density in non deformable and deformable situations respectively g cm 3 according to eq 3 the bulk density of the deformed frozen soil can be calculated using eq 4 campbell 1985 pointed out that soil hydraulic properties are closely related to soil bulk density the quantitative relationships between soil bulk density change and soil air entry potential and saturated hydraulic conductivity that campbell 1985 fitted are given in eqs 5 6 4 ρ b ρ b h 1 n h 1 n 5 ψ e ψ es g ρ b 1 3 0 67 b 6 k s 1 41 1 3 ρ b 1 3 b exp 6 9 m c 3 7 m si where ψe is the air entry potential m ψes is the air entry potential at standard bulk density 1 3 g cm 3 m b is a pore size distribution parameter ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 mc and msi are the percentage of clay and silt of soil respectively substituting eq 4 into eqs 5 and 6 can yield eqs 7 8 for adjusting the air entry potential and saturated water content for the deformed frozen soil the influences of soil bulk density change on soil thermal properties can be reflected by eqs a2 and a3 7 k s k s ρ b ρ b 1 3 b 8 ψ e ψ e ρ b ρ b 0 67 b where ks and ψe are the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 and air entry potential m of the deformed frozen soil respectively furthermore in the shaw model eq a8 is used to describe the equilibrium relationship between the temperature and water potential in freezing soils it is a simplified form of the clapeyron equation derived from eq 9 with the assumption that the gauge pressure in the ice is equal to zero the simplification is applicable in non deformable soils but it is not reasonable in deformable soils since frost heave may significantly change soil structure thus we included the gauge pressure in the ice in our model modification eq 9 is a generalized clapeyron equation that can be used in frozen soil and derived by loch 1978 by integrating the gibbs duhem equation 9 p w ρ l p i ρ i l f t k t where pw and pi are the equilibrium gauge pressures in frozen soil for the liquid water and ice phases respectively pa ρl and ρi are the liquid water and ice respectively kg m 3 lf is the latent heat of fusion j kg 1 tk is the soil temperature in kelvin k t is the soil temperature c when the gauge pressure in the ice is taken into account eq a8 can be rewritten as 10 ϕ π ψ p w g l f g t t k p i 0 917 g where ϕ is the total water potential m π is the osmotic potential m ψ is the soil matric potential m and g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 in this equation pi is equal to zero in the absence of frost heave otherwise pi is equal to the load on ice the load is equal to the sum of soil matrix weight and water weight of all soil layers above the ice lei et al 2020 assuming there are w soil layers above the ice the following formula can be used to calculate pi 11 p i a 1 w ρ ba z s a z s a θ la 0 917 θ ia ρ l g where ρba is the bulk density of the ath soil layer kg m 3 zsa is the height of the ath soil layer m θla is the liquid soil water content of the ath soil layer m3 m 3 θia is the soil volumetric ice content of the ath soil layer m3 m 3 soil deformation can also cause a change in node depth which can be calculated using eq 12 12 z s z s ρ b ρ b where zs is the node depth of deformed frozen soil m zs is the initial soil node depth m additionally in our model modification a maximum frost heave coefficient fr was considered to avoid the severe numerical problems and the ratio of zs to zs should not exceed fr 2 3 calculation procedure the modification was coded in program subroutines and functions which were then integrated into the shaw model the calculation procedure for the modified shaw model is shown in fig 1 in comparison with the shaw model the modified model will recalculate the soil bulk densities hydrothermal properties and node depths and then adjust soil liquid water content and ice content at the end of each time step accounting for the influence of soil deformation 3 materials and methods 3 1 study site 3 1 1 site description to evaluate the performance of the modified shaw model we chose farmland in hid 41 92 n 107 39 e at the upper yrb of china fig 2 as a case study the hid is one of china s three largest irrigation districts with an irrigated farmland of 0 57 mha xiong et al 2019 the climate in this area is a typically arid continental climate with only about 160 mm of annual precipitation however the average yearly evaporation 20 cm pan is around 2240 mm ren et al 2019 in winter the soil freeze thaw cycle generally begins in november and lasts until april or may of the following year with a frost depth of around 1 0 m due to the arid climate flat topography 0 2 slope and improper flood irrigation and drainage management groundwater table depths vary between 0 5 and 3 0 m during the year xiong et al 2019 causing a risk of soil salinization the location of the farmland in hid is shown in fig 2 the detailed soil physical properties of the farmland are presented in table 1 3 1 2 observation and data collection field observations were conducted over two winters from november 2018 to april 2019 and november 2019 to may 2020 respectively soil sampling was performed every 7 20 days to monitor changes in soil mass water content swc g g 1 and soil salt content ssc g kg 1 using a power drill diameter of 5 cm samples were gathered every 10 cm in the top 0 100 cm profile and every 20 cm below that until 120 cm temperature sensors with data recorded at 1 hour intervals and an accuracy of 0 5 c were initially installed at depths of 10 20 30 50 70 90 120 160 200 250 and 300 cm in a carbon fiber rod then the carbon fiber rod was then placed in the soil to measure soil temperature st a more detailed description of the experiments was provided in our previous studies liu et al 2021 2022 3 2 model set up calibration and validation the experimental data collected from november 18 2018 to april 26 2019 and november 9 2019 to may 5 2020 were used to calibrate and validate the modified shaw model respectively the initial soil profile was 120 cm deep with a spatial discretization of 2 cm for the top 20 cm and 10 cm for the remaining layers the atmospheric boundary condition was specified as the upper boundary condition for water flow and heat transport the linear interpolations of the water content measured at the 100 120 cm soil layer and the temperature measured at 120 cm depth were used as the lower boundary conditions of water flow and heat transport respectively the upper boundary condition for solute transport was defined as a zero flux boundary condition and the observed values specified the bottom boundary at 100 120 cm the solute does not degrade over time and absorption is not taken into account table 2 shows the initial values of soil parameters the initial values for the albedo of dry soil αd and the exponent for calculating the albedo of moist soil αa were the middle values of their respective ranges the initial soil hydraulic parameters ρb and θs were determined by measured data table 1 the initial soil hydraulic parameters ψe ks and b were estimated using the shaw model user manual based on soil bulk density and soil particle composition the percentages of sand silt and clay the initial solute transport parameters d0 τ and κ were adapted from lu et al 2019 the initial values of cp and fr were set at 1 0 and 1 125 respectively based on local frost heave studies liu et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 the parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using the local sensitivity analysis method as described by liang et al 2016 during the analysis only one soil parameter was altered at a time increased or decreased by 10 from its initial values while all other selected parameters remained constant the sensitivity of the parameters was judged by observing the changes in soil water content temperature and salt content in the 0 1 m soil profile after that all the above mentioned sensitive parameters were calibrated using a trial and error method the calibrated soil parameters for the modified shaw model are presented in table 3 the original shaw model was calibrated similarly to the modified shaw model except for parameters cp and fr the calibrated soil parameters for the original shaw model are presented in table 4 in addition for most soils soil saturated water content and soil porosity are quite close according to table 1 and eq 3 we can calculate that the soil specific gravity in the study area is around 2 75 0 01 thus in our simulations the soil specific gravity was set at 2 75 five statistical indicators including the regression coefficient b the coefficient of determination r2 the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were employed in this study to assess the model performance the detailed calculation procedures of these five statistical indicators could be found in ren et al 2016 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis fig 3 presents the results of sensitivity analysis of the 12 soil parameters for different output variables the order of the sensitivity of these 12 soil parameters is various the order of sensitivity for soil water is ρb fr θs cp ψe b with the remaining parameters being insensitive the order of sensitivity for soil temperature is ρb fr cp ψe b αd while the other parameters are insensitive for soil salinity the sensitive parameters include fr cp b ψe θs ρb and ks and the order of sensitivity is fr cp b ψe θs ρb ks both fr and cp are relatively sensitive parameters for all the three output variables i e soil water temperature and salinity indicating that soil deformation parameters are critical in simulating the coupled transfer of soil water heat and salt during the soil freeze thaw period 4 2 simulated results the comparison of soil gravimetric water content temperature and salt content at different depths simulated by the modified shaw model and the original shaw model with measured values is presented in figs 4 6 and table 5 as shown in fig 4 the soil gravimetric water contents simulated by the modified shaw model were in good agreement with the measured data for the model calibration and validation the mre values were within 2 the rmse values were 0 02 and 0 03 g g 1 the r2 values were 0 85 and 0 76 the nse values were 0 85 and 0 71 and the b values were close to 1 0 respectively table 5 the modified shaw model had a better performance than the original shaw model in modeling soil water dynamics fig 4 for example during the model calibration soil water content for the 40 60 cm soil layer increased rapidly from 0 32 to 0 43 g g 1 from december 17 2018 to december 17 2018 the soil water content reached 0 43 g g 1 which was about 30 higher than the saturated soil gravimetric water content 0 32 g g 1 measured at the beginning of experiments indicating severe frost heave the modified shaw still accurately captured the variations of soil water content however the original shaw model significantly underestimated the variations of soil water content fig 4 similar to the soil water simulation the simulated soil temperature by the modified shaw model agreed well with the measured data indicating that the modified shaw model provided a more accurate simulation than the original shaw model during the calibration period fig 5 the modified shaw model produced rmse values of 0 64 c and 1 48 c r2 values of 0 96 and 0 98 nse values of 0 98 and 0 99 and b values of 0 96 and 1 17 respectively for the calibration and validation periods table 5 however the original shaw model simulation increased the rmse value to 1 03 c and 1 73 c for the model calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 in addition it should be noted that the soil temperature simulation during the freezing period was better than those during the thawing period for both models as shown in fig 6 the simulated soil salt contents using the modified shaw model were in a reasonable agreement with the measured ones during the calibration and validation periods mre 13 44 and 11 76 rmse 0 31 and 0 39 g kg 1 r2 0 52 and 0 84 nse 0 10and 0 81 and b 0 85 and 0 98 however the simulation accuracy of the modified shaw model during model calibration and validation was not always better than the original shaw model during the model validation the modified shaw model outperformed the original shaw model with the rmse value decreasing from 0 45 to 0 39 g kg 1 table 5 but during the model calibration the modified shaw model did not simulate soil salt dynamics as well as the original shaw model with the rmse value increasing from 0 32 to 0 33 g kg 1 table 5 5 discussion 5 1 the role of considering soil deformation and soil hydrothermal properties changes in modeling soil transport processes changes in soil parameters are one of the major sources of uncertainty in modeling soil transport processes moges et al 2021 this is particularly true for water heat and salt transport simulations in frozen soil as soil deformation produced by frost heave may notably change soil hydrothermal properties sahin et al 2008 wu et al 2021 used a hydro thermal mechanical coupled model to simulate soil frost heave subjected to cyclic freeze thaw conditions and they found that the changes in soil parameters such as soil pore distribution were the main cause of inconsistency between the experimental and simulated results liu et al 2022 conducted field experiments to investigate the soil water salt dynamics in hid and they found that in consideration of soil bulk density change could significantly improve the estimation accuracy of soil water salt dynamics thus they expected soil water heat and salt transport in hid could be better modeled by incorporating the effects of soil bulk density change into the hydrological model this outlook is confirmed by our study as depicted in section 4 2 the improvements of the simulated soil water content and soil temperature by the modified shaw model indicate that the consideration of soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties could result in a better simulation of soil water heat and salt transport in aasgt under freeze thaw conditions the modified shaw model can improve the simulation accuracy because soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties are considered fig 7 a b illustrates the frost heave dynamics during the calibration and validation periods respectively it can be seen that frost heaves were significant in the study area with a maximum value of 10 2 cm for the calibration period and 6 0 cm for the validation period respectively the substantial frost heave caused significant changes in soil hydrothermal properties fig 8 fig 8 shows the dynamics of soil bulk density saturated soil water content saturated hydraulic conductivity and air entry potential of 40 60 cm soil layer during the model calibration period it can be seen that during the freezing period frost heave could significantly decrease soil bulk density which can subsequently increase soil air entry potential saturated soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity the simulated variations of soil bulk density air entry potential saturated soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were 10 35 13 and 61 respectively then during the thawing period these soil hydrothermal parameters gradually returned to their initial values as frost heave decreased in addition the variation of the simulated bulk density is consistent with that calculated by liu et al 2022 fig 8 a this further demonstrates the applicability of our modified model 5 2 uncertainties in simulating soil water heat and salt dynamics in model calibration and validation the modified shaw model slightly underestimated soil water variations in 60 100 cm soil layers at the end of the freeze thaw period fig 4 this result might be due to the fact that the lateral groundwater exchange was not considered in our simulation land use in hid is characterized by a fragmented distribution of various crop fields and natural vegetation patches due to a variety of irrigation activities topographic features and agronomic practices ren et al 2016 the freeze thaw process thus varies among various land uses because of the differences in initial soil water content land cover soil texture etc liu et al 2021 in spring as the soil thaws soil water accumulated in frozen layers may migrate downward raising the groundwater table however due to the variety of soil freeze thaw processes the time and rate of groundwater table rise in different land uses are different resulting in differences in groundwater tables between different land uses which in turn leads to lateral water exchange between different land uses wu et al 2019 farmland in hid generally takes a longer time to be completely thawed than other land uses such as woodland liu et al 2022 therefore there may be a lateral inflow of groundwater we thus recommended that detailed consideration on boundary conditions is necessary in modeling frozen soil fig 5 shows that soil temperature simulation during the freezing period is better than soil temperature simulation during the thawing period in model calibration and validation this result might be due to that the changes in soil surface albedo during the simulation by factors not accounted for by the model although the model accounts for soil water content influence on albedo in real practice soil surface albedo is prone to change when frozen soil thaws by other factors fujimaki et al 2003 wang et al 2014 for example fujimaki et al 2003 found that in arid areas as soil water evaporates in spring soil salt might crystallize on the soil surface increasing soil surface albedo wang et al 2014 found that wind erosion was very pronounced in arid and semiarid regions during late winter and early spring wind erosion could significantly change soil surface conditions and thus notably change soil surface albedo soil surface albedo plays an important role in soil heat transfer processes wang et al 2014 therefore a more accurate estimation of soil surface albedo would be helpful for improving the simulation of coupled water heat and salt transport in frozen soils the modified shaw model was slightly less effective in simulating soil salt transport as compared to the simulations of soil water and temperature table 5 this should be acceptable because soil salt has more spatial heterogeneity and its movement is more unpredictable and unstable ren et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 liu et al 2021 during the model validation soil water content in 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm layers increased significantly in the freezing process while the increase in soil salt content was relatively small this indicates that except for convection there might be some unforeseen processes that existed in soil salt transport wu et al 2019 pointed out that high salt concentration at low temperature would cause salt expulsion from solution due to the decrease in salt saturation with temperature which may explain this result in addition some of the uncertainties in our simulations may be owing to the oversimplified assumption of soil deformation frost heave in the modified model we assumed that the changed soil bulk density and soil porosity due to frost heave returned to their initial values immediately after soil thawing however in practice the soil may take a while to return to normal conditions 5 3 comparison with traditional frost heave models in engineering science frost heave is always a hot research topic since soil deformation caused by frost heave may severely damage foundations and buildings in cold regions cheng et al 2022 li et al 2017 peterson and krantz 2003 many frost heave models were therefore developed in the past decades depending on how they describe the frost heave process these models can be broadly classed as the capillary model hydrodynamic model segregation potential model rigid ice model and empirical model peppin and style 2013 wu et al 2021 among them the most widely used models are the hydrodynamic model and the rigid ice model peppin and style 2013 however the hydrodynamic model and rigid ice model are challenging to apply directly in the study of agro eco hydrological processes in frozen soil for example the rigid ice model generally assumes a frozen fringe formation as soil freezes o neill and miller 1985 frost heave is thought to be caused by the formation and growth of ice lenses in the frozen fringe however the model application requires a large number of physical parameters including some difficult to determine mechanical properties bronfenbrener and bronfenbrener 2010 besides that the frozen fringe is still debatable as compared with experimental results peppin and style 2013 as for the hydrodynamic model it usually ignores the formation of frozen fringe the growth of ice lenses and the effects of overlying loads guymon et al 1993 henry et al 2005 but its approach is relatively simple as compared with the rigid ice model in the hydrodynamic model frost heave is believed to occur when the total of ice and liquid water volumes reaches a certain proportion of the initial soil porosity henry et al 2005 this assumption is consistent with that of our model however soil hydrothermal properties e g the soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity in the hydrodynamic model are still treated as constants which is considered as one of the primary causes of the simulation errors peppin and style 2013 in this study the soil bulk density change was used as an intermediate bridge to describe the effect of soil deformation on hydrothermal properties under freeze thaw conditions and satisfactory simulated results were obtained this research may offer some insight on how to improve the simulation capability of the traditional frost heave models in addition although we updated the shaw model and obtained satisfactory results there are still some aspects that could be improved for example in this study the campbell equation was used to describe the soil moisture release curve however the van genuchten equation is more widely used in soil moisture simulation than the campbell equation han et al 2010 we assumed that soil bulk density immediately returned to its initial condition after soil thawing however it can take a while for the soil to consolidate back to normal conditions afterward furthermore crop growth and nitrogen or phosphorus turnover processes were not included in the modified shaw model which may limit the model s applicability in non freeze thaw seasons therefore future model development should aim to couple the crop growth nitrogen or phosphorus turnover modules characterize soil deformation more accurately and develop the quantitative relationships between soil deformation frost heave and the changes in parameters of the van genuchten equation 6 conclusion to improve the simulation of soil water heat and salt transport dynamics in cold areas with considerable frost heave the shaw model was modified in this study with considering soil deformation frost heave and its impacts on soil hydrothermal properties which is believed the first attempt for such a kind of study the modified shaw model was then evaluated against experimental data collected at hid a typical frost susceptible area in the yrb the result showed that the modified shaw model could well capture soil water heat salt dynamics in the study area under freeze thaw conditions and performed much better than the original shaw model in simulating soil water heat dynamics moreover the modified shaw model predictions for the daily soil bulk density air entry potential saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity suggested that frost heave could alter soil hydrothermal properties significantly however uncertainties still existed in simulated soil water content temperature and salt content the modified shaw model underestimated soil water content in deep soil layers 60 100 cm at the end of the thawing period underestimated or overestimated soil temperature during the thawing period and overestimated soil salt content in frozen layers during the model validation the model errors might be attributed to ignoring lateral groundwater exchange the change in soil surface albedo and salt expulsion thus the model prediction capability could be further improved with a more accurate description of lateral groundwater exchange soil surface albedo variation and salt transport process our study implies that considering soil deformation and its impacts on soil hydrothermal properties can effectively improve the simulations of soil water heat and salt migration and the modified shaw model can be used as a decision tool for water management and salinity control of farmland in cold areas with significant frost heave in addition further study is still required to enhance the model applicability in non freeze thaw seasons by coupling with the modules of crop growth and other relevant processes e g nitrogen phosphorus and carbon turnover credit authorship contribution statement

2148,traditional agricultural or eco hydrological models usually ignore soil deformation and its impact on hydrothermal properties when simulating soil water heat and salt transport under freeze thaw conditions as a result significant errors may occur when these models are used in areas with considerable frost heave such as arid areas with shallow groundwater tables in this study the simultaneous heat and water model shaw model was modified with considering soil deformation and its impact on hydrothermal properties during the freeze thaw period the modified shaw model was then validated using the experimental data collected at the hetao irrigation district in the upper yellow river basin comparison between the simulated and observed data showed that the modified shaw model performed well and obviously better than the original shaw model in simulating the soil water heat and salt transport as compared with the shaw model the modified shaw model averagely decreased the rmse value by 37 5 and 23 for soil water content and soil temperature respectively the modified model can be used as a decision tool for water management and salinity control of farmland in cold areas with significant frost heave keywords freeze thaw soil deformation soil hydrothermal property soil water heat salt dynamics model modification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal soil freeze thaw is a widespread naturally occurring phenomenon in the mid and high latitudes and alpine regions over 50 of the land surface in the northern hemisphere experiences seasonal freeze thaw cycles to varying degrees hayashi 2013 wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 during the freeze thaw period temperature driven phase transitions in soil water can significantly alter soil hydrothermal properties and soil water potential hansson et al 2004 stuurop et al 2021 influencing soil water and salt transport and potentially leading to soil salinization iwata et al 2010 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 therefore accurate simulations of soil water heat and salt transport under freeze thaw conditions are critical to improve the strategies of agricultural water management and salinity control in cold regions especially in arid areas with shallow groundwater tables aasgt where soil salinization is a major hindrance to sustainablemanagement of agricultural systems lu et al 2019 liu et al 2022 wu et al 2019 in the past decades many numerical models e g shaw flerchinger 1989 coupmodel jasson and karlberg 2004 and hydrus 1d freezing module hansson et al 2004 have been developed and widely applied for the simulation of soil water heat and salt transport as well as other agricultural or eco hydrological processes in cold regions kurylyk and watanabe 2013 most of these models have included the following assumptions 1 darcy fluid flow in unsaturated ice free soils is similar to water flow in partially frozen soils 2 there is an impedance factor that reflects the effects of pore ice on hydraulic conductivity 3 soils are non deformable that is the frost heave and its influence on soil hydrothermal properties have not been accounted for 4 a generalized or extended clapeyron equation is used to describe the mutual relationships among liquid water ice and temperature under the freeze thaw condition where the ice pressure is commonly considered as zero gauge pressure and the reference pressure is barometric hansson et al 2004 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 smith et al 2019 stuurop et al 2021 yang and wang 2019 zheng et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 yu et al 2018 yu et al 2020 in addition by integrating the advanced treatments of the atmospheric surface layer with the soil profile simulations these models can also be used to simulate hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration snowmelt and runoff under freeze thaw conditions hansson et al 2004 wu et al 2019 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 in most cases if soil deformation e g frost heave is not evident during the freeze thaw period it is reasonable to assume soil is non deformable however soil deformation in aasgt is significant under freeze thaw conditions since shallow groundwater might promote an increased water flow to the freezing zone xie et al 2021 thereby enhancing frost heave guo et al 2018 hermansson and guthrie 2005 for example guo et al 2018 conducted a field experiment to investigate the concrete lining damage in field canals caused by frost heave they found afrost heave of up to 12 cm or about 12 of the frost depth in the hetao irrigation district hid a typical arid area with shallow groundwater tables in the upper yellow river basin yrb of northwest china significant soil deformation may notably change soil hydrothermal properties resulting in a considerable bias in estimating soil water heat salt dynamics alaoui et al 2011 liu et al 2022 sahin et al 2008 wuest 2009 for example liu et al 2022 found soil deformation significantly changed soil bulk density in three land use types in hid the largest soil bulk density change in farmland and natural land was 0 48 g cm 3 and 0 43 g cm 3 respectively correspondingly if soil bulk density change was not considered the estimated values of soil hydrothermal properties including soil volumetric heat capacity thermal conductivity air entry potential saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity might be significantly biased resulting in noticeable errors in simulating water movement heat transfer and salt transport in soils under freeze thaw conditions therefore it is necessary to modify the aforementioned models with the consideration of soil deformation and its impact on hydrothermal properties in aasgt the shaw model was originally developed to simulate soil freeze thaw processes and the complex transfer of water heat and solute within a one dimensional plant snow residue soil system flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 compared with other agricultural or eco hydrological models the shaw model also considered the impact of snow and residue on soil freeze thaw processes the dynamic effects of salt on soil freezing point depression and the vapor transfer induced by soil temperature change flerchinger et al 2003 hansson et al 2004 jasson and karlberg 2004 therefore it has been regarded as one of the most detailed models to study soil freeze thaw processes and is widely used to evaluate the impacts of management and climate on biological and hydrological processes hayhoe 1994 nassar et al 2000 li et al 2013 lu et al 2019 additionally the shaw model showed its flexibility for further development due to its open source code and the advantage of combining other modules thus in this study the shaw model is selected to develop the process that describes soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties the objectives of this study are 1 to expand the shaw model s ability of simulating soil water heat and salt transport in freeze thaw deformed soils with considering soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties and 2 to evaluate the performance of the modified shaw model by comparing its simulation results with the experimental data 2 model modification 2 1 shaw model description the shaw model is a one dimensional water heat synchronization model it is capable of simulating complex wintertime phenomena of freezing effects on water and solute migration solute effects on frost formation and frozen soil related runoff flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 in the model transfer within the soil profile is solved concurrently with the surface energy and water balance which includes solar and long wave radiation exchange evaporation and sensible and latent heat transfer flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 the technical documentation for the shaw model contains a detailed description of the model s principle and algorithms flerchinger 2000 flerchinger 2017 and the major processes of soil water heat and solute transport can be found in appendix a 2 2 model modification by considering soil deformation in the model modification we first used the approach proposed by liu et al 2022 to determine the impact of soil deformation on soil bulk density then the effects of soil deformation on soil hydrothermal properties were indirectly determined by the change in soil bulk density liu et al 2022 proposed a method for calculating soil bulk density change in freeze thaw deformed soil and demonstrated its feasibility through field experiments in their research they ignored the differences between soil saturated water content and soil porosity and assumed that frost heave only occurred as the total volume of liquid water and frozen water reached a certain proportion cp of the initial soil porosity thus when the total volume ice plus liquid exceeds the cp of the porosity the saturated water content and porosity of the deformed frozen soil can be determined as follows 1 n n θ i θ l c p n 2 θ s θ s θ i θ l c p n where n is the soil porosity of the deformed frozen soil n is the initial soil porosity θi is the soil volumetric ice content m3 m 3 θl is the liquid soil water content m3 m 3 θs is the saturated soil water content of the deformed frozen soil m3 m 3 θs is the initial saturated soil water content the specific gravity of soil is defined as its density to that of water and it is generally constant federico et al 2018 the following formula can be used to calculate soil specific gravity using soil bulk density and soil porosity 3 g s ρ b 1 n ρ b 1 n where gs is the specific gravity of soil ρ b and ρ b are the soil bulk density in non deformable and deformable situations respectively g cm 3 according to eq 3 the bulk density of the deformed frozen soil can be calculated using eq 4 campbell 1985 pointed out that soil hydraulic properties are closely related to soil bulk density the quantitative relationships between soil bulk density change and soil air entry potential and saturated hydraulic conductivity that campbell 1985 fitted are given in eqs 5 6 4 ρ b ρ b h 1 n h 1 n 5 ψ e ψ es g ρ b 1 3 0 67 b 6 k s 1 41 1 3 ρ b 1 3 b exp 6 9 m c 3 7 m si where ψe is the air entry potential m ψes is the air entry potential at standard bulk density 1 3 g cm 3 m b is a pore size distribution parameter ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 mc and msi are the percentage of clay and silt of soil respectively substituting eq 4 into eqs 5 and 6 can yield eqs 7 8 for adjusting the air entry potential and saturated water content for the deformed frozen soil the influences of soil bulk density change on soil thermal properties can be reflected by eqs a2 and a3 7 k s k s ρ b ρ b 1 3 b 8 ψ e ψ e ρ b ρ b 0 67 b where ks and ψe are the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 and air entry potential m of the deformed frozen soil respectively furthermore in the shaw model eq a8 is used to describe the equilibrium relationship between the temperature and water potential in freezing soils it is a simplified form of the clapeyron equation derived from eq 9 with the assumption that the gauge pressure in the ice is equal to zero the simplification is applicable in non deformable soils but it is not reasonable in deformable soils since frost heave may significantly change soil structure thus we included the gauge pressure in the ice in our model modification eq 9 is a generalized clapeyron equation that can be used in frozen soil and derived by loch 1978 by integrating the gibbs duhem equation 9 p w ρ l p i ρ i l f t k t where pw and pi are the equilibrium gauge pressures in frozen soil for the liquid water and ice phases respectively pa ρl and ρi are the liquid water and ice respectively kg m 3 lf is the latent heat of fusion j kg 1 tk is the soil temperature in kelvin k t is the soil temperature c when the gauge pressure in the ice is taken into account eq a8 can be rewritten as 10 ϕ π ψ p w g l f g t t k p i 0 917 g where ϕ is the total water potential m π is the osmotic potential m ψ is the soil matric potential m and g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 in this equation pi is equal to zero in the absence of frost heave otherwise pi is equal to the load on ice the load is equal to the sum of soil matrix weight and water weight of all soil layers above the ice lei et al 2020 assuming there are w soil layers above the ice the following formula can be used to calculate pi 11 p i a 1 w ρ ba z s a z s a θ la 0 917 θ ia ρ l g where ρba is the bulk density of the ath soil layer kg m 3 zsa is the height of the ath soil layer m θla is the liquid soil water content of the ath soil layer m3 m 3 θia is the soil volumetric ice content of the ath soil layer m3 m 3 soil deformation can also cause a change in node depth which can be calculated using eq 12 12 z s z s ρ b ρ b where zs is the node depth of deformed frozen soil m zs is the initial soil node depth m additionally in our model modification a maximum frost heave coefficient fr was considered to avoid the severe numerical problems and the ratio of zs to zs should not exceed fr 2 3 calculation procedure the modification was coded in program subroutines and functions which were then integrated into the shaw model the calculation procedure for the modified shaw model is shown in fig 1 in comparison with the shaw model the modified model will recalculate the soil bulk densities hydrothermal properties and node depths and then adjust soil liquid water content and ice content at the end of each time step accounting for the influence of soil deformation 3 materials and methods 3 1 study site 3 1 1 site description to evaluate the performance of the modified shaw model we chose farmland in hid 41 92 n 107 39 e at the upper yrb of china fig 2 as a case study the hid is one of china s three largest irrigation districts with an irrigated farmland of 0 57 mha xiong et al 2019 the climate in this area is a typically arid continental climate with only about 160 mm of annual precipitation however the average yearly evaporation 20 cm pan is around 2240 mm ren et al 2019 in winter the soil freeze thaw cycle generally begins in november and lasts until april or may of the following year with a frost depth of around 1 0 m due to the arid climate flat topography 0 2 slope and improper flood irrigation and drainage management groundwater table depths vary between 0 5 and 3 0 m during the year xiong et al 2019 causing a risk of soil salinization the location of the farmland in hid is shown in fig 2 the detailed soil physical properties of the farmland are presented in table 1 3 1 2 observation and data collection field observations were conducted over two winters from november 2018 to april 2019 and november 2019 to may 2020 respectively soil sampling was performed every 7 20 days to monitor changes in soil mass water content swc g g 1 and soil salt content ssc g kg 1 using a power drill diameter of 5 cm samples were gathered every 10 cm in the top 0 100 cm profile and every 20 cm below that until 120 cm temperature sensors with data recorded at 1 hour intervals and an accuracy of 0 5 c were initially installed at depths of 10 20 30 50 70 90 120 160 200 250 and 300 cm in a carbon fiber rod then the carbon fiber rod was then placed in the soil to measure soil temperature st a more detailed description of the experiments was provided in our previous studies liu et al 2021 2022 3 2 model set up calibration and validation the experimental data collected from november 18 2018 to april 26 2019 and november 9 2019 to may 5 2020 were used to calibrate and validate the modified shaw model respectively the initial soil profile was 120 cm deep with a spatial discretization of 2 cm for the top 20 cm and 10 cm for the remaining layers the atmospheric boundary condition was specified as the upper boundary condition for water flow and heat transport the linear interpolations of the water content measured at the 100 120 cm soil layer and the temperature measured at 120 cm depth were used as the lower boundary conditions of water flow and heat transport respectively the upper boundary condition for solute transport was defined as a zero flux boundary condition and the observed values specified the bottom boundary at 100 120 cm the solute does not degrade over time and absorption is not taken into account table 2 shows the initial values of soil parameters the initial values for the albedo of dry soil αd and the exponent for calculating the albedo of moist soil αa were the middle values of their respective ranges the initial soil hydraulic parameters ρb and θs were determined by measured data table 1 the initial soil hydraulic parameters ψe ks and b were estimated using the shaw model user manual based on soil bulk density and soil particle composition the percentages of sand silt and clay the initial solute transport parameters d0 τ and κ were adapted from lu et al 2019 the initial values of cp and fr were set at 1 0 and 1 125 respectively based on local frost heave studies liu et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 the parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using the local sensitivity analysis method as described by liang et al 2016 during the analysis only one soil parameter was altered at a time increased or decreased by 10 from its initial values while all other selected parameters remained constant the sensitivity of the parameters was judged by observing the changes in soil water content temperature and salt content in the 0 1 m soil profile after that all the above mentioned sensitive parameters were calibrated using a trial and error method the calibrated soil parameters for the modified shaw model are presented in table 3 the original shaw model was calibrated similarly to the modified shaw model except for parameters cp and fr the calibrated soil parameters for the original shaw model are presented in table 4 in addition for most soils soil saturated water content and soil porosity are quite close according to table 1 and eq 3 we can calculate that the soil specific gravity in the study area is around 2 75 0 01 thus in our simulations the soil specific gravity was set at 2 75 five statistical indicators including the regression coefficient b the coefficient of determination r2 the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse were employed in this study to assess the model performance the detailed calculation procedures of these five statistical indicators could be found in ren et al 2016 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis fig 3 presents the results of sensitivity analysis of the 12 soil parameters for different output variables the order of the sensitivity of these 12 soil parameters is various the order of sensitivity for soil water is ρb fr θs cp ψe b with the remaining parameters being insensitive the order of sensitivity for soil temperature is ρb fr cp ψe b αd while the other parameters are insensitive for soil salinity the sensitive parameters include fr cp b ψe θs ρb and ks and the order of sensitivity is fr cp b ψe θs ρb ks both fr and cp are relatively sensitive parameters for all the three output variables i e soil water temperature and salinity indicating that soil deformation parameters are critical in simulating the coupled transfer of soil water heat and salt during the soil freeze thaw period 4 2 simulated results the comparison of soil gravimetric water content temperature and salt content at different depths simulated by the modified shaw model and the original shaw model with measured values is presented in figs 4 6 and table 5 as shown in fig 4 the soil gravimetric water contents simulated by the modified shaw model were in good agreement with the measured data for the model calibration and validation the mre values were within 2 the rmse values were 0 02 and 0 03 g g 1 the r2 values were 0 85 and 0 76 the nse values were 0 85 and 0 71 and the b values were close to 1 0 respectively table 5 the modified shaw model had a better performance than the original shaw model in modeling soil water dynamics fig 4 for example during the model calibration soil water content for the 40 60 cm soil layer increased rapidly from 0 32 to 0 43 g g 1 from december 17 2018 to december 17 2018 the soil water content reached 0 43 g g 1 which was about 30 higher than the saturated soil gravimetric water content 0 32 g g 1 measured at the beginning of experiments indicating severe frost heave the modified shaw still accurately captured the variations of soil water content however the original shaw model significantly underestimated the variations of soil water content fig 4 similar to the soil water simulation the simulated soil temperature by the modified shaw model agreed well with the measured data indicating that the modified shaw model provided a more accurate simulation than the original shaw model during the calibration period fig 5 the modified shaw model produced rmse values of 0 64 c and 1 48 c r2 values of 0 96 and 0 98 nse values of 0 98 and 0 99 and b values of 0 96 and 1 17 respectively for the calibration and validation periods table 5 however the original shaw model simulation increased the rmse value to 1 03 c and 1 73 c for the model calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 in addition it should be noted that the soil temperature simulation during the freezing period was better than those during the thawing period for both models as shown in fig 6 the simulated soil salt contents using the modified shaw model were in a reasonable agreement with the measured ones during the calibration and validation periods mre 13 44 and 11 76 rmse 0 31 and 0 39 g kg 1 r2 0 52 and 0 84 nse 0 10and 0 81 and b 0 85 and 0 98 however the simulation accuracy of the modified shaw model during model calibration and validation was not always better than the original shaw model during the model validation the modified shaw model outperformed the original shaw model with the rmse value decreasing from 0 45 to 0 39 g kg 1 table 5 but during the model calibration the modified shaw model did not simulate soil salt dynamics as well as the original shaw model with the rmse value increasing from 0 32 to 0 33 g kg 1 table 5 5 discussion 5 1 the role of considering soil deformation and soil hydrothermal properties changes in modeling soil transport processes changes in soil parameters are one of the major sources of uncertainty in modeling soil transport processes moges et al 2021 this is particularly true for water heat and salt transport simulations in frozen soil as soil deformation produced by frost heave may notably change soil hydrothermal properties sahin et al 2008 wu et al 2021 used a hydro thermal mechanical coupled model to simulate soil frost heave subjected to cyclic freeze thaw conditions and they found that the changes in soil parameters such as soil pore distribution were the main cause of inconsistency between the experimental and simulated results liu et al 2022 conducted field experiments to investigate the soil water salt dynamics in hid and they found that in consideration of soil bulk density change could significantly improve the estimation accuracy of soil water salt dynamics thus they expected soil water heat and salt transport in hid could be better modeled by incorporating the effects of soil bulk density change into the hydrological model this outlook is confirmed by our study as depicted in section 4 2 the improvements of the simulated soil water content and soil temperature by the modified shaw model indicate that the consideration of soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties could result in a better simulation of soil water heat and salt transport in aasgt under freeze thaw conditions the modified shaw model can improve the simulation accuracy because soil deformation and its impact on soil hydrothermal properties are considered fig 7 a b illustrates the frost heave dynamics during the calibration and validation periods respectively it can be seen that frost heaves were significant in the study area with a maximum value of 10 2 cm for the calibration period and 6 0 cm for the validation period respectively the substantial frost heave caused significant changes in soil hydrothermal properties fig 8 fig 8 shows the dynamics of soil bulk density saturated soil water content saturated hydraulic conductivity and air entry potential of 40 60 cm soil layer during the model calibration period it can be seen that during the freezing period frost heave could significantly decrease soil bulk density which can subsequently increase soil air entry potential saturated soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity the simulated variations of soil bulk density air entry potential saturated soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were 10 35 13 and 61 respectively then during the thawing period these soil hydrothermal parameters gradually returned to their initial values as frost heave decreased in addition the variation of the simulated bulk density is consistent with that calculated by liu et al 2022 fig 8 a this further demonstrates the applicability of our modified model 5 2 uncertainties in simulating soil water heat and salt dynamics in model calibration and validation the modified shaw model slightly underestimated soil water variations in 60 100 cm soil layers at the end of the freeze thaw period fig 4 this result might be due to the fact that the lateral groundwater exchange was not considered in our simulation land use in hid is characterized by a fragmented distribution of various crop fields and natural vegetation patches due to a variety of irrigation activities topographic features and agronomic practices ren et al 2016 the freeze thaw process thus varies among various land uses because of the differences in initial soil water content land cover soil texture etc liu et al 2021 in spring as the soil thaws soil water accumulated in frozen layers may migrate downward raising the groundwater table however due to the variety of soil freeze thaw processes the time and rate of groundwater table rise in different land uses are different resulting in differences in groundwater tables between different land uses which in turn leads to lateral water exchange between different land uses wu et al 2019 farmland in hid generally takes a longer time to be completely thawed than other land uses such as woodland liu et al 2022 therefore there may be a lateral inflow of groundwater we thus recommended that detailed consideration on boundary conditions is necessary in modeling frozen soil fig 5 shows that soil temperature simulation during the freezing period is better than soil temperature simulation during the thawing period in model calibration and validation this result might be due to that the changes in soil surface albedo during the simulation by factors not accounted for by the model although the model accounts for soil water content influence on albedo in real practice soil surface albedo is prone to change when frozen soil thaws by other factors fujimaki et al 2003 wang et al 2014 for example fujimaki et al 2003 found that in arid areas as soil water evaporates in spring soil salt might crystallize on the soil surface increasing soil surface albedo wang et al 2014 found that wind erosion was very pronounced in arid and semiarid regions during late winter and early spring wind erosion could significantly change soil surface conditions and thus notably change soil surface albedo soil surface albedo plays an important role in soil heat transfer processes wang et al 2014 therefore a more accurate estimation of soil surface albedo would be helpful for improving the simulation of coupled water heat and salt transport in frozen soils the modified shaw model was slightly less effective in simulating soil salt transport as compared to the simulations of soil water and temperature table 5 this should be acceptable because soil salt has more spatial heterogeneity and its movement is more unpredictable and unstable ren et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 liu et al 2021 during the model validation soil water content in 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm layers increased significantly in the freezing process while the increase in soil salt content was relatively small this indicates that except for convection there might be some unforeseen processes that existed in soil salt transport wu et al 2019 pointed out that high salt concentration at low temperature would cause salt expulsion from solution due to the decrease in salt saturation with temperature which may explain this result in addition some of the uncertainties in our simulations may be owing to the oversimplified assumption of soil deformation frost heave in the modified model we assumed that the changed soil bulk density and soil porosity due to frost heave returned to their initial values immediately after soil thawing however in practice the soil may take a while to return to normal conditions 5 3 comparison with traditional frost heave models in engineering science frost heave is always a hot research topic since soil deformation caused by frost heave may severely damage foundations and buildings in cold regions cheng et al 2022 li et al 2017 peterson and krantz 2003 many frost heave models were therefore developed in the past decades depending on how they describe the frost heave process these models can be broadly classed as the capillary model hydrodynamic model segregation potential model rigid ice model and empirical model peppin and style 2013 wu et al 2021 among them the most widely used models are the hydrodynamic model and the rigid ice model peppin and style 2013 however the hydrodynamic model and rigid ice model are challenging to apply directly in the study of agro eco hydrological processes in frozen soil for example the rigid ice model generally assumes a frozen fringe formation as soil freezes o neill and miller 1985 frost heave is thought to be caused by the formation and growth of ice lenses in the frozen fringe however the model application requires a large number of physical parameters including some difficult to determine mechanical properties bronfenbrener and bronfenbrener 2010 besides that the frozen fringe is still debatable as compared with experimental results peppin and style 2013 as for the hydrodynamic model it usually ignores the formation of frozen fringe the growth of ice lenses and the effects of overlying loads guymon et al 1993 henry et al 2005 but its approach is relatively simple as compared with the rigid ice model in the hydrodynamic model frost heave is believed to occur when the total of ice and liquid water volumes reaches a certain proportion of the initial soil porosity henry et al 2005 this assumption is consistent with that of our model however soil hydrothermal properties e g the soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity in the hydrodynamic model are still treated as constants which is considered as one of the primary causes of the simulation errors peppin and style 2013 in this study the soil bulk density change was used as an intermediate bridge to describe the effect of soil deformation on hydrothermal properties under freeze thaw conditions and satisfactory simulated results were obtained this research may offer some insight on how to improve the simulation capability of the traditional frost heave models in addition although we updated the shaw model and obtained satisfactory results there are still some aspects that could be improved for example in this study the campbell equation was used to describe the soil moisture release curve however the van genuchten equation is more widely used in soil moisture simulation than the campbell equation han et al 2010 we assumed that soil bulk density immediately returned to its initial condition after soil thawing however it can take a while for the soil to consolidate back to normal conditions afterward furthermore crop growth and nitrogen or phosphorus turnover processes were not included in the modified shaw model which may limit the model s applicability in non freeze thaw seasons therefore future model development should aim to couple the crop growth nitrogen or phosphorus turnover modules characterize soil deformation more accurately and develop the quantitative relationships between soil deformation frost heave and the changes in parameters of the van genuchten equation 6 conclusion to improve the simulation of soil water heat and salt transport dynamics in cold areas with considerable frost heave the shaw model was modified in this study with considering soil deformation frost heave and its impacts on soil hydrothermal properties which is believed the first attempt for such a kind of study the modified shaw model was then evaluated against experimental data collected at hid a typical frost susceptible area in the yrb the result showed that the modified shaw model could well capture soil water heat salt dynamics in the study area under freeze thaw conditions and performed much better than the original shaw model in simulating soil water heat dynamics moreover the modified shaw model predictions for the daily soil bulk density air entry potential saturated water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity suggested that frost heave could alter soil hydrothermal properties significantly however uncertainties still existed in simulated soil water content temperature and salt content the modified shaw model underestimated soil water content in deep soil layers 60 100 cm at the end of the thawing period underestimated or overestimated soil temperature during the thawing period and overestimated soil salt content in frozen layers during the model validation the model errors might be attributed to ignoring lateral groundwater exchange the change in soil surface albedo and salt expulsion thus the model prediction capability could be further improved with a more accurate description of lateral groundwater exchange soil surface albedo variation and salt transport process our study implies that considering soil deformation and its impacts on soil hydrothermal properties can effectively improve the simulations of soil water heat and salt migration and the modified shaw model can be used as a decision tool for water management and salinity control of farmland in cold areas with significant frost heave in addition further study is still required to enhance the model applicability in non freeze thaw seasons by coupling with the modules of crop growth and other relevant processes e g nitrogen phosphorus and carbon turnover credit authorship contribution statement

2149,artificial recharge of groundwater is an effective technology for solving the shortage of water resources the clogging of porous media is a bottleneck that limits the application of this technology in this study percolation experiments in sand columns were conducted to investigate the influence of different types of biofilms on the deposition of suspended particles and clogging evolution during artificial recharge a unique aspect of this study is the consideration of biofilms coated on porous media when the clogging mechanisms of suspended particles in porous media are explored at the end of the recharge process the relative hydraulic conductivity k of the porous media in descending order was pseudomonas aeruginosa experimental group pa bacillus subtilis experimental group bs mixed microbial consortium experimental group mc suspended particle only group sp the suspended particles in sp moved more deeply into the sand column than those in bs pa and mc electron microscopy high throughput sequencing and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to identify the mechanisms governing clogging evolution under the influence of biofilm existence the presence of a biofilm not only alters the surface charge and physical roughness of the porous media but also affects the electrostatic interaction between the porous media and suspended particles biofilms combine tightly with suspended particles by binding and adhesion which can form tight biofilm particle aggregations compared with deposition of particle only in sp the biofilm particle aggregations on the surface of the porous media are more firm the biofilm coated on the surface of porous media occupied the pore vacancy and narrowed the void space compared with that in clean sand which induced physical straining as the thickness of biofilm coated on the sand surface increased the more suspended particles were deposited on the sand surface in pa these findings provide insights into clogging under the influence of biofilms and have implications for future field based artificial recharge abbreviations bs bacillus subtilis experimental group bsck bacillus subtilis control

hydraulic conductivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction overexploitation of groundwater has led to substantial drops in groundwater levels which may pose serious environmental problems to humans such as ground subsidence seawater intrusion and soil salinization de graaf et al 2019 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b yin et al 2022 the artificial recharge of groundwater is an effective technology for handling these issues and has been widely used around the world cui et al 2018 cui et al 2021 du et al 2022 li et al 2021 ye et al 2019 however during the groundwater recharge process the clogging of aquifer media reduces efficiencies or renders the recharge facilities completely disabled some researchers have investigated the causes of clogging wang et al 2020 including suspended particles fetzer et al 2017 song et al 2020 chemical sedimentation cui et al 2018 microorganism growth baveye et al 1998 xian et al 2019 production of extracellular polymeric substances eps xia et al 2014 xia et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 and entrapment of gas ye et al 2009 suspended particle accumulation and microbial growth are the most common causes for clogging which are revealed by a previous field survey dillon and pavelic 1996 most of previous studies have focused on suspended particle only or microbe only conditions during recharge the mechanisms influencing factors and evolution process of clogging in porous media owing to suspended particles only or microbes only have been clarified tang et al 2022 xia et al 2022 yang et al 2021 ye et al 2019 however microbes are ubiquitous in the natural environment suspended particles and microbes usually coexist in recharge water or in porous media in our previous study we elucidated the interactions between suspended particles and bacteria and their combined effects on the clogging mechanisms of porous media which is under the condition that suspended particles and bacteria coexist in recharge water wang et al 2020 cui et al 2021 reported that high concentration of suspended solids promoted the deposition of pseudomonas aeruginosa when they coexist in recharge water although some researchers have paid attention to the coexistence of microbes and suspended particles in recharge water few studies have explored the effects of biofilms that coated on porous media surface on the clogging mechanisms of suspended particles from recharge water in real world aquifers biofilms usually colonized on various solid surfaces in natural environment in the studies of artificial recharge the effects of biofilms on the clogging of suspended particles were ignored whereas great efforts have been made to explore the effects of biofilms on the transport behavior of colloids and engineered nanoparticles huangfu et al 2019 leon morales et al 2007 liu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 which will provide foundation for our research in previous studies to explore the influence of biofilms on the transport of nanoparticles such as graphene oxide carbon nanotubes and ag gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas putida and gram positive bacillus subtilis have been used as model microbes to form biofilms on porous media surface han et al 2016 he et al 2017 ramazanpour esfahani et al 2021 xiao and wiesner 2013 zhang et al 2021 a high degree of variability has been reported in the literature regarding the effects of different types of biofilms some researchers have revealed that irrespective of the bacterial type i e gram negative p aeruginosa or gram positive b subtilis graphene oxide nanoparticles have greater retention in biofilm coated sand than in clean sand he et al 2017 xiao and wiesner 2013 mitzel and tufenkji 2014 discovered that the retention of poly vinylpyrrolidone stabilized silver nanoparticles in biofilm coated sand decreased significantly compared to that in clean sand the characteristics of biofilms including areal coverage surface roughness and mean height affect particle retention he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 crampon et al 2018 found that biofilms modify water flow velocity in porous media favor the transport of large aggregates and decrease nanoparticles mobility as an important component of biofilms the secretions of microbes known as eps and mainly consisting of polysaccharides and proteins are highly likely to affect the transport of nanoparticles in porous media basnet et al 2016 he et al 2015 mitzel and tufenkji 2014 although there are a variety of studies on the transport behavior of nanoparticles in biofilm coated media the promotion or inhibition effect of biofilms on the transport and fate of nanoparticles is still under debate current researches mainly focus on the influence of biofilms on nanoparticle transportation and plastic particles which is crucial for nanotechnology applications in agricultural industrial and commercial products huangfu et al 2019 he et al 2020 the influence of biofilms in other fields such as artificial groundwater recharge has received less attention which is the research focus in this paper during the artificial groundwater recharge process the influence of microbes coated on the surface of porous media on the deposition of suspended particles and their combined effects on the permeability of porous media cannot be ignored because of the characteristic differences between suspended particles and nanoparticles or plastic particles in addition previous studies have focused on the effects of model biofilms on nanoparticle transport behavior or studied the clogging process when microbes and suspended particles coexist in recharge water whereas the influence of biofilm coated on porous media on the clogging of suspended particles has not yet been elucidated especially the naturally occurring biofilms that comprise diverse microbes which derived from the natural environment the interactions between biofilms and suspended particles during artificial recharge is worth exploring including thoroughly investigating the clogging mechanisms in the presence of biofilms on porous media surface and suspended particles from recharge water in this study we used well controlled laboratory column experiments to explore the evolution of suspended particles clogging influenced by different types of biofilms colonized on porous media surface including single strain and naturally occurring biofilms this study aimed to 1 analyze differences in different kinds of biofilms gram positive b subtilis and gram negative p aeruginosa biofilms and biofilms consisting of a mixed microbial consortium 2 compare the permeability characteristics of porous media influenced by biofilms and 3 unveil the clogging mechanisms of suspended particles under the complex interplay of suspended particles and porous media coated by biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of porous media and suspended particles quartz sand sio2 96 loss on ignition 0 40 xiamen iso standard sand co ltd xiamen china between 0 50 and 1 00 mm was used as the porous media the sand was pretreated for 24 h with 0 25 mol l hcl to remove trace metals and then was neutralized with 0 25 mol l naoh and ultrapure water yang et al 2013 the sand was then burned at 550 c for 2 h to remove organic materials kaolin shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china with particle sizes smaller than 2 μm was used to simulate suspended particles before use quartz sand and kaolin were sterilized using ultraviolet light suspended particles were prepared at a concentration of 100 nephelometric turbidity units ntu 2 2 bacteria cultivation and nutrient solution two typical model bacteria gram positive b subtilis and gram negative p aeruginosa and a microbial consortium were used as inocula to form biofilms on sand surfaces bacillus subtilis cctcc ab 91095 and pseudomonas aeruginosa cctcc ab 93108 were purchased from the china center for type culture collection cctcc the microbial consortium was sampled from aquifers in the dagu river qingdao shandong province china e120 318974 n36 715616 at a groundwater level of 4 28 m bacillus subtilis pseudomonas aeruginosa and the mixed microbial consortium were cultivated to stationary phase in an enriched liquid medium containing peptone 0 5 g l beef extract 1 g l and nacl 0 5 g l wang et al 2020 2 3 experimental setup and preparation of biofilm coated sand the experimental setup mainly consisted of a plexiglas column water head control device peristaltic pump stirrer water tank and pressure plate fig 1 a the water head at different positions in sand column was measured by the pressure plate the column was 22 cm long and 5 cm in internal diameter the columns were packed with wet sand of equal volume density then the sand columns were saturated with sterilized milli q water from the bottom to top for 24 h to remove the residual gas in our study each biofilm group was subjected to identical experiments in triplicate after the pressure plate reading stabilized the value was recorded to calculate the initial hydraulic conductivity when cultured to the stable stage 10 ml of the bacterial solution was diluted with 90 ml of lb liquid medium the diluted solution was made to flow into the sand column from top to bottom with a constant water head δh 10 cm for 6 h and then flow was changed to the opposite direction at 1 0 ml min for 6 h this step was repeated twice to ensure uniform biofilm distribution on the sand surface after the biofilm coating was completed the loosely bound biofilm was eluted with a 10 mm nacl solution 2 4 column transport experiments synthetic recharge water was then introduced from the top of the column with a constant water head δh 10 cm after complete saturation the concentration of suspended particles in synthetic recharge water was 100 ntu different types of biofilm coated sand were used in the experiments and the experimental design is shown in fig 1 b including 1 b subtilis control group bsck b subtilis biofilm coated sand group in which recharge water contained no suspended particles as the control group 2 b subtilis experimental group bs b subtilis biofilm coated sand group in which recharge water contained suspended particles 3 p aeruginosa control group pack p

control group 6 microbial consortium experimental group mc microbial consortium biofilm coated sand group in which recharge water contained suspended particles and 7 suspended particle only group sp non biofilm coated sand in which recharge water contained suspended particles 2 5 analytic methods 2 5 1 hydraulic conductivity saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is derived from darcy s law 1 k s 4

initial hydraulic conductivity m d and ks is the hydraulic conductivity at any time m d 2 5 2 analysis of zeta potential biomass and suspended particle deposition biomass on the porous media was determined using the loss on ignition method described by tripathi et al 2012 the deposition of the suspended particles in the porous media was determined by gravimetric methods which was obtained by calculating the mass difference of sand samples before and after recharge wang et al 2020 zeta ζ potential was measured using the zetasizer zetasizer nano malvern 2 5 3 surface microtopography of the sand sample 1 electron microscopy the sand used in the column was sampled before recharge experiment after biofilm coating process was completed and at the end of the recharge experiment to maintain the original appearance of the samples 2 g sand sample was directly immersed in 4 w v glutaraldehyde kept at 4 c for 24 h to complete chemical fixation and was then dried in liquid co2 the surface of the dried sample was coated with a metal film and then the sand sample was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy tescan vega3 tescan china ltd 2 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to determine the thickness of biofilms formed on the sand surface propidium iodide syto 9 dye and sterilized ultrapure water were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 100 after the biofilm coating process was completed the sand sample was dyed with the premixed solution the dyed sand was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope leica tcs sp8 sand samples dyed with propidium iodide and syto 9 were observed using clsm with excitation wavelengths of 535 617 nm and 485 498 nm respectively based on the observation results a three dimensional spatial structure of the biofilm was constructed according to the spatial structure results the biofilm thickness of each sand grain was determined by averaging ten thickness measurements evenly distributed around the grain 2 5 4 high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the characteristics of the microbes dna was extracted from the microbial sample using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca and detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the concentration and quality of the dna were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer dna samples 30 ng were amplified by polymerase chain reaction transgen ap221 02 there were three replicates for each microbial sample and the products of pcr amplification were detected using 2 agarose gel electrophoresis the dna insert was dual end sequenced using an illumina miseq sequencer san diego ca 2 5 5 data analysis two way analysis of variance anova and a two sided t test were used to analyze whether differences were significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the biofilm on hydraulic conductivity relative hydraulic conductivity k was used to evaluate the degree of clogging the variation in k in different groups over time is shown in fig 2 the k in the control groups bsck pack and mcck did not change over time compared to that in the experimental groups which indicates that the biofilms coated on quartz sand in bsck pack and mcck were stable the initial values of hydraulic conductivity of the porous media in bs pa mc and sp clean sand were 0 258 0 250 0 262 and 0 280 cm s respectively from 0 to 15 h the k of all experimental groups decreased with time and was in the order of mc pa sp bs from 15 to 42 h the k of the porous media in pa mc and sp decreased rapidly over time whereas k reduction in bs slowed down from 15 to 42 h k of the porous media in the with biofilm groups pa bs and mc was reduced more rapidly than that in the without biofilm group sp from 42 to 66 h k of the porous media in the experimental groups showed a declining trend over time at the end of recharge the results of k in descending order were pa bs mc sp with approximate values of 0 18 0 24 0 28 and 0 32 respectively the results indicated that the existence of biofilm accelerated the hydraulic conductivity decline of porous media with time and promoted clogging evolution different types of biofilms had different influences on the hydraulic conductivity of porous media and the causes is clarified in section 3 4 fig 3 shows the k variation of the different layers in the sand column over time fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c show that k in the with biofilm groups bs pa and mc declined along the column over time and the rate of decrease in k was slowed down from the top to bottom layers with recharge processing at the end of the recharge process the k values of the surface 0 1 cm and second 1 3 cm layers in bs and pa were reduced to less than 0 05 the k of the surface 0 1 cm and the second 1 3 cm layers in mc was higher than that in bs and pa with a value of 0 10 and 0 13 respectively the k of the bottom two layers in pa showed a smaller decline over time than those in bs and mc the k values of the two surface layers in pa declined much more rapidly over time than those in bs and mc the results showed that clogging in pa is prone to occur in the upper layers however the k of the porous media in sp declined over time with obvious fluctuations the k of the bottom two layers 11 17 cm and 17 23 cm in sp showed a sharper decline over time than those in bs pa and mc the results indicate that the suspended particles in sp may move into the sand column more deeply than those in bs pa and mc based on the above analysis the k of different layers in the four experimental groups bs pa mc and sp showed a decreasing trend over time but at different rates the initial values of hydraulic conductivity in different layers from the inlet to outlet in the sand column were given in fig 4 the initial values of hydraulic conductivity were basically constant from the inlet to the outlet along the sand column which indicates uniform distribution of the biofilm in different layers 3 2 deposition of suspended particles in clean and biofilm coated sand suspended particles deposited on the sand surfaces are shown in fig 5 the amount of suspended particle deposition on the surface layer in the bs pa and mc groups was higher than that in the other layers in the corresponding groups with values of 30 93 36 44 and 23 92 mg g sand respectively the suspended particles accumulated on the sand of the bs pa and mc groups showed a declining trend along the sand column from the inlet to outlet the bottom layer 17 23 cm had the lowest suspended particle accumulation among the layers in the same groups with values of 10 83 4 68 and 6 34 mg g sand in the bs pa and mc groups respectively the amount of particle deposition in the bottom layer was reduced by 64 99 87 18 73 50 and 49 92 compared to the surface layer in the bs pa mc and sp groups respectively this indicates that the particles in the biofilm coated groups tended to deposit on the surface layer compared to the sp group for the sp group the deposition distribution of suspended particles was considerable different from that in the other three groups at the end of the recharge process the amount of suspended particles from the surface 0 1 cm to the third 3 5 cm layer decreased however the suspended particle accumulation of the fourth layer had an obvious rise and from the fourth to the bottom layer also showed a decreasing trend which is an interesting phenomenon observed in our study that can also be verified by the variation in the hydraulic conductivity described in section 3 1 in general under the condition of suspended particle with a size smaller than 2 μm the existence of biofilm coated on the porous media promoted the deposition of suspended particles on the sand surface whereas in the sand column without biofilm coverage suspended particles migrated deeper into the sand column and parts of the suspended particles moved out of the column with the water flow 3 3 characteristics of porous media and microbes 3 3 1 microbial community composition the microbial consortium was collected from the groundwater and then cultured fig 6 shows the diversity and dominant species of the mixed microbial consortium used in our experiment as shown in fig 6 the dominant species included methylophilus methyloversatilis rheinheimera exiguobacterium sphingobium pseudomonas novosphingobium sphingopyxis aeromonas enterococcus klebsiella acinetobacter rhodococcus raoultella vogesella flavobacterium azospirillum microvirgula and novispirillum the composition of the mc microbial community can effectively simulate the actual groundwater environment 3 3 2 surface morphology of the porous media the surface properties of the porous media are crucial for the transport and deposition of suspended particles the surface topography of the porous media in different experimental designs is shown in fig 7 the sand was clean and smooth without biofilm coating fig 7 g when the sand was coated with b subtilis and p aeruginosa the surface of the sand was covered by a sticky and dense biofilm fig 7 a and 7 b as shown in fig 7 c the sand covered by the microbial consortium biofilm was rougher than bare sand the biofilm was not as integrated as that in bsck and pack and was less dense than that in bsck and pack this was attributed to the difference in nutrient utilization between the mixed microbial consortium and b subtilis and p aeruginosa to quantify the difference in biofilm thickness clsm combined with fluorescent staining was used to determine the biofilm thickness formed on the sand surface the average biofilm thicknesses of sand samples collected from the 0 1 cm sand column in bsck pack and mcck were 186 67 10 226 67 5 and 160 00 10 μm respectively compared with the sand diameter of 0 50 1 00 mm the difference in biofilms among the different groups was relatively small the biomass of the different layers of the sand column was measured to examine the biofilm distribution of the sand column except for the biomass of the bottom two layers the average biomass of the top four layers in bsck pack and mcck was 0 42 0 46 0 50 0 58 and 0 40 0 45 mg g sand respectively fig 8 the difference in biomass distribution among different layers in this study was relatively small compared with the reported biomass of b subtilis 2 33 2 58 mg g sand and p putida 1 36 1 77 mg g sand biofilms he et al 2015 the relatively uniform distribution of biomass was attributed to the modification of the biofilm coating process and duration which weakened the effects of biomass distribution differences on porous media the results directly demonstrated that biofilm coating on sand surfaces would narrow the pore size thereby greatly inducing physical straining this explains the enhanced deposition of suspended particles in the presence of biofilms during the artificial recharging process 3 3 3 zeta potential the surface charges of the suspended particles and quartz sand with or without biofilm are listed in table 1 the zeta potential values of clean quartz sand suspended particles b subtilis p aeruginosa and microbial consortium were 27 70 0 2 10 19 0 4 18 27 0 4 31 2 0 4 and 29 06 0 2 mv respectively table 1 bacillus subtilis increased the zeta potential of quartz sand whereas p aeruginosa and the microbial consortium decreased the zeta potential of quartz sand 3 3 4 composition of eps extracellular polymeric substances account for 80 85 of the biofilm volume the composition of eps secreted by microbes in different groups is vital for analyzing the variation in k the polysaccharide content of different layers in bs pa and mc are shown in fig 9 the polysaccharides content in pa was higher than that in bs with a difference of 10 01 5 08 μg g sand the polysaccharide content in pa was higher than that in mc with a difference of 9 53 4 57 μg g sand the polysaccharide content in mc was slightly higher than that in bs at the same layer the difference in polysaccharide content between the layers in the same experimental group was not significant the protein content of the different layers in bs pa and mc are shown in fig 10 the protein content of the different layers in bs pa and mc were within the range of 12 86 15 02 μg g sand the difference in protein content between the groups was small and the differences between layers within the same group were very minor the characteristics of the eps may affect the transport of suspended particles therefore composition analysis of eps in the different groups is vital 3 4 mechanisms of clogging under the coexistence of biofilm and suspended particles 3 4 1 analysis of deposition rate the clogging of porous media was attributed to the suspended particles deposition meanwhile particle deposition rate can reflect the change of dominant mechanisms the particle concentration in the influent and the effluent was measured over time in this experiment the accumulated suspended particle can be calculated by particle concentration in the effluent according to a mathematical model for simulating particle deposition reported by zheng et al 2014 particle deposition rate can be calculated by the derivative of accumulated particle deposition eq 3 the particle deposition rate was shown in fig 11 3 r c t where r is particle deposition rate mg g h c is accumulated amount of suspended particles per unit sand mg g sand t is the recharge time h according to deposition rate of suspended particles fig 11 the whole process was divided into three stages from 0 to about 15 h stage i the deposition rate in descending order was bs sp pa mc from 15 to 42 h stage ii the deposition rate in pa increased rapidly while the particle deposition rate in bs and sp decreased over time after about 42 h stage iii the particle deposition rate in descending order was pa bs mc sp in different groups the deposition rate affects the hydraulic conductivity meanwhile the deposition rate was influenced by zeta potential of porous media biofilm thickness of the sand eps composition in the biofilm polysaccharides concentration and protein concentration the values of these related parameters were given in fig 12 deposition rate of suspended particles is a bridge that links the hydraulic conductivity and the dominant process of clogging at different stages one or more of the factors played a dominant role and all of these factors exist throughout the whole recharge process which contribute to the variation in particle deposition rate 3 4 2 influence of porous media surface properties on clogging the surface properties of the porous media were mainly including zeta potential and biofilm roughness the presence of different bacterial strains changed the zeta potential of the porous medium to some extent bacillus subtilis decreased the negative charge of porous media whereas p aeruginosa and the microbial consortium slightly increased the negative charge of porous media the presence of biofilm not only alters the surface charge of the porous media but also affects the electrostatic interaction between the porous media and suspended particles fig 13 at stage i the suspended particles enter the porous medium with water flow when the distance between the suspended particles and porous media is large they are affected by van der waals forces although the distance was shortened with the water flow the electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles and porous media was dominant the electrostatic repulsion between the different biofilm coated sands and suspended particles decreased in the order pa mc sp bs if we only take electrostatic repulsion into consideration suspended particles in bs were easier to deposit on the sand column than that in the other groups although the electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles and porous media in pa was higher than that in mc the decrease in k in pa was faster than that in mc this indicates there are other factors that influence suspended particle deposition rate by combined analysis of the other influential factors including biofilm thickness of the sand eps composition in the biofilm polysaccharides concentration protein concentration and deposition rate in fig 11 and fig 12 the biofilm thickness also plays an important role at this stage the more details of biofilm thickness are discussed in section3 4 4 the physical roughness of sand surfaces has been documented to play a key role in suspended particle deposition the surface topography of the sand coated with different types of biofilms is shown in fig 7 the sand coated with b subtilis and p aeruginosa was covered by dense and sticky biofilms whereas the sand covered by the mixed microbial consortium biofilm seemed much more uneven and nonhomogeneous the sand surfaces were modified by different types of biofilms and the physical roughness of the sand surfaces resulted in differences the sand in the mc may have a greater ability to retain suspended particles in terms of physical roughness he et al 2017 huangfu et al 2019 3 4 3 binding interaction binding between the biofilms and suspended particles also be an important mechanism fig 13 at stage ii the sand surfaces in the different groups were covered by suspended particles and the deposition of suspended particles led to a change of the sand surface charge in particular for sp the downward trend of k slowed down over time and the hydraulic conductivity of the different layers of the sand column fluctuated significantly over time fig 3 simultaneously the suspended particles in the effluent flow increased temporarily and were measured with a diameter range of 550 nm which indicated that the suspended particles migrated deeper into the column and part of the suspended particles moved out of the sand column this phenomenon was not observed in groups other than the sp group the biofilm consists of microbes and eps the eps mainly consists of polysaccharides and proteins among which the acetyl group of the extracellular polysaccharides enhances the adhesion of suspended particles to biofilms flemming and wingender 2001 according to fig 11 at stage ii the deposition rate in pa increased rapidly while the deposition rate in bs and sp decreased the order of deposition rate in different experimental groups has high correlation with the order of eps content the polysaccharides concentration of eps in pa was higher than those in the other groups fig 12 which indicates that the adhesion between the biofilm and suspended particles in pa was stronger than that in the other groups thus binding by eps plays a key role at this stage while the other two mechanisms still exist at stage ii the hydraulic conductivity of porous media in pa declined much more sharply over time than that in the other experimental groups in general suspended particles have stronger adhesion to sand coated by biofilm than sand without biofilm coating in addition eps can flocculate kaolin particles and the available carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of eps have a very high binding capacity aljuboori et al 2015 bezawada et al 2013 more et al 2014 the main components polysaccharides and proteins of eps contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated quartz sand columns he et al 2020 in the suspended particle only group the suspended particles that accumulated on the sand surface were not firm and could be easily washed out with water flow in addition the deposition of suspended particles narrowed the pores of porous media in the sand column which increased the water velocity the absence of biofilms and the enhanced scouring of water contributed to the outflow of suspended particles and fluctuations of hydraulic conductivity in the biofilm coated groups the biofilm coated on the sand surface could bind suspended particles and further stabilize the matrix by providing additional sites for bridging with suspended particles which made the suspended particles tightly bound to the biofilm the tightly bound suspended particles and biofilm aggregations can remarkably enhance clogging durability kim and kwon 2022 wei et al 2019 3 4 4 physical straining physical straining was influenced by biofilm thickness which was mainly related to the microbes types in different groups although the electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles and the porous media in pa was slightly higher than that in mc the decrease in k in pa was faster than that in mc fig 2 these results were related to the difference of biofilm thickness the biofilm in pa was thicker than that in mc physical straining is another dominant factor that influences suspended particle deposition and hydraulic conductivity variations in porous media fig 13 the presence of biofilm changes the surface roughness of quartz sand which plays a critical role in suspended particle deposition even under unfavorable electrostatic conditions in addition the biofilm coated on the surface of the porous media occupied the pore vacancies which narrowed the void space compared with that in clean sand the biofilm thickness coated on the sand surface in descending order was pa bs mc fig 12 thus the biofilm coated on the sand surface in pa has greater retention ability for suspended particles which is one of the causes for the greater decline in hydraulic conductivity in pa than in the other groups 4 conclusions in this study artificial recharge of groundwater was simulated using well conducting sand columns and the influence of biofilms coated on the surface of porous media on the clogging process of suspended particles was investigated among the experimental groups the rate of decrease in relative hydraulic conductivity in descending order was pa bs mc sp biofilms coated on porous media exacerbate clogging in the biofilm coated groups the biofilm coated on the sand surface could tightly bind the suspended particles the tightly bound suspended particle biofilm aggregations enhance clogging durability for the without biofilm groups the hydraulic conductivity of the different layers of the sand column fluctuated significantly the suspended particles migrated deeper into the column and some of the suspended particles moved out of the sand column in the without biofilm group the change in zeta potential and physical roughness of porous media binding and adhesion by microbes and eps and physical straining caused by biofilms were the main influencing factors contributing to the clogging process of suspended particles in the biofilm coated porous media which led to the differences in k in different groups credit authorship

2149,artificial recharge of groundwater is an effective technology for solving the shortage of water resources the clogging of porous media is a bottleneck that limits the application of this technology in this study percolation experiments in sand columns were conducted to investigate the influence of different types of biofilms on the deposition of suspended particles and clogging evolution during artificial recharge a unique aspect of this study is the consideration of biofilms coated on porous media when the clogging mechanisms of suspended particles in porous media are explored at the end of the recharge process the relative hydraulic conductivity k of the porous media in descending order was pseudomonas aeruginosa experimental group pa bacillus subtilis experimental group bs mixed microbial consortium experimental group mc suspended particle only group sp the suspended particles in sp moved more deeply into the sand column than those in bs pa and mc electron microscopy high throughput sequencing and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to identify the mechanisms governing clogging evolution under the influence of biofilm existence the presence of a biofilm not only alters the surface charge and physical roughness of the porous media but also affects the electrostatic interaction between the porous media and suspended particles biofilms combine tightly with suspended particles by binding and adhesion which can form tight biofilm particle aggregations compared with deposition of particle only in sp the biofilm particle aggregations on the surface of the porous media are more firm the biofilm coated on the surface of porous media occupied the pore vacancy and narrowed the void space compared with that in clean sand which induced physical straining as the thickness of biofilm coated on the sand surface increased the more suspended particles were deposited on the sand surface in pa these findings provide insights into clogging under the influence of biofilms and have implications for future field based artificial recharge abbreviations bs bacillus subtilis experimental group bsck bacillus subtilis control

hydraulic conductivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction overexploitation of groundwater has led to substantial drops in groundwater levels which may pose serious environmental problems to humans such as ground subsidence seawater intrusion and soil salinization de graaf et al 2019 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b yin et al 2022 the artificial recharge of groundwater is an effective technology for handling these issues and has been widely used around the world cui et al 2018 cui et al 2021 du et al 2022 li et al 2021 ye et al 2019 however during the groundwater recharge process the clogging of aquifer media reduces efficiencies or renders the recharge facilities completely disabled some researchers have investigated the causes of clogging wang et al 2020 including suspended particles fetzer et al 2017 song et al 2020 chemical sedimentation cui et al 2018 microorganism growth baveye et al 1998 xian et al 2019 production of extracellular polymeric substances eps xia et al 2014 xia et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 and entrapment of gas ye et al 2009 suspended particle accumulation and microbial growth are the most common causes for clogging which are revealed by a previous field survey dillon and pavelic 1996 most of previous studies have focused on suspended particle only or microbe only conditions during recharge the mechanisms influencing factors and evolution process of clogging in porous media owing to suspended particles only or microbes only have been clarified tang et al 2022 xia et al 2022 yang et al 2021 ye et al 2019 however microbes are ubiquitous in the natural environment suspended particles and microbes usually coexist in recharge water or in porous media in our previous study we elucidated the interactions between suspended particles and bacteria and their combined effects on the clogging mechanisms of porous media which is under the condition that suspended particles and bacteria coexist in recharge water wang et al 2020 cui et al 2021 reported that high concentration of suspended solids promoted the deposition of pseudomonas aeruginosa when they coexist in recharge water although some researchers have paid attention to the coexistence of microbes and suspended particles in recharge water few studies have explored the effects of biofilms that coated on porous media surface on the clogging mechanisms of suspended particles from recharge water in real world aquifers biofilms usually colonized on various solid surfaces in natural environment in the studies of artificial recharge the effects of biofilms on the clogging of suspended particles were ignored whereas great efforts have been made to explore the effects of biofilms on the transport behavior of colloids and engineered nanoparticles huangfu et al 2019 leon morales et al 2007 liu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 which will provide foundation for our research in previous studies to explore the influence of biofilms on the transport of nanoparticles such as graphene oxide carbon nanotubes and ag gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas putida and gram positive bacillus subtilis have been used as model microbes to form biofilms on porous media surface han et al 2016 he et al 2017 ramazanpour esfahani et al 2021 xiao and wiesner 2013 zhang et al 2021 a high degree of variability has been reported in the literature regarding the effects of different types of biofilms some researchers have revealed that irrespective of the bacterial type i e gram negative p aeruginosa or gram positive b subtilis graphene oxide nanoparticles have greater retention in biofilm coated sand than in clean sand he et al 2017 xiao and wiesner 2013 mitzel and tufenkji 2014 discovered that the retention of poly vinylpyrrolidone stabilized silver nanoparticles in biofilm coated sand decreased significantly compared to that in clean sand the characteristics of biofilms including areal coverage surface roughness and mean height affect particle retention he et al 2015 roche et al 2017 crampon et al 2018 found that biofilms modify water flow velocity in porous media favor the transport of large aggregates and decrease nanoparticles mobility as an important component of biofilms the secretions of microbes known as eps and mainly consisting of polysaccharides and proteins are highly likely to affect the transport of nanoparticles in porous media basnet et al 2016 he et al 2015 mitzel and tufenkji 2014 although there are a variety of studies on the transport behavior of nanoparticles in biofilm coated media the promotion or inhibition effect of biofilms on the transport and fate of nanoparticles is still under debate current researches mainly focus on the influence of biofilms on nanoparticle transportation and plastic particles which is crucial for nanotechnology applications in agricultural industrial and commercial products huangfu et al 2019 he et al 2020 the influence of biofilms in other fields such as artificial groundwater recharge has received less attention which is the research focus in this paper during the artificial groundwater recharge process the influence of microbes coated on the surface of porous media on the deposition of suspended particles and their combined effects on the permeability of porous media cannot be ignored because of the characteristic differences between suspended particles and nanoparticles or plastic particles in addition previous studies have focused on the effects of model biofilms on nanoparticle transport behavior or studied the clogging process when microbes and suspended particles coexist in recharge water whereas the influence of biofilm coated on porous media on the clogging of suspended particles has not yet been elucidated especially the naturally occurring biofilms that comprise diverse microbes which derived from the natural environment the interactions between biofilms and suspended particles during artificial recharge is worth exploring including thoroughly investigating the clogging mechanisms in the presence of biofilms on porous media surface and suspended particles from recharge water in this study we used well controlled laboratory column experiments to explore the evolution of suspended particles clogging influenced by different types of biofilms colonized on porous media surface including single strain and naturally occurring biofilms this study aimed to 1 analyze differences in different kinds of biofilms gram positive b subtilis and gram negative p aeruginosa biofilms and biofilms consisting of a mixed microbial consortium 2 compare the permeability characteristics of porous media influenced by biofilms and 3 unveil the clogging mechanisms of suspended particles under the complex interplay of suspended particles and porous media coated by biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of porous media and suspended particles quartz sand sio2 96 loss on ignition 0 40 xiamen iso standard sand co ltd xiamen china between 0 50 and 1 00 mm was used as the porous media the sand was pretreated for 24 h with 0 25 mol l hcl to remove trace metals and then was neutralized with 0 25 mol l naoh and ultrapure water yang et al 2013 the sand was then burned at 550 c for 2 h to remove organic materials kaolin shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china with particle sizes smaller than 2 μm was used to simulate suspended particles before use quartz sand and kaolin were sterilized using ultraviolet light suspended particles were prepared at a concentration of 100 nephelometric turbidity units ntu 2 2 bacteria cultivation and nutrient solution two typical model bacteria gram positive b subtilis and gram negative p aeruginosa and a microbial consortium were used as inocula to form biofilms on sand surfaces bacillus subtilis cctcc ab 91095 and pseudomonas aeruginosa cctcc ab 93108 were purchased from the china center for type culture collection cctcc the microbial consortium was sampled from aquifers in the dagu river qingdao shandong province china e120 318974 n36 715616 at a groundwater level of 4 28 m bacillus subtilis pseudomonas aeruginosa and the mixed microbial consortium were cultivated to stationary phase in an enriched liquid medium containing peptone 0 5 g l beef extract 1 g l and nacl 0 5 g l wang et al 2020 2 3 experimental setup and preparation of biofilm coated sand the experimental setup mainly consisted of a plexiglas column water head control device peristaltic pump stirrer water tank and pressure plate fig 1 a the water head at different positions in sand column was measured by the pressure plate the column was 22 cm long and 5 cm in internal diameter the columns were packed with wet sand of equal volume density then the sand columns were saturated with sterilized milli q water from the bottom to top for 24 h to remove the residual gas in our study each biofilm group was subjected to identical experiments in triplicate after the pressure plate reading stabilized the value was recorded to calculate the initial hydraulic conductivity when cultured to the stable stage 10 ml of the bacterial solution was diluted with 90 ml of lb liquid medium the diluted solution was made to flow into the sand column from top to bottom with a constant water head δh 10 cm for 6 h and then flow was changed to the opposite direction at 1 0 ml min for 6 h this step was repeated twice to ensure uniform biofilm distribution on the sand surface after the biofilm coating was completed the loosely bound biofilm was eluted with a 10 mm nacl solution 2 4 column transport experiments synthetic recharge water was then introduced from the top of the column with a constant water head δh 10 cm after complete saturation the concentration of suspended particles in synthetic recharge water was 100 ntu different types of biofilm coated sand were used in the experiments and the experimental design is shown in fig 1 b including 1 b subtilis control group bsck b subtilis biofilm coated sand group in which recharge water contained no suspended particles as the control group 2 b subtilis experimental group bs b subtilis biofilm coated sand group in which recharge water contained suspended particles 3 p aeruginosa control group pack p

control group 6 microbial consortium experimental group mc microbial consortium biofilm coated sand group in which recharge water contained suspended particles and 7 suspended particle only group sp non biofilm coated sand in which recharge water contained suspended particles 2 5 analytic methods 2 5 1 hydraulic conductivity saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is derived from darcy s law 1 k s 4 q δ l π d 2 δ h where q is the flow rate m3 d δl is the distance between the two manometric tubes along the column m δh is the hydraulic head difference at a distance of δl m and d is the inner

initial hydraulic conductivity m d and ks is the hydraulic conductivity at any time m d 2 5 2 analysis of zeta potential biomass and suspended particle deposition biomass on the porous media was determined using the loss on ignition method described by tripathi et al 2012 the deposition of the suspended particles in the porous media was determined by gravimetric methods which was obtained by calculating the mass difference of sand samples before and after recharge wang et al 2020 zeta ζ potential was measured using the zetasizer zetasizer nano malvern 2 5 3 surface microtopography of the sand sample 1 electron microscopy the sand used in the column was sampled before recharge experiment after biofilm coating process was completed and at the end of the recharge experiment to maintain the original appearance of the samples 2 g sand sample was directly immersed in 4 w v glutaraldehyde kept at 4 c for 24 h to complete chemical fixation and was then dried in liquid co2 the surface of the dried sample was coated with a metal film and then the sand sample was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy tescan vega3 tescan china ltd 2 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to determine the thickness of biofilms formed on the sand surface propidium iodide syto 9 dye and sterilized ultrapure water were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 100 after the biofilm coating process was completed the sand sample was dyed with the premixed solution the dyed sand was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope leica tcs sp8 sand samples dyed with propidium iodide and syto 9 were observed using clsm with excitation wavelengths of 535 617 nm and 485 498 nm respectively based on the observation results a three dimensional spatial structure of the biofilm was constructed according to the spatial structure results the biofilm thickness of each sand grain was determined by averaging ten thickness measurements evenly distributed around the grain 2 5 4 high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the characteristics of the microbes dna was extracted from the microbial sample using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca and detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the concentration and quality of the dna were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer dna samples 30 ng were amplified by polymerase chain reaction transgen ap221 02 there were three replicates for each microbial sample and the products of pcr amplification were detected using 2 agarose gel electrophoresis the dna insert was dual end sequenced using an illumina miseq sequencer san diego ca 2 5 5 data analysis two way analysis of variance anova and a two sided t test were used to analyze whether differences were significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the biofilm on hydraulic conductivity relative hydraulic conductivity k was used to evaluate the degree of clogging the variation in k in different groups over time is shown in fig 2 the k in the control groups bsck pack and mcck did not change over time compared to that in the experimental groups which indicates that the biofilms coated on quartz sand in bsck pack and mcck were stable the initial values of hydraulic conductivity of the porous media in bs pa mc and sp clean sand were 0 258 0 250 0 262 and 0 280 cm s respectively from 0 to 15 h the k of all experimental groups decreased with time and was in the order of mc pa sp bs from 15 to 42 h the k of the porous media in pa mc and sp decreased rapidly over time whereas k reduction in bs slowed down from 15 to 42 h k of the porous media in the with biofilm groups pa bs and mc was reduced more rapidly than that in the without biofilm group sp from 42 to 66 h k of the porous media in the experimental groups showed a declining trend over time at the end of recharge the results of k in descending order were pa bs mc sp with approximate values of 0 18 0 24 0 28 and 0 32 respectively the results indicated that the existence of biofilm accelerated the hydraulic conductivity decline of porous media with time and promoted clogging evolution different types of biofilms had different influences on the hydraulic conductivity of porous media and the causes is clarified in section 3 4 fig 3 shows the k variation of the different layers in the sand column over time fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c show that k in the with biofilm groups bs pa and mc declined along the column over time and the rate of decrease in k was slowed down from the top to bottom layers with recharge processing at the end of the recharge process the k values of the surface 0 1 cm and second 1 3 cm layers in bs and pa were reduced to less than 0 05 the k of the surface 0 1 cm and the second 1 3 cm layers in mc was higher than that in bs and pa with a value of 0 10 and 0 13 respectively the k of the bottom two layers in pa showed a smaller decline over time than those in bs and mc the k values of the two surface layers in pa declined much more rapidly over time than those in bs and mc the results showed that clogging in pa is prone to occur in the upper layers however the k of the porous media in sp declined over time with obvious fluctuations the k of the bottom two layers 11 17 cm and 17 23 cm in sp showed a sharper decline over time than those in bs pa and mc the results indicate that the suspended particles in sp may move into the sand column more deeply than those in bs pa and mc based on the above analysis the k of different layers in the four experimental groups bs pa mc and sp showed a decreasing trend over time but at different rates the initial values of hydraulic conductivity in different layers from the inlet to outlet in the sand column were given in fig 4 the initial values of hydraulic conductivity were basically constant from the inlet to the outlet along the sand column which indicates uniform distribution of the biofilm in different layers 3 2 deposition of suspended particles in clean and biofilm coated sand suspended particles deposited on the sand surfaces are shown in fig 5 the amount of suspended particle deposition on the surface layer in the bs pa and mc groups was higher than that in the other layers in the corresponding groups with values of 30 93 36 44 and 23 92 mg g sand respectively the suspended particles accumulated on the sand of the bs pa and mc groups showed a declining trend along the sand column from the inlet to outlet the bottom layer 17 23 cm had the lowest suspended particle accumulation among the layers in the same groups with values of 10 83 4 68 and 6 34 mg g sand in the bs pa and mc groups respectively the amount of particle deposition in the bottom layer was reduced by 64 99 87 18 73 50 and 49 92 compared to the surface layer in the bs pa mc and sp groups respectively this indicates that the particles in the biofilm coated groups tended to deposit on the surface layer compared to the sp group for the sp group the deposition distribution of suspended particles was considerable different from that in the other three groups at the end of the recharge process the amount of suspended particles from the surface 0 1 cm to the third 3 5 cm layer decreased however the suspended particle accumulation of the fourth layer had an obvious rise and from the fourth to the bottom layer also showed a decreasing trend which is an interesting phenomenon observed in our study that can also be verified by the variation in the hydraulic conductivity described in section 3 1 in general under the condition of suspended particle with a size smaller than 2 μm the existence of biofilm coated on the porous media promoted the deposition of suspended particles on the sand surface whereas in the sand column without biofilm coverage suspended particles migrated deeper into the sand column and parts of the suspended particles moved out of the column with the water flow 3 3 characteristics of porous media and microbes 3 3 1 microbial community composition the microbial consortium was collected from the groundwater and then cultured fig 6 shows the diversity and dominant species of the mixed microbial consortium used in our experiment as shown in fig 6 the dominant species included methylophilus methyloversatilis rheinheimera exiguobacterium sphingobium pseudomonas novosphingobium sphingopyxis aeromonas enterococcus klebsiella acinetobacter rhodococcus raoultella vogesella flavobacterium azospirillum microvirgula and novispirillum the composition of the mc microbial community can effectively simulate the actual groundwater environment 3 3 2 surface morphology of the porous media the surface properties of the porous media are crucial for the transport and deposition of suspended particles the surface topography of the porous media in different experimental designs is shown in fig 7 the sand was clean and smooth without biofilm coating fig 7 g when the sand was coated with b subtilis and p aeruginosa the surface of the sand was covered by a sticky and dense biofilm fig 7 a and 7 b as shown in fig 7 c the sand covered by the microbial consortium biofilm was rougher than bare sand the biofilm was not as integrated as that in bsck and pack and was less dense than that in bsck and pack this was attributed to the difference in nutrient utilization between the mixed microbial consortium and b subtilis and p aeruginosa to quantify the difference in biofilm thickness clsm combined with fluorescent staining was used to determine the biofilm thickness formed on the sand surface the average biofilm thicknesses of sand samples collected from the 0 1 cm sand column in bsck pack and mcck were 186 67 10 226 67 5 and 160 00 10 μm respectively compared with the sand diameter of 0 50 1 00 mm the difference in biofilms among the different groups was relatively small the biomass of the different layers of the sand column was measured to examine the biofilm distribution of the sand column except for the biomass of the bottom two layers the average biomass of the top four layers in bsck pack and mcck was 0 42 0 46 0 50 0 58 and 0 40 0 45 mg g sand respectively fig 8 the difference in biomass distribution among different layers in this study was relatively small compared with the reported biomass of b subtilis 2 33 2 58 mg g sand and p putida 1 36 1 77 mg g sand biofilms he et al 2015 the relatively uniform distribution of biomass was attributed to the modification of the biofilm coating process and duration which weakened the effects of biomass distribution differences on porous media the results directly demonstrated that biofilm coating on sand surfaces would narrow the pore size thereby greatly inducing physical straining this explains the enhanced deposition of suspended particles in the presence of biofilms during the artificial recharging process 3 3 3 zeta potential the surface charges of the suspended particles and quartz sand with or without biofilm are listed in table 1 the zeta potential values of clean quartz sand suspended particles b subtilis p aeruginosa and microbial consortium were 27 70 0 2 10 19 0 4 18 27 0 4 31 2 0 4 and 29 06 0 2 mv respectively table 1 bacillus subtilis increased the zeta potential of quartz sand whereas p aeruginosa and the microbial consortium decreased the zeta potential of quartz sand 3 3 4 composition of eps extracellular polymeric substances account for 80 85 of the biofilm volume the composition of eps secreted by microbes in different groups is vital for analyzing the variation in k the polysaccharide content of different layers in bs pa and mc are shown in fig 9 the polysaccharides content in pa was higher than that in bs with a difference of 10 01 5 08 μg g sand the polysaccharide content in pa was higher than that in mc with a difference of 9 53 4 57 μg g sand the polysaccharide content in mc was slightly higher than that in bs at the same layer the difference in polysaccharide content between the layers in the same experimental group was not significant the protein content of the different layers in bs pa and mc are shown in fig 10 the protein content of the different layers in bs pa and mc were within the range of 12 86 15 02 μg g sand the difference in protein content between the groups was small and the differences between layers within the same group were very minor the characteristics of the eps may affect the transport of suspended particles therefore composition analysis of eps in the different groups is vital 3 4 mechanisms of clogging under the coexistence of biofilm and suspended particles 3 4 1 analysis of deposition rate the clogging of porous media was attributed to the suspended particles deposition meanwhile particle deposition rate can reflect the change of dominant mechanisms the particle concentration in the influent and the effluent was measured over time in this experiment the accumulated suspended particle can be calculated by particle concentration in the effluent according to a mathematical model for simulating particle deposition reported by zheng et al 2014 particle deposition rate can be calculated by the derivative of accumulated particle deposition eq 3 the particle deposition rate was shown in fig 11 3 r c t where r is particle deposition rate mg g h c is accumulated amount of suspended particles per unit sand mg g sand t is the recharge time h according to deposition rate of suspended particles fig 11 the whole process was divided into three stages from 0 to about 15 h stage i the deposition rate in descending order was bs sp pa mc from 15 to 42 h stage ii the deposition rate in pa increased rapidly while the particle deposition rate in bs and sp decreased over time after about 42 h stage iii the particle deposition rate in descending order was pa bs mc sp in different groups the deposition rate affects the hydraulic conductivity meanwhile the deposition rate was influenced by zeta potential of porous media biofilm thickness of the sand eps composition in the biofilm polysaccharides concentration and protein concentration the values of these related parameters were given in fig 12 deposition rate of suspended particles is a bridge that links the hydraulic conductivity and the dominant process of clogging at different stages one or more of the factors played a dominant role and all of these factors exist throughout the whole recharge process which contribute to the variation in particle deposition rate 3 4 2 influence of porous media surface properties on clogging the surface properties of the porous media were mainly including zeta potential and biofilm roughness the presence of different bacterial strains changed the zeta potential of the porous medium to some extent bacillus subtilis decreased the negative charge of porous media whereas p aeruginosa and the microbial consortium slightly increased the negative charge of porous media the presence of biofilm not only alters the surface charge of the porous media but also affects the electrostatic interaction between the porous media and suspended particles fig 13 at stage i the suspended particles enter the porous medium with water flow when the distance between the suspended particles and porous media is large they are affected by van der waals forces although the distance was shortened with the water flow the electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles and porous media was dominant the electrostatic repulsion between the different biofilm coated sands and suspended particles decreased in the order pa mc sp bs if we only take electrostatic repulsion into consideration suspended particles in bs were easier to deposit on the sand column than that in the other groups although the electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles and porous media in pa was higher than that in mc the decrease in k in pa was faster than that in mc this indicates there are other factors that influence suspended particle deposition rate by combined analysis of the other influential factors including biofilm thickness of the sand eps composition in the biofilm polysaccharides concentration protein concentration and deposition rate in fig 11 and fig 12 the biofilm thickness also plays an important role at this stage the more details of biofilm thickness are discussed in section3 4 4 the physical roughness of sand surfaces has been documented to play a key role in suspended particle deposition the surface topography of the sand coated with different types of biofilms is shown in fig 7 the sand coated with b subtilis and p aeruginosa was covered by dense and sticky biofilms whereas the sand covered by the mixed microbial consortium biofilm seemed much more uneven and nonhomogeneous the sand surfaces were modified by different types of biofilms and the physical roughness of the sand surfaces resulted in differences the sand in the mc may have a greater ability to retain suspended particles in terms of physical roughness he et al 2017 huangfu et al 2019 3 4 3 binding interaction binding between the biofilms and suspended particles also be an important mechanism fig 13 at stage ii the sand surfaces in the different groups were covered by suspended particles and the deposition of suspended particles led to a change of the sand surface charge in particular for sp the downward trend of k slowed down over time and the hydraulic conductivity of the different layers of the sand column fluctuated significantly over time fig 3 simultaneously the suspended particles in the effluent flow increased temporarily and were measured with a diameter range of 550 nm which indicated that the suspended particles migrated deeper into the column and part of the suspended particles moved out of the sand column this phenomenon was not observed in groups other than the sp group the biofilm consists of microbes and eps the eps mainly consists of polysaccharides and proteins among which the acetyl group of the extracellular polysaccharides enhances the adhesion of suspended particles to biofilms flemming and wingender 2001 according to fig 11 at stage ii the deposition rate in pa increased rapidly while the deposition rate in bs and sp decreased the order of deposition rate in different experimental groups has high correlation with the order of eps content the polysaccharides concentration of eps in pa was higher than those in the other groups fig 12 which indicates that the adhesion between the biofilm and suspended particles in pa was stronger than that in the other groups thus binding by eps plays a key role at this stage while the other two mechanisms still exist at stage ii the hydraulic conductivity of porous media in pa declined much more sharply over time than that in the other experimental groups in general suspended particles have stronger adhesion to sand coated by biofilm than sand without biofilm coating in addition eps can flocculate kaolin particles and the available carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of eps have a very high binding capacity aljuboori et al 2015 bezawada et al 2013 more et al 2014 the main components polysaccharides and proteins of eps contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in biofilm coated quartz sand columns he et al 2020 in the suspended particle only group the suspended particles that accumulated on the sand surface were not firm and could be easily washed out with water flow in addition the deposition of suspended particles narrowed the pores of porous media in the sand column which increased the water velocity the absence of biofilms and the enhanced scouring of water contributed to the outflow of suspended particles and fluctuations of hydraulic conductivity in the biofilm coated groups the biofilm coated on the sand surface could bind suspended particles and further stabilize the matrix by providing additional sites for bridging with suspended particles which made the suspended particles tightly bound to the biofilm the tightly bound suspended particles and biofilm aggregations can remarkably enhance clogging durability kim and kwon 2022 wei et al 2019 3 4 4 physical straining physical straining was influenced by biofilm thickness which was mainly related to the microbes types in different groups although the electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles and the porous media in pa was slightly higher than that in mc the decrease in k in pa was faster than that in mc fig 2 these results were related to the difference of biofilm thickness the biofilm in pa was thicker than that in mc physical straining is another dominant factor that influences suspended particle deposition and hydraulic conductivity variations in porous media fig 13 the presence of biofilm changes the surface roughness of quartz sand which plays a critical role in suspended particle deposition even under unfavorable electrostatic conditions in addition the biofilm coated on the surface of the porous media occupied the pore vacancies which narrowed the void space compared with that in clean sand the biofilm thickness coated on the sand surface in descending order was pa bs mc fig 12 thus the biofilm coated on the sand surface in pa has greater retention ability for suspended particles which is one of the causes for the greater decline in hydraulic conductivity in pa than in the other groups 4 conclusions in this study artificial recharge of groundwater was simulated using well conducting sand columns and the influence of biofilms coated on the surface of porous media on the clogging process of suspended particles was investigated among the experimental groups the rate of decrease in relative hydraulic conductivity in descending order was pa bs mc sp biofilms coated on porous media exacerbate clogging in the biofilm coated groups the biofilm coated on the sand surface could tightly bind the suspended particles the tightly bound suspended particle biofilm aggregations enhance clogging durability for the without biofilm groups the hydraulic conductivity of the different layers of the sand column fluctuated significantly the suspended particles migrated deeper into the column and some of the suspended particles moved out of the sand column in the without biofilm group the change in zeta potential and physical roughness of porous media binding and adhesion by microbes and eps and physical straining caused by biofilms were the main influencing factors contributing to the clogging process of suspended particles in the biofilm coated porous media which led to the differences in k in different groups credit authorship
