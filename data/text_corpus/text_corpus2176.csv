10880,coupling hydrologic and crop models is becoming an increasingly important approach in the development of agro hydrologic theme scientists and decision makers working to address issues in the areas of resource conservation and agricultural productivity are interested in the complementary processing of the two coupled systems the objective of the present work is to review relevant studies related to hydrologic and crop models coupling and to analyze the domain applicability limitations and other considerations keywords coupling tools crop models hydrologic models integrated modeling modeling frameworks 1 introduction hydrologic and crop growth numerical modeling has progressed over the last decades and the scientific modeling community has recognized the complementary nature of various aspects of hydrologic and crop systems debates and issues on food security environmental degradations and climate change have raised the need for integrated simulation models to cope with issues of sustainable agriculture production tandem with resources scarcity and climate stresses a proper answer to the question of how water can be efficiently used to maximize crop yields is therefore needed white et al 2011a furthermore agricultural pricing and policies have a high impacts on farmers incentives with a consequent high control of their cropping systems siad et al 2017 being a major user of water agriculture is a potential adequate field to study water use efficiency jia et al 2011 agricultural water use for crops relies on several factors such as climatic conditions topography lithology soil management practices type of crop etc knowledge of these parameters allows estimating crop water requirement and establishing cropping management procedures water requirements by agricultural crops can be determined locally at the field nevertheless being all these processes observed at small spatial scales they are mainly conditioned by rainfall and its distribution and redistribution at the basin scale to date hydrological practices have been developed to their greatest advancement in the study of large catchments for water resources purposes and yet have a limited implication in agriculture jia et al 2011 with an increasing importance of improving low agricultural productivity in marginal lands where capital investments are not beneficial subsistence activity water harvesting is the determinant of agricultural production thus given the importance of water in agriculture an enhanced understanding of hydrological conditions is essential to efficiently exploit soil moisture opportunities antonelli et al 2015 this paper presents a review of studies on crop growth and hydrologic models we begin with an introduction to the general concepts related to hydrologic crop growth and coupling models and coupling computer models then we synthesize literature sources which coupled hydrologic and crop growth models applied for various purposes finally we provided some considerations and implications 2 concepts and notions the concept of environmental modeling deals with the relations among water climate soil and plants iacobellis et al 2002 white et al 2011b and includes temporal and spatial features meiyappan et al 2014 the behavior of each feature is controlled by its own components jajarmizadeh et al 2012 accordingly models are a simplified representations of the real processes anothai et al 2008 models can be either physical physical representation of the original system reproduced by scaled parameters electrical analogue electrical circuit similar to the investigated system composed of electrical component or mathematical mathematical stochastic equations that describe physical characteristics of the system gutzler et al 2015 the physical and analogue models have been very important in the past refsgaard 1996 nowadays the mathematical group of models is by far the most easily and universally applicable the most widespread and rapidly developing with regards to scientific basis and application van kraalingen et al 2003 2 1 crop growth modeling crop models are tools that help estimating crop yields as a function of weather soil conditions and the applied management practices hoogenboom et al 2002 there are several types of models that have been developed over the years they can be classified into various groups or types ranging from empirical to explanatory models hoogenboom 1999 empirical models are based on direct descriptions of observed data expressed as regression equations and used for estimation of crop yields empirical approach analyzes data and fits an equation or a set of equations to the data these models have no information on the mechanisms that control the outputs phakamas et al 2013 in contrast mechanistic models explain not only the relationships between weather parameters and crop yields but also the mechanisms that control these relationships bannayan et al 2003 in stochastic models each output is attached to a probability element for each set of inputs different outputs are given along with probabilities these models define a state of dependent of model variables at a given rate etkin et al 2008 explanatory models consist of quantitative description of the mechanisms that cause a behavior in such models the processes are separately quantified and then integrated into the entire system hoogenboom 1994 among the models successfully used to simulate maize growth and yield are the epic williams 1990 ceres maize bao et al 2017 almanac kiniry et al 2005 cropsyst st√∂ckle et al 2003 wofost van diepen et al 1989 and adel fournier et al 2003 for simulating maize growth and yield the sorkam rosenthal et al 1989 sormodel arora 1982 sorgf wiegand and richardson 1984 and almanac are used for sorghum crop management ceres pearl millet model santos et al 2016 cropsyst and pm models boylan and russell 2006 are used for simulating of pearl millet genotypes across the globe similarly the pnutgro hoogenboom et al 1992 is used for groundnut chikpgro singh and virmani 1996 for chick pea wtgrows sehgal and sastri 2005 for wheat soygro hoogenboom et al 1990 for soybean qsun schnable et al 2009 for sunflower and gossym boone et al 1993 and cotons jallas et al 2000 for cotton the above mentioned models are those currently in use for meeting the requirements by farmers scientists and decision makers 2 2 hydrologic modeling hydrologic models are developed for estimating predicting and managing water distribution and fluxes at the soil atmosphere interface as a function of various parameters that are used for describing soil and watershed characteristics e g gioia et al 2011 manfreda et al 2005 the commonly required inputs are atmospheric data e g rainfall and temperature while the model parameterization includes watershed characteristics like the topographic relief geomorphology bedrock soil and vegetation properties i e models based on physical concepts when restricted to land surface processes hydrologic models are referred to as rainfall runoff models and are often based on a conceptual representation of physical processes iacobellis et al 2015 in general they can be classified as lumped or distributed models e g milella et al 2012 depending on the spatial discretization of parameters in lumped models the entire watershed is taken as a single unit and the spatial variability of input variables parameters and outputs are disregarded breuer et al 2009 on the other hand distributed models can deal with space distributed quantities by dividing the catchment into subunits usually square cells or triangulated irregular network so that the parameters inputs and outputs can vary spatially a large number of models have developed different application ranges from small catchments to global models has been developed such as dhsvm wigmosta et al 2002 mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 toplats bormann 2006 wasim eth schulla and jasper 2007 swat santhi et al 2001 prms heckerman et al 2007 slurp barr et al 1997 hbv lindstrom et al 1997 lascam viney and sivapalan 2001 ihacres croke et al 2005 dream manfreda et al 2005 etc where each model has its own unique characteristics and respective applications the model choice and implementation are basically constraint by data availability e g gauged or ungauged catchment and modeling purpose such as streamflow and flood forecasting water resource management evaluation of water quality erosion nutrient and pesticide circulation etc di modugno et al 2015 gorgoglione et al 2016 manfreda et al 2015 2 3 complementarily of simulation processes in order to guarantee the efficiency of crop production assessment the role of hydrological modeling is to provide accurate soil moisture distribution in space and time accounting for basin scale water dynamics balenzano et al 2013 dokoohaki et al 2016 iacobellis et al 2013 rainfall amount and its space time distribution determine the quantity of water that reaches the land s surface temperature humidity vegetation cover i e type amount and distribution determine the proportion of evaporated water vegetation productivity and soil conditions while topography determines the quantity of water that infiltrates into the soil versus water that runs on the ground surface gioia et al 2014 it is the interactions among these complex processes that define the effective water available for crops in the rhizosphere fig 1 vegetation affects water balance by evapotranspiration et and interception canopy properties such as the leaf area index lai and the rooting depth are obtained offline externally and are considered as parameters in most physically based hydrological models gigante et al 2009 mcnider et al 2015b lai estimates provide an indication of vegetation growth cycle and of plant activity in terms of water transpiration keeping lai constant throughout a model simulation may lead to errors in the model results lai may also be treated as an input variable being regularly updated by means of earth observation products balacco et al 2015 milella et al 2012 yet exploiting crop growth models the hydrological model could be enhanced with a module able to simulate vegetation development crop growth models which accurately reproduce soil water flow processes should be given preference when compared to other methods for evaluating vegetation stats betts 2005 crop models can be improved by a proper modeling of water flow distribution for a better estimation of et rates since all these processes are represented in hydrological models the coupling of hydrologic and crop growth models can be expected to be beneficial for both simulations manfreda et al 2010 2 4 coupling models coupling is used in the context of feedbacks between various processes it does refer to physics but it happens on software development base with numerical implications there are several methods of coupling models ranging between simple hand made data exchanges and automated frameworks of integration as follow 1 sequential coupling models are completely decoupled 2 loose coupling models exchange i o data 3 shared coupling a unified gui models share graphical user interface gui b shared data models share i o database 4 embedded one model is completely contained in the other usually as a subroutine 5 integrated models are merged at the code source level in one coherent model 6 framework using an overall modeling framework where the models are coupled using a third part tool commonly called coupler based on a combination of the previous methods the level of coupling refers to the degree to which model variables depend upon each other in high level coupling i e embedded integrated each component and its linked one must be presented in a way allowing a code or a framework to be executed at the same time low level coupling i e shared and loose coupling allows components to be autonomously managed and communicate among themselves in a completely decoupled coupling i e sequential coupling components operate separately and independently 2 5 open and closed source models the notion of openness closeness of a source can be applied either for the code source of a model and or its data flexibility use and modification of closed source models are predetermined by the creator s which is subjected to copyright and limit their accessibility and modification at the same time open sources allow more freedom in modification reproduction and use according to needs also open sources with the possibility to change their codes develop more rapidly generally we may define three level of openness to third party models open source a completely open source code partially open source part of the source code is restricted close source an entirely restricted source code and three other level for third party data heterogeneous no restriction for third party data source partially heterogeneous some data sources are restricted homogeneous only pre determined data source is accepted these characteristics have to be considered for model development based on coupling an integrated method offers a highly cohesive system but makes its maintenance and upgradability harder such as if new versions of the legacy models are released in contrast less invasive methods offer easier maintenance and more homogeneity but with weak cohesiveness fig 2 2 6 challenges of model coupling in order to be coupled models must be interoperable a term often used but lacking a single and precise definition for instance wileden and kaplan 1999 defined interoperable as the capability of two or more programs to share and process information irrespective of their implementation of language and platform similarly b√ºhler and mckee 1996 defined interoperable geo processing as the ability of digital systems to i freely exchange all kinds of spatial information about the earth and about objects and phenomena on above and below the earth s surface and ii cooperatively over networks run software capable of manipulating such information both definitions apply to computer programs hardwares and data file formats models and their respective data must be interoperable with both spatial and temporal scales if a scale difference cannot be resolved then the models cannot be meaningfully coupled although the models may share information if the models scales are different the results from the coupled system are meaningless in such cases an intermediate program is required to reconcile the scales for example two models may assume the same data type with the same dimensions and extends however if the output is in the time unit but one is in minute and the second is in month a temporal scale conversion for interoperability is required similarly if the spatial scale is different a spatial conversion is required hu and bian 2009 kumar et al 2006 due to the substantial number of available models and practical tools and the diÔ¨Ä erent approaches e g from empirical to mechanistic that characterize them choosing a suitable model to be coupled and the specific method of data processing may be diÔ¨Écult moreover a lack of knowledge about the domain heterogeneity can make models application entirely misleading often computer resources encompass a restrictive factor for such combinations nevertheless reasonable computational time and precision can be achieved when simulated processes are not overloaded i e in the random access memory ram or central processing unit cpu in addition to hardware resources both programming languages and framework of combination play a key role in managing the available resources these aspects are purely computer science oriented criteria and may represent a serious barrier for the combination of source models many factors should be considered prior to the selection of an appropriate methodology and framework for coupling these factors include the nature and relative scale of the crop system basin characteristics data and information availability method requirements time constraints for producing an assessment and the required accuracy in some cases process selection is a context shaped approach therefore the process should be transparent where the assumptions simplifications and other limitations are clearly indicated it would assist in validating the results with observation data the process also needs to be adaptive so that new or improved information can be incorporated fig 3 3 overview of coupled hydrologic and crop growth model coupling hydrologic and crop model s studies are relatively scarce and is still at early stage of development nevertheless it is an important task for the scientific modelling community dealing with sustainable water resources management for crop system improvement the principal objectives of the reviewed studies table 1 concern better quantification of et co2 water and nutrients flux estimation with dynamic vegetation along with the cost and time saving involved in the model development for this reason exchanges between atmosphere surface subsurface water fluxes need to be complemented with crop development and other physiological processes the developed models have been parameterized for a given target crop s according to the area extend and or relevance for the study focus all studies results show that hydrological processes are sensitive to changes led by the incorporation of crop dynamics in the hydrologic models and significantly improve fluxes estimation compared to the original hydrological models in case distributed hydrological models where some zones of the watershed present specificity regarding the cropping pattern it was concluded case study related that improving the estimation of energy et co2 pollutants and water fluxes over croplands is achieved through a more accurate description of vegetation dynamics regardless with the numerous crop models available and their different levels of sophistication water requirement and availability are basic inputs increased accuracy of soil hydrology strengthens the understanding of temporal dynamics as a function of agricultural production and inter seasonal plant physiological changes while at the same time improvement to irrigation practices 4 general discussion and implications meteorological observations crop production soil samples and other data pertinent to watershed system are gathered at local scale current research supports integrated assessments of complex systems based on place oriented assessments results of this review show that building larger scale understandings from localized case studies is an upscaling task aggregation nonetheless not all data are prompt to aggregation to estimate larger scale values such as vector i e wind or intensive i e temperature data however technical solution for problems in upscaling exists such as linking models between scales changing model resolution or comparing aggregates with overall records fig 3 challenges related to data availability at detailed scales the increasing complexity of causal relationships and capturing contextual detail led to another essential aspect of coupling downscaling because many driving forces i e rainfall topography etc operate at watershed scale they shape on field realities however this is not easily attainable by interpolating spatially data which results in great uncertainties fig 4 and 5 examples for rainfall and wind data downscaling often use a triangularization process where upscaling is proceeded through grids aggregation in addition validation processes of the model s outputs are not always attainable due to lack of detailed observational datasets assuming that all relevant data are converted to a common metric data the coupling challenge has been greatly simplified if the aim is to attain an integrated understanding of processes simply converting numbers to a common spatial scale does not necessarily assures conceptual integration as contrasted with computational integration where coupling method has a crucial role in the system processes assimilation it is often a matter of reconciling differences in process assumptions theoretical foundations and perceived standards last but not least distributed hydrological models are land use dependent for soil functions and rainfall distribution land use can significantly alter the seasonal and annual hydrological response within a catchment nevertheless cropping systems represent one category among others i e urban areas forests etc the prevalence of agricultural activity in a given hydrological system will determine the potential benefit of incorporating crop model in hydrological simulation the Ô¨Årst criterion for modeler when selecting models to be coupled should be the end purposes followed by the selection of the adequate compromise between precision and ease of use for investigating the models assumptions and qualiÔ¨Åcations this implies that the addressed user should have a comprehensive overview on the selected models purposes metrics capabilities and field of validity then the user has to consider the biophysical cycles that have to be modeled along with the crop and hydrological cycle the greater is the number of simulated processes the larger is the complexity of the resulting coupled model going on through the choice of models speciÔ¨Åc purposes regarding the investigated agro hydrological system and climatic regions such as their ecological relevance economic importance expected risks etc should be defined hence it is necessary to refer to the geographic regions where models have been already applied successful studies for assessments and analyses serve as guides towards most suitable planning for coupling especially those targeting climate changes and adaptation issues literature provides several models reviews mostly focused on topics of speciÔ¨Åc interests such as the description of general approaches and evaluation inter comparison of models performance forecasts and gaps analysis 5 conclusion the objective of our work was to review studies involving coupled hydrologic and crop growth models the study provides useful examples for practical information and purposes of this new tendency in model development this study can be of interest for researchers practitioners and policymakers involved in agro hydrological studies and projects particularly this study may help understanding the potential benefit raising from incorporating crop models in hydrological simulation for water resources conservation sustainability and performance improvement of crop and irrigation systems despite its potential the study results suggest that the current interest trend in coupling hydrologic and crop models is limited to improvement of crop systems performance and environmental impacts assessment hydrologic systems resilience to imported exported quantities i e soil nutrients and water for agricultural practices is an important aspect that has to be given more consideration for sustainable crop production and resource conservation concerns

crop model in hydrological simulation the Ô¨Årst criterion for modeler when selecting models to be coupled should be the end purposes followed by the selection of the adequate compromise between precision and ease of use for investigating the models assumptions and qualiÔ¨Åcations this implies that the addressed user should have a comprehensive overview on the selected models purposes metrics capabilities and field of validity then the user has to consider the biophysical cycles that have to be modeled along with the crop and hydrological cycle the greater is the number of simulated processes the larger is the complexity of the resulting coupled model going on through the choice of models speciÔ¨Åc purposes regarding the investigated agro hydrological system and climatic regions such as their ecological relevance economic importance expected risks etc should be defined hence it is necessary to refer to the geographic regions where models have been already applied successful studies for assessments and analyses serve as guides towards most suitable planning for coupling especially those targeting climate changes and adaptation issues literature provides several models reviews mostly focused on topics of speciÔ¨Åc interests such as the description of general approaches and evaluation inter comparison of models performance forecasts and gaps analysis 5 conclusion the objective of our work was to review studies involving coupled hydrologic and crop growth models the study provides useful examples for practical information and purposes of this new tendency in model development this study can be of interest for researchers practitioners and policymakers involved in agro hydrological studies and projects particularly this study may help understanding the potential benefit raising from incorporating crop models in hydrological simulation for water resources conservation sustainability and performance improvement of crop and irrigation systems despite its potential the study results suggest that the current interest trend in coupling hydrologic and crop models is limited to improvement of crop systems performance and environmental impacts assessment hydrologic systems resilience to imported exported quantities i e soil nutrients and water for agricultural practices is an important aspect that has to be given more consideration for sustainable crop production and resource conservation concerns

relationship between various variables for the field system dynamics model the external variables include precipitation evapotranspiration irrigation water field runoff and surface runoff the internal variable are ridge seepage flow field seepage flow surface leakage and deep leakage and the state variable is field water storage and soil water storage 4 model test test the consistency between the model system and the actual system elmahdi et al 2007 tehrani et al 2013 a diagram of the field water system dynamics model is shown in fig 4 this study established a field water system dynamics model according to the water balance principle to study the trends and influence factors of return flows in northern china the flowchart of the research is in fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 model establishment and test according to the calculation formula for each variable 1 10 the field water system dynamics model was established in order to improve the simulation accuracy of the model the model is further optimized and tested by entering the measured data of irrigation water and precipitation in 2016 into the field water system dynamics model and the parameters of the model were optimized the results of the parameter optimization are shown in table 1 the simulated values of the model were compared with the measured values of field water storage and field runoff in 2016 and the comparative results in fig 6 show that the simulated and measured trends for field water level and field runoff were almost identical the absolute error range of the daily field water storage was 0 1996 0 2034 mm and its relative error was 0 2663 2 4943 5 0000 5 0000 the absolute error range of the daily underground return flow through field seepage was 0 2183 0 1853 mm and its relative error was 0 6602 1 9829 5 0000 5 0000 these results demonstrate that the field water system dynamics model can simulate the field water balance process well 4 2 return flow simulation analysis the field return flow was simulated using the established field water system dynamics model for the hu lanhe irrigation area in 2016 the simulation results in fig 7 show that the range of the surface return flow was 0 4 58 mm d the range of the underground return flow was 0 1 99 mm d and the range of the total return flow was 0 6 30 mm d the cumulative surface return flow was higher than that of the underground return flow which accounted for 65 53 of the total return flow the change trends in the surface return flow and the total return flow were similar overall thus showing that the effect of the surface return flow on the total return flow was larger than that of the underground return flow throughout the entire process furthermore the similarity of the trends of the underground return flow and the surface return flow was low overall and the overall trend of the groundwater return flow was complex furthermore there was a lag between the underground return flow and the surface return flow and the peak level of underground return flow generally lagged behind that of the surface return flow by more than 1 day the return flow significantly decreased when entering the growth period of the milk and yellow ripe stage during this stage the similarity of the trends of the total return flow and surface return water was more obvious because of the reduction of underground return water in the milk and yellow ripe stage growth period when the total water inflow the sum of precipitation and irrigation water was high the total return flow was high thus the larger the total water inflow is the larger the total return flow however the trends of the total water inflow and total return flow were not fully synchronized when the water level of the total water inflow was significantly higher than the field ridge height the surface return flow played a decisive role in the total return flow and the surface return flow increased significantly as the total return flow increased therefore when the total water inflow increased the surface return flow and the total return flow both increased when the water level of total water inflow was lower than the field ridge height the total return flow was influenced by both the surface return flow and the underground return flow in this situation the trends of the surface return flow underground return flow and total return flow were more complex the surface return flow was affected by factors such as instantaneous precipitation or a continuous irrigation operation while the underground water return was influenced by the field water level which reduced the significance of the trend of the total return flow therefore the trends of the total water inflow and the total return flow were not synchronous under these conditions 4 3 influencing factor analysis of the return flow 4 3 1 field ridge layout factor the return flows for different field ridge heights lengths and widths were simulated according to the field system dynamics model established to analyze the trends in the return flow under different field ridge layout conditions as shown in fig 8 the total return flow decreased with increasing field ridge height when only the field ridge height was changed because the field ridge height had a major impact on the surface return flow when the field ridge height was equal to or less than 10 mm the surface return flow was approximately equal to the total return flow and when the field ridge height increased the surface return flow and total return flow decreased when only the field ridge length was changed the total return flow increased with increasing field ridge length when only the field ridge width was changed the total return flow decreased with increasing field ridge width the field ridge width influenced both the field seepage flow and the ridge seepage flow but the impact on the ridge seepage flow was more significant the field ridge seepage flow showed a linear decreasing trend with increasing field ridge width therefore for field management and planning it is necessary to increase the field ridge height and reasonably adjust the field ridge length and field ridge width proportions in order to reduce the return flow 4 3 2 water inflow factor the 6 years of field data collected between 2011 and 2016 were entered into the established field water system dynamics model to analyze the variations in the return flow under different water inflow levels the simulated results of the return flow are shown in table 2 the 2011 2016 return flow coefficient of irrigation ranged from 0 5825 to 0 6395 and the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation ranged from 0 2734 to 0 3386 the volatility in the 2 indicators over the 6 years was not significant and the range of the return flow coefficient of irrigation was greater than that of the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation this difference was because the precipitation amounts were uncertain and belonged to the effective use of water for corp thus using the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation to characterize the reuse of the return flow is more in keeping with the actual situation the trends between the irrigation water and precipitation values and the total return flow were determined in order to analyze the relationships between these factors fig 9 the fitting curve for the total return flow and irrigation water has an r 2 of 0 9176 a rmse of 0 038 a significance of p 0 01 residual satisfies normal distribution and can thus be considered a good fit hence with increasing irrigation water the total return flow showed a significant increase the fitting curve for the total return flow and precipitation has a low r2 of 0 3472 a rmse of 24 484 a significance of p 0 1 and the residuals do not satisfy the normal distribution the total return flow first decreased and then increased with increasing precipitation which differs from the sustainability and stability associated with irrigation water this trend occurred because the sudden and ephemeral nature of precipitation when short term precipitation occurred the field water level was below the field ridge height the precipitation was primarily consumed by crops and a small amount of water remained for the field seepage thus the total return flow was low when the water level of precipitation was greater than the field ridge height the surface return flow increased which led to a gradual increase in the total return flow additional quantitative analysis was performed on the relationships among irrigation water precipitation surface return flow underground return flow and total return flow the fitting results are presented in table 3 y is the fitting line of the precipitation irrigation water and total return flow the total return flow was negatively correlated with precipitation and positively correlated with irrigation water and the regression coefficient of the irrigation water was much higher than that of precipitation indicating that the effect of irrigation water on the total return flow was much greater than the effect of precipitation on the total return flow y 1 is the fitting line of the precipitation irrigation water and surface return flow the surface return flow was positively correlated with both the precipitation and irrigation water and the impact of irrigation water on the surface return flow was greater than that of precipitation according to the regression coefficients y 2 is the fitting line of the precipitation irrigation water and underground return flow the underground return flow was negatively correlated with precipitation and positively correlated with irrigation water and the impact of irrigation water was greater than that of the precipitation on the groundwater return flow 5 discussion thus far because of the inconvenience involved in measuring the return flow the study of the return flow at different scales has been simulated by water balance models such as the swat and modflow models kim et al 2009 khadri and pande 2016 wu et al 2019 field scale simulation of return flow is the basis of the return flow estimates at different scales and the simulation accuracy of return flow at the field scale was higher than that at larger scales zhang et al 2005 this research adopts the system dynamics model based on the principle of water balance to simulate field return flow cui et al 2014 used this method to simulate the field return flow of an irrigation area with abundant water resources in the southern irrigation area of china the relative error of the simulated field water storage was less than 2 in the study by zhang et al 2005 while the deviation range of the simulated field water storage in our study was 0 1996 0 2034 mm and the relative error was 0 2663 2 4943 thus the simulated field water storages were basically consistent with the actual field water storages in both studies which shows that the system dynamics model is applicable for the simulation of field water balance process in both humid and semiarid regions however the simulation accuracy of our research was lower than that of zhang et al 2005 and this difference occurred because the precipitation in our study was less than that in zhang et al 2005 with additional years of continuous simulation repetitions in this region the simulation accuracy of the model could be further verified and improved by optimizing model according to many years of actual experimental observation the trend of the surface return flow was similar to that of the total return flow and variation in the underground return flow was not obvious hence the results of our research were consistent with previous research results in that the surface water flow accounted for 65 53 of the total return flow in our research compared to 70 on average in the research of cui et al 2014 the proportions of surface return flow to total flow in both studies were both greater than 50 but the proportion in our study is lower than that in cui et al 2014 the reasons for these differences may be related to the soil type channel lining and ground slope fei et al 2015 the causes of the different proportions of surface water to groundwater in different regions in response to an increase in the amount of field return flow data must be further explored in this research the influencing factors of field ridge height width and length on the return flow were analyzed the total return flow decreased with increasing field ridge height and width and it increased with increasing field ridge length these results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2005 there were no differences in the variation in the return flow among different field layouts or different climatic or water resource conditions the relationship between the water inflow and the total return flow was analyzed on the basis of simulating the trend of the return flow which has been an added component of systematic research on return flow in typical semiarid areas a set of relatively complete research findings on field return flow has been gathered for the simulation of field return flow the analysis of influencing factors the impacts of irrigation and precipitation on the return flow and the quantitative analysis of the return flow and water inflow this research could be provide a theoretical reference for the maximum reuse of return flow at the field scale the implementation of water saving strategies and the study of return flow at other scales this study simulated the trends of return water of 6 years from 2011 to 2016 to further discuss the trends of return flow under different climatic conditions in this research area the precipitation of 1986 2016 in this area which were obtained by collection of meteorological data were entered to the established model to simulate the reuse of return water under 3 hydrological years which were the dry year precipitation frequency is 90 the normal year precipitation frequency is 50 and the wet year precipitation frequency is 10 it can be seen from fig 10 Œ∑i p dry Œ∑i p normal Œ∑i p wet Œ∑i dry Œ∑i normal Œ∑i wet these results are the same as that of wu et al 2019 in dry year the water inflow was mainly irrigation water and the reused return flow was mainly the irrigation return flow into the branch canal hence Œ∑i more larger than Œ∑i p in wet year the precipitation was relatively large the inflow of precipitation was dominated the reused return flows were mainly the precipitation return flows into the field so Œ∑i p was nearly to Œ∑i wu et al 2019 the research region in this study was a high latitude area located in the cold temperate zone the results of this study were compared with those other studies that focused on areas with different climatic conditions table 4 lists the results of several similar field return flow studies the field return flow is related to the regional natural conditions precipitation conditions and other climatic conditions zareeian et al 2017 li et al 2018 kim et al 2009 table 4 shows that the larger the precipitation is the smaller the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation this result will be influenced by environmental factors such as crop species and soil types however due to the limited number of comparative samples this conclusion needs to be further verified 6 conclusions the field water system dynamics model was established by the principle of water balance which the variables of irrigation water precipitation evapotranspiration field water storage soil water storage field seepage flow ridge seepage flow surface runoff surface leakage deep leakage and field runoff were entered the established model was tested by measured data in 2016 of crop growth period in the hu lanhe irrigation area the test results indicated the precision of the established model was adequate based on the results return flow for consecutive years can be simulated by entering the irrigation water and precipitation into the established model which is convenient to study its change low and analyze its influencing factors in local irrigation area in addition the field water system dynamics model can compensate for the deficiencies of the experiment which cannot change various scenarios it is convenient to simulate and analyze the variations in return flow in different scenarios in terms of field ridge size climate and region the modeling method of field water system dynamics model is applicable to different regions but the results of model optimization parameters in this study are not applicable to all regions for irrigation areas under different climatic conditions it is suggested to enter some experimental data to optimize parameters and then simulate the return flow so as to ensure the accuracy of the results more research of field water system dynamics model in different regions and considering the complex relations of variables in the model are needed to simulate the return flow more accurately acknowledgments this research has been

mechanism of a system this technique uses complex qualitative and quantitative patterns to analyze the relationships among various variables within a system or between a system and the outside environment hanseok and jan 2016 system dynamics modeling includes the following steps 1 boundary determination distinguish the internal and external variables of the system 2 causality analysis analyze the feedback mechanism of the variables in the system and establish the causal relationship of the variables 3 model establishment determine the system process and establish the quantitative relationship between various variables for the field system dynamics model the external variables include precipitation evapotranspiration irrigation water field runoff and surface runoff the internal variable are ridge seepage flow field seepage flow surface leakage and deep leakage and the state variable is field water storage and soil water storage 4 model test test the consistency between the model system and the actual system elmahdi et al 2007 tehrani et al 2013 a diagram of the field water system dynamics model is shown in fig 4 this study established a field water system dynamics model according to the water balance principle to study the trends and influence factors of return flows in northern china the flowchart of the research is in fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 model establishment and test according to the calculation formula for each variable 1 10 the field water system dynamics model was established in order to improve the simulation accuracy of the model the model is further optimized and tested by entering the measured data of irrigation water and precipitation in 2016 into the field water system dynamics model and the parameters of the model were optimized the results of the parameter optimization are shown in table 1 the simulated values of the model were compared with the measured values of field water storage and field runoff in 2016 and the comparative results in fig 6 show that the simulated and measured trends for field water level and field runoff were almost identical the absolute error range of the daily field water storage was 0 1996 0 2034 mm and its relative error was 0 2663 2 4943 5 0000 5 0000 the absolute error range of the daily underground return flow through field seepage was 0 2183 0 1853 mm and its relative error was 0 6602 1 9829 5 0000 5 0000 these results demonstrate that the field water system dynamics model can simulate the field water balance process well 4 2 return flow simulation analysis the field return flow was simulated using the established field water system dynamics model for the hu lanhe irrigation area in 2016 the simulation results in fig 7 show that the range of the surface return flow was 0 4 58 mm d the range of the underground return flow was 0 1 99 mm d and the range of the total return flow was 0 6 30 mm d the cumulative surface return flow was higher than that of the underground return flow which accounted for 65 53 of the total return flow the change trends in the surface return flow and the total return flow were similar overall thus showing that the effect of the surface return flow on the total return flow was larger than that of the underground return flow throughout the entire process furthermore the similarity of the trends of the underground return flow and the surface return flow was low overall and the overall trend of the groundwater return flow was complex furthermore there was a lag between the underground return flow and the surface return flow and the peak level of underground return flow generally lagged behind that of the surface return flow by more than 1 day the return flow significantly decreased when entering the growth period of the milk and yellow ripe stage during this stage the similarity of the trends of the total return flow and surface return water was more obvious because of the reduction of underground return water in the milk and yellow ripe stage growth period when the total water inflow the sum of precipitation and irrigation water was high the total return flow was high thus the larger the total water inflow is the larger the total return flow however the trends of the total water inflow and total return flow were not fully synchronized when the water level of the total water inflow was significantly higher than the field ridge height the surface return flow played a decisive role in the total return flow and the surface return flow increased significantly as the total return flow increased therefore when the total water inflow increased the surface return flow and the total return flow both increased when the water level of total water inflow was lower than the field ridge height the total return flow was influenced by both the surface return flow and the underground return flow in this situation the trends of the surface return flow underground return flow and total return flow were more complex the surface return flow was affected by factors such as instantaneous precipitation or a continuous irrigation operation while the underground water return was influenced by the field water level which reduced the significance of the trend of the total return flow therefore the trends of the total water inflow and the total return flow were not synchronous under these conditions 4 3 influencing factor analysis of the return flow 4 3 1 field ridge layout factor the return flows for different field ridge heights lengths and widths were simulated according to the field system dynamics model established to analyze the trends in the return flow under different field ridge layout conditions as shown in fig 8 the total return flow decreased with increasing field ridge height when only the field ridge height was changed because the field ridge height had a major impact on the surface return flow when the field ridge height was equal to or less than 10 mm the surface return flow was approximately equal to the total return flow and when the field ridge height increased the surface return flow and total return flow decreased when only the field ridge length was changed the total return flow increased with increasing field ridge length when only the field ridge width was changed the total return flow decreased with increasing field ridge width the field ridge width influenced both the field seepage flow and the ridge seepage flow but the impact on the ridge seepage flow was more significant the field ridge seepage flow showed a linear decreasing trend with increasing field ridge width therefore for field management and planning it is necessary to increase the field ridge height and reasonably adjust the field ridge length and field ridge width proportions in order to reduce the return flow 4 3 2 water inflow factor the 6 years of field data collected between 2011 and 2016 were entered into the established field water system dynamics model to analyze the variations in the return flow under different water inflow levels the simulated results of the return flow are shown in table 2 the 2011 2016 return flow coefficient of irrigation ranged from 0 5825 to 0 6395 and the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation ranged from 0 2734 to 0 3386 the volatility in the 2 indicators over the 6 years was not significant and the range of the return flow coefficient of irrigation was greater than that of the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation this difference was because the precipitation amounts were uncertain and belonged to the effective use of water for corp thus using the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation to characterize the reuse of the return flow is more in keeping with the actual situation the trends between the irrigation water and precipitation values and the total return flow were determined in order to analyze the relationships between these factors fig 9 the fitting curve for the total return flow and irrigation water has an r 2 of 0 9176 a rmse of 0 038 a significance of p 0 01 residual satisfies normal distribution and can thus be considered a good fit hence with increasing irrigation water the total return flow showed a significant increase the fitting curve for the total return flow and precipitation has a low r2 of 0 3472 a rmse of 24 484 a significance of p 0 1 and the residuals do not satisfy the normal distribution the total return flow first decreased and then increased with increasing precipitation which differs from the sustainability and stability associated with irrigation water this trend occurred because the sudden and ephemeral nature of precipitation when short term precipitation occurred the field water level was below the field ridge height the precipitation was primarily consumed by crops and a small amount of water remained for the field seepage thus the total return flow was low when the water level of precipitation was greater than the field ridge height the surface return flow increased which led to a gradual increase in the total return flow additional quantitative analysis was performed on the relationships among irrigation water precipitation surface return flow underground return flow and total return flow the fitting results are presented in table 3 y is the fitting line of the precipitation irrigation water and total return flow the total return flow was negatively correlated with precipitation and positively correlated with irrigation water and the regression coefficient of the irrigation water was much higher than that of precipitation indicating that the effect of irrigation water on the total return flow was much greater than the effect of precipitation on the total return flow y 1 is the fitting line of the precipitation irrigation water and surface return flow the surface return flow was positively correlated with both the precipitation and irrigation water and the impact of irrigation water on the surface return flow was greater than that of precipitation according to the regression coefficients y 2 is the fitting line of the precipitation irrigation water and underground return flow the underground return flow was negatively correlated with precipitation and positively correlated with irrigation water and the impact of irrigation water was greater than that of the precipitation on the groundwater return flow 5 discussion thus far because of the inconvenience involved in measuring the return flow the study of the return flow at different scales has been simulated by water balance models such as the swat and modflow models kim et al 2009 khadri and pande 2016 wu et al 2019 field scale simulation of return flow is the basis of the return flow estimates at different scales and the simulation accuracy of return flow at the field scale was higher than that at larger scales zhang et al 2005 this research adopts the system dynamics model based on the principle of water balance to simulate field return flow cui et al 2014 used this method to simulate the field return flow of an irrigation area with abundant water resources in the southern irrigation area of china the relative error of the simulated field water storage was less than 2 in the study by zhang et al 2005 while the deviation range of the simulated field water storage in our study was 0 1996 0 2034 mm and the relative error was 0 2663 2 4943 thus the simulated field water storages were basically consistent with the actual field water storages in both studies which shows that the system dynamics model is applicable for the simulation of field water balance process in both humid and semiarid regions however the simulation accuracy of our research was lower than that of zhang et al 2005 and this difference occurred because the precipitation in our study was less than that in zhang et al 2005 with additional years of continuous simulation repetitions in this region the simulation accuracy of the model could be further verified and improved by optimizing model according to many years of actual experimental observation the trend of the surface return flow was similar to that of the total return flow and variation in the underground return flow was not obvious hence the results of our research were consistent with previous research results in that the surface water flow accounted for 65 53 of the total return flow in our research compared to 70 on average in the research of cui et al 2014 the proportions of surface return flow to total flow in both studies were both greater than 50 but the proportion in our study is lower than that in cui et al 2014 the reasons for these differences may be related to the soil type channel lining and ground slope fei et al 2015 the causes of the different proportions of surface water to groundwater in different regions in response to an increase in the amount of field return flow data must be further explored in this research the influencing factors of field ridge height width and length on the return flow were analyzed the total return flow decreased with increasing field ridge height and width and it increased with increasing field ridge length these results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2005 there were no differences in the variation in the return flow among different field layouts or different climatic or water resource conditions the relationship between the water inflow and the total return flow was analyzed on the basis of simulating the trend of the return flow which has been an added component of systematic research on return flow in typical semiarid areas a set of relatively complete research findings on field return flow has been gathered for the simulation of field return flow the analysis of influencing factors the impacts of irrigation and precipitation on the return flow and the quantitative analysis of the return flow and water inflow this research could be provide a theoretical reference for the maximum reuse of return flow at the field scale the implementation of water saving strategies and the study of return flow at other scales this study simulated the trends of return water of 6 years from 2011 to 2016 to further discuss the trends of return flow under different climatic conditions in this research area the precipitation of 1986 2016 in this area which were obtained by collection of meteorological data were entered to the established model to simulate the reuse of return water under 3 hydrological years which were the dry year precipitation frequency is 90 the normal year precipitation frequency is 50 and the wet year precipitation frequency is 10 it can be seen from fig 10 Œ∑i p dry Œ∑i p normal Œ∑i p wet Œ∑i dry Œ∑i normal Œ∑i wet these results are the same as that of wu et al 2019 in dry year the water inflow was mainly irrigation water and the reused return flow was mainly the irrigation return flow into the branch canal hence Œ∑i more larger than Œ∑i p in wet year the precipitation was relatively large the inflow of precipitation was dominated the reused return flows were mainly the precipitation return flows into the field so Œ∑i p was nearly to Œ∑i wu et al 2019 the research region in this study was a high latitude area located in the cold temperate zone the results of this study were compared with those other studies that focused on areas with different climatic conditions table 4 lists the results of several similar field return flow studies the field return flow is related to the regional natural conditions precipitation conditions and other climatic conditions zareeian et al 2017 li et al 2018 kim et al 2009 table 4 shows that the larger the precipitation is the smaller the return flow coefficient of irrigation and precipitation this result will be influenced by environmental factors such as crop species and soil types however due to the limited number of comparative samples this conclusion needs to be further verified 6 conclusions the field water system dynamics model was established by the principle of water balance which the variables of irrigation water precipitation evapotranspiration field water storage soil water storage field seepage flow ridge seepage flow surface runoff surface leakage deep leakage and field runoff were entered the established model was tested by measured data in 2016 of crop growth period in the hu lanhe irrigation area the test results indicated the precision of the established model was adequate based on the results return flow for consecutive years can be simulated by entering the irrigation water and precipitation into the established model which is convenient to study its change low and analyze its influencing factors in local irrigation area in addition the field water system dynamics model can compensate for the deficiencies of the experiment which cannot change various scenarios it is convenient to simulate and analyze the variations in return flow in different scenarios in terms of field ridge size climate and region the modeling method of field water system dynamics model is applicable to different regions but the results of model optimization parameters in this study are not applicable to all regions for irrigation areas under different climatic conditions it is suggested to enter some experimental data to optimize parameters and then simulate the return flow so as to ensure the accuracy of the results more research of field water system dynamics model in different regions and considering the complex relations of variables in the model are needed to simulate the return flow more accurately acknowledgments this research has been

10882,low precipitation and temperature fluctuations are key limiting factors that influence the potato tuber yield in rainfed areas of the loess plateau china the implementation of tillage with mulching during fallow after the autumn harvest may be an effective management strategy to help reduce soil evaporation and conserve more soil water for spring sown potato we conducted a three year field experiment in a semiarid area of the loess plateau in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 to study the interactive effects of autumn tillage and mulching practices during fallow on the soil temperature moisture tuber yield and water use efficiency of potato the treatments comprised three tillage systems in the main plots i e no tillage nt subsoiling st and plowing tillage pt and three mulching methods in the subplots i e straw mulch sm plastic film mulch pm and no mulch nm in a replicated split plot design autumn tillage with mulching during fallow significantly influenced the soil water storage especially in the early growing season of potato among the mulching methods sm and pm increased the mean soil water storage by 6 3 and 5 9 p 0 05 respectively compared with the nm plots conservation tillage combined with pm nt pm and st pm significantly increased the topsoil temperature whereas conservation tillage combined with sm nt sm and st sm significantly decreased the temperature which could have improved the topsoil conditions for potato tuber yield formation in the three experimental years among the tillage systems the pm plots increased the mean topsoil temperature by 2 4 c p 0 05 whereas the sm plots reduced the temperature by 3 0 c p 0 05 during the whole period the beneficial effects of the changes in moisture and temperature in the pm and sm plots improved the tuber yield of potato in comparison with nm plots tillage and mulching had significant interaction effects on the potato tuber yield and water use efficiency the highest mean potato tuber yields were obtained in the st sm and nt sm treatments respectively which were 41 0 and 35 3 higher p 0 05 than those with the pt nm treatment the three year mean water use efficiency increased significantly by 50 5 and 39 9 p 0 05 under the st sm and nt sm treatments respectively and the three year mean rainwater use efficiency increased by 30 and 29 p 0 05 when compared with ct nm treatment overall our findings demonstrate that conservation tillage with sm and pm significantly increased the potato tuber yield and water use efficiency considering the years with warm and dry climate conditions we recommend conservation tillage with sm may be a more efficient method for improving the potato productivity wue and rue in the semiarid region of the loess plateau keywords autumn tillage with mulching potato tuber yield semiarid area of loess plateau soil moisture and temperature water use efficiency 1 introduction the loess plateau is a typical rainfed semiarid area for crop production in china where scarce precipitation and low water availability comprise the main constraint that limits dryland farming in this area zhang et al 2013 dryland agro ecosystems are affected by precipitation in the arid and semiarid regions of southern ningxia where agricultural production is completely dependent on natural precipitation hou et al 2011 thus rainfall is the major water resource for agricultural productivity li et al 2004 however rainfall is limited and high evaporation often limits crop yields in this area li et al 2013 therefore it is essential to efficiently exploit rainwater resources to maximize crop yield and rainwater use efficiency rue which requires both better methods of capturing rainfall and reducing evaporation conventional tillage e g plowing and harrowing straw removal and fallow are widely used after harvesting the crop to maximize the retention of limited precipitation resources su et al 2007 however conventional tillage combined with bare soil leads to a shallow arable layer and a thickened subsurface soil layer zhang et al 2018 as a consequence the fields become waterlogged when adequate rainfall occurs but excessively dry with inadequate rainfall which causes unstable and declining crop yields fabrizzi et al 2005 hou et al 2011 improved tillage methods can improve the soil properties and water use efficiency wue bottinelli et al 2017 therefore after harvesting the previous crop in a rainfed area more soil water is usually obtained with conservation tillage and mulching to further improve the crop yield and wue conservation tillage no tillage nt or subsoiling st with mulching is a promising approach for conserving soil water regulating the hydrothermal status of the topsoil and improving the crop yield and wue he et al 2009 su et al 2007 tao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 nt and st can conserve more soil water by increasing water infiltration and decreasing evaporation to increase the soil water available for crop growth hou et al 2011 mohanty et al 2007 at present plastic film mulch pm and straw mulch sm are employed widely in dryland farming production yang et al 2018 pm has advantages in terms of increasing the soil temperature and water storage but white pollution caused by long term use of pm has become a widespread environmental problem chen et al 2015 sm can reduce evaporation increase the soil water content and enhance crop growth to increase the crop yield and wue he et al 2009 however sm may reduce the temperature during the seedling stage and ultimately lead to crop failure zhang et al 2011 the advantages of combining tillage with mulching for conserving soil moisture are recognized by many researchers tillage with pm can modify the soil environment to enhance the profitable production of the important crop cocoyam in tropical climates anikwe et al 2007 nt with sm can minimize the disruption of the soil structure as well as reducing soil erosion and runoff to increase the soil water capacity and wue sharma et al 2011 st with sm may break the hardpan or soil compacted layer to improve water infiltration tao et al 2015 thus according to previous studies combining tillage with various mulching practices is promising for improving the soil water storage crop yield and wue many studies have evaluated the positive effects of tillage combined with mulching practices in rainfed areas but it is still necessary to consider the interactive effects of tillage combined with mulching on the soil micro environment crop yield and wue in order to identify the most effective technique for adaptation to variable climatic conditions pm gradually decreases the topsoil temperature during potato growth and development wang et al 2005 but applying pm for the whole growth period can considerably reduce the tuber yield because consistently high temperatures in midsummer subject plants to heat stress zhao et al 2012 therefore other methods should be considered such as sm fan et al 2012 or removing the film mulch zhao et al 2012 maintaining soil moisture content and improving wue and rue are key factors in a rain fed farming system in which annual precipitation exceeds evaporation deng et al 2006 turner 2004 the wue was estimated as the crop yield divided by the growing season evapotranspiration and rue of the annual rainfall was calculated by dividing the crop yield by the annual rainfall this is especially the case in semi arid areas such as the ningxia province field site where there is a large amount of evaporation jia et al 2017 additionally in recent years high temperatures and evaporation levels as well as an uneven distribution of rainfall have resulted in more frequent droughts during the crop growing season more than 40 of fallow period rainfall is lost through evaporation before it can infiltrate the soil and be used by plants hou and li 2018 therefore storing rainfall during the fallow period to supplement water for the subsequent crop season is crucial for increasing crop yields wue and rue previous studies in the areas where tillage has been combined with mulching practice indicate that it is important to enhance the wue and rue in order to develop the potato industry in variable climate regions zhao et al 2014 in this study we conducted a three year field experiment to explore the interactive effects of tillage combined with various mulching practices during fallow after harvesting the autumn crop in a rainfed semiarid area three tillage systems nt st and plowing tillage pt and three mulching methods plastic film straw and no mulch nm were compared to determine their effects on potato production wue and rue we hypothesized that i the soil temperature and water characteristics during the potato growing stages would differ with various tillage and mulching practices and ii the potato tuber yield wue and rue would also be affected by these methods we aimed to identify the most promising approach for modifying the moisture and temperature regimes during the potato growing stages in order to improve the potato tuber yield wue and rue in a semiarid area of loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1

recorded at 08 00 h 10 00 h 12 00 h 14 00 h 16 00 h and 18 00 h daily for three consecutive days during each seedling 30 das squaring 60 das tuber initiation 90 das tuber expansion 120 das and harvest 150 das period for the potatoes in 2014 2016 the mean daily soil temperature was calculated as the average of the three daily readings 2 4 2 soil water storage and evapotranspiration soil water content was determined in each plot by taking three random soil core samples using a steel core sampling tube with a diameter of 54 mm which was manually driven to a depth of 2 0 m during each sowing 0 das seedling 30 das squaring 60 das tuber initiation 90 das tuber expansion 120 das and harvest 150 das period for the potatoes in 2014 2016 samples were collected at every 20 cm from the 20 200 cm soil layer the soil cores were weighed wet dried in a fan assisted oven set at 105 c for 48 h and weighed again to determine the soil water content meanwhile three random soil samples were taken from 0 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals using a 54 mm diameter steel core sampling tube in each plot the soil cores were weighed wet dried at 105 c for 48 h and weighed again to determine bulk density the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density to obtain the volumetric water content soil water storage mm was calculated for each 2 0 m profile by multiplying the soil volumetric water content by the soil depth evapotranspiration et for individual plots was determined for seasonal total and between the growing stages using the soil water balance equation as follows huang et al 2005 1 et p i c d r w where p is the rainfall during the crop growing season i is the irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and w is the change in water content of the soil profile 0 2 0 m depth between planting and harvest period or between the growth stages in this experiment there is no irrigation so i in eqs 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant consequently et 1 can be reduced to et p Œ¥w 2 4 3 tuber yield the total tubers per plot were weighed to determine the yield and for assessing the yield components the total tubers per plot were weighed to determine the tuber yield and to conduct assessments of the yield components tuber yield data were calculated and reported on an area basis t ha 1 for all treatments 2 4 4 water use efficiency wue and rainwater use efficiency rue the wue kg mm 1 ha 1 and rue kg mm 1 ha 1 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively as described by huang et al 2005 and hou et al 2011 2 wue y et 3 rue y r where y is the crop yield et is the evapotranspiration during the entire growth period and r is the annual rainfall october september in the following year 2 5 statistical analysis the data were tested by analysis of variance using spss 22 0 where the data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately mean values from treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if the f tests were significant at a probability level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil temperature 3 1 1 diurnal changes in topsoil temperature the daily fluctuations in the topsoil temperature 0 25 cm under tillage and mulch management were primarily detected in the seedling stage 30 das during 2014 2016 fig 2 the mean daily topsoil temperature was significantly different in the mulched and nm plots under the same tillage system whereas the temperatures in the tillage systems with the same mulching method did not differ significantly the soil temperature was highest in the pm plots and the soil temperature in the sm plots was lower than that in the nm plots at the same time of day these results are consistent with those obtained by anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2016 and zhao et al 2012 who found that tillage treatments did not significantly affect the soil temperature pm always increased the daily soil temperature and sm decreased the daily soil temperature in the daytime compared with nm during emergence in all experimental years pm may have eliminated the latent heat exchange in the soil alleviated sensible heat transfer in the soil and inhibited the effective emission and radiation in the night time to increase the topsoil temperature gan et al 2013 yang et al 2018 in addition the soil temperatures were lower under sm than nm sarkar et al 2007 possibly due to the lower transmissivity of sm ghosh et al 2006 irrespective of the tillage system the soil temperatures in all of the mulching plots increased rapidly after 08 00 h and reached a peak at 14 00 h followed by a rapid decrease after 18 00 h fig 2a i as also found in a previous study subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 the uses of different mulching materials in the same tillage system had different warming and cooling effects on the daily soil temperature in our experiment during the three years the order of the warming effect with different mulching methods was pm sm nm and the order of the cooling effect was pm sm nm fig 2 the increases and decreases in the topsoil temperature depended on the different mulching materials in each of the experimental years li et al 2016 the temperature increases and decreases in 2014 were pm nm sm under the same tillage system fig 2a c similar results were obtained in 2015 fig 2d f and 2016 fig 2g i these results indicated that the pm plots had higher temperature increases than the sm plots but the sm plots had higher temperature decreases chen et al 2014 li et al 2009 reported that the order of the temperature increase with different mulching materials was pm nm sm and the order of the temperature decrease was nm pm sm li et al 2010 found that pm and sm caused significant increases and decreases in the temperature respectively which mainly occurred in the seedling stage our results are consistent with those reported previously chen et al 2014 li et al 2009 2010 the daily average topsoil temperatures in the pm and sm plots were lowest at 8 00 h and the difference was the smallest compared with the nm plots the temperature was highest at 14 00 h and the difference was also the largest the temperature was moderate at 18 00 h these findings agree with those obtained by chen et al 2007 and cai et al 2013 at 8 00 h 14 00 h and 18 00 h the average topsoil temperature was 3 0 c 5 9 c higher p 0 05 in the pm plots compared with the nm plots whereas the mean topsoil temperature was 1 3 c 4 2 c lower p 0 05 in the sm plots compared with the nm plots the topsoil temperatures in all of the treatments were in the range for rapid germination 18 c to 25 c which is not the main limiting factor for the early growth of potatoes hou et al 2018 conservation tillage nt and st combined with pm and sm increased and decreased the topsoil temperature respectively but these effects depended on the variable climate conditions tillage management and mulching materials in each of the experimental years 3 1 2 topsoil temperature in the 0 25 cm depth the changes in the topsoil temperature in different layers under tillage and mulch management were primarily determined in three potato growing periods during 2014 2016 i e the squaring fig 3 tuber initiation fig 4 and tuber expansion stages fig 5 the seasonal or annual dynamics of the topsoil temperature were similar in all of the treatments and they were influenced by the daily air temperature and precipitation yang et al 2018 as the soil depth increased the topsoil temperature generally decreased in all of the treatments irrespective of the specific tillage system the mean topsoil temperature was consistently highest in the pm plots and lowest in the sm plots during 2014 2016 the topsoil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm were significantly higher in the pm plots than those in the sm and nm plots during the three potato growth stages the average topsoil temperature in the pm plots was significantly higher than that in the nm plots however the topsoil temperatures in the sm plots were significantly lower than those in the nm plots during the squaring 60 das fig 3 tuber initiation 90 das fig 4 and tuber expansion stages 120 das fig 5 other studies also found that the highest soil temperatures were mainly in the no till pm plots and tilled pm plots whereas the sm plots had the lowest soil temperatures at different times after planting anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2009 possibly because pm increased the topsoil temperature and sm decreased the topsoil temperature fabrizzi et al 2005 zhou et al 2009 however the significant interactive effects of the tillage with mulching practices on the topsoil temperature may depend on the crop growing period in different experimental years sarkar et al 2007 the effect of tillage and mulching on the topsoil temperature was higher during the early stages 60 das fig 3 among the three tillage systems compared with the nm plots the mean topsoil temperature increased by 2 6 c p 0 05 in the pm plots but decreased by 3 1 c p 0 05 in the sm plots in 2014 fig 3a e and 2016 fig 3k o the interaction effects between the mulching methods under the same tillage system were significant on the topsoil temperatures in all layers and the interaction effects between the tillage systems with the same mulching method were significant on the soil temperatures in the 5 cm and 10 cm soil layers in 2015 fig 3f j the interaction effects of the tillage systems and the same mulching method were not significant on the topsoil temperatures in all layers however the interaction effects of the mulching methods with the same tillage system were significant during 2014 2016 the soil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm were significantly higher p 0 05 in the pm plots and they were significantly higher compared with the nm plots whereas the topsoil temperatures at these depths in the sm plots were significantly lower p 0 05 the maximum mean topsoil temperature was obtained in the nt pm treatment 26 3 c and the minimum in the pt sm treatment 19 7 c more of the soil surface was shaded as the plant canopy spread and the differences in the topsoil temperatures among the treatments gradually decreased during the middle of the growing season 90 das fig 4 under the three tillage systems compared with the nm plots the mean topsoil temperature was 2 5 c higher p 0 05 in the pm plots but 2 2 c lower p 0 05 in the sm plots in 2014 fig 4a e the tillage systems and the interactions between the tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the soil temperature in the 0 05 m and 0 10 m layers whereas the topsoil temperatures in the other layers were not affected significantly in 2015 fig 4f j and 2016 fig 4k o the topsoil temperatures in the 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 25 cm layers were not affected significantly by the tillage with mulching practices and the interaction of the tillage with mulching practices did not significantly influence the soil temperature in the 15 cm layer during the tuber initiation stage in 2014 2016 the soil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm in the pm plots were significantly higher p 0 05 compared with those in the nm plots whereas the soil temperatures in the sm plots were significantly lower p 0 05 during this period the maximum daily mean topsoil temperature was obtained in the pt pm treatment 25 6 c and the minimum in the nt sm treatment 20 0 c as the canopy developed during the mid late growing season 120 das fig 5 the topsoil temperature was lower in the pm and sm plots and the mean topsoil temperature in the pm plots was 2 1 c higher p 0 05 compared with that in the nm plots whereas that in the sm plots was 1 8 c lower p 0 05 this difference occurred because as the plant canopy increased in size more of the soil surface was shaded and the difference in the soil temperature between the mulched and nm plots decreased wang et al 2009 in 2014 fig 5a e the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the topsoil temperatures in all of the layers whereas the topsoil temperatures in all of the layers under the tillage systems with the same mulching measure and their interactions were not affected significantly in 2015 fig 5f j and 2016 fig 5k o the maximum daily mean topsoil temperature was obtained in the pt pm treatment and the minimum in the nt sm treatment during 2014 2016 at the end of the growing season 150 das there were no significant differences in the topsoil temperatures among all of the treatments although the soil temperature was slightly higher in the pm plots than the sm and nm plots under the same tillage system data not shown suitable soil temperatures during the early stage of crop growth can greatly accelerate seed germination and crop yields zhao et al 2012 2014 the soil temperature is significantly influenced by tillage and mulching choudhary et al 2013 tillage changes the soil physicochemical properties and affects the movement of heat through the soil to affect the soil temperature chen et al 2009 and mulching insulates the soil surface to increase the resistance to heat and vapor transfer li et al 2016 we found that tillage and mulching had similar effects on the topsoil temperature where the topsoil temperature in all of the treatments decreased gradually as the soil depth increased in each of the three experimental years similar findings were obtained by sarkar et al 2007 and choudhary et al 2013 pm for a short duration increased the topsoil temperature during the early growing season and reduced it later in the growing season this change is similar to that observed in a previous study were pm was applied to potatoes wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 in general sm and pm have opposite effects on the topsoil temperature throughout the growth period where sm has a significant cooling effect li et al 2018a in our study the topsoil temperature increased in the pm plots due to the reduced soil evaporation and latent heat loss cook et al 2006 whereas the albedo was greater in the sm plots and it blocked the solar energy from reaching the soil chen et al 2019 to reduce the topsoil temperature 3 2 soil water storage three years of tillage during the fallow period led to more effective storage of autumn and spring precipitation in the soil and the soil water storage before sowing stage of potato 0 das increased significantly to varying degrees under the different tillage and mulching practices fig 6 the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the soil water storage regardless of the tillage system the pm and sm plots significantly increased the soil water storage compared with the nm plots irrespective of the mulching method the soil water storage was improved significantly in the nt and st plots compared with the pt plots in 2014 fig 6a f the interaction effects of the tillage systems with the same mulching method were not significant on the soil water storage whereas the interaction effects of the mulching methods with the same tillage system significantly increased the soil water storage among all of the treatments the maximum soil water storage was obtained in the nt sm treatment which was 6 1 higher p 0 05 than that in the pt nm treatment in 2015 fig 6g l and 2016 fig 6m r the different tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the soil water storage compared with 2014 which was related to the fact that the fallow period precipitation levels were 112 9 mm in 2013 2014 131 5 mm in 2014 2015 and 120 6 mm in 2015 2016 the maximum soil water storage was obtained in the st plots followed by the nt plots during the two fallow seasons and the minimum soil water storage was obtained in the pt plots in the sowing stage the mean soil water storage levels in the sm and pm plots were 6 3 and 5 9 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with those in the nm plots during 2015 and 26 8 and 21 1 higher p 0 05 during 2016 the soil water storage was highest in the st sm treatment and lowest in the pt nm treatment the soil water storage levels with different tillage and mulching practices in the 0 2 0 m layer during the potato growing seasons in 2014 2016 are presented in fig 6 tillage with mulching practices retained more soil water in the 2 0 m layer during the fallow period to provide more soil water for the early potato growth 30 60 das during 2014 2016 the st plots had the highest mean soil water storage followed by the nt and pt plots among the three tillage systems in addition the maximum mean soil water storage levels were higher in the sm and pm plots than the nm plots the maximum mean soil water storage was obtained in the st sm treatment and the minimum in the pt nm treatment where the difference was 18 1 p 0 05 during the middle of the growing season 90 120 das potato growth enters a vigorous period and the crop water consumption increases strongly thus the soil water decreased sharply with all of the treatments irrespective of the tillage system the mean soil water storage levels were 373 6 354 6 and 316 6 mm in the sm pm and nm plots respectively similarly the mean soil water storage levels under the tillage systems were 347 5 353 6 and 343 8 mm in the nt st and pt plots respectively the mean soil water storage level was higher in the st sm treatment 382 0 mm followed by the st sm treatment 372 4 mm and it was lowest in the pt nm treatment 314 1 mm the potato entered the maturity stage at up to 150 das as the rainfall increased and the soil water status recovered in all of the treatments irrespective of the mulching measure the mean soil water storage under different tillage systems did not differ greatly under the different tillage systems during 2014 2016 the mean soil water storage levels in the pm and sm plots were 6 4 and 4 0 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with that in the nm plots the maximum mean soil water storage levels were obtained in the st sm and nt sm treatments which were 8 0 and 8 5 higher p 0 05 respectively than that in the pt nm treatment the storage and conservation of precipitation during the fallow stage after the crop harvest are affected by the tillage and mulching practices employed gao et al 1999 su et al 2007 thus st combined with ground surface mulching can significantly improve the soil water status and increase the soil water storage during the fallow season compared with conventional tillage li and hou 2015 we found that the soil water storage levels were highest in the nt sm and st sm treatments during the 3 year sowing periods of potato these results are similar to those obtained by zhang et al 2018 who showed that conservation tillage practices during the fallow period maintained higher soil water storage levels than conventional tillage with bare soil tillage with mulching can have positive effects on aggregation processes to enhance the water holding capacity thereby allowing the capture of more precipitation and conserving the soil water more efficiently li et al 2018b su et al 2007 found that the changes in the soil water storage under tillage and mulching practices differed among the growing seasons sharma et al 2011 showed that various tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the soil water in a three year study in the present study the interactive effects of autumn tillage with mulching significantly affected the soil water storage during the growing season thereby agreeing with the findings obtained in the studies mentioned above sharma et al 2011 su et al 2007 yang et al 2018 showed that sm and pm under conventional tillage and nt increased the soil moisture to some extent but tillage with mulching was better than sm at preserving the soil water however in the present study the st sm and nt sm treatments consistently achieved higher soil water storage levels from 30 das to 150 das in each year while the minimum soil water storage was obtained in the pt nm treatment the combinations of st and nt with sm could have decreased the soil disturbance and evaporation from the soil surface and promoted the infiltration of rainfall into deeper soil layers he et al 2009 whereas pt with nm led to relatively high evaporation he et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 3 3 tuber yield the crop yield was related to the tillage and mulching practices but also to the total rainfall and its distribution shao et al 2016 tao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 among the three years the highest potato tuber yield was obtained in 2014 fig 7 a followed by 2015 fig 7b and 2016 fig 7c during the study period the interaction effects of tillage and mulching practices on the potato yield differed significantly in 2014 fig 7a the interactions between the tillage systems and the same mulching method had no significant effects on the potato yield however the interactions between the mulching methods and the same tillage system had significant effects on the potato yield the maximum mean tuber yield 40 78 t ha 1 was obtained in the nt sm treatment which was 51 8 higher p 0 05 than that in the pt nm treatment the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the tuber yields in 2015 fig 7b and 2016 fig 7c the highest mean tuber yield was obtained in the st plots 16 29 t ha 1 followed by the nt 13 94 t ha 1 and pt plots 13 39 t ha 1 among the mulching plots the pm and sm plots had the highest mean tuber yields of 15 65 t ha 1 and 15 63 t ha 1 respectively and the lowest mean tuber yield of 12 34 t ha 1 was recorded in the nm plots the maximum mean tuber yield 18 64 t ha 1 was obtained in the st sm treatment which was 56 2 higher p 0 05 than that in the pt nm treatment 11 93 t ha 1 during the last two years of study the improved soil water and thermal condition due to tillage and mulching practices provided a better micro environment for potato growth and development to increase the tuber yield hou et al 2018 li and hou 2015 pervaiz et al 2009 concluded that different tillage systems had no significant effects on the maize grain yield whereas mulching and the interaction effect of tillage and mulching had significant effects gupta et al 2016 also found that there were no significant interaction or main treatment effects on the wheat grain yield in the first two years but the wheat yield was significantly lower under nt than conventional tillage in the third year in the present study the interaction effects of tillage and mulching practices on the potato yield differed significantly where the potato tuber yield was significantly higher under the nt sm and st sm treatments than the pt nm treatment these differences could be attributed to the better soil conditions under tillage with mulching during emergence anikwe et al 2007 hou and li 2018 we also found that the st plots obtained the highest average tuber yield followed by the nt plots under the same mulching methods the sm plots obtained the highest potato tuber yield followed by the pm plots among the three tillage systems which may be explained by the following reasons first conservation tillage led to greater rain storage in the soil during fallow which relieved the water stress and significantly increased the crop yield compared with conventional tillage hemmat and eskandari 2004 hou et al 2011 second pm could effectively improve the soil water content and topsoil temperature in the crop growing season gan et al 2013 but it hindered tuber bulking due to the higher temperatures in middle and late june or early july zhao et al 2012 however the increased moisture content with sm during the seedling period compensated for the effects of low temperatures on potato growth li et al 2017 the improved soil microenvironment could facilitate tuber formation to enhance the yield hou and li 2015 zhang et al 2011 3 4 et and wue in rainfed agriculture the water released via et comes partly from the growing season rainfall and partly from the pre planting stored soil water su et al 2007 the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the crop et during this three year study fig 7d f irrespective of the mulching method applied the et levels under all tillage systems increased from 307 6 mm nt to 340 9 mm st for all of the tillage systems the mean et levels were 305 1 332 5 and 297 1 mm during 2014 fig 7d in the sm pm and nm plots respectively 386 2 385 1 and 375 6 mm during 2015 fig 7e and 282 8 279 8 and 269 6 mm during 2016 fig 7f therefore there were significant differences in the crop et levels in the sm pm and nm plots where the highest mean crop et levels were obtained in the nt sm and st sm treatments which were 6 2 and 6 7 higher p 0 05 respectively than that in the pt nm treatment the variations in the wue and rue exhibited similar trends to the tuber yield fig 7g l in 2014 the mulching methods and the interactions between the tillage systems and mulching methods significantly affected the crop wue and rue whereas the tillage systems had no significant effects however the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions significantly improved the crop wue and rue in 2015 and 2016 the three year mean wue values were higher in the nt sm and st sm treatments where they were 37 7 and 43 8 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with that in the pt nm treatment fig 7g i similar to the wue the tillage systems mulching methods and their combinations had significant effects on the rue fig 7j l the highest rue value 62 4 was obtained in the st sm treatment followed by the nt sm treatment and the lowest rue value 41 5 was obtained in the pt nm treatment compared with the pt nm treatment the three year mean rue values were 50 5 and 39 9 higher p 0 05 in the st sm and nt sm treatments respectively the et wue and rue levels varied significantly with the growing season rainfall and agricultural management where the tillage with mulching during fallow promoted the better usage of fallow rainfall improved the soil water status reduced the crop water consumption and increased the wue and rue levels hou et al 2011 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 huang et al 2012 showed that various tillage practices combined with mulching significantly increased the soil water content thereby enhancing the wue in a semiarid region li et al 2018b found that mulched ridge tillage systems tended to increase the wue compared with ridge tillage and thus combining ridge tillage with mulching had a positive interaction effect on the wue level in the present study the wue and rue levels varied significantly throughout the whole rainfall season where conservation tillage st and nt combined with sm practices obtained higher wue and rue levels whereas the lower wue and rue values were achieved with pt nm the improvements in the wue and rue levels under tillage with mulching may be explained as follows first conservation tillage during fallow could effectively capture more rainfall and improve the soil water content before sowing chen et al 2015 second sm could significantly improve the crop wue by restricting the soil surface evaporation as well as increasing infiltration and soil water retention in this semiarid area cai et al 2015 wang et al 2011 third pt combined with nm which is applied widely in semiarid regions greatly increased the soil water loss via evaporation shao et al 2016 4 conclusion during the three year study period the tillage and mulching practices during fallow significantly influenced the soil water storage during the growing seasons of potato where the pm and sm plots under different tillage systems retained more soil moisture compared with the nm plots tillage combined with mulching made the topsoil warmer and wetter to ensure potato tuber formation with a high yield in all of the tillage systems sm was more effective than pm at increasing the potato tuber yield and wue particularly in warm and dry conditions the interactions between tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the potato tuber yield wue and rue in all treatments the maximum tuber yield wue and rue were obtained in the st sm and nt sm treatments whereas the pt nm treatment obtained the lowest results in conclusion conservation tillage with sm was favorable for improving the soil hydrothermal environment where it increased the potato tuber yield wue and rue 5 implications in the dryland farming region of southern ningxia china the planting area of commercial potato is 15 0 t ha 1 which accounts for about half of the annual potato production in ningxia however the mean tuber yield of potato in this region is 12 9 t ha 1 lower than national average level 17 0 t ha 1 and far lower than the world average level 20 1 t ha 1 the soil temperature and moisture were equally important for potato growth however in our present study water deficiency was the major factor that limited crop production due to the uneven distribution of precipitation whereas the soil temperature did not have important effects on potato productivity fm could effectively improve the topsoil temperature during the vegetative growing season but severe droughts and higher temperatures during the growing season could hinder potato tuber bulking and growth sm significantly increased the soil water storage but the low temperature under sm in the early growing season was identified an issue our results demonstrated that conserving the stored fallow period soil water by the tillage and mulching practices is fundamentally important for improving the potato productivity and wue however in conditions with low air temperatures and precipitation during the early growing season but higher air temperature during the later growing season it is important to consider replacing sm with pm under tillage systems or removing the application of pm at an appropriate time to obtain more favorable temperature and moisture conditions to improve the wue rue and tuber yield of potato declaration of competing interest

10882,low precipitation and temperature fluctuations are key limiting factors that influence the potato tuber yield in rainfed areas of the loess plateau china the implementation of tillage with mulching during fallow after the autumn harvest may be an effective management strategy to help reduce soil evaporation and conserve more soil water for spring sown potato we conducted a three year field experiment in a semiarid area of the loess plateau in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 to study the interactive effects of autumn tillage and mulching practices during fallow on the soil temperature moisture tuber yield and water use efficiency of potato the treatments comprised three tillage systems in the main plots i e no tillage nt subsoiling st and plowing tillage pt and three mulching methods in the subplots i e straw mulch sm plastic film mulch pm and no mulch nm in a replicated split plot design autumn tillage with mulching during fallow significantly influenced the soil water storage especially in the early growing season of potato among the mulching methods sm and pm increased the mean soil water storage by 6 3 and 5 9 p 0 05 respectively compared with the nm plots conservation tillage combined with pm nt pm and st pm significantly increased the topsoil temperature whereas conservation tillage combined with sm nt sm and st sm significantly decreased the temperature which could have improved the topsoil conditions for potato tuber yield formation in the three experimental years among the tillage systems the pm plots increased the mean topsoil temperature by 2 4 c p 0 05 whereas the sm plots reduced the temperature by 3 0 c p 0 05 during the whole period the beneficial effects of the changes in moisture and temperature in the pm and sm plots improved the tuber yield of potato in comparison with nm plots tillage and mulching had significant interaction effects on the potato tuber yield and water use efficiency the highest mean potato tuber yields were obtained in the st sm and nt sm treatments respectively which were 41 0 and 35 3 higher p 0 05 than those with the pt nm treatment the three year mean water use efficiency increased significantly by 50 5 and 39 9 p 0 05 under the st sm and nt sm treatments respectively and the three year mean rainwater use efficiency increased by 30 and 29 p 0 05 when compared with ct nm treatment overall our findings demonstrate that conservation tillage with sm and pm significantly increased the potato tuber yield and water use efficiency considering the years with warm and dry climate conditions we recommend conservation tillage with sm may be a more efficient method for improving the potato productivity wue and rue in the semiarid region of the loess plateau keywords autumn tillage with mulching potato tuber yield semiarid area of loess plateau soil moisture and temperature water use efficiency 1 introduction the loess plateau is a typical rainfed semiarid area for crop production in china where scarce precipitation and low water availability comprise the main constraint that limits dryland farming in this area zhang et al 2013 dryland agro ecosystems are affected by precipitation in the arid and semiarid regions of southern ningxia where agricultural production is completely dependent on natural precipitation hou et al 2011 thus rainfall is the major water resource for agricultural productivity li et al 2004 however rainfall is limited and high evaporation often limits crop yields in this area li et al 2013 therefore it is essential to efficiently exploit rainwater resources to maximize crop yield and rainwater use efficiency rue which requires both better methods of capturing rainfall and reducing evaporation conventional tillage e g plowing and harrowing straw removal and fallow are widely used after harvesting the crop to maximize the retention of limited precipitation resources su et al 2007 however conventional tillage combined with bare soil leads to a shallow arable layer and a thickened subsurface soil layer zhang et al 2018 as a consequence the fields become waterlogged when adequate rainfall occurs but excessively dry with inadequate rainfall which causes unstable and declining crop yields fabrizzi et al 2005 hou et al 2011 improved tillage methods can improve the soil properties and water use efficiency wue bottinelli et al 2017 therefore after harvesting the previous crop in a rainfed area more soil water is usually obtained with conservation tillage and mulching to further improve the crop yield and wue conservation tillage no tillage nt or subsoiling st with mulching is a promising approach for conserving soil water regulating the hydrothermal status of the topsoil and improving the crop yield and wue he et al 2009 su et al 2007 tao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 nt and st can conserve more soil water by increasing water infiltration and decreasing evaporation to increase the soil water available for crop growth hou et al 2011 mohanty et al 2007 at present plastic film mulch pm and straw mulch sm are employed widely in dryland farming production yang et al 2018 pm has advantages in terms of increasing the soil temperature and water storage but white pollution caused by long term use of pm has become a widespread environmental problem chen et al 2015 sm can reduce evaporation increase the soil water content and enhance crop growth to increase the crop yield and wue he et al 2009 however sm may reduce the temperature during the seedling stage and ultimately lead to crop failure zhang et al 2011 the advantages of combining tillage with mulching for conserving soil moisture are recognized by many researchers tillage with pm can modify the soil environment to enhance the profitable production of the important crop cocoyam in tropical climates anikwe et al 2007 nt with sm can minimize the disruption of the soil structure as well as reducing soil erosion and runoff to increase the soil water capacity and wue sharma et al 2011 st with sm may break the hardpan or soil compacted layer to improve water infiltration tao et al 2015 thus according to previous studies combining tillage with various mulching practices is promising for improving the soil water storage crop yield and wue many studies have evaluated the positive effects of tillage combined with mulching practices in rainfed areas but it is still necessary to consider the interactive effects of tillage combined with mulching on the soil micro environment crop yield and wue in order to identify the most effective technique for adaptation to variable climatic conditions pm gradually decreases the topsoil temperature during potato growth and development wang et al 2005 but applying pm for the whole growth period can considerably reduce the tuber yield because consistently high temperatures in midsummer subject plants to heat stress zhao et al 2012 therefore other methods should be considered such as sm fan et al 2012 or removing the film mulch zhao et al 2012 maintaining soil moisture content and improving wue and rue are key factors in a rain fed farming system in which annual precipitation exceeds evaporation deng et al 2006 turner 2004 the wue was estimated as the crop yield divided by the growing season evapotranspiration and rue of the annual rainfall was calculated by dividing the crop yield by the annual rainfall this is especially the case in semi arid areas such as the ningxia province field site where there is a large amount of evaporation jia et al 2017 additionally in recent years high temperatures and evaporation levels as well as an uneven distribution of rainfall have resulted in more frequent droughts during the crop growing season more than 40 of fallow period rainfall is lost through evaporation before it can infiltrate the soil and be used by plants hou and li 2018 therefore storing rainfall during the fallow period to supplement water for the subsequent crop season is crucial for increasing crop yields wue and rue previous studies in the areas where tillage has been combined with mulching practice indicate that it is important to enhance the wue and rue in order to develop the potato industry in variable climate regions zhao et al 2014 in this study we conducted a three year field experiment to explore the interactive effects of tillage combined with various mulching practices during fallow after harvesting the autumn crop in a rainfed semiarid area three tillage systems nt st and plowing tillage pt and three mulching methods plastic film straw and no mulch nm were compared to determine their effects on potato production wue and rue we hypothesized that i the soil temperature and water characteristics during the potato growing stages would differ with various tillage and mulching practices and ii the potato tuber yield wue and rue would also be affected by these methods we aimed to identify the most promising approach for modifying the moisture and temperature regimes during the potato growing stages in order to improve the potato tuber yield wue and rue in a semiarid area of loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1

growing season may september volumes were 283 4 331 7 and 248 4 mm according to the 40 year precipitation 430 5 mm and growing season precipitation 337 8 mm data the growing season was relatively dry in 2013 2014 normal in 2015 2016 and dry in 2014 2015 the experimental field was flat with a calcic cambisol soil sand 14 silt 26 clay 60 and a mean bulk density of 1 35g cm 3 according to the fao unesco soil classification fao unesco 1993 the basic soil chemical properties 0 0 40 m comprised an organic matter content of 7 5 g kg 1 and the available n p2o5 and k2o levels were 58 6 8 4 and 90 5 mg kg 1 respectively the study site was used to produce spring maize and it was then left for 6 months under winter and spring fallow after the harvest total rainfall of 120 mm was received after the rainy season pt was practiced before the experiment irrigation was not applied during the study 2 2 experimental design the experiment tested three tillage systems i e nt st and pt and three mulching methods i e sm pm and nm the trial was laid out in a split plot design with three replicates tillage systems were placed in the main plots and mulching methods in the subplots a schematic diagram showing the experimental design is presented in table 1 tillage was established on 30 4 m strips and three mulching practices were randomly allocated to subplots measuring 9 4 m in each tillage system each plot was separated by a 1 m pathway to prevent runoff from one plot to the next when tillage was conducted 2 3 tillage and crop management all of the tillage operations were performed before applying the mulching material to each subplot nt was applied after the previous crop harvest and potatoes were drilled directly in all of the plots during late april in the following year st was performed using a subsoiling chisel point with adjustable wings which was designed at the china agricultural university in 1992 li et al 2000 the soil was plowed to a depth of 30 35 cm with 40 cm between the plowing strips and was not turned over pt involved deep plowing to a depth of 20 cm using a tractor mounted moldboard plow and harrowing to a depth of 15 cm followed by tine tillage according to the local fertilizer application practices the same quantities of chemical nitrogen fertilizer urea n 46 diammonium phosphate n 18 p2o5 46 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 were applied at application rates of 150 150 and 150 kg ha 1 respectively to each plot before the autumn tillage operation an additional 50 kg ha 1 of urea was applied as a top dressing at 60 days after sowing das the tillage systems were applied after the previous crop harvest and mulching methods were then applied to the soil surface of each tillage plot the plastic film transparent 0 008 mm thick was produced by the gansu qiyang plastic plant gansu china maize straw was cut into lengths of 15 cm and applied uniformly at a rate of 9000 kg ha 1 after plant growth cai et al 2015 sm was applied by hand potatoes longshu no 3 were planted at a rate of 50 000 plants ha 1 using a hole sowing machine on april 28 2014 may 2 2015 and may 8 2016 and the corresponding harvest dates were october 3 2014 september 23 2015 and october 5 2016 all treatments had the same row wide spacing 60 cm and narrow plant spacing 40 cm with flat cultivation in the three year study the seed potato tubers were planted with wide inter row spacings at a depth of 10 cm the holes were sealed with moist soil after planting excluding the tillage and mulching practices the sowing fertilization and weed control processes were identical in all plots 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 soil temperature the topsoil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm between two plants in the middle of each plot were recorded at 08 00 h 10 00 h 12 00 h 14 00 h 16 00 h and 18 00 h daily for three consecutive days during each seedling 30 das squaring 60 das tuber initiation 90 das tuber expansion 120 das and harvest 150 das period for the potatoes in 2014 2016 the mean daily soil temperature was calculated as the average of the three daily readings 2 4 2 soil water storage and evapotranspiration soil water content was determined in each plot by taking three random soil core samples using a steel core sampling tube with a diameter of 54 mm which was manually driven to a depth of 2 0 m during each sowing 0 das seedling 30 das squaring 60 das tuber initiation 90 das tuber expansion 120 das and harvest 150 das period for the potatoes in 2014 2016 samples were collected at every 20 cm from the 20 200 cm soil layer the soil cores were weighed wet dried in a fan assisted oven set at 105 c for 48 h and weighed again to determine the soil water content meanwhile three random soil samples were taken from 0 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals using a 54 mm diameter steel core sampling tube in each plot the soil cores were weighed wet dried at 105 c for 48 h and weighed again to determine bulk density the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density to obtain the volumetric water content soil water storage mm was calculated for each 2 0 m profile by multiplying the soil volumetric water content by the soil depth evapotranspiration et for individual plots was determined for seasonal total and between the growing stages using the soil water balance equation as follows huang et al 2005 1 et p i c d r w where p is the rainfall during the crop growing season i is the irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and w is the change in water content of the soil profile 0 2 0 m depth between planting and harvest period or between the growth stages in this experiment there is no irrigation so i in eqs 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant consequently et 1 can be reduced to et p Œ¥w 2 4 3 tuber yield the total tubers per plot were weighed to determine the yield and for assessing the yield components the total tubers per plot were weighed to determine the tuber yield and to conduct assessments of the yield components tuber yield data were calculated and reported on an area basis t ha 1 for all treatments 2 4 4 water use efficiency wue and rainwater use efficiency rue the wue kg mm 1 ha 1 and rue kg mm 1 ha 1 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively as described by huang et al 2005 and hou et al 2011 2 wue y et 3 rue y r where y is the crop yield et is the evapotranspiration during the entire growth period and r is the annual rainfall october september in the following year 2 5 statistical analysis the data were tested by analysis of variance using spss 22 0 where the data obtained from each sampling event were analyzed separately mean values from treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 if the f tests were significant at a probability level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil temperature 3 1 1 diurnal changes in topsoil temperature the daily fluctuations in the topsoil temperature 0 25 cm under tillage and mulch management were primarily detected in the seedling stage 30 das during 2014 2016 fig 2 the mean daily topsoil temperature was significantly different in the mulched and nm plots under the same tillage system whereas the temperatures in the tillage systems with the same mulching method did not differ significantly the soil temperature was highest in the pm plots and the soil temperature in the sm plots was lower than that in the nm plots at the same time of day these results are consistent with those obtained by anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2016 and zhao et al 2012 who found that tillage treatments did not significantly affect the soil temperature pm always increased the daily soil temperature and sm decreased the daily soil temperature in the daytime compared with nm during emergence in all experimental years pm may have eliminated the latent heat exchange in the soil alleviated sensible heat transfer in the soil and inhibited the effective emission and radiation in the night time to increase the topsoil temperature gan et al 2013 yang et al 2018 in addition the soil temperatures were lower under sm than nm sarkar et al 2007 possibly due to the lower transmissivity of sm ghosh et al 2006 irrespective of the tillage system the soil temperatures in all of the mulching plots increased rapidly after 08 00 h and reached a peak at 14 00 h followed by a rapid decrease after 18 00 h fig 2a i as also found in a previous study subrahmaniyan and zhou 2008 the uses of different mulching materials in the same tillage system had different warming and cooling effects on the daily soil temperature in our experiment during the three years the order of the warming effect with different mulching methods was pm sm nm and the order of the cooling effect was pm sm nm fig 2 the increases and decreases in the topsoil temperature depended on the different mulching materials in each of the experimental years li et al 2016 the temperature increases and decreases in 2014 were pm nm sm under the same tillage system fig 2a c similar results were obtained in 2015 fig 2d f and 2016 fig 2g i these results indicated that the pm plots had higher temperature increases than the sm plots but the sm plots had higher temperature decreases chen et al 2014 li et al 2009 reported that the order of the temperature increase with different mulching materials was pm nm sm and the order of the temperature decrease was nm pm sm li et al 2010 found that pm and sm caused significant increases and decreases in the temperature respectively which mainly occurred in the seedling stage our results are consistent with those reported previously chen et al 2014 li et al 2009 2010 the daily average topsoil temperatures in the pm and sm plots were lowest at 8 00 h and the difference was the smallest compared with the nm plots the temperature was highest at 14 00 h and the difference was also the largest the temperature was moderate at 18 00 h these findings agree with those obtained by chen et al 2007 and cai et al 2013 at 8 00 h 14 00 h and 18 00 h the average topsoil temperature was 3 0 c 5 9 c higher p 0 05 in the pm plots compared with the nm plots whereas the mean topsoil temperature was 1 3 c 4 2 c lower p 0 05 in the sm plots compared with the nm plots the topsoil temperatures in all of the treatments were in the range for rapid germination 18 c to 25 c which is not the main limiting factor for the early growth of potatoes hou et al 2018 conservation tillage nt and st combined with pm and sm increased and decreased the topsoil temperature respectively but these effects depended on the variable climate conditions tillage management and mulching materials in each of the experimental years 3 1 2 topsoil temperature in the 0 25 cm depth the changes in the topsoil temperature in different layers under tillage and mulch management were primarily determined in three potato growing periods during 2014 2016 i e the squaring fig 3 tuber initiation fig 4 and tuber expansion stages fig 5 the seasonal or annual dynamics of the topsoil temperature were similar in all of the treatments and they were influenced by the daily air temperature and precipitation yang et al 2018 as the soil depth increased the topsoil temperature generally decreased in all of the treatments irrespective of the specific tillage system the mean topsoil temperature was consistently highest in the pm plots and lowest in the sm plots during 2014 2016 the topsoil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm were significantly higher in the pm plots than those in the sm and nm plots during the three potato growth stages the average topsoil temperature in the pm plots was significantly higher than that in the nm plots however the topsoil temperatures in the sm plots were significantly lower than those in the nm plots during the squaring 60 das fig 3 tuber initiation 90 das fig 4 and tuber expansion stages 120 das fig 5 other studies also found that the highest soil temperatures were mainly in the no till pm plots and tilled pm plots whereas the sm plots had the lowest soil temperatures at different times after planting anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2009 possibly because pm increased the topsoil temperature and sm decreased the topsoil temperature fabrizzi et al 2005 zhou et al 2009 however the significant interactive effects of the tillage with mulching practices on the topsoil temperature may depend on the crop growing period in different experimental years sarkar et al 2007 the effect of tillage and mulching on the topsoil temperature was higher during the early stages 60 das fig 3 among the three tillage systems compared with the nm plots the mean topsoil temperature increased by 2 6 c p 0 05 in the pm plots but decreased by 3 1 c p 0 05 in the sm plots in 2014 fig 3a e and 2016 fig 3k o the interaction effects between the mulching methods under the same tillage system were significant on the topsoil temperatures in all layers and the interaction effects between the tillage systems with the same mulching method were significant on the soil temperatures in the 5 cm and 10 cm soil layers in 2015 fig 3f j the interaction effects of the tillage systems and the same mulching method were not significant on the topsoil temperatures in all layers however the interaction effects of the mulching methods with the same tillage system were significant during 2014 2016 the soil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm were significantly higher p 0 05 in the pm plots and they were significantly higher compared with the nm plots whereas the topsoil temperatures at these depths in the sm plots were significantly lower p 0 05 the maximum mean topsoil temperature was obtained in the nt pm treatment 26 3 c and the minimum in the pt sm treatment 19 7 c more of the soil surface was shaded as the plant canopy spread and the differences in the topsoil temperatures among the treatments gradually decreased during the middle of the growing season 90 das fig 4 under the three tillage systems compared with the nm plots the mean topsoil temperature was 2 5 c higher p 0 05 in the pm plots but 2 2 c lower p 0 05 in the sm plots in 2014 fig 4a e the tillage systems and the interactions between the tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the soil temperature in the 0 05 m and 0 10 m layers whereas the topsoil temperatures in the other layers were not affected significantly in 2015 fig 4f j and 2016 fig 4k o the topsoil temperatures in the 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 25 cm layers were not affected significantly by the tillage with mulching practices and the interaction of the tillage with mulching practices did not significantly influence the soil temperature in the 15 cm layer during the tuber initiation stage in 2014 2016 the soil temperatures at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm and 25 cm in the pm plots were significantly higher p 0 05 compared with those in the nm plots whereas the soil temperatures in the sm plots were significantly lower p 0 05 during this period the maximum daily mean topsoil temperature was obtained in the pt pm treatment 25 6 c and the minimum in the nt sm treatment 20 0 c as the canopy developed during the mid late growing season 120 das fig 5 the topsoil temperature was lower in the pm and sm plots and the mean topsoil temperature in the pm plots was 2 1 c higher p 0 05 compared with that in the nm plots whereas that in the sm plots was 1 8 c lower p 0 05 this difference occurred because as the plant canopy increased in size more of the soil surface was shaded and the difference in the soil temperature between the mulched and nm plots decreased wang et al 2009 in 2014 fig 5a e the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the topsoil temperatures in all of the layers whereas the topsoil temperatures in all of the layers under the tillage systems with the same mulching measure and their interactions were not affected significantly in 2015 fig 5f j and 2016 fig 5k o the maximum daily mean topsoil temperature was obtained in the pt pm treatment and the minimum in the nt sm treatment during 2014 2016 at the end of the growing season 150 das there were no significant differences in the topsoil temperatures among all of the treatments although the soil temperature was slightly higher in the pm plots than the sm and nm plots under the same tillage system data not shown suitable soil temperatures during the early stage of crop growth can greatly accelerate seed germination and crop yields zhao et al 2012 2014 the soil temperature is significantly influenced by tillage and mulching choudhary et al 2013 tillage changes the soil physicochemical properties and affects the movement of heat through the soil to affect the soil temperature chen et al 2009 and mulching insulates the soil surface to increase the resistance to heat and vapor transfer li et al 2016 we found that tillage and mulching had similar effects on the topsoil temperature where the topsoil temperature in all of the treatments decreased gradually as the soil depth increased in each of the three experimental years similar findings were obtained by sarkar et al 2007 and choudhary et al 2013 pm for a short duration increased the topsoil temperature during the early growing season and reduced it later in the growing season this change is similar to that observed in a previous study were pm was applied to potatoes wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 in general sm and pm have opposite effects on the topsoil temperature throughout the growth period where sm has a significant cooling effect li et al 2018a in our study the topsoil temperature increased in the pm plots due to the reduced soil evaporation and latent heat loss cook et al 2006 whereas the albedo was greater in the sm plots and it blocked the solar energy from reaching the soil chen et al 2019 to reduce the topsoil temperature 3 2 soil water storage three years of tillage during the fallow period led to more effective storage of autumn and spring precipitation in the soil and the soil water storage before sowing stage of potato 0 das increased significantly to varying degrees under the different tillage and mulching practices fig 6 the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the soil water storage regardless of the tillage system the pm and sm plots significantly increased the soil water storage compared with the nm plots irrespective of the mulching method the soil water storage was improved significantly in the nt and st plots compared with the pt plots in 2014 fig 6a f the interaction effects of the tillage systems with the same mulching method were not significant on the soil water storage whereas the interaction effects of the mulching methods with the same tillage system significantly increased the soil water storage among all of the treatments the maximum soil water storage was obtained in the nt sm treatment which was 6 1 higher p 0 05 than that in the pt nm treatment in 2015 fig 6g l and 2016 fig 6m r the different tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the soil water storage compared with 2014 which was related to the fact that the fallow period precipitation levels were 112 9 mm in 2013 2014 131 5 mm in 2014 2015 and 120 6 mm in 2015 2016 the maximum soil water storage was obtained in the st plots followed by the nt plots during the two fallow seasons and the minimum soil water storage was obtained in the pt plots in the sowing stage the mean soil water storage levels in the sm and pm plots were 6 3 and 5 9 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with those in the nm plots during 2015 and 26 8 and 21 1 higher p 0 05 during 2016 the soil water storage was highest in the st sm treatment and lowest in the pt nm treatment the soil water storage levels with different tillage and mulching practices in the 0 2 0 m layer during the potato growing seasons in 2014 2016 are presented in fig 6 tillage with mulching practices retained more soil water in the 2 0 m layer during the fallow period to provide more soil water for the early potato growth 30 60 das during 2014 2016 the st plots had the highest mean soil water storage followed by the nt and pt plots among the three tillage systems in addition the maximum mean soil water storage levels were higher in the sm and pm plots than the nm plots the maximum mean soil water storage was obtained in the st sm treatment and the minimum in the pt nm treatment where the difference was 18 1 p 0 05 during the middle of the growing season 90 120 das potato growth enters a vigorous period and the crop water consumption increases strongly thus the soil water decreased sharply with all of the treatments irrespective of the tillage system the mean soil water storage levels were 373 6 354 6 and 316 6 mm in the sm pm and nm plots respectively similarly the mean soil water storage levels under the tillage systems were 347 5 353 6 and 343 8 mm in the nt st and pt plots respectively the mean soil water storage level was higher in the st sm treatment 382 0 mm followed by the st sm treatment 372 4 mm and it was lowest in the pt nm treatment 314 1 mm the potato entered the maturity stage at up to 150 das as the rainfall increased and the soil water status recovered in all of the treatments irrespective of the mulching measure the mean soil water storage under different tillage systems did not differ greatly under the different tillage systems during 2014 2016 the mean soil water storage levels in the pm and sm plots were 6 4 and 4 0 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with that in the nm plots the maximum mean soil water storage levels were obtained in the st sm and nt sm treatments which were 8 0 and 8 5 higher p 0 05 respectively than that in the pt nm treatment the storage and conservation of precipitation during the fallow stage after the crop harvest are affected by the tillage and mulching practices employed gao et al 1999 su et al 2007 thus st combined with ground surface mulching can significantly improve the soil water status and increase the soil water storage during the fallow season compared with conventional tillage li and hou 2015 we found that the soil water storage levels were highest in the nt sm and st sm treatments during the 3 year sowing periods of potato these results are similar to those obtained by zhang et al 2018 who showed that conservation tillage practices during the fallow period maintained higher soil water storage levels than conventional tillage with bare soil tillage with mulching can have positive effects on aggregation processes to enhance the water holding capacity thereby allowing the capture of more precipitation and conserving the soil water more efficiently li et al 2018b su et al 2007 found that the changes in the soil water storage under tillage and mulching practices differed among the growing seasons sharma et al 2011 showed that various tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the soil water in a three year study in the present study the interactive effects of autumn tillage with mulching significantly affected the soil water storage during the growing season thereby agreeing with the findings obtained in the studies mentioned above sharma et al 2011 su et al 2007 yang et al 2018 showed that sm and pm under conventional tillage and nt increased the soil moisture to some extent but tillage with mulching was better than sm at preserving the soil water however in the present study the st sm and nt sm treatments consistently achieved higher soil water storage levels from 30 das to 150 das in each year while the minimum soil water storage was obtained in the pt nm treatment the combinations of st and nt with sm could have decreased the soil disturbance and evaporation from the soil surface and promoted the infiltration of rainfall into deeper soil layers he et al 2009 whereas pt with nm led to relatively high evaporation he et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 3 3 tuber yield the crop yield was related to the tillage and mulching practices but also to the total rainfall and its distribution shao et al 2016 tao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 among the three years the highest potato tuber yield was obtained in 2014 fig 7 a followed by 2015 fig 7b and 2016 fig 7c during the study period the interaction effects of tillage and mulching practices on the potato yield differed significantly in 2014 fig 7a the interactions between the tillage systems and the same mulching method had no significant effects on the potato yield however the interactions between the mulching methods and the same tillage system had significant effects on the potato yield the maximum mean tuber yield 40 78 t ha 1 was obtained in the nt sm treatment which was 51 8 higher p 0 05 than that in the pt nm treatment the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the tuber yields in 2015 fig 7b and 2016 fig 7c the highest mean tuber yield was obtained in the st plots 16 29 t ha 1 followed by the nt 13 94 t ha 1 and pt plots 13 39 t ha 1 among the mulching plots the pm and sm plots had the highest mean tuber yields of 15 65 t ha 1 and 15 63 t ha 1 respectively and the lowest mean tuber yield of 12 34 t ha 1 was recorded in the nm plots the maximum mean tuber yield 18 64 t ha 1 was obtained in the st sm treatment which was 56 2 higher p 0 05 than that in the pt nm treatment 11 93 t ha 1 during the last two years of study the improved soil water and thermal condition due to tillage and mulching practices provided a better micro environment for potato growth and development to increase the tuber yield hou et al 2018 li and hou 2015 pervaiz et al 2009 concluded that different tillage systems had no significant effects on the maize grain yield whereas mulching and the interaction effect of tillage and mulching had significant effects gupta et al 2016 also found that there were no significant interaction or main treatment effects on the wheat grain yield in the first two years but the wheat yield was significantly lower under nt than conventional tillage in the third year in the present study the interaction effects of tillage and mulching practices on the potato yield differed significantly where the potato tuber yield was significantly higher under the nt sm and st sm treatments than the pt nm treatment these differences could be attributed to the better soil conditions under tillage with mulching during emergence anikwe et al 2007 hou and li 2018 we also found that the st plots obtained the highest average tuber yield followed by the nt plots under the same mulching methods the sm plots obtained the highest potato tuber yield followed by the pm plots among the three tillage systems which may be explained by the following reasons first conservation tillage led to greater rain storage in the soil during fallow which relieved the water stress and significantly increased the crop yield compared with conventional tillage hemmat and eskandari 2004 hou et al 2011 second pm could effectively improve the soil water content and topsoil temperature in the crop growing season gan et al 2013 but it hindered tuber bulking due to the higher temperatures in middle and late june or early july zhao et al 2012 however the increased moisture content with sm during the seedling period compensated for the effects of low temperatures on potato growth li et al 2017 the improved soil microenvironment could facilitate tuber formation to enhance the yield hou and li 2015 zhang et al 2011 3 4 et and wue in rainfed agriculture the water released via et comes partly from the growing season rainfall and partly from the pre planting stored soil water su et al 2007 the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions had significant effects on the crop et during this three year study fig 7d f irrespective of the mulching method applied the et levels under all tillage systems increased from 307 6 mm nt to 340 9 mm st for all of the tillage systems the mean et levels were 305 1 332 5 and 297 1 mm during 2014 fig 7d in the sm pm and nm plots respectively 386 2 385 1 and 375 6 mm during 2015 fig 7e and 282 8 279 8 and 269 6 mm during 2016 fig 7f therefore there were significant differences in the crop et levels in the sm pm and nm plots where the highest mean crop et levels were obtained in the nt sm and st sm treatments which were 6 2 and 6 7 higher p 0 05 respectively than that in the pt nm treatment the variations in the wue and rue exhibited similar trends to the tuber yield fig 7g l in 2014 the mulching methods and the interactions between the tillage systems and mulching methods significantly affected the crop wue and rue whereas the tillage systems had no significant effects however the tillage systems mulching methods and their interactions significantly improved the crop wue and rue in 2015 and 2016 the three year mean wue values were higher in the nt sm and st sm treatments where they were 37 7 and 43 8 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with that in the pt nm treatment fig 7g i similar to the wue the tillage systems mulching methods and their combinations had significant effects on the rue fig 7j l the highest rue value 62 4 was obtained in the st sm treatment followed by the nt sm treatment and the lowest rue value 41 5 was obtained in the pt nm treatment compared with the pt nm treatment the three year mean rue values were 50 5 and 39 9 higher p 0 05 in the st sm and nt sm treatments respectively the et wue and rue levels varied significantly with the growing season rainfall and agricultural management where the tillage with mulching during fallow promoted the better usage of fallow rainfall improved the soil water status reduced the crop water consumption and increased the wue and rue levels hou et al 2011 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 huang et al 2012 showed that various tillage practices combined with mulching significantly increased the soil water content thereby enhancing the wue in a semiarid region li et al 2018b found that mulched ridge tillage systems tended to increase the wue compared with ridge tillage and thus combining ridge tillage with mulching had a positive interaction effect on the wue level in the present study the wue and rue levels varied significantly throughout the whole rainfall season where conservation tillage st and nt combined with sm practices obtained higher wue and rue levels whereas the lower wue and rue values were achieved with pt nm the improvements in the wue and rue levels under tillage with mulching may be explained as follows first conservation tillage during fallow could effectively capture more rainfall and improve the soil water content before sowing chen et al 2015 second sm could significantly improve the crop wue by restricting the soil surface evaporation as well as increasing infiltration and soil water retention in this semiarid area cai et al 2015 wang et al 2011 third pt combined with nm which is applied widely in semiarid regions greatly increased the soil water loss via evaporation shao et al 2016 4 conclusion during the three year study period the tillage and mulching practices during fallow significantly influenced the soil water storage during the growing seasons of potato where the pm and sm plots under different tillage systems retained more soil moisture compared with the nm plots tillage combined with mulching made the topsoil warmer and wetter to ensure potato tuber formation with a high yield in all of the tillage systems sm was more effective than pm at increasing the potato tuber yield and wue particularly in warm and dry conditions the interactions between tillage and mulching practices had significant effects on the potato tuber yield wue and rue in all treatments the maximum tuber yield wue and rue were obtained in the st sm and nt sm treatments whereas the pt nm treatment obtained the lowest results in conclusion conservation tillage with sm was favorable for improving the soil hydrothermal environment where it increased the potato tuber yield wue and rue 5 implications in the dryland farming region of southern ningxia china the planting area of commercial potato is 15 0 t ha 1 which accounts for about half of the annual potato production in ningxia however the mean tuber yield of potato in this region is 12 9 t ha 1 lower than national average level 17 0 t ha 1 and far lower than the world average level 20 1 t ha 1 the soil temperature and moisture were equally important for potato growth however in our present study water deficiency was the major factor that limited crop production due to the uneven distribution of precipitation whereas the soil temperature did not have important effects on potato productivity fm could effectively improve the topsoil temperature during the vegetative growing season but severe droughts and higher temperatures during the growing season could hinder potato tuber bulking and growth sm significantly increased the soil water storage but the low temperature under sm in the early growing season was identified an issue our results demonstrated that conserving the stored fallow period soil water by the tillage and mulching practices is fundamentally important for improving the potato productivity and wue however in conditions with low air temperatures and precipitation during the early growing season but higher air temperature during the later growing season it is important to consider replacing sm with pm under tillage systems or removing the application of pm at an appropriate time to obtain more favorable temperature and moisture conditions to improve the wue rue and tuber yield of potato declaration of competing interest

10883,a study was conducted on a research farm at urmia university under drip irrigation in order to schedule the irrigation of maize based on plant indices crop water stress index cwsi and relative water content rwc and soil indices soil water sw and soil penetration resistance q in climatic conditions of urmia region in iran this study was conducted in the form of randomized complete block design with four irrigation levels including two levels of deficit irrigation i1 crop water requirement cwr of 0 5 and i2 0 75cwr a full irrigation level of i3 1 0cwr and an over irrigation level of i4 1 25cwr with three replications i4 treatment for air filled porosity was considered in the soil for irrigation scheduling lower and upper baseline and cwsi equations for i1 i2 and i3 treatments were calculated during plant growth period using the extracted baselines the mean cwsi values during maize growth season for i1 i2 and i3 treatments were calculated to be 0 53 0 44 and 0 28 respectively the threshold limit of water stress index of i3 treatment was the basis of irrigation scheduling then relationships were provided for determining the irrigation time using cwsi in urmia climate for three maize growth stages in addition among soil and plant indices which were simultaneously measured at maximum stress hour were used as a complementary indicator to eliminate cwsi constraints using the regression relationships extracted between the indices the water status of plant can be determined by only measuring the canopy temperature tc without measuring the rwc sw and q it should be noted that in the region of urmia the critical values of the difference between the tc and the air temperature q and sw for maize were respectively 1 5 c 3 6 mpa and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 matric potential of 8900 hpa keywords canopy temperature tc empirical cwsi penetration resistance q relative water content rwc soil water sw 1 introduction dryness and drought are one of the most important problems and obstacles in the production of agricultural crops and iran is one of the arid and semi arid countries of the world which has always been subject to water constraints therefore the correct and timely use of water resources is inevitable one of the strategies for optimal water use in the agricultural sector is irrigation scheduling of agricultural crops irrigation scheduling means determining the irrigation time and amount of water required erdem et al 2005 at each irrigation interval during the plant growth period irrigation scheduling is actually to determine the best time and amount of irrigation irrigation scheduling methods are divided into two categories of plant indices and soil indices in application of plant and soil indices some plant and soil characteristics are used shackel 2011 plant indices are used to determine the irrigation time including leaf and stem water potential by means of a pressure chamber stomatal resistance or conductivity by means of a porometer and the canopy temperature by the infrared thermometer the canopy temperature tc is affected by soil water sw stomatal resistance or conductivity and meteorological variables such as wind speed net radiation rn relative humidity rh and air temperature ta idso et al 1981 maes and steppe 2012 ahi et al 2015 infrared thermometers compared to conventional methods is one of the most cost effective tools and non destructive methods kirkham 2005 dejonge et al 2015 also it does not contact the plant while measurement and it quickly measures tc and in general it is a reliable index for measuring plant water stress jones 2004 tc is used to assess plant water status and irrigation scheduling carroll et al 2017 in the research the difference between the canopy temperature and air temperature tc ta was used to schedule irrigation of crops such as wheat barley sorghum etc idso et al 1980 1981 researchers used tc ta as an indicator of the plant s water status they concluded that when the plant is without water deficit and subjected to water stress tc ta is respectively negative and positive idso et al 1981 using this technique an applied parameter called the crop water stress index cwsi is calculated which was introduced in 1981 idso et al 1981 this indicator in terms of both theoretical aspects and field observations has high functionality and high acceptability jackson et al 1981 this indicator is further developed for use in arid and semi arid regions and is less efficient in wet areas due to the higher tc value compared to ta keener and kircher 1983 cwsi is examined from two perspectives one according to idso et al 1981 which is an empirical theory and with regard to field research and analysis of the information obtained from them another according to jackson et al 1981 which is a theory and has examined cwsi taking into account the energy balance equations while researchers have paid more attention to the empirical method because the meteorological parameters only require ta and rh taghvaeian et al 2013 dejonge et al 2015 the range of cwsi variations is between zero i e the plant was not exposed to water stress and has a better transplantation condition and one i e the maximum water stress on the plant and the complete stopping of transpiration idso et al 1981 dejonge et al 2015 cwsi has been used by many researchers for irrigation scheduling and evaluation of factors such as plant water stress stomatal resistance or conductivity of leafs photosynthesis leaf water potential and transpiration rate regarding plants under field and greenhouse conditions such as sunflower taghvaeian et al 2014 red pepper sezen et al 2014 grapevine ahi et al 2015 and maize idso 1982 stegman 1986 steele et al 1994 irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 2013 dejonge et al 2015 mangus et al 2016 carroll et al 2017 cwsi can predict the irrigation time as an indicator for irrigation scheduling but it can not calculate the irrigation rate irmak et al 2000 chen et al 2010 stegman 1986 used two cwsi thresholds 0 2 and 0 4 in northern dakota usa for the maize irrigation time maize water productivity increased from 2 3 to 2 5 kg m 3 using cwsi irrigation scheduling threshold of 0 4 also steele et al 1994 in a region where stegman 1986 conducted a maize research study conducted a similar study for 3 years in this study the water stress index values of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 were used which reduced water consumption by 28 43 and 54 and at the cwsi threshold of 0 2 no significant yield loss was observed for the maize the results of the research showed that maximum tc and cwsi for maize occur during 1 to 2 h afternoon irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 also a maize greenhouse experiment showed that maximum daily stress occurs between 13 30 and 15 00 mangus et al 2016 soil indices used in determining the irrigation time include determining the sw and comparing it with the minimum water content that the soil should have before irrigation for this purpose this minimum water content should already been set minimum water content varies in different stages of growth and it is not possible to use a moisture criterion throughout the growth period from the soil indices the amount of water that should be given to the ground can be obtained the percentage of moisture and water capacity in the soil due to their importance in determining the depth of irrigation water and the time interval between two irrigations are important operations in agricultural scheduling steele et al 2000 compared four irrigation scheduling methods water balance tensiometer tc and plant model the results showed that all four methods can be used for maize irrigation scheduling provided that the maximum accuracy in irrigation scheduling and management is considered by using the above methods about 30 of the water was saved cremona et al 2004 conducted irrigation scheduling based on plant stress index using tc and sw the results showed that the use of tc increases the water use efficiency by 25 this method is suitable for drip irrigation systems due to increased irrigation frequencies in other research irrigation scheduling has been carried out based on sw cwsi or in combination soil and plant indices chawla and bundela 2007 paltineanu et al 2012 high penetration resistance is one of the most important physical stressors for plant growth bengough et al 2005 by increasing the soil penetration resistance q the root growth rate has decreased absorption of water and nutrient content has reduced and important processes occurring in the plant aerial organs are disrupted to and kay 2005 evidence suggests that plant growth is susceptible to changes in the soil q rather than in soil matric suction variations whitmore et al 2011 it is also possible to measure the soil q at the farm easily and faster compared to matric suction hence soil q can be a useful soil index for determining the irrigation time although a large number of studies confirm the limiting effect of soil q on root and plant growth there are still clear unanswered questions how much is the critical mechanical strength of soil for maize plant what is the role of air temperature and canopy temperature in the critical mechanical strength of soil from the viewpoint of water status and plant growth the answer to these questions is important for scheduling irrigation and calculating the soil water used for planting in different ways asgarzadeh et al 2010 2011 in this regard the main objectives of the study were to extract and detect the relationship between soil q and air temperature and canopy temperature and to determine the critical values of soil q soil water and tc ta that are very practical for the development and scheduling of the irrigation system in reality one of our most important goals was to use soil q for irrigation and management of soil water because there is little information in this regard on the other hand soil q is very rapidly measurable which can influence the extension of this method other objectives of this study are to calculate cwsi and find the relationships between soil and plant indices for removing cwsi constraints 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and soil description this research was carried out at urmia university research field in 2017 on maize sc704 this farm is located at 37 39 n 44 58 e and the altitude of 1365 m above sea level in the northwest of iran planting details important growth stages as well as other operations have been presented in table 1 the research field was plowed in the fall of 2016 at a depth of 30 cm the disc operation was done to crush the husk and prepare the seedbed in the spring of 2017 the dimensions of plots were 3 m 4 m and plot spacing from each other was 2 m in the next step rows with intervals of 75 cm and seed spacing on the 20 cm row were created soil samples were prepared to determine some physical properties of soil using sampling cylinders table 2 2 2 experimental design and treatments this research investigates the effects of various irrigation treatments the experimental design was based on randomized complete block design with four water treatments on maize in three replications fig 1 the treatments were i1 irrigation water with crop water requirement cwr of 50 i2 irrigation water with 0 75cwr i3 irrigation water with 1 0cwr and i4 irrigation water with 1 25cwr to determine the cwr the meteorological parameters were obtained from the weather station of urmia university then the reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the eto calculator v3 1 program raes 2009 the cwr in each irrigation is obtained by multiplying eto in maize crop coefficient kc farshi et al 1997 considering that the plant did not find complete deployment the water stress began from july seventh irrigation irrigation values for each treatment and eto during the growth period have been shown in table 3 the water requirement of maize in the long term statistics for the urmia region is 625 6 mm farshi et al 1997 in the present study this value was 635 6 mm 2 3 irrigation method during the growth season irrigation was carried out using a 16 mm drip irrigation pipe placed next to each row of the plant sezen et al 2014 taghvaeian et al 2014 16 mm pipes have constant pressure and thickness of 1 15 mm also the distance between the in line emitters was 20 cm line and the discharge of the emitters was 4 l h 1 to control stress using time 16 mm in 16 mm valve was used at the beginning of each 16 mm pipe irrigation was carried out every 3 days during the growth period fertilizers were used to prevent food shortages dejonge et al 2015 for all treatments based on soil analysis and all treatments received equal amounts of fertilizers sezen et al 2014 2 4 weather data the climate of urmia region is hot and dry in the summer and cold and dry in the winter the rainfall period starts from late october and continues until june meteorological parameters of the area were obtained during the design implementation from the weather station of the faculty of agriculture of urmia university which was the nearest station to the site table 4 it was also used to obtain ta and rh data in the 10 minute intervals of the watchdog field mounted meteorological observatory finally the data was transferred to the pc via the interface cable and specware 9 software 2 5 plant measurements 2 5 1 infrared thermometers irts in the early 1970s a portable and simple thermometer called an infrared thermometer was built and developed in the us water conservation laboratory which was used extensively to measure the temperature of canopy cover and leaves the major advantages of the infrared thermometer are that it can measure the temperature of several leaves at the same time before the invention of this device it was very difficult to measure the difference between the canopy temperature and air temperature tc ta because there was no means to be able to measure the temperature of a group of leaves simultaneously also it is easy to measure with the infrared thermometer because the instruments are handheld and lightweight jackson et al 1981 kirkham 2005 in this study the manual infrared thermometer of fluke mini ir62 model was used to measure tc which was affected by various factors such as the environment plant growth stage soil water and salinity given that the maximum stress occurs in one or two hours after sunset it is the best time for tc measurement at these hours erdem et al 2005 it should be noted that to obtain the equations of the upper and lower baselines of the methods presented by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 tc should be measured daily from 4 to 5 times in this research no leaf temperature was measured from plantation time until 10 july due to the small size of the plant less canopy and the small measurement field of device the effect of soil surface temperature on tc measurement irmak et al 2000 tc measurements when the sky was clear and without clouds taghvaeian et al 2012 sezen et al 2014 were conducted from four geographical directions erdem et al 2005 for each treatment with three replications measurements were made from different leaves since different plant leaves were likely to have different temperatures therefore the average of tc was obtained by averaging these values 12 readings for each treatment sezen et al 2014 to calculate the lower baseline eq 1 maize tc was measured on the days after irrigation taghvaeian et al 2013 for non stress treatment i3 at an interval of one hour from 8 50 to 14 50 local standard time also to determine the cwsi index eq 6 and to calculate the tc ta m tc of maize in the days before irrigation for each of the three treatments i1 i2 and i3 was measured in hours from 11 50 to 14 50 it should be noted that cwsi values were calculated for three stages of maize growth vegetative phase floral initiation flowering pollination and seed seating seed filling 2 5 1 1 crop water stress index cwsi cwsi is one of the indices that presents the water status in the plant according to tc ta idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 the cwsi is also called the plant water stress index kirkham 2005 to examine and describe the cwsi a relationship based on two parameters tc ta and air vapor pressure deficit avpd is presented as follows idso et al 1981 1 t c t a l l a b a v p d 2 a v p d 10 exp 16 78 t a 116 9 t a 237 3 1 r h 100 where tc and ta are canopy temperature and air temperature c avpd represents air vapor pressure deficit mbar rh indicates relative humidity a and b are constant coefficients which vary from plant to plant the line obtained in accordance with eq 1 is called the lower baseline or the non water stressed baseline nwsb taghvaeian et al 2013 the upper baseline or non transpiring baseline ntb taghvaeian et al 2013 represents the maximum value expected for tc ta which expresses the complete stop of transpiration of the plant and independent of the avpd the position of the upper baseline is obtained using the following equation idso et al 1981 3 t c t a u l a b a v p g 4 a v p g e s t a a e s t a 5 e s t a 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t a 237 3 t a 1000 101 where avpg is the air vapor pressure gradient mbar the coefficients a and b are obtained from the lower baseline eq 1 according to eq 3 when the air is saturated with water vapor transpiration is reduced but not stopped however transpiration will continue due to the vapor pressure gradient between the canopy and air therefore when the tc ta value is higher than the y intercept a of the lower baseline eq 1 the transpiration rate is completely stopped idso et al 1981 the cwsi at a certain water vapor pressure deficit is the ratio of tc ta measured from the lower baseline to the total possible difference for the same amount of water vapor pressure deficit idso et al 1981 6 c w s i d t m d t l l d t u l d t l l where dtm is the difference between the tc and ta during measurement c dtl l represents the difference between the tc and ta obtained from the lower baseline equation for the measured avpd dtu l is a constant number for the upper baseline 2 5 2 relative water content rwc during plant growth period relative water content rwc of leaves was measured in 5 series for each treatment with three replications the first measurement date for the rwc was 18 july it should be noted that the rwc values were measured for a period of four days before and after irrigation every other weak each day 2 to 3 adult and young leaves were cut from each plot by a razor at maximum stress hour at 15 in local time to determine the rwc after measuring tc the taken leaves were put in nylon without any damage and were immediately transferred to the laboratory the rwc value was calculated using the method proposed by barrs and weatherley 1962 and was calculated by the following equation 7 rwc fw dw tw dw where fw tw and dw are the fresh leaf weight g leaf weight in full turgid g and weight of leaf dried in oven g the fw value was obtained after leaves were removed from the plant then the leaves were placed in distilled water for 4 h in order to remove the cutting edge effect the leaves were immersed intact in distilled water direct light radiation in the laboratory was prevented to minimize cell growth and thermal effects barrs and weatherley 1962 kirkham 2005 after reaching the equilibrium the leaves were removed from the water by forceps and slowly dried with a towel and their turgid weight tw was measured the leaves were then placed inside the packet to dry at an oven temperature of 70 c for 24 h to obtain dry weight dw barrs and weatherley 1962 kirkham 2005 2 6 soil measurements 2 6 1 soil water sw during the plant growth period sw up to root development depth was measured for all treatments for 3 4 times per week before and after irrigation taghvaeian et al 2014 at maximum stress hour the sw was measured using a profile probe pr2 device the pr2 device is used in two types of pr2 4 and pr2 6 to measure sw in the vertical section of the soil in the pr2 6 type on the one meter probe that enters the soil there are six sensors that simultaneously measure soil water content at depths of 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm the diameter of the device s sensor is 25 4 mm and the special plastic pipes to be installed in the soil have a diameter of 28 mm in this study the pr2 6 tubes were installed in the center row of each plot the amount of sw deficit relative to field capacity and soil water content can be shown on the hh2 device display screen to determine the sw content the device probe was pulled out from its shield and led into a transparent plastic tube inside the soil and by pressing the read button on the hh2 device we performed the reading at six depths simultaneously the pr2 was calibrated against the sw determined gravimetrically mohammadi et al 2019 also bd values are used to convert the gravimetric moisture to volumetric moisture content table 2 2 6 2 water retention curve soil potential points are usually measured in a laboratory using different devices such as a sandbox a pressure plate and an ultra centrifuge and sometimes through plant cultivation in a pot to measure the soil water retention curve swrc in the laboratory 8 intact samples with two replications were taken through each of the layers of 10 15 cm 4 samples and 30 35 cm 4 samples of soil using sampling cylinders of 100 and 50 cm3 after saturation of the samples the suction matric h of 0 20 30 100 330 1000 3000 8000 and 15 000 hpa were introduced into samples by sand box low values of h and pressure plate large values of h and after equilibrium their average gravimetric moisture content was measured romano et al 2002 dane and hopmans 2002 the average soil porosity was calculated using the formula 1 bd 2 65 and was considered as saturated moisture content the swrc model with the retc program was fitted on the measured data of soil water retention the van genuchten 1980 equation is as follows 8 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n 1 n 1 where the value of Œ∏ h of soil water cm3 cm 3 h represents soil moisture suction hpa Œ∏r and Œ∏s is the residual moisture and soil saturation cm3 cm 3 and Œ± is related to the inverse suction in the turning point air entry point hpa 1 and n denotes the pore size distribution index sillers et al 2001 2 6 3 penetration resistance q curve the maximum soil tolerance to mechanical stresses without deformation and rupture is the mechanical strength of the soil q is one of the types of mechanical soil strengths indicating the soil s resistance to penetrating a bar shaped body into it soane and van ouwerkerk 1994 which is affected by texture bulk density and soil organic matter content this characteristic can also be affected by soil water and soil structure conditions while the soil water is most important dexter et al 2008 da silva et al 1994 the soil q can be measured by automatic laboratory micro penetrometer the automatic micro penetrometer using the proprietary software called kmp2 enables the user to obtain precise data on the penetration resistance of soil samples by adjusting the depth and penetration speed of the cone in the soil in order to measure the soil penetration resistance curve sprc 10 intact soil samples layers 10 15 cm 5 samples and 30 35 cm 5 samples were first introduced to different moisture values to homogenize moisture distribution these soil samples were placed in nylon bags for 4 weeks after moisture equilibrium soil q values were measured using automatic micro penetrometer cone angle of 30 and base diameter of 3 mm with penetration speed of 5 mm min 1 in 3 repetitions with the arrangement of the vertices of a triangle on intact samples asgarzadeh et al 2014 finally the data measured by the interface cable and the kmp2 software was transferred to the pc the gravimetric moisture content of soil samples was measured and the bd values were converted to volumetric moisture the sprc model was fitted with the solver program on measured soil q data to measure sprc the modified van genuchten 1980 model was used 9 q q l q h q l 1 Œ± q Œ∏ Œ∏ n q Œ∏ 1 n q Œ∏ 1 where q is soil penetration resistance mpa Œ∏

parameters of the model related to the turning point and slope of the mechanical strength function against soil water 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline equations and crop water stress index cwsi as indicated in section 2 5 1 tc of maize was measured from 8 50 to 14 50 to calculate the lower baseline using idso et al 1981 in order to obtain the lower baseline equation in different after irrigation days tc ta values were plotted versus avpd fig 2 and regression equations for three stages of maize growth were extracted table 5 in extracting relationships it was assumed that the plant was not subjected to other environmental stress other than water stress according to fig 2 the range of avpd and tc ta for maize growth period is 4 45 mbar and 4 to 5 c respectively one of the important benefits of extension of the avpd range is that the lower baseline fitted can be used in other places but if this range is more limited such a possibility will not be available gardner and shock 1989 as the avpd increases tc ta in absolute terms also increases the increase of tc ta decreases with time and also depends on irrigation treatment taghvaeian et al 2013 the increase of avpd is associated with increasing evapotranspiration and if water requirement is provided the plant is kept cool investigation of regression relationships shows that the coefficients a and b have different values for each of three stages of growth and the slope of the line was obtained negative for all three stages the different values of these coefficients indicate the difference between water absorption potential and transpiration during plant growth period the lower baseline represents the conditions in which a plant is not subject to any limitations in terms of water supply also using idso et al 1981 the upper baseline values for maize were obtained at three growth stages as 4 69 2 83 and 10 01 c respectively table 5 which indicates the difference between the upper baseline value for each maize growth stage the saturation of air by water vapor the complete stopping of transpiration at each stage of plant growth and thus the highest stress applying on it the values of the coefficients a and b of the lower baseline and the upper baseline values of the present study differed from those of other studies that were carried out for maize idso 1982 steele et al 1994 irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 2013 the values of the coefficients a and b in the many researchers such as idso 1982 steele et al 1994 irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 and taghvaeian et al 2013 are a 3 11 b 0 197 a 2 14 b 0 197 a 1 39 b 0 086 a 2 73 b 0 190 and a 3 04 b 0 199 respectively it should be noted that the coefficients a and b of the stages of vegetative phase floral initiation and flowering pollination of the present study on july 11 to july 21 and july 25 to august 18 are respectively similar to the coefficients obtained idso 1982 and steele et al 1994 in the studies conducted by irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 and taghvaeian et al 2013 on august 3 to september 12 1995 in southern turkey august 5 to september 2 2011 in northeastern colorado using remote sensing and august 4 to september 22 2011 in northern colorado the mean value of the upper baseline was respectively 4 60 4 14 and 4 38 c which is close to the upper baseline 4 69 c of the present study at the vegetative phase floral initiation stage on july 11 to july 21 also a two year research on maize summer 2012 and 2013 in north colorado usa by dejonge et al 2015 obtained the coefficients a and b for the lower baseline of 2 34 and 0 179 respectively which were close to the coefficients of second stage of growth flowering pollination of the present study it should be noted in the studies conducted by taghvaeian et al 2013 and dejonge et al 2015 at a common location the city of greeley in northern colorado a different coefficient a was obtained therefore it is necessary to determine the position of the baselines for each plant during different plant growth stages based on the type of irrigation system and management conditions so that more precise irrigation scheduling can be done in general the location of the baselines depends on the type of plant plant variety soil type and climate conditions of each region and these baselines should be developed for each region taghvaeian et al 2013 the specificity of the baselines for each plant indicates that while maximum transpiration each plant responds to a certain size against environmental changes stresses and meteorological parameters that transpiration values vary in crops the first step for estimating cwsi is the development of baselines for the plant taghvaeian et al 2012 given the equations of lower and upper baselines for the three stages of maize growth table 5 as well as tc ta average calculation in the days before irrigation the cwsi values were calculated using eq 6 for all three treatments i1 i2 and i3 table 6 according to table 6 cwsi threshold values for control treatment i3 in three stages of growth were 0 13 0 55 and 0 15 respectively and also average values of cwsi during maize growth period for three treatments of 50 75 and 100 of water requirement was 0 53 0 44 and 0 28 respectively as previously mentioned according to idso et al 1981 the cwsi range was between zero and 1 0 but some research results showed that cwsi values exceeded the range of zero and one taghvaeian et al 2012 2013 in this study the values between zero and 1 0 were used to calculate the average cwsi ahi et al 2015 depending on the conditions of sw atmosphere and the plant sometimes dtm values greater than dtu l may be obtained so cwsi can be slightly larger than 1 0 dejonge et al 2015 maximum cwsi for all three treatments occurred on july 25 to august 18 and the highest cwsi is for severe deficit irrigation i1 the plant closes its stomata reduced transpiration and due to less irrigation to cope with deficit irrigation taghvaeian et al 2013 resulting in increased tc and consequently cwsi increases given that the climatic conditions are the same for the three treatments tc is the only factor that has increased cwsi in the i1 treatment in general cwsi values increase with increasing water stress ahi et al 2015 the empirical method of cwsi idso et al 1981 has been used in several studies to manage maize irrigation taghvaeian et al 2013 irmak et al 2000 conducted a study on maize under semi arid mediterranean conditions antalya turkey and found that the cwsi seasonal average should not be below 0 22 in order for the crop yield to not be reduced taghvaeian et al 2013 in north colorado usa obtained average cwsi for maize over 2 h of afternoon 12 00 13 00 and 13 00 14 00 and the whole study period early august to late september 2011 for three treatments including full low frequency deficit and high frequency deficit irrigation regimes as 0 19 0 57 and 0 20 respectively it should be noted that if the average cwsi in this study was limited to only the first three weeks before the senescence the cwsi values for the three treatments mentioned above are reduced to 0 02 0 40 and 0 04 respectively as a result in this study two treatments of full and high frequency deficit irrigation regimes did not experience significant water stress and the cwsi values in these two treatments are close to the mean value of cwsi of 0 28 in i3 treatment full irrigation of the present study as mentioned the maximum mean cwsi 0 53 in the present study was obtained for i1 treatment which is close to the mean cwsi for low frequency deficit irrigation regime 0 57 in the taghvaeian et al 2013 research cwsi is an indicator of the intensity of water stress that indicates the relationship between transpiration and water supply in canopy chen et al 2010 the difference and unconstancy of the threshold values of cwsi in various researches and the present research can be attributed to meteorological factors such as wind speed direction of wind clouds temperature etc and climate change chen et al 2010 type of irrigation system study area and planting date also if there is a significant change in the growth and stress level of the plant in the area the effect of the data collection location should be taken into account taghvaeian et al 2013 in most irrigation areas meteorological variables are measured on reference surfaces grass or alfalfa in standard meteorological stations which are usually kept under non stressed conditions full canopy in this case the cwsi threshold should be set for irrigation scheduling for dispersed and poor canopy taghvaeian et al 2013 3 2 irrigation scheduling using cwsi the purpose of cwsi is to provide a simple method for measuring plant water stress and as a tool for irrigation scheduling for crops and fruit trees chen et al 2010 one of the applications of cwsi is irrigation scheduling considering that the lowest cwsi 0 28 was observed in the control treatment non stressed therefore this treatment is the basis of irrigation scheduling based on idso et al 1981 for maize sc704 in the urmia region the values of cwsi have been presented in table 6 using eq 6 therefore according to the values of this index and eq 10 the relationships needed for irrigation scheduling for maize were extracted for three stages of maize growth table 7 10 c w s i i t c t a c a b a v p d t c t a u l a b a v p d the parameters of eq 10 have been previously described in section 2 5 1 1 to determine the irrigation time before introducing stress to the plant the avpd values should be measured at 11 50 to 14 50 and with the replacement in the extracted relationships for each growth stage table 7 the permitted tc ta c value is calculated the value of tc ta m can be measured and calculated at maximum stress conditions from 11 50 to 14 50 using the infrared thermometer the irrigation time can be determined by comparing tc ta m and tc ta c if the average of the measured values is less than the calculated permitted value the irrigation time is not yet reached however if the calculated permitted value is greater the irrigation time is past geiser et al 1982 also if between tc ta m and tc ta c are equal it indicates that it is the irrigation time geiser et al 1982 the baselines tables 5 and 7 can be transmitted not only based on the location but also possibly in similar climatic conditions taghvaeian et al 2012 3 3 relations between plant and soil indices the swrc data and the parameters of the van genuchten equation considerably control the physical properties of the soil asgarzadeh et al 2014 the fitness parameters of the van genuchten model 1980 for swrc in surface layer 10 15 cm and lower layer 30 35 cm have been presented in table 8 the coefficient of determination r2 obtained for the characteristic curves of these two layers is a high figure which shows that van genuchten 1980 model is well fitted on laboratory data fig 3 a in the present study 125 water requirement treatment i4 for air filled porosity afp was considered in the soil the afp critical limit for the root growth of more plants is about 10 da silva et al 1994 q values of soil that limits root development in the soil are reported in the range of 1 5 4 mpa and 2 mpa is the most acceptable value and well known critical q da silva et al 1994 due to the uniform distribution of water in laboratory soil samples and better control of the conditions asgarzadeh et al 2014 the coefficient of determination r2 obtained for the double layer sprc is greater which shows that the modified model of van genuchten 1980 is well fitted on laboratory data fig 3b also the fitness parameters of this model for sprc have been presented in table 8 in the lower layer due to compression and high bd soil porosity decreases fig 3b and moisture Œ∏ at the field capacity fc point increased compared to the lower surface layer also in this layer Œ∏ at the pwp point has increased more than the surface layer as a result soil available water for the plant has decreased increasing density and soil q reduces the absorption of nutrients oxygen deficiency and growth and causes root deformation raper 2005 critical q has been determined in fig 3b well known critical q occurs at different values of Œ∏ asgarzadeh et al 2014 in the present study the critical q value of 2 mpa occurs in compact soils lower layer in higher moisture content about 0 35 cm3 cm 3 and in the surface layer at lower moisture about 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the regression relationships between plant and soil indices measured simultaneously at maximum stress hour during the maize growth period were extracted the relationship of rwc with soil indices soil q and sw and the relationship tc ta with soil and plant indices q sw and rwc can be observed figs 4 and 5 at noon on sunny days rwc values for well irrigated for most grown plants are usually in the range of 0 85 0 95 hsiao and bradford 1983 the study of hofler diagram relationships between water potential and its components with rwc for wheat planted in the field showed that rwc is in the range of 0 80 to 0 83 such as the initial phase of wilting plasmolysis where the turgid pressure of the plant cells is zero turner 1981 kirkham 2005 in the present study rwc of 0 80 was considered as the critical limit according to fig 4a b the critical values obtained for q and sw are respectively 3 6 mpa and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 matric potential equal to 8900 hpa the value of 3 6 mpa found in this study was different from the critical value of 2 mpa fig 3b the well known 2 mpa obtained by using a cone penetrometer is approximately equal to the 4 mpa measured in the same moisture content by the micro penetrometer in the laboratory asgarzadeh et al 2014 therefore 3 6 mpa obtained for soil q is a reasonable value by substituting the critical values of q and sw in the linear relationships of fig 5a b the critical tc ta values of respectively 1 51 and 1 59 c were obtained also the permitted tc ta c was calculated for the maize growth period and the value of 1 54 c was obtained it should be noted that the permitted value obtained is very close to the critical values of tc ta mentioned above a research in central minnesota becker city was conducted by geiser et al 1982 for maize irrigation scheduling based on tc ta the model presented by them tc ta was considered as a dependent variable which was a function of three independent parameters rn rh and available water aw to use this model the aw value was considered constant 50 and the critical values of tc ta were obtained for different values of rn from 0 to 750 w m 2 and rh 20 80 the range of critical values of tc ta was between 3 c and 2 c the critical value obtained for tc ta in this study for maize was in the range determined by geiser et al 1982 for tc ta permitted tc ta c value 1 54 c was inserted in the linear relationship between tc ta and rwc fig 5c and the value of 0 796 was obtained for rwc as a result the same critical value 0 80 originally considered for rwc was obtained also given that the critical limit for sw was 0 27 cm3 cm 3 the plant is subjected to water stress in the moisture less than critical limit according to figs 4b and 5b the changes in rwc and tc ta are almost linear relative to sw that is with a lower sw the rwc decreases and the tc ta value increases also according to fig 5c by reducing rwc value tc ta value increases consequently with the decrease of avpd tc ta increases carlson et al 1972 measured leaf temperature of two soybean varieties under controlled irrigation using infrared thermometer during the 9 day experiment they concluded that by decreasing the values of rwc and avpd leaf temperature would increase with increasing ta irrigation management and scheduling is very important and if irrigation scheduling methods and tools are used properly a significant increase in water use efficiency can be achieved plant and soil moisture content are not used in calculating cwsi and only the thermal reflections of the plant are considered irrigation scheduling based on tc is more accurate than soil indices because it is based on the relationship between the transpiration rate of the plant and the evaporation power of the atmosphere given that cwsi is a valuable tool for irrigation scheduling however the calculation of avpd the availability of ta and rh values and then the cwsi calculation may restrict the practical application of this empirical method by farmers dejonge et al 2015 in this research plant and soil indices were used as a supplementary indicator for removing cwsi constraints using the regression relationships obtained between the indices without measuring the plant water content sw and soil q the plant s water status can be found only by measuring tc it should also be noted that among the mentioned indicators the supplementary index that can both eliminate cwsi constraints and have fast measurable capability in the field is soil q because the soil q measurement device is portable and the farmer can easily move it on the farm according to research results whitmore et al 2011 this index is even better than the soil matric potential and it can show the difference between soils because plant growth is due to changes in soil q it is more susceptible to matric potential changes hence soil q is a useful indicator for determining the irrigation time and improving irrigation management in this study the relationship between soil q and air temperature and canopy temperature as well as the relationship of other indices with each other was determined and the critical value of soil q for the maize crop was 3 6 mpa as the introduction of the paper emphasized the determination of critical values of soil q soil water and tc ta these values were considered in this study for different stages of maize growth which the data could be used as a reference for the development of irrigation systems another advantage of this research is that due to the simplicity of measuring most of the proposed parameters the farmer based on their existing facilities can use the determined relationships between soil and plant indices as well as the critical range obtained for irrigation of the farm for irrigation scheduling the irrigation start and end time should be determined in practice these indices can be used to determine the irrigation start time the irrigation time can be also determined according to the time of arrival of sw to fc moisture content and irrigation depth can be used with a volume meter for the irrigation end time 4 conclusions irrigation scheduling in this study was carried out using a manual infrared thermometer in urmia region for maize sc704 variety under different irrigation regimes with surface drip irrigation the empirical method presented by idso et al 1981 was used for maize irrigation scheduling the equations of lower and upper baselines as well as cwsi for three treatments of 50 75 and 100 of water requirement i1 i2 and i3 during the growth season was calculated using idso et al 1981 using the baselines extracted for each treatment the average cwsi values for maize growth season for i1 i2 and i3 treatments were calculated to be 0 53 0 44 and 0 28 respectively then relationships were established for determining the irrigation time using cwsi in urmia climate for three maize growth stages of vegetative phase floral initiation flowering pollination and seed seating seed filling as tc ta c 3 4617 0 1553 avpd tc ta c 2 5536 0 0556 avpd and tc ta c 7 2806 0 1572 avpd in this study soil and plant indices were used as a complementary indicator for eliminating cwsi constraints the regression relationships between these indices during the growth period of the plant were extracted which were simultaneously measured at the maximum stress time also the critical limits of tc ta q and sw for maize were obtained respectively at 1 5 c 3 6 mpa and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 matric potential of 8900 hpa respectively it is also possible to measure the soil q at the farm easily and faster compared to matric suction hence soil q can be a useful soil index for determining the irrigation time using these regression relationships obtained between the indices the water status of the plant can be examined by only measuring tc without measuring the rwc sw and soil q acknowledgments this research was funded by urmia university under grant no rd 2598 the authors also appreciate the support office of vice

10883,a study was conducted on a research farm at urmia university under drip irrigation in order to schedule the irrigation of maize based on plant indices crop water stress index cwsi and relative water content rwc and soil indices soil water sw and soil penetration resistance q in climatic conditions of urmia region in iran this study was conducted in the form of randomized complete block design with four irrigation levels including two levels of deficit irrigation i1 crop water requirement cwr of 0 5 and i2 0 75cwr a full irrigation level of i3 1 0cwr and an over irrigation level of i4 1 25cwr with three replications i4 treatment for air filled porosity was considered in the soil for irrigation scheduling lower and upper baseline and cwsi equations for i1 i2 and i3 treatments were calculated during plant growth period using the extracted baselines the mean cwsi values during maize growth season for i1 i2 and i3 treatments were calculated to be 0 53 0 44 and 0 28 respectively the threshold limit of water stress index of i3 treatment was the basis of irrigation scheduling then relationships were provided for determining the irrigation time using cwsi in urmia climate for three maize growth stages in addition among soil and plant indices which were simultaneously measured at maximum stress hour were used as a complementary indicator to eliminate cwsi constraints using the regression relationships extracted between the indices the water status of plant can be determined by only measuring the canopy temperature tc without measuring the rwc sw and q it should be noted that in the region of urmia the critical values of the difference between the tc and the air temperature q and sw for maize were respectively 1 5 c 3 6 mpa and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 matric potential of 8900 hpa keywords canopy temperature tc empirical cwsi penetration resistance q relative water content rwc soil water sw 1 introduction dryness and drought are one of the most important problems and obstacles in the production of agricultural crops and iran is one of the arid and semi arid countries of the world which has always been subject to water constraints therefore the correct and timely use of water resources is inevitable one of the strategies for optimal water use in the agricultural sector is irrigation scheduling of agricultural crops irrigation scheduling means determining the irrigation time and amount of water required erdem et al 2005 at each irrigation interval during the plant growth period irrigation scheduling is actually to determine the best time and amount of irrigation irrigation scheduling methods are divided into two categories of plant indices and soil indices in application of plant and soil indices some plant and soil characteristics are used shackel 2011 plant indices are used to determine the irrigation time including leaf and stem water potential by means of a pressure chamber stomatal resistance or conductivity by means of a porometer and the canopy temperature by the infrared thermometer the canopy temperature tc is affected by soil water sw stomatal resistance or conductivity and meteorological variables such as wind speed net radiation rn relative humidity rh and air temperature ta idso et al 1981 maes and steppe 2012 ahi et al 2015 infrared thermometers compared to conventional methods is one of the most cost effective tools and non destructive methods kirkham 2005 dejonge et al 2015 also it does not contact the plant while measurement and it quickly measures tc and in general it is a reliable index for measuring plant water stress jones 2004 tc is used to assess plant water status and irrigation scheduling carroll et al 2017 in the research the difference between the canopy temperature and air temperature tc ta was used to schedule irrigation of crops such as wheat barley sorghum etc idso et al 1980 1981 researchers used tc ta as an indicator of the plant s water status they concluded that when the plant is without water deficit and subjected to water stress tc ta is respectively negative and positive idso et al 1981 using this technique an applied parameter called the crop water stress index cwsi is calculated which was introduced in 1981 idso et al 1981 this indicator in terms of both theoretical aspects and field observations has high functionality and high acceptability jackson et al 1981 this indicator is further developed for use in arid and semi arid regions and is less efficient in wet areas due to the higher tc value compared to ta keener and kircher 1983 cwsi is examined from two perspectives one according to idso et al 1981 which is an empirical theory and with regard to field research and analysis of the information obtained from them another according to jackson et al 1981 which is a theory and has examined cwsi taking into account the energy balance equations while researchers have paid more attention to the empirical method because the meteorological parameters only require ta and rh taghvaeian et al 2013 dejonge et al 2015 the range of cwsi variations is between zero i e the plant was not exposed to water stress and has a better transplantation condition and one i e the maximum water stress on the plant and the complete stopping of transpiration idso et al 1981 dejonge et al 2015 cwsi has been used by many researchers for irrigation scheduling and evaluation of factors such as plant water stress stomatal resistance or conductivity of leafs photosynthesis leaf water potential and transpiration rate regarding plants under field and greenhouse conditions such as sunflower taghvaeian et al 2014 red pepper sezen et al 2014 grapevine ahi et al 2015 and maize idso 1982 stegman 1986 steele et al 1994 irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 2013 dejonge et al 2015 mangus et al 2016 carroll et al 2017 cwsi can predict the irrigation time as an indicator for irrigation scheduling but it can not calculate the irrigation rate irmak et al 2000 chen et al 2010 stegman 1986 used two cwsi thresholds 0 2 and 0 4 in northern dakota usa for the maize irrigation time maize water productivity increased from 2 3 to 2 5 kg m 3 using cwsi irrigation scheduling threshold of 0 4 also steele et al 1994 in a region where stegman 1986 conducted a maize research study conducted a similar study for 3 years in this study the water stress index values of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 were used which reduced water consumption by 28 43 and 54 and at the cwsi threshold of 0 2 no significant yield loss was observed for the maize the results of the research showed that maximum tc and cwsi for maize occur during 1 to 2 h afternoon irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 also a maize greenhouse experiment showed that maximum daily stress occurs between 13 30 and 15 00 mangus et al 2016 soil indices used in determining the irrigation time include determining the sw and comparing it with the minimum water content that the soil should have before irrigation for this purpose this minimum water content should already been set minimum water content varies in different stages of growth and it is not possible to use a moisture criterion throughout the growth period from the soil indices the amount of water that should be given to the ground can be obtained the percentage of moisture and water capacity in the soil due to their importance in determining the depth of irrigation water and the time interval between two irrigations are important operations in agricultural scheduling steele et al 2000 compared four irrigation scheduling methods water balance tensiometer tc and plant model the results showed that all four methods can be used for maize irrigation scheduling provided that the maximum accuracy in irrigation scheduling and management is considered by using the above methods about 30 of the water was saved cremona et al 2004 conducted irrigation scheduling based on plant stress index using tc and sw the results showed that the use of tc increases the water use efficiency by 25 this method is suitable for drip irrigation systems due to increased irrigation frequencies in other research irrigation scheduling has been carried out based on sw cwsi or in combination soil and plant indices chawla and bundela 2007 paltineanu et al 2012 high penetration resistance is one of the most important physical stressors for plant growth bengough et al 2005 by increasing the soil penetration resistance q the root growth rate has decreased absorption of water and nutrient content has reduced and important processes occurring in the plant aerial organs are disrupted to and kay 2005 evidence suggests that plant growth is susceptible to changes in the soil q rather than in soil matric suction variations whitmore et al 2011 it is also possible to measure the soil q at the farm easily and faster compared to matric suction hence soil q can be a useful soil index for determining the irrigation time although a large number of studies confirm the limiting effect of soil q on root and plant growth there are still clear unanswered questions how much is the critical mechanical strength of soil for maize plant what is the role of air temperature and canopy temperature in the critical mechanical strength of soil from the viewpoint of water status and plant growth the answer to these questions is important for scheduling irrigation and calculating the soil water used for planting in different ways asgarzadeh et al 2010 2011 in this regard the main objectives of the study were to extract and detect the relationship between soil q and air temperature and canopy temperature and to determine the critical values of soil q soil water and tc ta that are very practical for the development and scheduling of the irrigation system in reality one of our most important goals was to use soil q for irrigation and management of soil water because there is little information in this regard on the other hand soil q is very rapidly measurable which can influence the extension of this method other objectives of this study are to calculate cwsi and find the relationships between soil and plant indices for removing cwsi constraints 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and soil description this research was carried out at urmia university research field in 2017 on maize sc704 this farm is located at 37 39 n 44 58 e and the altitude of 1365 m above sea level in the northwest of iran planting details important growth stages as well as other operations have been presented in table 1 the research field was plowed in the fall of 2016 at a depth of 30 cm the disc operation was done to crush the husk and prepare the seedbed in the spring of 2017 the dimensions of plots were 3 m 4 m and plot spacing from each other was 2 m in the next step rows with intervals of 75 cm and seed spacing on the 20 cm row were created soil samples were prepared to determine some physical properties of soil using sampling cylinders table 2 2 2 experimental design and treatments this research investigates the effects of various irrigation treatments the experimental design was based on randomized complete block design with four water treatments on maize in three replications fig 1 the treatments were i1 irrigation water with crop water requirement cwr of 50 i2 irrigation water with 0 75cwr i3 irrigation water with 1 0cwr and i4 irrigation water with 1 25cwr to determine the cwr the meteorological parameters were obtained from the weather station of urmia university then the reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the eto calculator v3 1 program raes 2009 the cwr in each irrigation is obtained by multiplying eto in maize crop coefficient kc farshi et al 1997 considering that the plant did not find complete deployment the water stress began from july seventh irrigation irrigation values for each treatment and eto during the growth period have been shown in table 3 the water requirement of maize in the long term statistics for the urmia region is 625 6 mm farshi et al 1997 in the present study this value was 635 6 mm 2 3 irrigation method during the growth season irrigation was carried out using a 16 mm drip irrigation pipe placed next to each row of the plant sezen et al 2014 taghvaeian et al 2014 16 mm pipes have constant pressure and thickness of 1 15 mm also the distance between the in line emitters was 20 cm line and the discharge of the emitters was 4 l h 1 to control stress using time 16 mm in 16 mm valve was used at the beginning of each 16 mm pipe irrigation was carried out every 3 days during the growth period fertilizers were used to prevent food shortages dejonge et al 2015 for all treatments based on soil analysis and all treatments received equal amounts of fertilizers sezen et al 2014 2 4 weather data the climate of urmia region is hot and dry in the summer and cold and dry in the winter the rainfall period starts from late october and continues until june meteorological parameters of the area were obtained during the design implementation from the weather station of the faculty of agriculture of urmia university which was the nearest station to the site table 4 it was also used to obtain ta and rh data in the 10 minute intervals of the watchdog field mounted meteorological observatory finally the data was transferred to the pc via the interface cable and specware 9 software 2 5 plant measurements 2 5 1 infrared thermometers irts in the early 1970s a portable and simple thermometer called an infrared thermometer was built and developed in the us water conservation laboratory which was used extensively to measure the temperature of canopy cover and leaves the major advantages of the infrared thermometer are that it can measure the temperature of several leaves at the same time before the invention of this device it was very difficult to measure the difference between the canopy temperature and air temperature tc ta because there was no means to be able to measure the temperature of a group of leaves simultaneously also it is easy to measure with the infrared thermometer because the instruments are handheld and lightweight jackson et al 1981 kirkham 2005 in this study the manual infrared thermometer of fluke mini ir62 model was used to measure tc which was affected by various factors such as the environment plant growth stage soil water and salinity given that the maximum stress occurs in one or two hours after sunset it is the best time for tc measurement at these hours erdem et al 2005 it should be noted that to obtain the equations of the upper and lower baselines of the methods presented by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 tc should be measured daily from 4 to 5 times in this research no leaf temperature was measured from plantation time until 10 july due to the small size of the plant less canopy and the small measurement field of device the effect of soil surface temperature on tc measurement irmak et al 2000 tc measurements when the sky was clear and without clouds taghvaeian et al 2012 sezen et al 2014 were conducted from four geographical directions erdem et al 2005 for each treatment with three replications measurements were made from different leaves since different plant leaves were likely to have different temperatures therefore the average of tc was obtained by averaging these values 12 readings for each treatment sezen et al 2014 to calculate the lower baseline eq 1 maize tc was measured on the days after irrigation taghvaeian et al 2013 for non stress treatment i3 at an interval of one hour from 8 50 to 14 50 local standard time also to determine the cwsi index eq 6 and to calculate the tc ta m tc of maize in the days before irrigation for each of the three treatments i1 i2 and i3 was measured in hours from 11 50 to 14 50 it should be noted that cwsi values were calculated for three stages of maize growth vegetative phase floral initiation flowering pollination and seed seating seed filling 2 5 1 1 crop water stress index cwsi cwsi is one of the indices that presents the water status in the plant according to tc ta idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 the cwsi is also called the plant water stress index kirkham 2005 to examine and describe the cwsi a relationship based on two parameters tc ta and air vapor pressure deficit avpd is presented as follows idso et al 1981 1 t c t a l l a b a v p d 2 a v p d 10 exp 16 78 t a 116 9 t a 237 3 1 r h 100 where tc and ta are canopy temperature and air temperature c avpd represents air vapor pressure deficit mbar rh indicates relative humidity a and b are constant coefficients which vary from plant to plant the line obtained in accordance with eq 1 is called the lower baseline or the non water stressed baseline nwsb taghvaeian et al 2013 the upper baseline or non transpiring baseline ntb taghvaeian et al 2013 represents the maximum value expected for tc ta which expresses the complete stop of transpiration of the plant and independent of the avpd the position of the upper baseline is obtained using the following equation idso et al 1981 3 t c t a u l a b a v p g 4 a v p g e s t a a e s t a 5 e s t a 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t a 237 3 t a 1000 101 where avpg is the air vapor pressure gradient mbar the coefficients a and b are obtained from the lower baseline eq 1 according to eq 3 when the air is saturated with water vapor transpiration is reduced but not stopped however transpiration will continue due to the vapor pressure gradient between the canopy and air therefore when the tc ta value is higher than the y intercept a of the lower baseline eq 1 the transpiration rate is completely stopped idso et al 1981 the cwsi at a certain water vapor pressure deficit is the ratio of tc ta measured from the lower baseline to the total possible difference for the same amount of water vapor pressure deficit idso et al 1981 6 c w s i d t m d t l l d t u l d t l l where dtm is the difference between the tc and ta during measurement c dtl l represents the difference between the tc and ta obtained from the lower baseline equation for the measured avpd dtu l is a constant number for the upper baseline 2 5 2 relative water content rwc during plant growth period relative water content rwc of leaves was measured in 5 series for each treatment with three replications the first measurement date for the rwc was 18 july it should be noted that the rwc values were measured for a period of four days before and after irrigation every other weak each day 2 to 3 adult and young leaves were cut from each plot by a razor at maximum stress hour at 15 in local time to determine the rwc after measuring tc the taken leaves were put in nylon without any damage and were immediately transferred to the laboratory the rwc value was calculated using the method proposed by barrs and weatherley 1962 and was calculated by the following equation 7 rwc fw dw tw dw where fw tw and dw are the fresh leaf weight g leaf weight in full turgid g and weight of leaf dried in oven g the fw value was obtained after leaves were removed from the plant then the leaves were placed in distilled water for 4 h in order to remove the cutting edge effect the leaves were immersed intact in distilled water direct light radiation in the laboratory was prevented to minimize cell growth and thermal effects barrs and weatherley 1962 kirkham 2005 after reaching the equilibrium the leaves were removed from the water by forceps and slowly dried with a towel and their turgid weight tw was measured the leaves were then placed inside the packet to dry at an oven temperature of 70 c for 24 h to obtain dry weight dw barrs and weatherley 1962 kirkham 2005 2 6 soil measurements 2 6 1 soil water sw during the plant growth period sw up to root development depth was measured for all treatments for 3 4 times per week before and after irrigation taghvaeian et al 2014 at maximum stress hour the sw was measured using a profile probe pr2 device the pr2 device is used in two types of pr2 4 and pr2 6 to measure sw in the vertical section of the soil in the pr2 6 type on the one meter probe that enters the soil there are six sensors that simultaneously measure soil water content at depths of 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm the diameter of the device s sensor is 25 4 mm and the special plastic pipes to be installed in the soil have a diameter of 28 mm in this study the pr2 6 tubes were installed in the center row of each plot the amount of sw deficit relative to field capacity and soil water content can be shown on the hh2 device display screen to determine the sw content the device probe was pulled out from its shield and led into a transparent plastic tube inside the soil and by pressing the read button on the hh2 device we performed the reading at six depths simultaneously the pr2 was calibrated against the sw determined gravimetrically mohammadi et al 2019 also bd values are used to convert the gravimetric moisture to volumetric moisture content table 2 2 6 2 water retention curve soil potential points are usually measured in a laboratory using different devices such as a sandbox a pressure plate and an ultra centrifuge and sometimes through plant cultivation in a pot to measure the soil water retention curve swrc in the laboratory 8 intact samples with two replications were taken through each of the layers of 10 15 cm 4 samples and 30 35 cm 4 samples of soil using sampling cylinders of 100 and 50 cm3 after saturation of the samples the suction matric h of 0 20 30 100 330 1000 3000 8000 and 15 000 hpa were introduced into samples by sand box low values of h and pressure plate large values of h and after equilibrium their average gravimetric moisture content was measured romano et al 2002 dane and hopmans 2002 the average soil porosity was calculated using the formula 1 bd 2 65 and was considered as saturated moisture content the swrc model with the retc program was fitted on the measured data of soil water retention the van genuchten 1980 equation is as follows 8 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n 1 n 1 where the value of Œ∏ h of soil water cm3 cm 3 h represents soil moisture suction hpa Œ∏r and Œ∏s is the residual moisture and soil saturation cm3 cm 3 and Œ± is related to the inverse suction in the turning point air entry point hpa 1 and n denotes the pore size distribution index sillers et al 2001 2 6 3 penetration resistance q curve the maximum soil tolerance to mechanical stresses without deformation and rupture is the mechanical strength of the soil q is one of the types of mechanical soil strengths indicating the soil s resistance to penetrating a bar shaped body into it soane and van ouwerkerk 1994 which is affected by texture bulk density and soil organic matter content this characteristic can also be affected by soil water and soil structure conditions while the soil water is most important dexter et al 2008 da silva et al 1994 the soil q can be measured by automatic laboratory micro penetrometer the automatic micro penetrometer using the proprietary software called kmp2 enables the user to obtain precise data on the penetration resistance of soil samples by adjusting the depth and penetration speed of the cone in the soil in order to measure the soil penetration resistance curve sprc 10 intact soil samples layers 10 15 cm 5 samples and 30 35 cm 5 samples were first introduced to different moisture values to homogenize moisture distribution these soil samples were placed in nylon bags for 4 weeks after moisture equilibrium soil q values were measured using automatic micro penetrometer cone angle of 30 and base diameter of 3 mm with penetration speed of 5 mm min 1 in 3 repetitions with the arrangement of the vertices of a triangle on intact samples asgarzadeh et al 2014 finally the data measured by the interface cable and the kmp2 software was transferred to the pc the gravimetric moisture content of soil samples was measured and the bd values were converted to volumetric moisture the sprc model was fitted with the solver program on measured soil q data to measure sprc the modified van genuchten 1980 model was used 9 q q l q h q l 1 Œ± q Œ∏ Œ∏ n q Œ∏ 1 n q Œ∏ 1 where q is soil penetration resistance mpa Œ∏

parameters of the model related to the turning point and slope of the mechanical strength function against soil water 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline equations and crop water stress index cwsi as indicated in section 2 5 1 tc of maize was measured from 8 50 to 14 50 to calculate the lower baseline using idso et al 1981 in order to obtain the lower baseline equation in different after irrigation days tc ta values were plotted versus avpd fig 2 and regression equations for three stages of maize growth were extracted table 5 in extracting relationships it was assumed that the plant was not subjected to other environmental stress other than water stress according to fig 2 the range of avpd and tc ta for maize growth period is 4 45 mbar and 4 to 5 c respectively one of the important benefits of extension of the avpd range is that the lower baseline fitted can be used in other places but if this range is more limited such a possibility will not be available gardner and shock 1989 as the avpd increases tc ta in absolute terms also increases the increase of tc ta decreases with time and also depends on irrigation treatment taghvaeian et al 2013 the increase of avpd is associated with increasing evapotranspiration and if water requirement is provided the plant is kept cool investigation of regression relationships shows that the coefficients a and b have different values for each of three stages of growth and the slope of the line was obtained negative for all three stages the different values of these coefficients indicate the difference between water absorption potential and transpiration during plant growth period the lower baseline represents the conditions in which a plant is not subject to any limitations in terms of water supply also using idso et al 1981 the upper baseline values for maize were obtained at three growth stages as 4 69 2 83 and 10 01 c respectively table 5 which indicates the difference between the upper baseline value for each maize growth stage the saturation of air by water vapor the complete stopping of transpiration at each stage of plant growth and thus the highest stress applying on it the values of the coefficients a and b of the lower baseline and the upper baseline values of the present study differed from those of other studies that were carried out for maize idso 1982 steele et al 1994 irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 2013 the values of the coefficients a and b in the many researchers such as idso 1982 steele et al 1994 irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 and taghvaeian et al 2013 are a 3 11 b 0 197 a 2 14 b 0 197 a 1 39 b 0 086 a 2 73 b 0 190 and a 3 04 b 0 199 respectively it should be noted that the coefficients a and b of the stages of vegetative phase floral initiation and flowering pollination of the present study on july 11 to july 21 and july 25 to august 18 are respectively similar to the coefficients obtained idso 1982 and steele et al 1994 in the studies conducted by irmak et al 2000 taghvaeian et al 2012 and taghvaeian et al 2013 on august 3 to september 12 1995 in southern turkey august 5 to september 2 2011 in northeastern colorado using remote sensing and august 4 to september 22 2011 in northern colorado the mean value of the upper baseline was respectively 4 60 4 14 and 4 38 c which is close to the upper baseline 4 69 c of the present study at the vegetative phase floral initiation stage on july 11 to july 21 also a two year research on maize summer 2012 and 2013 in north colorado usa by dejonge et al 2015 obtained the coefficients a and b for the lower baseline of 2 34 and 0 179 respectively which were close to the coefficients of second stage of growth flowering pollination of the present study it should be noted in the studies conducted by taghvaeian et al 2013 and dejonge et al 2015 at a common location the city of greeley in northern colorado a different coefficient a was obtained therefore it is necessary to determine the position of the baselines for each plant during different plant growth stages based on the type of irrigation system and management conditions so that more precise irrigation scheduling can be done in general the location of the baselines depends on the type of plant plant variety soil type and climate conditions of each region and these baselines should be developed for each region taghvaeian et al 2013 the specificity of the baselines for each plant indicates that while maximum transpiration each plant responds to a certain size against environmental changes stresses and meteorological parameters that transpiration values vary in crops the first step for estimating cwsi is the development of baselines for the plant taghvaeian et al 2012 given the equations of lower and upper baselines for the three stages of maize growth table 5 as well as tc ta average calculation in the days before irrigation the cwsi values were calculated using eq 6 for all three treatments i1 i2 and i3 table 6 according to table 6 cwsi threshold values for control treatment i3 in three stages of growth were 0 13 0 55 and 0 15 respectively and also average values of cwsi during maize growth period for three treatments of 50 75 and 100 of water requirement was 0 53 0 44 and 0 28 respectively as previously mentioned according to idso et al 1981 the cwsi range was between zero and 1 0 but some research results showed that cwsi values exceeded the range of zero and one taghvaeian et al 2012 2013 in this study the values between zero and 1 0 were used to calculate the average cwsi ahi et al 2015 depending on the conditions of sw atmosphere and the plant sometimes dtm values greater than dtu l may be obtained so cwsi can be slightly larger than 1 0 dejonge et al 2015 maximum cwsi for all three treatments occurred on july 25 to august 18 and the highest cwsi is for severe deficit irrigation i1 the plant closes its stomata reduced transpiration and due to less irrigation to cope with deficit irrigation taghvaeian et al 2013 resulting in increased tc and consequently cwsi increases given that the climatic conditions are the same for the three treatments tc is the only factor that has increased cwsi in the i1 treatment in general cwsi values increase with increasing water stress ahi et al 2015 the empirical method of cwsi idso et al 1981 has been used in several studies to manage maize irrigation taghvaeian et al 2013 irmak et al 2000 conducted a study on maize under semi arid mediterranean conditions antalya turkey and found that the cwsi seasonal average should not be below 0 22 in order for the crop yield to not be reduced taghvaeian et al 2013 in north colorado usa obtained average cwsi for maize over 2 h of afternoon 12 00 13 00 and 13 00 14 00 and the whole study period early august to late september 2011 for three treatments including full low frequency deficit and high frequency deficit irrigation regimes as 0 19 0 57 and 0 20 respectively it should be noted that if the average cwsi in this study was limited to only the first three weeks before the senescence the cwsi values for the three treatments mentioned above are reduced to 0 02 0 40 and 0 04 respectively as a result in this study two treatments of full and high frequency deficit irrigation regimes did not experience significant water stress and the cwsi values in these two treatments are close to the mean value of cwsi of 0 28 in i3 treatment full irrigation of the present study as mentioned the maximum mean cwsi 0 53 in the present study was obtained for i1 treatment which is close to the mean cwsi for low frequency deficit irrigation regime 0 57 in the taghvaeian et al 2013 research cwsi is an indicator of the intensity of water stress that indicates the relationship between transpiration and water supply in canopy chen et al 2010 the difference and unconstancy of the threshold values of cwsi in various researches and the present research can be attributed to meteorological factors such as wind speed direction of wind clouds temperature etc and climate change chen et al 2010 type of irrigation system study area and planting date also if there is a significant change in the growth and stress level of the plant in the area the effect of the data collection location should be taken into account taghvaeian et al 2013 in most irrigation areas meteorological variables are measured on reference surfaces grass or alfalfa in standard meteorological stations which are usually kept under non stressed conditions full canopy in this case the cwsi threshold should be set for irrigation scheduling for dispersed and poor canopy taghvaeian et al 2013 3 2 irrigation scheduling using cwsi the purpose of cwsi is to provide a simple method for measuring plant water stress and as a tool for irrigation scheduling for crops and fruit trees chen et al 2010 one of the applications of cwsi is irrigation scheduling considering that the lowest cwsi 0 28 was observed in the control treatment non stressed therefore this treatment is the basis of irrigation scheduling based on idso et al 1981 for maize sc704 in the urmia region the values of cwsi have been presented in table 6 using eq 6 therefore according to the values of this index and eq 10 the relationships needed for irrigation scheduling for maize were extracted for three stages of maize growth table 7 10 c w s i i t c t a c a b a v p d t c t a u l a b a v p d the parameters of eq 10 have been previously described in section 2 5 1 1 to determine the irrigation time before introducing stress to the plant the avpd values should be measured at 11 50 to 14 50 and with the replacement in the extracted relationships for each growth stage table 7 the permitted tc ta c value is calculated the value of tc ta m can be measured and calculated at maximum stress conditions from 11 50 to 14 50 using the infrared thermometer the irrigation time can be determined by comparing tc ta m and tc ta c if the average of the measured values is less than the calculated permitted value the irrigation time is not yet reached however if the calculated permitted value is greater the irrigation time is past geiser et al 1982 also if between tc ta m and tc ta c are equal it indicates that it is the irrigation time geiser et al 1982 the baselines tables 5 and 7 can be transmitted not only based on the location but also possibly in similar climatic conditions taghvaeian et al 2012 3 3 relations between plant and soil indices the swrc data and the parameters of the van genuchten equation considerably control the physical properties of the soil asgarzadeh et al 2014 the fitness parameters of the van genuchten model 1980 for swrc in surface layer 10 15 cm and lower layer 30 35 cm have been presented in table 8 the coefficient of determination r2 obtained for the characteristic curves of these two layers is a high figure which shows that van genuchten 1980 model is well fitted on laboratory data fig 3 a in the present study 125 water requirement treatment i4 for air filled porosity afp was considered in the soil the afp critical limit for the root growth of more plants is about 10 da silva et al 1994 q values of soil that limits root development in the soil are reported in the range of 1 5 4 mpa and 2 mpa is the most acceptable value and well known critical q da silva et al 1994 due to the uniform distribution of water in laboratory soil samples and better control of the conditions asgarzadeh et al 2014 the coefficient of determination r2 obtained for the double layer sprc is greater which shows that the modified model of van genuchten 1980 is well fitted on laboratory data fig 3b also the fitness parameters of this model for sprc have been presented in table 8 in the lower layer due to compression and high bd soil porosity decreases fig 3b and moisture Œ∏ at the field capacity fc point increased compared to the lower surface layer also in this layer Œ∏ at the pwp point has increased more than the surface layer as a result soil available water for the plant has decreased increasing density and soil q reduces the absorption of nutrients oxygen deficiency and growth and causes root deformation raper 2005 critical q has been determined in fig 3b well known critical q occurs at different values of Œ∏ asgarzadeh et al 2014 in the present study the critical q value of 2 mpa occurs in compact soils lower layer in higher moisture content about 0 35 cm3 cm 3 and in the surface layer at lower moisture about 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the regression relationships between plant and soil indices measured simultaneously at maximum stress hour during the maize growth period were extracted the relationship of rwc with soil indices soil q and sw and the relationship tc ta with soil and plant indices q sw and rwc can be observed figs 4 and 5 at noon on sunny days rwc values for well irrigated for most grown plants are usually in the range of 0 85 0 95 hsiao and bradford 1983 the study of hofler diagram relationships between water potential and its components with rwc for wheat planted in the field showed that rwc is in the range of 0 80 to 0 83 such as the initial phase of wilting plasmolysis where the turgid pressure of the plant cells is zero turner 1981 kirkham 2005 in the present study rwc of 0 80 was considered as the critical limit according to fig 4a b the critical values obtained for q and sw are respectively 3 6 mpa and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 matric potential equal to 8900 hpa the value of 3 6 mpa found in this study was different from the critical value of 2 mpa fig 3b the well known 2 mpa obtained by using a cone penetrometer is approximately equal to the 4 mpa measured in the same moisture content by the micro penetrometer in the laboratory asgarzadeh et al 2014 therefore 3 6 mpa obtained for soil q is a reasonable value by substituting the critical values of q and sw in the linear relationships of fig 5a b the critical tc ta values of respectively 1 51 and 1 59 c were obtained also the permitted tc ta c was calculated for the maize growth period and the value of 1 54 c was obtained it should be noted that the permitted value obtained is very close to the critical values of tc ta mentioned above a research in central minnesota becker city was conducted by geiser et al 1982 for maize irrigation scheduling based on tc ta the model presented by them tc ta was considered as a dependent variable which was a function of three independent parameters rn rh and available water aw to use this model the aw value was considered constant 50 and the critical values of tc ta were obtained for different values of rn from 0 to 750 w m 2 and rh 20 80 the range of critical values of tc ta was between 3 c and 2 c the critical value obtained for tc ta in this study for maize was in the range determined by geiser et al 1982 for tc ta permitted tc ta c value 1 54 c was inserted in the linear relationship between tc ta and rwc fig 5c and the value of 0 796 was obtained for rwc as a result the same critical value 0 80 originally considered for rwc was obtained also given that the critical limit for sw was 0 27 cm3 cm 3 the plant is subjected to water stress in the moisture less than critical limit according to figs 4b and 5b the changes in rwc and tc ta are almost linear relative to sw that is with a lower sw the rwc decreases and the tc ta value increases also according to fig 5c by reducing rwc value tc ta value increases consequently with the decrease of avpd tc ta increases carlson et al 1972 measured leaf temperature of two soybean varieties under controlled irrigation using infrared thermometer during the 9 day experiment they concluded that by decreasing the values of rwc and avpd leaf temperature would increase with increasing ta irrigation management and scheduling is very important and if irrigation scheduling methods and tools are used properly a significant increase in water use efficiency can be achieved plant and soil moisture content are not used in calculating cwsi and only the thermal reflections of the plant are considered irrigation scheduling based on tc is more accurate than soil indices because it is based on the relationship between the transpiration rate of the plant and the evaporation power of the atmosphere given that cwsi is a valuable tool for irrigation scheduling however the calculation of avpd the availability of ta and rh values and then the cwsi calculation may restrict the practical application of this empirical method by farmers dejonge et al 2015 in this research plant and soil indices were used as a supplementary indicator for removing cwsi constraints using the regression relationships obtained between the indices without measuring the plant water content sw and soil q the plant s water status can be found only by measuring tc it should also be noted that among the mentioned indicators the supplementary index that can both eliminate cwsi constraints and have fast measurable capability in the field is soil q because the soil q measurement device is portable and the farmer can easily move it on the farm according to research results whitmore et al 2011 this index is even better than the soil matric potential and it can show the difference between soils because plant growth is due to changes in soil q it is more susceptible to matric potential changes hence soil q is a useful indicator for determining the irrigation time and improving irrigation management in this study the relationship between soil q and air temperature and canopy temperature as well as the relationship of other indices with each other was determined and the critical value of soil q for the maize crop was 3 6 mpa as the introduction of the paper emphasized the determination of critical values of soil q soil water and tc ta these values were considered in this study for different stages of maize growth which the data could be used as a reference for the development of irrigation systems another advantage of this research is that due to the simplicity of measuring most of the proposed parameters the farmer based on their existing facilities can use the determined relationships between soil and plant indices as well as the critical range obtained for irrigation of the farm for irrigation scheduling the irrigation start and end time should be determined in practice these indices can be used to determine the irrigation start time the irrigation time can be also determined according to the time of arrival of sw to fc moisture content and irrigation depth can be used with a volume meter for the irrigation end time 4 conclusions irrigation scheduling in this study was carried out using a manual infrared thermometer in urmia region for maize sc704 variety under different irrigation regimes with surface drip irrigation the empirical method presented by idso et al 1981 was used for maize irrigation scheduling the equations of lower and upper baselines as well as cwsi for three treatments of 50 75 and 100 of water requirement i1 i2 and i3 during the growth season was calculated using idso et al 1981 using the baselines extracted for each treatment the average cwsi values for maize growth season for i1 i2 and i3 treatments were calculated to be 0 53 0 44 and 0 28 respectively then relationships were established for determining the irrigation time using cwsi in urmia climate for three maize growth stages of vegetative phase floral initiation flowering pollination and seed seating seed filling as tc ta c 3 4617 0 1553 avpd tc ta c 2 5536 0 0556 avpd and tc ta c 7 2806 0 1572 avpd in this study soil and plant indices were used as a complementary indicator for eliminating cwsi constraints the regression relationships between these indices during the growth period of the plant were extracted which were simultaneously measured at the maximum stress time also the critical limits of tc ta q and sw for maize were obtained respectively at 1 5 c 3 6 mpa and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 matric potential of 8900 hpa respectively it is also possible to measure the soil q at the farm easily and faster compared to matric suction hence soil q can be a useful soil index for determining the irrigation time using these regression relationships obtained between the indices the water status of the plant can be examined by only measuring tc without measuring the rwc sw and soil q acknowledgments this research was funded by urmia university under grant no rd 2598 the authors also appreciate the support office of vice

10884,water shortage is a critical constraint limiting china s capacity for food security to provide evidence supporting environmentally sustainable water use in food production this study compared irrigation water productivities iwps and water scarcity footprints wsfs for china s wheat production at high spatial resolution contrary to previous water productivity studies assessing crop yield over total water consumption it was found that iwps in china s water scarce northern regions were much lower than those in water rich southern regions the wsfs further demonstrated the larger

increased irrigation demand and water scarcity today croplands suitable for wheat production lie fallow in some southern regions in the winter a national reassessment of this situation is urgently

2017 however the wp or iwp concept has limited meaning when comparing the values from locations with different water scarcity backgrounds this is because producing a crop with a high wp or iwp in a

irrigation water consumptions were modeled by the widely applied fao aquacrop model version 6 1 http www fao org aquacrop which simulated attainable yield as a function of water consumption under rain fed or irrigated conditions on a daily step raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 to facilitate the use of aquacrop and other models for a high number of spatial simulations a model independent and open source tool named geosim was previously developed as a plug in for quantum gis qgis https www qgis org and its application has been improved to efficiently work at china s national scale huang et al 2019 thorp and bronson 2013 geosim automates batch simulations with aquacrop for different locations by passing geospatial data from polygons in a base shapefile to the model input files and then similarly passing model outputs back to the base shapefile thorp and bronson 2013 six types of input data were used for the simulations 1 crop distribution 2 climate data 3 crop parameters 4 soil parameters 5 initial soil water conditions and 6 management data a shapefile vector data of national wheat distribution in 2015 was created from a raster dataset with a resolution of 5 arc minutes appendix a fig a 1 daily climate data from 825 meteorological stations across china from 2010 to 2015 were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic http data cma cn crop parameters including sowing dates sowing density growing stages and harvest dates were also obtained from the nmic additional crop data such as crop transpiration yield formation and soil water stresses were based on the conservative wheat parameters provided by the aquacrop reference manual http www fao org aquacrop and studies which documented these parameters for both spring and winter wheat production modeling in china huang et al 2019 primary soil data applied to identify soil textures were obtained from the harmonized world soil database wieder et al 2014 the indicative values of several soil hydraulic parameters for each soil type were obtained from the aquacrop reference manual to avoid modeling failures caused by low soil water content that affects canopy development the initial soil water contents were assumed to be at field capacity which was the default value of aquacrop due to the lack of detailed national irrigation management data irrigation water consumption and wheat yields under irrigation conditions were modeled by applying the option of determination of net irrigation requirement in aquacrop which are calculated by adding a small amount of water to the soil profile each day when the root zone depletion exceeds a specified threshold the threshold for the allowable root zone depletion was set as 50 of the readily available soil water which was identified as a threshold for wheat irrigation management in china zhang et al 2015 the default rain fed condition in aquacrop was applied to simulate the wheat yield under rain fed conditions other management effects such as fertilizer application and ground surface cover were disregarded groundwater characteristics such as the depth and quality were not considered due to the lack of a detailed national dataset all the input files of climate crop soil initial condition and irrigation management were prepared according to the aquacrop formats besides these files the aquacrop modeling requires day numbers to indicate the first and last days of cropping and simulation periods for each year the calculation of these variables follows from our previous study huang et al 2019 after all the input files were prepared geosim was used to pass only the names of the files and day numbers corresponding to each spatial unit in the base layer shapefile to aquacrop s project file which controls the aquacrop simulations by minimizing the spatial inputs and identifying unique response units unique combinations of climate crop soil and day numbers the efficiency of aquacrop in conducting national scale simulations was improved huang et al 2019 as the model completed the simulation the results for wheat yields and irrigation water consumptions under irrigated conditions and wheat yields under rain fed conditions were post processed by geosim and native qgis tools finally wheat yields and irrigation water consumptions from the base shapefile were converted back to raster datasets with a resolution of 5 arc minutes further details on the post processing is described in our previous study huang et al 2019 2 2 irrigation water productivity calculation irrigation water productivity for wheat production in each grid cell iwpgrid kg m 3 was defined as the total wheat production of each grid cell pgrid kg divided by the total irrigation water consumption of each grid cell igrid m3 1 i

cropland in each grid cell the areas of the irrigated croplands and the total croplands at a county level were obtained for the year 2015 from national statistics nbsc 2011 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 2011 2016 this data was used to derive the firri for each county which was subsequently converted to a raster dataset fig a 2 we assumed that in each county the irrigation water use was equally distributed among the area equipped for irrigation the iwps of wheat production across china were presented in a raster map with a resolution of 5 arc minutes in addition the grid based iwps were aggregated to average iwps for each of china s agro ecological zones aezs fig 1 eq 4 which were defined based on climatic soil and landform characteristics liu and chen 2005 4 i w p a e z i w p g r i d i g r i d i

consumption to water availability to express the environmental relevance of water use pfister et al 2009 5 w s f g r i d i g r i d p g r i d w s i g r i d the gird based wsis were originated from a global dataset for the decade 2000 2009 then the data were rescaled to the period of 2010 2015 by using the data of water availability water use and precipitation for each of china s first order basins cmwr 2000 2015cmwr 2015cmwr 2000 2015 scherer and pfister 2016 the primary 30 arc minute data were disaggregated by bilinear interpolation to 5 arc minutes the raster map of wsis can be found in the appendix a fig a 3 the wsfs of wheat production across china were also presented in both a raster map with a resolution of 5 arc minutes and a aez map the wsfs for each of china s aezs were calculated by the following equation 6 w s f a e z w s f g r i d p g r i d p g r i d 2 4 hotspots identification to identify the hotspot regions iwps and wsfs at both grid and aez scales were classified as low moderate and high by dividing them into terciles i e if they were below the 33 3 quantile here iwp 5 2 kg m 3 wsf 0 0065 m3 h2oe kg 1 between 33 3 and 66 7 and above 66 7 here iwp 15 8 kg m 3 wsf 0 058 m3 h2oe kg 1 thus there can be nine combinations of iwps and wsfs the combinations were mapped using a matrix for color coding and the corresponding wheat areas identified by each color were calculated and presented as percentages of the total wheat area the hotspot regions were defined as the regions with low iwps but high wsfs which means a lot of irrigation water is used for wheat production in water scarce regions trade offs can occur if iwp is low i e water is wasted but wsf is low i e environmental impacts are low because of water abundance or if iwp is high i e water is saved but wsf is also high i e environmental impacts are high because of water scarcity since there was considerable uncertainty in the choice of boundaries which would be further increased by combining two indicators with different units we judged this qualitative representation as adequate for the type of information being analyzed rather than including more precise quantitative details 3 results 3 1 wheat production and irrigation water consumption the highest amounts of grid based wheat production were mainly observed in the huang huai hai aezs fig a 4a the total production of these aezs contributed to approximately 60 of the total national wheat production similarly the highest amount of irrigation consumption for wheat production was also observed in the in the huang huai hai aezs fig a 4b since the amount of precipitation is very low in most of the region during the winter wheat cropping season irrigation is essential for wheat growth it accounted for approximately 66 of the total national irrigation consumption for wheat production 3 2 irrigation water productivities and water scarcity footprints iwps vary largely across regions in line with differences in wheat yield and irrigation intensity most of the rain fed or idly irrigated unnecessarily irrigated without achieving any yield improvements wheat production areas were located in the water rich southern region fig 2 a low irrigation water consumption in some southern and northeastern regions resulted in much higher iwps 20 0 kg m 3 compared to wheat grown in some northern northwestern and southwestern regions 2 5 kg m 3 according to the aez scale fig 2b the northwest aezs had much lower iwps 2 5 kg m 3 while some southwest sichuan basin and northeast aezs had much higher iwps 20 0 kg m 3 if idle irrigation was avoided most aezs in the southern regions could have higher iwps e g the iwp of the southwest aez encoded as 9 2 may increase from 31 3 to 35 6 kg m 3 larger environmental impacts resulted from irrigation in water scarce regions such as the huang huai hai and northwestern regions fig 3 a the wsfs of wheat in these regions were higher than 0 10 m3 h2oe kg 1 in contrast the wsfs of wheat produced in some southern and northeastern regions were less than 0 01 m3 h2oe kg 1 at the aez scale fig 3b the northwest aezs as well as some huang huai hai aezs had much higher wsfs 0 10 m3 h2oe kg 1 while most northeast aezs and most aezs in southern china had much lower wsfs 0 02 m3 h2oe kg 1 3 3 hotspot regions the hotspot regions were identified as the grid cells with iwps in the lowest tercile 5 2 kg m 3 but with wsfs in the highest tercile 0 058 m3 h2oe kg 1 marked red in fig 4 a the hotspot regions accounted for 34 of the total wheat cropping area fig 4c 32 of the national wheat production and 61 of the national irrigation consumption for wheat production most hotspot regions were located in the huang huai hai and northwestern regions the most sustainable water use was found in the northeastern and southern regions accounting for 11 of the national wheat cropping area dark green in fig 4a at the aez scale fig 4b the hotspot aezs were identified as the northwest and several huang huai hai aezs some aezs in the huang huai hai region and surroundings also had very high wsfs but moderate iwps light coral in fig 4c 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other research most previous studies focus on the water productivity wp of wheat production cao et al 2015 huang and li 2010 liu et al 2007a 2007b the virtual water vw siebert and d√∂ll 2010 sun et al 2013 or the vw derived water footprint wfvw cao et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 zhuo et al 2016 to our knowledge iwps and wsfs for wheat production have not yet been estimated with such a high spatial resolution at the national scale this impeded conducting a detailed spatial comparison with other research to ease the comparison the grid based iwps and wsfs were aggregated to national and regional average values and compared with literature values after harmonizing the concepts e g wp vs iwp and units table 1 the national and regional average iwps in this study were higher than those derived from the literature cao et al 2015 huang and li 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 sun et al 2013 zhuo et al 2016 an important reason is that most other studies used the wheat yield data from statistics or scaled the modeled yields to fit the statistics but applied modeled water consumption values under full irrigation cao et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 which mixes optimal irrigation with suboptimal yields and may therefore overestimate the irrigation water consumption and result in lower iwps in contrast by applying the option of determination of net irrigation requirements in aquacrop without considering stress factors such as low fertility and high salinity this study consistently assumes optimal conditions but may overestimate the wheat yield and result in higher iwps the average national wheat yield the total production divided by the total cropping area in this study was 6 5 t ha 1 while the average national data from the statistics during 2010 2015 was 5 0 t ha 1 nbsc 2011 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 2011 2016 other reasons such as different studied time series and spatial resolutions may also result in higher iwps in this study compared with previous studies higher wheat yields were also a reason for lower wsfs in this study compared with previous studies pfister and bayer 2014 scherer and pfister 2016 in addition this study calculated the national wsf as a production weighted average based on gridded data for both water consumption and wsi while pfister and bayer 2014 applied water consumption at the grid level but wsis at the watershed level and scherer and pfister 2016 focused their study on spatially explicit wsis and only used national scale crop production data to calculate wsfs for a few case studies the different methods and different studied time series can also cause different results to identify the hotspot regions the relative iwp and wsf values across china rather than the absolute values are more meaningful despite different absolute values among the studies the spatial variation identified in iwps and wsfs by this study resembles other studies huang and li 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 pfister and bayer 2014 sun et al 2013 the water scarce northern regions such as the huang huai and hai basins always had lower iwps than the water rich southern regions such as the yangtze basin for example this study found that the iwp of wheat produced in the hai basin was 3 5 kg m 3 while that in the yangtze basin was 14 4 kg m 3 similar results were obtained from huang and li 2010 who estimated an iwp of 1 8 kg m 3 for the hai basin and an iwp of 19 4 kg m 3 for the yangtze basin detailed regional wsf values were not available in previous studies but the global map in pfister and bayer 2014 demonstrated a similar trend as this study illustrating that the wsfs of the northern regions such as the huang huai hai basins and northwest area were much higher than most southern regions 4 2 implications of this study previous studies have reported that wheat production in china s water scarce northern regions e g huang huai hai basins had higher wps than most southern regions e g yangtze basin cao et al 2015 huang and li 2010 liu et al 2007a this wp indicator which integrates green i e soil moisture and blue water i e groundwater or surface water into a single assessment of water consumption is confusing as the consumption of green water is not equivalent to the consumption of blue water by assessing the blue water related iwps this study presents data contrary to what was previously thought iwps in china s water scarce northern regions e g the huang huai hai and northwestern aezs were much lower than those in the water rich southern regions e g aezs in the southwest and sichuan basin this is because the irrigation consumption in the north was much higher than in the south thus it is suggested that the wp results can mislead policy decisions for water management as some research has argued that products should be traded from regions with high wps to regions with low wps chapagain and hoekstra 2008 dalin et al 2014 if more wheat would be sourced from china s water scarce northern regions it would require more irrigation and place a huge amount of pressure on the local water sources however although the iwp indicator can illustrate the unsustainable water use of china s wheat production to a certain degree this concept can also be confusing because it still fails to consider variations in the environmental relevance of water from different locations several previous studies have illustrated that water use indicators that do not consider environmental relevance have the potential to misinform and motivate behaviors that potentially conflict with the goal of reducing pressure on freshwater systems huang et al 2014 ridoutt and huang 2012 ridoutt and pfister 2010a this study again illustrated that high iwps can also occur in water stressed regions resulting in very high environmental impacts mango color in fig 4a by applying both iwp and wsf indicators this study demonstrated that the current water use for wheat production in the water scarce northern regions where the iwps were low but the wsfs were high is highly unsustainable the hotspot regions accounted for 34 of the total wheat cropping area considering all the regions with high wsfs the contribution of hotspot regions was as high as 54 marked red light coral and mango colors in fig 4a an important conclusion to be drawn from this study is that the pressure that wheat production puts on freshwater systems arises from the current patterns of water consumption which often occurs in highly water stressed regions wheat has a very wide suitable growing zone in china iiasa fao 2012 however this study found that more than 60 of the total national wheat production was concentrated in the water scarce huang huai hai region indicating that extensive wheat production in this region prohibited water sustainability davis et al 2017 identified that optimizing the global distribution of major crops can reduce the current consumptive use of blue water by 12 while increasing the production and this was substantial compared with solutions such as improvements in crop wp and the minimization of food waste in the case of china s wheat production the priority for reducing this pressure can be given to optimizing the current water use patterns by redistributing the national wheat cropping historically southern china was also an important contributor of wheat production however the wheat production in some southern regions including the aezs in jiangnan sichuan the southwest and the south has decreased by 44 from 1980 to 2015 nbsc 1981 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 1981 2016 due to numerous socioeconomic factors especially the shifting of the labor force from rural to urban and suburban areas more and more agricultural land with high quality lie fallow each winter in south china a land area of 2 1 107 ha which is suitable for winter wheat production lie fallow in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze basin accounting for 46 of the arable land in the region bao et al 2014 zhai et al 2012 thus china s wheat production is experiencing a paradox wheat is mainly produced in severely water scarce regions while the suitable farmland in the water rich regions lie fallow to solve this problem a national wheat cropping adjustment is necessary and urgent to overcome the mismatch of water availability and water consumption between the south and the north china has been developing approximately 20 major water transfer projects including the world s largest the south north water transfer project liu et al 2013 furthermore the chinese government made a decision in 2011 to invest approximately 630 billion usd into water conservation from 2012 to 2020 and planned to establish a pricing mechanism to encourage saving water within a decade huang and yang 2017 on cultivated land priority has been given towards improving land productivity through developing high standard farmlands that are highly drought and flood resistant huang and yang 2017 all these strategies can alleviate the regional water stress to a certain degree however this study revealed that water consumption in some places has a greater potential for environmental harm than in others it is the consumption patterns rather than the overall water consumption that deserves more attention in policy development fortunately in 2016 the chinese government announced a pilot plan called the winter fallow policy in the heilonggang region located in the huang huai hai region where the groundwater level has declined rapidly in recent years due to irrigation by providing a certain number of subsidies called ecological compensations farmers in the heilonggang region were encouraged to abandon traditional wheat production however the heilonggang region only accounted for a small part of the water scarce region less than 2 of the hotspot regions identified by this study thus the winter fallow policy has little impact on the regional water use in addition political decisions on land and water use lead to changes in the food supply system which can have important environmental consequences extending beyond the local region huang et al 2014 it is therefore essential that strategies are aimed at sustainable water use to better integrate food security the socioeconomic situation and the environment 5 conclusions this study has highlighted the importance of putting regional freshwater issues into a national context the water indicator results obtained in this study lead to several strategic implications for china s wheat production first efforts to address environmental impacts benefit from being guided by wsfs rather than other volumetric based indicators high wsf values highlight the need for more urgent actions second the national adjustment of cropping has a high potential to alleviate regional water stress opportunities to increase wheat production in southern regions can be explored third regional decisions could avoid unintended negative consequences by integrating national water food and socioeconomic considerations it is critical that policies affecting land and water use consider the wider implications of meeting national food demands moving beyond these strategic recommendations further research with a narrower scope is recommended to assess the specific managerial options this case study of china s wheat production is likely to be representative of the challenges faced by many of the world s countries where pressures on land and water resources are high and a sustainable means of increasing food supply must be found acknowledgments this work was supported by china s national key research and development program grant number 2016yfd0300210 and the longshan academic talent research supporting

10884,water shortage is a critical constraint limiting china s capacity for food security to provide evidence supporting environmentally sustainable water use in food production this study compared irrigation water productivities iwps and water scarcity footprints wsfs for china s wheat production at high spatial resolution contrary to previous water productivity studies assessing crop yield over total water consumption it was found that iwps in china s water scarce northern regions were much lower than those in water rich southern regions the wsfs further demonstrated the larger environmental impacts resulting from irrigation in water scarce northern regions hotspot regions having iwps in the lowest tercile 5 2 kg m 3 and wsfs in the highest tercile 0 058 m3 h2oe kg 1 were mainly located in the huang huai hai and northwestern regions and accounted for 34 of the cropping area but 61 of irrigation water use historically the south was also an important contributor of china s wheat production but progressive shifts toward highly resource efficient cropping in the huang huai hai region has occurred the paradox is that gains in total crop water efficiency have led to increased irrigation demand and water scarcity today croplands suitable for wheat production lie fallow in some southern regions in the winter a national reassessment of this situation is urgently needed keywords food production environmental impacts water security hotspots crop distribution 1 introduction feeding a growing population while minimizing global environmental impacts are twin challenges faced by the global food system davis et al 2017 foley et al 2011 scherer et al 2018 as the world s most populous and largest food consuming country china s food security has been an issue of broad concern for a long time brown 1997 dalin et al 2015 heilig et al 2009 water shortage is recognized as the most critical constraint that limits china s capacity for food security du et al 2014 huang and li 2010 khan et al 2009 although china s water resources are large in absolute terms the average water resources per capita are less than one third of the global average kang et al 2017 moreover increasing demand worsening water pollution spatially and seasonally uneven water distributions and climate change have aggravated the water shortage and deteriorated china s aquatic ecosystem cai et al 2017 xiong et al 2009 zuo et al 2018 the agricultural sector is responsible for the most water use in china accounting for 63 nbsc 2011 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 2011 2016 to address the water for food dilemma in china improving crop water productivity wp especially irrigation water productivity iwp has been an important measure for ensuring china s water and food security iwp refers to the total crop yield divided by the total amount of irrigation water used for crops i e it is high if crop yields are high and irrigation is low china s national grain iwp has increased from 0 8 kg m 3 in the early 1990s to 1 6 kg m 3 in 2013 kang et al 2017 currently improving wp and iwp remains the chief concern for china s agricultural water management du et al 2015 geng et al 2019 kang et al 2017 however the wp or iwp concept has limited meaning when comparing the values from locations with different water scarcity backgrounds this is because producing a crop with a high wp or iwp in a water scarce region can cause more serious environmental impacts than producing a crop with a low wp in a water rich region as described by a life cycle assessment lca based water scarcity footprint wsf indicator ridoutt and pfister 2010a thus the wp concept as well as other volumetric water use indicators such as virtual water vw which for crops refers to the actual evapotranspiration over the crop yield chapagain and hoekstra 2008 or the vw derived water footprint wfvw aldaya et al 2012 have the potential to misinform water management decisions ridoutt and huang 2012 ridoutt and pfister 2010a it is reported that most global freshwater withdrawals currently occur in watersheds with extreme water stress ridoutt and pfister 2010b that said the urgent need to reduce the pressure that humanity exerts on the freshwater system does not arise from an absolute shortage of freshwater in the world but rather from the current pattern of freshwater use similar situations exist in the current state of crop production in china for example it is well known that the extremely water scarce north china plain with a water availability of less than 150 m3 per capita per year produces more than half of the national wheat and one third of maize cmwr 2000 2015cmwr 2015cmwr 2000 2015 nbsc 2011 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 2011 2016 the growing demand for irrigation water in this region has resulted in an overdraft of groundwater and therefore falling groundwater tables and increased land degradation a number of studies have focused on this issue and mitigation strategies have been identified such as improving the wp or iwp of crop production from a technological perspective and restricting the amount of water extraction from a policy perspective dalin et al 2015 kang et al 2017 yang et al 2003 however as mentioned above these strategies focus on the local conservation of water rather than considering environmental impacts at the national scale failing to provide useful information for supporting environmentally sustainable water use in china s food production to present a picture of national water use associated with wheat production and identify relevant hotspots this study compared both the iwps and wsfs of wheat production across china a geospatial simulation tool geosim was applied to manage the fao aquacrop model for spatial simulations of wheat yield and irrigation water consumption from 2010 to 2015 2015 being the most recent year for which most of the data were available hotspot regions with low iwps but high wsfs were identified with a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes and were also presented at the scale of china s agro ecological zones aezs the overall goal was to provide scientific evidence that will enable policies to set national agricultural water use priorities across regions by considering the environmental implications of meeting food security 2 material and methods 2 1 wheat yield and irrigation water consumption modeling wheat yields and

wheat production modeling in china huang et al 2019 primary soil data applied to identify soil textures were obtained from the harmonized world soil database wieder et al 2014 the indicative values of several soil hydraulic parameters for each soil type were obtained from the aquacrop reference manual to avoid modeling failures caused by low soil water content that affects canopy development the initial soil water contents were assumed to be at field capacity which was the default value of aquacrop due to the lack of detailed national irrigation management data irrigation water consumption and wheat yields under irrigation conditions were modeled by applying the option of determination of net irrigation requirement in aquacrop which are calculated by adding a small amount of water to the soil profile each day when the root zone depletion exceeds a specified threshold the threshold for the allowable root zone depletion was set as 50 of the readily available soil water which was identified as a threshold for wheat irrigation management in china zhang et al 2015 the default rain fed condition in aquacrop was applied to simulate the wheat yield under rain fed conditions other management effects such as fertilizer application and ground surface cover were disregarded groundwater characteristics such as the depth and quality were not considered due to the lack of a detailed national dataset all the input files of climate crop soil initial condition and irrigation management were prepared according to the aquacrop formats besides these files the aquacrop modeling requires day numbers to indicate the first and last days of cropping and simulation periods for each year the calculation of these variables follows from our previous study huang et al 2019 after all the input files were prepared geosim was used to pass only the names of the files and day numbers corresponding to each spatial unit in the base layer shapefile to aquacrop s project file which controls the aquacrop simulations by minimizing the spatial inputs and identifying unique response units unique combinations of climate crop soil and day numbers the efficiency of aquacrop in conducting national scale simulations was improved huang et al 2019 as the model completed the simulation the results for wheat yields and irrigation water consumptions under irrigated conditions and wheat yields under rain fed conditions were post processed by geosim and native qgis tools finally wheat yields and irrigation water consumptions from the base shapefile were converted back to raster datasets with a

consumption to water availability to express the environmental relevance of water use pfister et al 2009 5 w s f g r i d i g r i d p g r i d w s i g r i d the gird based wsis were originated from a global dataset for the decade 2000 2009 then the data were rescaled to the period of 2010 2015 by using the data of water availability water use and precipitation for each of china s first order basins cmwr 2000 2015cmwr 2015cmwr 2000 2015 scherer and pfister 2016 the primary 30 arc minute data were disaggregated by bilinear interpolation to 5 arc minutes the raster map of wsis can be found in the appendix a fig a 3 the wsfs of wheat production across china were also presented in both a raster map with a resolution of 5 arc minutes and a aez map the wsfs for each of china s aezs were calculated by the following equation 6 w s f a e z w s f g r i d p g r i d p g r i d 2 4 hotspots identification to identify the hotspot regions iwps and wsfs at both grid and aez scales were classified as low moderate and high by dividing them into terciles i e if they were below the 33 3 quantile here iwp 5 2 kg m 3 wsf 0 0065 m3 h2oe kg 1 between 33 3 and 66 7 and above 66 7 here iwp 15 8 kg m 3 wsf 0 058 m3 h2oe kg 1 thus there can be nine combinations of iwps and wsfs the combinations were mapped using a matrix for color coding and the corresponding wheat areas identified by each color were calculated and presented as percentages of the total wheat area the hotspot regions were defined as the regions with low iwps but high wsfs which means a lot of irrigation water is used for wheat production in water scarce regions trade offs can occur if iwp is low i e water is wasted but wsf is low i e environmental impacts are low because of water abundance or if iwp is high i e water is saved but wsf is also high i e environmental impacts are high because of water scarcity since there was considerable uncertainty in the choice of boundaries which would be further increased by combining two indicators with different units we judged this qualitative representation as adequate for the type of information being analyzed rather than including more precise quantitative details 3 results 3 1 wheat production and irrigation water consumption the highest amounts of grid based wheat production were mainly observed in the huang huai hai aezs fig a 4a the total production of these aezs contributed to approximately 60 of the total national wheat production similarly the highest amount of irrigation consumption for wheat production was also observed in the in the huang huai hai aezs fig a 4b since the amount of precipitation is very low in most of the region during the winter wheat cropping season irrigation is essential for wheat growth it accounted for approximately 66 of the total national irrigation consumption for wheat production 3 2 irrigation water productivities and water scarcity footprints iwps vary largely across regions in line with differences in wheat yield and irrigation intensity most of the rain fed or idly irrigated unnecessarily irrigated without achieving any yield improvements wheat production areas were located in the water rich southern region fig 2 a low irrigation water consumption in some southern and northeastern regions resulted in much higher iwps 20 0 kg m 3 compared to wheat grown in some northern northwestern and southwestern regions 2 5 kg m 3 according to the aez scale fig 2b the northwest aezs had much lower iwps 2 5 kg m 3 while some southwest sichuan basin and northeast aezs had much higher iwps 20 0 kg m 3 if idle irrigation was avoided most aezs in the southern regions could have higher iwps e g the iwp of the southwest aez encoded as 9 2 may increase from 31 3 to 35 6 kg m 3 larger environmental impacts resulted from irrigation in water scarce regions such as the huang huai hai and northwestern regions fig 3 a the wsfs of wheat in these regions were higher than 0 10 m3 h2oe kg 1 in contrast the wsfs of wheat produced in some southern and northeastern regions were less than 0 01 m3 h2oe kg 1 at the aez scale fig 3b the northwest aezs as well as some huang huai hai aezs had much higher wsfs 0 10 m3 h2oe kg 1 while most northeast aezs and most aezs in southern china had much lower wsfs 0 02 m3 h2oe kg 1 3 3 hotspot regions the hotspot regions were identified as the grid cells with iwps in the lowest tercile 5 2 kg m 3 but with wsfs in the highest tercile 0 058 m3 h2oe kg 1 marked red in fig 4 a the hotspot regions accounted for 34 of the total wheat cropping area fig 4c 32 of the national wheat production and 61 of the national irrigation consumption for wheat production most hotspot regions were located in the huang huai hai and northwestern regions the most sustainable water use was found in the northeastern and southern regions accounting for 11 of the national wheat cropping area dark green in fig 4a at the aez scale fig 4b the hotspot aezs were identified as the northwest and several huang huai hai aezs some aezs in the huang huai hai region and surroundings also had very high wsfs but moderate iwps light coral in fig 4c 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other research most previous studies focus on the water productivity wp of wheat production cao et al 2015 huang and li 2010 liu et al 2007a 2007b the virtual water vw siebert and d√∂ll 2010 sun et al 2013 or the vw derived water footprint wfvw cao et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 zhuo et al 2016 to our knowledge iwps and wsfs for wheat production have not yet been estimated with such a high spatial resolution at the national scale this impeded conducting a detailed spatial comparison with other research to ease the comparison the grid based iwps and wsfs were aggregated to national and regional average values and compared with literature values after harmonizing the concepts e g wp vs iwp and units table 1 the national and regional average iwps in this study were higher than those derived from the literature cao et al 2015 huang and li 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 sun et al 2013 zhuo et al 2016 an important reason is that most other studies used the wheat yield data from statistics or scaled the modeled yields to fit the statistics but applied modeled water consumption values under full irrigation cao et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 which mixes optimal irrigation with suboptimal yields and may therefore overestimate the irrigation water consumption and result in lower iwps in contrast by applying the option of determination of net irrigation requirements in aquacrop without considering stress factors such as low fertility and high salinity this study consistently assumes optimal conditions but may overestimate the wheat yield and result in higher iwps the average national wheat yield the total production divided by the total cropping area in this study was 6 5 t ha 1 while the average national data from the statistics during 2010 2015 was 5 0 t ha 1 nbsc 2011 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 2011 2016 other reasons such as different studied time series and spatial resolutions may also result in higher iwps in this study compared with previous studies higher wheat yields were also a reason for lower wsfs in this study compared with previous studies pfister and bayer 2014 scherer and pfister 2016 in addition this study calculated the national wsf as a production weighted average based on gridded data for both water consumption and wsi while pfister and bayer 2014 applied water consumption at the grid level but wsis at the watershed level and scherer and pfister 2016 focused their study on spatially explicit wsis and only used national scale crop production data to calculate wsfs for a few case studies the different methods and different studied time series can also cause different results to identify the hotspot regions the relative iwp and wsf values across china rather than the absolute values are more meaningful despite different absolute values among the studies the spatial variation identified in iwps and wsfs by this study resembles other studies huang and li 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 pfister and bayer 2014 sun et al 2013 the water scarce northern regions such as the huang huai and hai basins always had lower iwps than the water rich southern regions such as the yangtze basin for example this study found that the iwp of wheat produced in the hai basin was 3 5 kg m 3 while that in the yangtze basin was 14 4 kg m 3 similar results were obtained from huang and li 2010 who estimated an iwp of 1 8 kg m 3 for the hai basin and an iwp of 19 4 kg m 3 for the yangtze basin detailed regional wsf values were not available in previous studies but the global map in pfister and bayer 2014 demonstrated a similar trend as this study illustrating that the wsfs of the northern regions such as the huang huai hai basins and northwest area were much higher than most southern regions 4 2 implications of this study previous studies have reported that wheat production in china s water scarce northern regions e g huang huai hai basins had higher wps than most southern regions e g yangtze basin cao et al 2015 huang and li 2010 liu et al 2007a this wp indicator which integrates green i e soil moisture and blue water i e groundwater or surface water into a single assessment of water consumption is confusing as the consumption of green water is not equivalent to the consumption of blue water by assessing the blue water related iwps this study presents data contrary to what was previously thought iwps in china s water scarce northern regions e g the huang huai hai and northwestern aezs were much lower than those in the water rich southern regions e g aezs in the southwest and sichuan basin this is because the irrigation consumption in the north was much higher than in the south thus it is suggested that the wp results can mislead policy decisions for water management as some research has argued that products should be traded from regions with high wps to regions with low wps chapagain and hoekstra 2008 dalin et al 2014 if more wheat would be sourced from china s water scarce northern regions it would require more irrigation and place a huge amount of pressure on the local water sources however although the iwp indicator can illustrate the unsustainable water use of china s wheat production to a certain degree this concept can also be confusing because it still fails to consider variations in the environmental relevance of water from different locations several previous studies have illustrated that water use indicators that do not consider environmental relevance have the potential to misinform and motivate behaviors that potentially conflict with the goal of reducing pressure on freshwater systems huang et al 2014 ridoutt and huang 2012 ridoutt and pfister 2010a this study again illustrated that high iwps can also occur in water stressed regions resulting in very high environmental impacts mango color in fig 4a by applying both iwp and wsf indicators this study demonstrated that the current water use for wheat production in the water scarce northern regions where the iwps were low but the wsfs were high is highly unsustainable the hotspot regions accounted for 34 of the total wheat cropping area considering all the regions with high wsfs the contribution of hotspot regions was as high as 54 marked red light coral and mango colors in fig 4a an important conclusion to be drawn from this study is that the pressure that wheat production puts on freshwater systems arises from the current patterns of water consumption which often occurs in highly water stressed regions wheat has a very wide suitable growing zone in china iiasa fao 2012 however this study found that more than 60 of the total national wheat production was concentrated in the water scarce huang huai hai region indicating that extensive wheat production in this region prohibited water sustainability davis et al 2017 identified that optimizing the global distribution of major crops can reduce the current consumptive use of blue water by 12 while increasing the production and this was substantial compared with solutions such as improvements in crop wp and the minimization of food waste in the case of china s wheat production the priority for reducing this pressure can be given to optimizing the current water use patterns by redistributing the national wheat cropping historically southern china was also an important contributor of wheat production however the wheat production in some southern regions including the aezs in jiangnan sichuan the southwest and the south has decreased by 44 from 1980 to 2015 nbsc 1981 2016nbsc 2016nbsc 1981 2016 due to numerous socioeconomic factors especially the shifting of the labor force from rural to urban and suburban areas more and more agricultural land with high quality lie fallow each winter in south china a land area of 2 1 107 ha which is suitable for winter wheat production lie fallow in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze basin accounting for 46 of the arable land in the region bao et al 2014 zhai et al 2012 thus china s wheat production is experiencing a paradox wheat is mainly produced in severely water scarce regions while the suitable farmland in the water rich regions lie fallow to solve this problem a national wheat cropping adjustment is necessary and urgent to overcome the mismatch of water availability and water consumption between the south and the north china has been developing approximately 20 major water transfer projects including the world s largest the south north water transfer project liu et al 2013 furthermore the chinese government made a decision in 2011 to invest approximately 630 billion usd into water conservation from 2012 to 2020 and planned to establish a pricing mechanism to encourage saving water within a decade huang and yang 2017 on cultivated land priority has been given towards improving land productivity through developing high standard farmlands that are highly drought and flood resistant huang and yang 2017 all these strategies can alleviate the regional water stress to a certain degree however this study revealed that water consumption in some places has a greater potential for environmental harm than in others it is the consumption patterns rather than the overall water consumption that deserves more attention in policy development fortunately in 2016 the chinese government announced a pilot plan called the winter fallow policy in the heilonggang region located in the huang huai hai region where the groundwater level has declined rapidly in recent years due to irrigation by providing a certain number of subsidies called ecological compensations farmers in the heilonggang region were encouraged to abandon traditional wheat production however the heilonggang region only accounted for a small part of the water scarce region less than 2 of the hotspot regions identified by this study thus the winter fallow policy has little impact on the regional water use in addition political decisions on land and water use lead to changes in the food supply system which can have important environmental consequences extending beyond the local region huang et al 2014 it is therefore essential that strategies are aimed at sustainable water use to better integrate food security the socioeconomic situation and the environment 5 conclusions this study has highlighted the importance of putting regional freshwater issues into a national context the water indicator results obtained in this study lead to several strategic implications for china s wheat production first efforts to address environmental impacts benefit from being guided by wsfs rather than other volumetric based indicators high wsf values highlight the need for more urgent actions second the national adjustment of cropping has a high potential to alleviate regional water stress opportunities to increase wheat production in southern regions can be explored third regional decisions could avoid unintended negative consequences by integrating national water food and socioeconomic considerations it is critical that policies affecting land and water use consider the wider implications of meeting national food demands moving beyond these strategic recommendations further research with a narrower scope is recommended to assess the specific managerial options this case study of china s wheat production is likely to be representative of the challenges faced by many of the world s countries where pressures on land and water resources are high and a sustainable means of increasing food supply must be found acknowledgments this work was supported by china s national key research and development program grant number 2016yfd0300210 and the longshan academic talent research supporting
