24440,cascade development of hydropower projects in a river basin can fully enhance the utilization of hydropower resources yet the impacts of cascade hydropower projects on river ecosystems and social economic systems are not well elaborated the current research proposed an emergy estimation method to evaluate the environmental sustainability of two large hydropower projects and suggest the reasonable scale of hydropower development at river basin scale unlike traditional approach that used a single hydropower project as a system the method took river reach as a system the cascade hydropower development in lower jinsha river the river reach in the upper yangtze river in china were taken as the case study to apply the method the results shown that at current level of construction and management the development of xiangjiaba and xiluodu are still sustainable but insufficient and the scale of large hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is suggested to be 29000 mw to 54000 mw then the transformity of hydroelectricity would be 9 50e 04sej j to 6 85e 04sej j the emergy sustainability indicator esi decreases with the increasing of development scale esi would be 6 5 in the case of current development plan 45200mw which means a good utilization efficiency and sustainability however the on grid electricity price was suggested to increase to 0 40 cny kw h for the reason that fair price of the electricity is higher than the on grid electricity price such evaluation results could have a greater reference for hydropower planning in river basin we believed that this approach can help policymakers and stakeholders make more reliable decisions in hydropower planning keywords emergy analysis development scale large hydropower environmental sustainability 1 introduction the increase in energy demand especially the extensive use of fossil fuels has caused considerable impacts on global change systematic solutions to mitigating and adapting to climate change are urgently needed switching to renewable and climate friendly energy is a promising approach for enhancing environmental sustainability hydropower has been regarded as an important renewable energy source that has advantages in terms of its continuous supply easy maintenance high flexibility and low cost the consumption of hydropower in 2020 reached 38 16 tw h the share of hydropower in energy has increased to 6 9 looney 2021 china brazil canada turkey and india are leading hydropower developers in the world nautiyal and goel 2020 the upper limits for classifying hydropower differ from country to country yet it is generally believed that 50 megawatts mw can be set as the standard for differentiating large hydropower projects lhps from small hydropower projects shps zhang et al 2015 besides hydropower provision most lhps at present have multiple services e g flood control water supply and navigation these services provide effective solutions for mitigating and adapting to the negative effects of global change due to china s huge energy demand and pressure to reduce carbon emissions the development of hydropower has experienced soaring growth in china where it can be broadly divided into three phases initially from 1949 to 1979 the emphasis was on strengthening rebuilding and expanding existing hydropower stations then structural reform and technological upgrades were carried out so far a great number of hydropower stations have been in service while many more are under construction by 2020 the annual hydropower electricity generation in china has reached 135 52 1e 10 kw h which accounting for 17 42 of the annual electricity generation in china national bureau of statistics https data stats gov cn index htm china is entering a new era of large scale hydropower systems composing of numerous hydropower bases niu et al 2018 cascade hydropower in river basins has become the main measures of china for the development of hydropower however there are still concerns and debates regarding the ecological and environmental consequences of lhps worldwide moran et al 2018 the development of lhps regulate river ecosystem due to water storage and the cutting off natural flow variations such influence of river continuum would cause a series of environmental problems i e deposition of sediments loss of terrestrial productivity in flooded areas aggravation of soil erosion etc tahseen and karney 2017 liu et al 2013 the ecological consequences due to environmentally unfriendly dam operation in lhps also significantly impact both upstream and downstream river reaches thus reducing the potential sustainability of lhps in the context of global change maximizing the technical and economic potential of hydropower is frequently applied for lhp planning and decision making mishra et al 2011 santolin et al 2011 nevertheless neglecting the possible eco environmental consequences may lead to adverse effects when considering sustainability hence substantial trade offs are observed between expanding hydropower generation in the basin and maintaining environmental sustainability in the planning and decision making of hydropower projects the hydroelectric potential of a project is calculated under the presumption that all the potential energy in natural flows will be used when technical and economic factors are also taken into consideration the technically viable hydroelectric potential refers to the maximum potential that can be used with existing technologies while the economically viable hydroelectric potential refers to the portion of the technically viable potential that can be realized under the existing and expected local economic conditions kankal et al 2014 in developed countries the development degree of hydropower potential has reached to a range between 60 and 95 of the theoretical installed capacity li et al 2015 however increase the degrees of hydropower development do not mean that hydropower development can remain sustainable for example although only approximately half of the potential for hydropower generation 268 000 gw h year in the mekong basin has been developed existing dams have already reduced the river s sediment load decreased the sediment supply to the mekong delta and rapidly receded the delta coastline schmitt et al 2019 thus the hydropower potential should be re evaluated based on a consideration of its potential environmental and social impacts tiago et al 2017 on the basis of thermodynamic principles emergy analysis is one of the earliest approaches to quantifying the sustainability of an ecological or an engineering system odum 1996 energy change evaluations of a system generate a boundary that includes natural flows sun wind rain deep heat tidal energy and material flows mineral ores metals cristiano and gonella 2019 which makes it possible to evaluate the sustainability of the system chen et al 2017 emergy analysis methods have been applied in the hydropower field brown and mcclanahan 1996 kang and park 2002 tassinari et al 2016 fang et al 2015 ren and feng 2021 however most of the emergy analyses of hydropower projects have merely focused on the construction and operation of hydropower stations in addition development of hydropower resources in a river basin is to fully exploit hydropower resources by cascade hydro dams sustainable lhp planning in a river basin is to be evaluated under a river basin scale rather than on single ones most of the current evaluations were focused on a single hydropower plant the evaluations may lack of strategic analysis of the cumulative dam impacts and benefits the results of such evaluations likely do not provide a reliable assessment of cascade hydropower projects in a river basin here we evaluated the sustainable development of cascade lhps in the upper yangtze river based on emery theory the two lhps i e xiangjiaba and xiluodu in our study are the currently ninth and third largest hydropower plant in the world we highlighted the application of emergy theory with an uncertainty analysis to evaluate the cascade lhps in addition we provided a method to estimate the reasonable installed capacity in the same river reach and analyze the planning of cascade lhps towards optimal and sustainable development of hydropower resources in the lower jinsha river we believe that our research will enrich the current cases of emergy analysis in the field of hydropower projects and provide valuable suggestions for policymakers and stakeholders 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description fig 1 is the geographical distribution of the cascade lhps system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river china the jinsha river is the main stem of the upper yangtze river and one of the largest hydropower bases in china the lower reach of the jinsha river extends from panzhihua city to yibin city in sichuan province and is approximately 768 km long with a drop of 719 m in recent decades four large hydropower projects have been under operation or construction i e xiangjiaba xjb xiluodu xld baihetan bht and wudongde wdd the first phase xjb and xld has been completed and been officially put into operation the xjb and xld reservoirs are typically river valley dammed a life span of 100 years was considered in the study although the primary services of both the xld and xjb projects are hydroelectricity production both reservoirs perform water level variations for flood control irrigation and navigation the construction of xld and xjb has led to accumulated engineering experience for the construction and operation of lhps in the lower jinsha river and provided data on resettlement eco environment protection and restoration under the same geomorphological and ecological background a similar engineering experience was observed during the construction of bht and wdd hydropower projects second phase 2 2 emergy evaluation of cascade hydropower projects 2 2 1 emergy evaluation a life cycle perspective recognizes that all product life cycle stages e g raw materials manufacturing and transportation generate environmental impacts that need to be evaluated in most of the studies presenting the joint use of emergy and life cycle assessment lca results the approach consisted of extending the boundaries using the lca perspective from cradle to grave rugani and benetto 2012 as a top down approach for evaluating river ecosystem health assessments emergy analysis includes several steps in general the first step is to define the system boundary then a system diagram as shown in fig 2 is proposed to elaborate the material and energy flow through different components of the hydropower ecosystem in this study it is considered that the emergy evaluate should run through the whole life cycle of hydropower station including preparation period construction period operation period the hydropower stations were assumed to have a 100 year life span emergy analysis was used in conjunction with life cycle assessment in this study the emergy of inflow outflow and ecosystem services losses were taken into account the different emergy sources were aggregated as free local renewable resource r such as river geopotential free local nonrenewable resource n such as sandstone purchased inputs f such as concrete steel wood economic cost i e emergy of ecosystem services losses les such as social disruption crop land loss sediments biodiversity loss i e and emergy output such as hydroelectricity flood control i e the emergy based indicators that were used to evaluate the performance of the lhps are listed and described in table 1 last all of the energy material and currency types were converted into emergy values following the equation shown in eq 1 1 u i f i u e v i where ui represents the emergy values of the ith input flow fi represents the ith input flow i 1 n and uevi is the unit emergy value of the ith input flow the baseline of geobiosphere emergy is defined as 12 0 1024 sej a campbell 2016 brown and ulgiati 2016 and all uev had to be converted based on the baseline in this study the basic data included the natural environment social economy and production system in the study area data for the xjb and xld projects were originally from the environmental impact assessment report of both hydropower projects provided and authorized by the china three gorges corporation environmental impact assessment report of xiluodu hydro project edited by chengdu engineering corporation limited april 2005 environmental impact assessment report of xiangjiaba hydro project edited by central southern china electric power design institute april 2006 the calculation methods and parameters are derived from published research all the emergy indicators are calculated as shown in table 1 2 2 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were performed following a hybrid method which combines a data quality indicator dqi and the monte carlo rank order correlation sensitivity analysis wang and shen 2013 in brief the hybrid data quality indicator and statistical method approach consists of three steps 1 implement the quantitative dqi with monte carlo simulations mcs 2 perform detailed probability distribution estimations for the parameters 3 generate the final mcs calculation a data quality pedigree matrix dqpm covers five descriptive indicators i e data representativeness data source time correlation technological correlation and geographical correlation these indicators are selected to obtain descriptive indicators of data quality all the individual indicators are considered with equal weight to obtain the overall quality of the data then quantitative dqi transforms the aggregated dqi scores to beta functions to enable uncertainty quantification canter et al 2002 according to the relationship between inputs and outputs the elaborately estimated parameter probability distributions are used as inputs to calculate stochastic results by the mcs algorithm 2 3 planning of installed capacity in the lower jinsha river according to emergy theory the energy sustainability indicator is calculated as follows 2 e s i e y r e l r y f l e s n f n l n e s r f r l r e s where eyr is the emergy yield ratio elr is the environmental loading ratio y is the total emergy output f is the purchased inputs les is the emergy of ecosystem services losses n is the free local nonrenewable resource fn is the nonrenewable fraction of purchases inputs ln es is the nonrenewable fraction of ecosystem services losses r is the free local renewable resource fr is the renewable fraction of purchased inputs and lr es is the renewable fraction of ecosystem services losses if the esi is lower than 1 then the project appears to be nonsustainable and if the esi is higher than 1 the project will have sustainable contributions to the economy however when the esi is higher than 10 it is generally considered an undeveloped system with high sustainability brown and ulgiati 2002 the input and output of hydropower stations are positively related to the scale of the hydropower station we can analyze based on existing cases e g xld and xjb explore the relationship between the esi and installed capacity and obtain the reasonable development scale of the cascade hydropower system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river 3 results 3 1 inventories of emergy 3 1 1 construction and operations and maintenance in china pre impoundment clearance is commonly conducted to remove obstacles and reduce potential toxic pollutants that may deteriorate water quality after flooding li et al 2017 activities associated with pre impoundment clearance include wood removal epidemic prevention and building and structure demolition emergy during the construction phase includes material production construction and installation in the operations and maintenance phase emergy refers to the input for maintenance and upgrading the emergy values from energy material consumption and labor and capital input in each activity during the construction phase are shown in table 2 in the operations and maintenance phase concrete routine maintenance and electromechanical equipment are the most important emergy inputs for these uevs the uev of concrete is 1 87e 09 sej

zhang et al 2009 3 1 2 ecosystem service loss ecosystem service loss les caused by the construction and operation of hydropower projects includes social disruption cropland loss soil erosion climate regulation loss sediment loss water evaporation water and air pollution biodiversity loss and habitat loss chen et al 2020 yang 2016 brown and mcclanahan 1996 as a result of cumulative effects many ecological processes are likely exacerbated along reservoir cascades santos et al 2018 studies have shown that multiple dams may produce a cumulative effect on hydrologic change water temperature total dissolved gas and sediment ma et al 2018 he et al 2020 kibler and tullos 2013 all the ecological processes are important ecological factors in habitat and the dam cascade planned in the upper yangtze river will have serious cumulative effects on fishes cheng et al 2015 in this paper the ecosystem service loss of fish was considered as the environmental reflect for the cumulative effects of ecological processes as the reason that representative fish is not an endangered species this paper mainly considers the cumulative ecosystem service loss of non endangered fish the emergy of non endangered biodiversity loss can be calculated as follows 3 unon endagered biodiversity loss i 1 n ari bm q δ fi uev δ f f 1 f i s 1 h 1 j 1 m 1 s 2 h i j i m i where ari represents the area of the river section n is the number of cascade hydropower project bm represents the average fish biomass q is the calorific value of fish δf is the diversity factor difference of fish h is the shannon wiener index j is the pielou evenness m is the margalef index s represents the number of fish species f1 is the diversity factor before the construction of hydropower project fi is the diversity factor after the construction of hydropower project the inventories of emergy value of les were shown in table 3 the result shown the emergy value of non endangered biodiversity loss of first phase would be 2 66e 21sej while xld or xjb is built alone the emergy value would be 1 12e 21sej xld or 8 29e 20sej xjb the emergy value of non endangered biodiversity in cascade hydropower development is much bigger than the sum of that of two single hydropower stations which means the cascade hydropower development would seriously affect fish diversity 3 1 3 emergy yield emergy yields include flood control fishery sediment regulation irrigation navigation and hydroelectricity provision table 4 sediment has both positive and negative effects on the development of hydropower station for the hydropower station itself sediment deposition not only affect its own reservoir capacity but also affect the natural transport of sediment yang 2016 for cascade reservoirs sediment deposition in upstream reservoirs could mitigate the reservoir capacity loss due to sedimentation in downstream reservoirs this phenomenon was evident after the operation of the xjb reservoir in 2014 which significantly reduced the inflow sediments in the downstream three gorges reservoir in this study not only the negative impacts of sediment deposition on the hydropower station were considered but also the positive impacts of sediment regulation on the cascade hydropower station system in consideration of cumulative effects the construction of upstream reservoir will delay the sediment deposition of the lower reservoir and impact the flood control capacity this paper divides the flood control capacity into three scenarios single development of xld single development of xjb and cascade development owing to the joint operation of cascade reservoirs the flood control yield of first phase would reach 8 39e 22 which is much larger than that of the two single hydropower stations the result shown that flood control effect of cascade dams is much greater than that of single dams 3 1 4 life cycle inventories of emergy according to the above calculation process the overall situation is summarized in table 5 and fig 3 among the emergy inputs the river geopotential and ecosystem service losses are the most important and account for more than 90 for ecosystem service losses due to the huge amount of sediment and endangered species in the upper reaches of the yangtze river emergy value of sediment and endangered biodiversity loss accounts for more than 90 of the losses of ecosystem services for the purchase inputs concrete is the most important followed by routine maintenance and upgrades 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the probability distributions resulting from the monte carlo simulation of the transformities from the xld xjb and first phase hydropower systems are shown in fig 4 other indicators such as eyr elr and esi were analyzed in the same way as transformity and the distribution is shown in table 6 the results show that uncertainty widely exists in all indicators of the emergy analysis therefore the results represented by each indicator need to be interpreted in combination with up and down fluctuations for example according to the emergy theory of esi esi 1 means sustainability but due to uncertainty its fluctuation reaches approximately 50 which means that in hydropower development esi 1 does not mean sustainability moreover in the development of water resources the sustainability of hydropower development needs to reserve a certain elastic space and the system is generally considered to be long term sustainable with an esi higher than 5 zhang et al 2016 we believe that the sustainability indicator esi should be adjusted to a level greater than 5 to represent sustainability the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 5 all projects indicated that the emergy values for the river geopotential hydroelectricity sediments and endangered biodiversity loss were among the most sensitive factors in the life cycle emergy value inventories at the same time the sensitivity of concrete and social disruption cannot be ignored as a result increasing electricity generation is the most direct measure of improving the ecological efficiency of hydropower stations in the operation of hydropower stations scouring and other measures should be adopted periodically to address the sediments and they represent effective measures of improving the efficiency of hydropower stations the impact of endangered biodiversity loss on the sustainability of hydropower stations is extremely obvious in planning and construction it is particularly important to provide living space for endangered organisms such as avoiding endangered spawning areas and the construction of fishways as concrete plays an important role in emergy analysis this research suggests that local resources such as sandstone and gravel should be used as much as possible in the construction of hydropower stations which can also reduce the impacts on the environment for social disruption the construction of hydropower stations should minimize the scale of immigrants to avoid social disruption which means that densely populated areas are not suitable for the construction of large reservoirs the emergy values in the pre impoundment were insignificant in the overall sensitivity analysis however pre impoundment clearance such as removing forests and trees is an applicable and practical measure for significantly minimizing the potential increase in greenhouse gas ghg emissions after reservoir impoundment li et al 2017 this paper holds that pre impoundment is an effective and economical method of reducing the environmental impact of hydropower station construction and is worthy of popularization worldwide 3 3 reasonable installed capacity planned in the lower jinsha river from the above results the low elr and high esi 10 under the current hydropower development scale showed that the xld and xjb cascade hydropower projects are insufficient for the development of hydropower resources in the lower reaches of the jinsha river and thus were not conducive to meeting the growing energy needs and improving the energy structure further development of hydropower projects in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is feasible however the development of a reasonable installation capacity based on emergy evaluation has not been discussed the esi estimation formula of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is shown in eq 2 where each parameter is related to the scale of hydropower development we use the installed capacity to represent the scale of development total emergy output y although lhps are generally multipurpose the main function of the power stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is to generate electricity only the power generation function is considered in this paper there is no doubt that hydroelectricity generation increases with increasing installed capacity and the relationship could be simplified to a linear relationship purchased inputs f based on the emergy analysis of two existing hydropower stations and other cases in china ren and feng 2021 yang 2016 we found that there is an obvious linear relationship between purchased inputs f and installed capacity as shown in fig 6 ecosystem services loss les according to the life cycle inventories of emergy emergy of sediment and endangered biodiversity loss can almost represent all the losses of ecosystem services for the sediment yang 2016 assumed silted volume dead storage capacity 10 of effective storage capacity for endangered biodiversity loss it is mainly because the construction of hydropower stations destroys the original habitats of endangered species which is directly related to the affected water area generally in the same river basin the larger the affected water area is the larger the reservoir capacity is according to the hydropower stations xld xjb guanyinyan jinanqiao liyuan ludila ahai longkaikou built in jinsha river basin as shown in fig 6 there is also an obvious linear relationship between installed capacity and storage capacity this study holds that there is a linear relationship between ecosystem services loss and installed capacity based on the xld xjb and the first phase that have been built y 5e 19x 4e 22 where y is the ecosystem services loss x is the installed capacity free local nonrenewable resources n we assume that the conditions of hydropower projects and their construction in the lower reaches of the jinsha river are similar the relationship between free local nonrenewable resources n and installed capacity was simplified as a linear relationship renewable fraction of purchased inputs fr according to the emergy assessment results of xld and xjb hydropower stations the fr was only approximately 1 of f the fr was ignored therefore f fn renewable fraction of ecosystem service losses lr es in this paper it was considered that les is nonrenewable therefore lr es was ignored les ln es the relevant parameters of the esi and their functional relationship with the installed capacity are as follows 4 e s i e y r e l r y f l e s n f n l n e s r f r l r e s 10 3408 e 05 x 3 849 x 2 9 932 e 03 x 6 4 e 06 where x is the installed capacity mw y 3 68e 20 x sej f 1e 19 x 4e 22 sej les 5e 19 x 4e 22 sej n 4 15e 18 x sej and r 2 81e 24 sej according to eq 4 we obtain the diagram of esi as it changes with the installed capacity as shown in fig 7 we define the reasonable range of the sustainability index esi of hydropower development in river basins as 10 to 5 therefore the reasonable scale of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is 29000 mw to 54000 mw while the transformity of hydroelectricity is 9 50e 04sej j to 6 85e 04sej j then the annual power generation ranges from 134 11 billion kw h to 249 73 billion kw h 4 discussion 4 1 emergy based indicators for hydropower power generation in this paper the emergy method was applied to evaluate hydropower sustainability at the basin scale the results can provide data beyond that of a single hydropower station and directly show the sustainability of hydropower development in the basin as presented in fig 8 other kinds of hydropower generation stations worldwide were selected for comparison to obtain better insight into the lhps in the jinsha river transformity is a crucial parameter that measures the overall efficiency of a production system from the view of emergy it is noted that the transformity 1 14e 05 0 18e 04sej j of a first phase hydropower station is obviously lower than that of either the xld 1 70e 05 0 3e 05sej j or xjb 2 85e 05 5 4e 04sej j which means that cascade hydropower stations improve the conversion efficiency of hydropower resources to electric energy obviously increasing the development scale by the cascade development mode could improve the utilization efficiency of hydropower resources as well however the power system xld and xjb was less efficient than that of other lhps whose transformities ranged from 4 52e 04 sej j to 1 20e 05 sej j ren and feng 2021 this finding was associated with the lack of full exploitation of the hydropower resources in the lower reaches of the jinsha river compared with shps whose transformity ranges from 1 18e 05 to 2 07e 05 sej j zhang et al 2016 pang et al 2015 the lhp system in the jinsha river was more efficient although the installed capacities of shps 500 mw are much smaller than those of lhps 500 mw the consumption of both construction minerals and economic resources per unit of power generation is higher due to the scale effect the eyr is frequently used to measure the ability of a production system to exploit local resources by investing resources from the economic system for hydropower development the natural resources involved are mainly the river geopotential which can be considered renewable it is generally believed that high values of eyr seem to reflect a good situation of system behavior and result from the contribution of local free resources tassinari et al 2016 a value of approximately 7 was calculated in the paper lhps in the lower reaches of the jinsha river are significantly superior to other forms of power generation which is mainly due to the superiority of the quality of hydropower resources and extensive use of local free resources sand and gravel in the construction of hydropower stations elr provides a measure of the pressure on the environment with a higher value corresponding to higher stress on the environment in this research as the number of hydropower stations increases the elr gradually rises although the pressure on the environment is still at a low level values less than 0 42 were estimated in our research which was similar to the elrs of hydropower stations in the lancang river 0 15 0 55 ren and feng 2021 and much lower than the elrs of shps 2 92 4 78 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2020 pang et al 2015 this finding may be due to the huge river geopotential of lhp the esi provides a comprehensive assessment of system sustainability as a relative measure our research has confirmed that an esi higher than 5 indicates sustainable lhp development although the esi of the power station system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river declined with increases in the development scale 22 6 or 53 4 declined to 17 1 the power system is still sustainable but insufficient brown and ulgiati 2002 from a comprehensive perspective the development of the xld and xjb hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river did not fully exploit the hydropower resources in the basin if the scale of the power system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river increases then this region might produce cheaper clean energy under the premise of sustainable development 4 2 development of hydropower and sustainable development goals the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs emphasize the importance of energy sdg 7 ensures access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all and sustainable and economical energy must be generated for socioeconomic development and quality of life wegner et al 2020 for the power generation system sdg7 includes two levels of meaning one is the sustainability of the power generation system and the other is the affordability of power from an economic point of view to achieve the above goals the cost of power generation should be economic due to the high development costs of small hydropower stations shps most shps cannot achieve independent profits and might need state subsidies zhang et al 2014 lhps perform better economically ren and feng 2021 in view of the emergy method eer is used to assess the equity of the trade the revenue of the system could be fair and equitable in terms of market price when eer 1 when the eer is assumed to be 1 we can calculate the fair on grid price of hydropower then the economics of hydropower projects could be evaluated through the difference between the fair on grid price and the actual on grid price according to the calculation formula we can obtain the relationship between the fair on grid electricity price and installed capacity of cascade power stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river as shown in eq 5 the diagram is shown in fig 9 5 f a i r p r i c e o f e l e c t r i c i t y r n l e s f h y d r o e l e c t r i c i t y u e v c n y 2 73 e 24 6 415 e 19 x 3 02 e 20 x where the x represents the installed capacity the parameters are described in section 3 3 apparently the fair on grid price decreases with the installed capacity according to the state grid electricity purchase plan the on grid electricity price of the hydropower system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is approximately 0 3218 cny kw h correspondingly the fair price of electricity for hydropower station system in the lower reach of jinsha river is 0 38 to 0 51 cny kw h as shown in fig 9 which is higher than the on grid electricity price according to the hydropower development plan the hydropower development plan in the lower reaches of the jinsha river adopt a two phase development scheme the first phase includes the xld 12600 mw and xjb 6400 mw hydropower stations and the second phase includes the wdd 10200 mw and bht 16000 mw stations which are still under construction the total installed capacity of the cascade power stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river will be 45200 mw the fair price of electricity would be 0 40 cny kw h the results shown that the planned development scale of the hydropower station system is ecologically rational however for the hydropower station system the higher fair price of electricity is not conducive to maintaining the economic sustainability of the power plant itself which is consistent with the research of a small hydropower plant in southwestern china zhang et al 2014 the research provides more quantitative evidence for increasing the on grid electricity price of electricity the on grid electricity price was suggested to increase to 0 40 cny kw h in this research in this case the development of hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river could provide support for the sdg7 4 3 the substitution effect of hydropower to thermal power in china although the proportion of renewable energy in the energy supply is increasing thermal power is still in the dominant position wang et al 2019 the coal dominated energy structure results in a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions thus green energy including hydropower must be developed to optimize the energy structure and fulfill the emission reduction commitments li et al 2018 according to the results of the emergy evaluation the reasonable scale of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is 29000 mw 54000 mw and power generation ranges from 1 34e 13 to 2 50e 13 kw h throughout the lifetime the purchased inputs f would be 4 15 1 25 1e 23sej as the two most important forms of energy in china the relationship between hydropower and thermal power was not only competitive but also complementary wang et al 2019 the eyr of coal fired power station was evaluated as 5 41 here eyr y f and the transformity was evaluated as 1 63e 05 sej j andrić et al 2015 power generation would be 2 82 0 85 1e 12 kw h in the lifetime if emergy inputs of lphs in the lower reaches of the jinsha river were used in the construction of a coal fired power station compared with the power generation of lhps power generation of coal fired station has decreased by approximately 82 which is mainly because hydropower uses many renewable river potential resources while thermal power uses nonrenewable coal the development of hydropower is a form of power generation that can efficiently replace thermal power 5 conclusions we proposed an emergy estimation method to evaluate environmental sustainability and cascade hydropower development taken the lower reaches of the jinsha river as an example the simple and easy approach based on theory elaborated the reasonable development scale of cascade hydropower in river basin uncertainty analysis was applied to increases the credibility of the emergy evaluation of large hydropower projects we concluded that the reasonable scale of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river would be 29000 mw 54000 mw the current hydropower development plan 45200mw could achieve ecologically sustainability however the current on grid electricity price is lower than the actual emergy cost of power generation it is suggested that the on grid electricity price of hydropower should be raised to 0 40 cny kw h which will

24440,cascade development of hydropower projects in a river basin can fully enhance the utilization of hydropower resources yet the impacts of cascade hydropower projects on river ecosystems and social economic systems are not well elaborated the current research proposed an emergy estimation method to evaluate the environmental sustainability of two large hydropower projects and suggest the reasonable scale of hydropower development at river basin scale unlike traditional approach that used a single hydropower project as a system the method took river reach as a system the cascade hydropower development in lower jinsha river the river reach in the upper yangtze river in china were taken as the case study to apply the method the results shown that at current level of construction and management the development of xiangjiaba and xiluodu are still sustainable but insufficient and the scale of large hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is suggested to be 29000 mw to 54000 mw then the transformity of hydroelectricity would be 9 50e 04sej j to 6 85e 04sej j the emergy sustainability indicator esi decreases with the increasing of development scale esi would be 6 5 in the case of current development plan 45200mw which means a good utilization efficiency and sustainability however the on grid electricity price was suggested to increase to 0 40 cny kw h for the reason that fair price of the electricity is higher than the on grid electricity price such evaluation results could have a greater reference for hydropower planning in river basin we believed that this approach can help policymakers and stakeholders make more reliable decisions in hydropower planning keywords emergy analysis development scale large hydropower environmental sustainability 1 introduction the increase in energy demand especially the extensive use of fossil fuels has caused considerable impacts on global change systematic solutions to mitigating and adapting to climate change are urgently needed switching to renewable and climate friendly energy is a promising approach for enhancing environmental sustainability hydropower has been regarded as an important renewable energy source that has advantages in terms of its continuous supply easy maintenance high flexibility and low cost the consumption of hydropower in 2020 reached 38 16 tw h the share of hydropower in energy has increased to 6 9 looney 2021 china brazil canada turkey and india are leading hydropower developers in the world nautiyal and goel 2020 the upper limits for classifying hydropower differ from country to country yet it is generally believed that 50 megawatts mw can be set as the standard for differentiating large hydropower projects lhps from small hydropower projects shps zhang et al 2015 besides hydropower provision most lhps at present have multiple services e g flood control water supply and navigation these services provide effective solutions for mitigating and adapting to the negative effects of global change due to china s huge energy demand and pressure to reduce carbon emissions the development of hydropower has experienced soaring growth in china where it can be broadly divided into three phases initially from 1949 to 1979 the emphasis was on strengthening rebuilding and expanding existing hydropower stations then structural reform and technological upgrades were carried out so far a great number of hydropower stations have been in service while many more are under construction by 2020 the annual hydropower electricity generation in china has reached 135 52 1e 10 kw h which accounting for 17 42 of the annual electricity generation in china national bureau of statistics https data stats gov cn index htm china is entering a new era of large scale hydropower systems composing of numerous hydropower bases niu et al 2018 cascade hydropower in river basins has become the main measures of china for the development of hydropower however there are still concerns and debates regarding the ecological and environmental consequences of lhps worldwide moran et al 2018 the development of lhps regulate river ecosystem due to water storage and the cutting off natural flow variations such influence of river continuum would cause a series of environmental problems i e deposition of sediments loss of terrestrial productivity in flooded areas aggravation of soil erosion etc tahseen and karney 2017 liu et al 2013 the ecological consequences due to environmentally unfriendly dam operation in lhps also significantly impact both upstream and downstream river reaches thus reducing the potential sustainability of lhps in the context of global change maximizing the technical and economic potential of hydropower is frequently applied for lhp planning and decision making mishra et al 2011 santolin et al 2011 nevertheless neglecting the possible eco environmental consequences may lead to adverse effects when considering sustainability hence substantial trade offs are observed between expanding hydropower generation in the basin and maintaining environmental sustainability in the planning and decision making of hydropower projects the hydroelectric potential of a project is calculated under the presumption that all the potential energy in natural flows will be used when technical and economic factors are also taken into consideration the technically viable hydroelectric potential refers to the maximum potential that can be used with existing technologies while the economically viable hydroelectric potential refers to the portion of the technically viable potential that can be realized under the existing and expected local economic conditions kankal et al 2014 in developed countries the development degree of hydropower potential has reached to a range between 60 and 95 of the theoretical installed capacity li et al 2015 however increase the degrees of hydropower development do not mean that hydropower development can remain sustainable for example although only approximately half of the potential for hydropower generation 268 000 gw h year in the mekong basin has been developed existing dams have already reduced the river s sediment load decreased the sediment supply to the mekong delta and rapidly receded the delta coastline schmitt et al 2019 thus the hydropower potential should be re evaluated based on a consideration of its potential environmental and social impacts tiago et al 2017 on the basis of thermodynamic principles emergy analysis is one of the earliest approaches to quantifying the sustainability of an ecological or an engineering system odum 1996 energy change evaluations of a system generate a boundary that includes natural flows sun wind rain deep heat tidal energy and material flows mineral ores metals cristiano and gonella 2019 which makes it possible to evaluate the sustainability of the system chen et al 2017 emergy analysis methods have been applied in the hydropower field brown and mcclanahan 1996 kang and park 2002 tassinari et al 2016 fang et al 2015 ren and feng 2021 however most of the emergy analyses of hydropower projects have merely focused on the construction and operation of hydropower stations in addition development of hydropower resources in a river basin is to fully exploit hydropower resources by cascade hydro dams sustainable lhp planning in a river basin is to be evaluated under a river basin scale rather than on single ones most of the current evaluations were focused on a single hydropower plant the evaluations may lack of strategic analysis of the cumulative dam impacts and benefits the results of such evaluations likely do not provide a reliable assessment of cascade hydropower projects in a river basin here we evaluated the sustainable development of cascade lhps in the upper yangtze river based on emery theory the two lhps i e xiangjiaba and xiluodu in our study are the currently ninth and third largest hydropower plant in the world we highlighted the application of emergy theory with an uncertainty analysis to evaluate the cascade lhps in addition we provided a method to estimate the reasonable installed capacity in the same river reach and analyze the planning of cascade lhps towards optimal and sustainable development of hydropower resources in the lower jinsha river we believe that our research will enrich the current cases of emergy analysis in the field of hydropower projects and provide valuable suggestions for policymakers and stakeholders 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description fig 1 is the geographical distribution of the cascade lhps system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river china the jinsha river is the main stem of the upper yangtze river and one of the largest hydropower bases in china the lower reach of the jinsha river extends from panzhihua city to yibin city in sichuan province and is approximately 768 km long with a drop of 719 m in recent decades four large hydropower projects have been under operation or construction i e xiangjiaba xjb xiluodu xld baihetan bht and wudongde wdd the first phase xjb and xld has been completed and been officially put into operation the xjb and xld reservoirs are typically river valley dammed a life span of 100 years was considered in the study although the primary services of both the xld and xjb projects are hydroelectricity production both reservoirs perform water level variations for flood control irrigation and navigation the construction of xld and xjb has led to accumulated engineering experience for the construction and operation of lhps in the lower jinsha river and provided data on resettlement eco environment protection and restoration under the same geomorphological and ecological background a similar engineering experience was observed during the construction of bht and wdd hydropower projects second phase 2 2 emergy evaluation of cascade hydropower projects 2 2 1 emergy evaluation a life cycle perspective recognizes that all product life cycle stages e g raw materials manufacturing and transportation generate environmental impacts that need to be evaluated in most of the studies presenting the joint use of emergy and life cycle assessment lca results the approach consisted of extending the boundaries using the lca perspective from cradle to grave rugani and benetto 2012 as a top down approach for evaluating river ecosystem health assessments emergy analysis includes several steps in general the first step is to define the system boundary then a system diagram as shown in fig 2 is proposed to elaborate the material and energy flow through different components of the hydropower ecosystem in this study it is considered that the emergy evaluate should run through the whole life cycle of hydropower station including preparation period construction period operation period the hydropower stations were assumed to have a 100 year life span emergy analysis was used in conjunction with life cycle assessment in this study the emergy of inflow outflow and ecosystem services losses were taken into account the different emergy sources were aggregated as free local renewable resource r such as river geopotential free local nonrenewable resource n such as sandstone purchased inputs f such as concrete steel wood economic cost i e emergy of ecosystem services losses les such as social disruption crop land loss sediments biodiversity loss i e and emergy output such as hydroelectricity flood control i e the emergy based indicators that were used to evaluate the performance of the lhps are listed and described in table 1 last all of the energy material and currency types were converted into emergy values following the equation shown in eq 1 1 u i f i u e v i where ui represents the emergy values of the ith input flow fi represents the ith input flow i 1 n and uevi is the unit emergy value of the ith input flow the baseline of geobiosphere emergy is defined as 12 0 1024 sej a campbell 2016 brown and ulgiati 2016 and all uev had to be converted based on the baseline in this study the basic data included the natural environment social economy and production system in the study area data for the xjb and xld projects were originally from the environmental impact assessment report of both hydropower projects provided and authorized by the china three gorges corporation environmental impact assessment report of xiluodu hydro project edited by chengdu engineering corporation limited april 2005 environmental impact assessment report of xiangjiaba hydro project edited by central southern china electric power design institute april 2006 the calculation methods and parameters are derived from published research all the emergy indicators are calculated as shown in table 1 2 2 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were performed following a hybrid method which combines a data quality indicator dqi and the monte carlo rank order correlation sensitivity analysis wang and shen 2013 in brief the hybrid data quality indicator and statistical method approach consists of three steps 1 implement the quantitative dqi with monte carlo simulations mcs 2 perform detailed probability distribution estimations for the parameters 3 generate the final mcs calculation a data quality pedigree matrix dqpm covers five descriptive indicators i e data representativeness data source time correlation technological correlation and geographical correlation these indicators are selected to obtain descriptive indicators of data quality all the individual indicators are considered with equal weight to obtain the overall quality of the data then quantitative dqi transforms the aggregated dqi scores to beta functions to enable uncertainty quantification canter et al 2002 according to the relationship between inputs and outputs the elaborately estimated parameter probability distributions are used as inputs to calculate stochastic results by the mcs algorithm 2 3 planning of installed capacity in the lower jinsha river according to emergy theory the energy sustainability indicator is calculated as follows 2 e s i e y r e l r y f l e s n f n l n e s r f r l r e s where eyr is the emergy yield ratio elr is the environmental loading ratio y is the total emergy output f is the purchased inputs les is the emergy of ecosystem services losses n is the free local nonrenewable resource fn is the nonrenewable fraction of purchases inputs ln es is the nonrenewable fraction of ecosystem services losses r is the free local renewable resource fr is the renewable fraction of purchased inputs and lr es is the renewable fraction of ecosystem services losses if the esi is lower than 1 then the project appears to be nonsustainable and if the esi is higher than 1 the project will have sustainable contributions to the economy however when the esi is higher than 10 it is generally considered an undeveloped system with high sustainability brown and ulgiati 2002 the input and output of hydropower stations are positively related to the scale of the hydropower station we can analyze based on existing cases e g xld and xjb explore the relationship between the esi and installed capacity and obtain the reasonable development scale of the cascade hydropower system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river 3 results 3 1 inventories of emergy 3 1 1 construction and operations and maintenance in china pre impoundment clearance is commonly conducted to remove obstacles and reduce potential toxic pollutants that may deteriorate water quality after flooding li et al 2017 activities associated with pre impoundment clearance include wood removal epidemic prevention and building and structure demolition emergy during the construction phase includes material production construction and installation in the operations and maintenance phase emergy refers to the input for maintenance and upgrading the emergy values from energy material consumption and labor and capital input in each activity during the construction phase are shown in table 2 in the operations and maintenance phase concrete routine maintenance and electromechanical equipment are the most important emergy inputs for these uevs the uev of concrete is 1 87e 09 sej

zhang et al 2009 3 1 2 ecosystem service loss ecosystem service loss les caused by the construction and operation of hydropower projects includes social disruption cropland loss soil erosion climate regulation loss sediment loss water evaporation water and air pollution biodiversity loss and habitat loss chen et al 2020 yang 2016 brown and mcclanahan 1996 as a result of cumulative effects many ecological processes are likely exacerbated along reservoir cascades santos et al 2018 studies have shown that multiple dams may produce a cumulative effect on hydrologic change water temperature total dissolved gas and sediment ma et al 2018 he et al 2020 kibler and tullos 2013 all the ecological processes are important ecological factors in habitat and the dam cascade planned in the upper yangtze river will have serious cumulative effects on fishes cheng et al 2015 in this paper the ecosystem service loss of fish was considered as the environmental reflect for the cumulative effects of ecological processes as the reason that representative fish is not an endangered species this paper mainly considers the cumulative ecosystem service loss of non endangered fish the emergy of non endangered biodiversity loss can be calculated as follows 3 unon endagered biodiversity loss i 1 n ari bm q δ fi uev δ f f 1 f i s 1 h 1 j 1 m 1 s 2 h i j i m i where ari represents the area of the river section n is the number of cascade hydropower project bm represents the average fish biomass q is the calorific value of fish δf is the diversity factor difference of fish h is the shannon wiener index j is the pielou evenness m is the margalef index s represents the number of fish species f1 is the diversity factor before the construction of hydropower project fi is the diversity factor after the construction of hydropower project the inventories of emergy value of les were shown in table 3 the result shown the emergy value of non endangered biodiversity loss of first phase would be 2 66e 21sej while xld or xjb is built alone the emergy value would be 1 12e 21sej xld or 8 29e 20sej xjb the emergy value of non endangered biodiversity in cascade hydropower development is much bigger than the sum of that of two single hydropower stations which means the cascade hydropower development would seriously affect fish diversity 3 1 3 emergy yield emergy yields include flood control fishery sediment regulation irrigation navigation and hydroelectricity provision table 4 sediment has both positive and negative effects on the development of hydropower station for the hydropower station itself sediment deposition not only affect its own reservoir capacity but also affect the natural transport of sediment yang 2016 for cascade reservoirs sediment deposition in upstream reservoirs could mitigate the reservoir capacity loss due to sedimentation in downstream reservoirs this phenomenon was evident after the operation of the xjb reservoir in 2014 which significantly reduced the inflow sediments in the downstream three gorges reservoir in this study not only the negative impacts of sediment deposition on the hydropower station were considered but also the positive impacts of sediment regulation on the cascade hydropower station system in consideration of cumulative effects the construction of upstream reservoir will delay the sediment deposition of the lower reservoir and impact the flood control capacity this paper divides the flood control capacity into three scenarios single development of xld single development of xjb and cascade development owing to the joint operation of cascade reservoirs the flood control yield of first phase would reach 8 39e 22 which is much larger than that of the two single hydropower stations the result shown that flood control effect of cascade dams is much greater than that of single dams 3 1 4 life cycle inventories of emergy according to the above calculation process the overall situation is summarized in table 5 and fig 3 among the emergy inputs the river geopotential and ecosystem service losses are the most important and account for more than 90 for ecosystem service losses due to the huge amount of sediment and endangered species in the upper reaches of the yangtze river emergy value of sediment and endangered biodiversity loss accounts for more than 90 of the losses of ecosystem services for the purchase inputs concrete is the most important followed by routine maintenance and upgrades 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the probability distributions resulting from the monte carlo simulation of the transformities from the xld xjb and first phase hydropower systems are shown in fig 4 other indicators such as eyr elr and esi were analyzed in the same way as transformity and the distribution is shown in table 6 the results show that uncertainty widely exists in all indicators of the emergy analysis therefore the results represented by each indicator need to be interpreted in combination with up and down fluctuations for example according to the emergy theory of esi esi 1 means sustainability but due to uncertainty its fluctuation reaches approximately 50 which means that in hydropower development esi 1 does not mean sustainability moreover in the development of water resources the sustainability of hydropower development needs to reserve a certain elastic space and the system is generally considered to be long term sustainable with an esi higher than 5 zhang et al 2016 we believe that the sustainability indicator esi should be adjusted to a level greater than 5 to represent sustainability the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 5 all projects indicated that the emergy values for the river geopotential hydroelectricity sediments and endangered biodiversity loss were among the most sensitive factors in the life cycle emergy value inventories at the same time the sensitivity of concrete and social disruption cannot be ignored as a result increasing electricity generation is the most direct measure of improving the ecological efficiency of hydropower stations in the operation of hydropower stations scouring and other measures should be adopted periodically to address the sediments and they represent effective measures of improving the efficiency of hydropower stations the impact of endangered biodiversity loss on the sustainability of hydropower stations is extremely obvious in planning and construction it is particularly important to provide living space for endangered organisms such as avoiding endangered spawning areas and the construction of fishways as concrete plays an important role in emergy analysis this research suggests that local resources such as sandstone and gravel should be used as much as possible in the construction of hydropower stations which can also reduce the impacts on the environment for social disruption the construction of hydropower stations should minimize the scale of immigrants to avoid social disruption which means that densely populated areas are not suitable for the construction of large reservoirs the emergy values in the pre impoundment were insignificant in the overall sensitivity analysis however pre impoundment clearance such as removing forests and trees is an applicable and practical measure for significantly minimizing the potential increase in greenhouse gas ghg emissions after reservoir impoundment li et al 2017 this paper holds that pre impoundment is an effective and economical method of reducing the environmental impact of hydropower station construction and is worthy of popularization worldwide 3 3 reasonable installed capacity planned in the lower jinsha river from the above results the low elr and high esi 10 under the current hydropower development scale showed that the xld and xjb cascade hydropower projects are insufficient for the development of hydropower resources in the lower reaches of the jinsha river and thus were not conducive to meeting the growing energy needs and improving the energy structure further development of hydropower projects in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is feasible however the development of a reasonable installation capacity based on emergy evaluation has not been discussed the esi estimation formula of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is shown in eq 2 where each parameter is related to the scale of hydropower development we use the installed capacity to represent the scale of development total emergy output y although lhps are generally multipurpose the main function of the power stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is to generate electricity only the power generation function is considered in this paper there is no doubt that hydroelectricity generation increases with increasing installed capacity and the relationship could be simplified to a linear relationship purchased inputs f based on the emergy analysis of two existing hydropower stations and other cases in china ren and feng 2021 yang 2016 we found that there is an obvious linear relationship between purchased inputs f and installed capacity as shown in fig 6 ecosystem services loss les according to the life cycle inventories of emergy emergy of sediment and endangered biodiversity loss can almost represent all the losses of ecosystem services for the sediment yang 2016 assumed silted volume dead storage capacity 10 of effective storage capacity for endangered biodiversity loss it is mainly because the construction of hydropower stations destroys the original habitats of endangered species which is directly related to the affected water area generally in the same river basin the larger the affected water area is the larger the reservoir capacity is according to the hydropower stations xld xjb guanyinyan jinanqiao liyuan ludila ahai longkaikou built in jinsha river basin as shown in fig 6 there is also an obvious linear relationship between installed capacity and storage capacity this study holds that there is a linear relationship between ecosystem services loss and installed capacity based on the xld xjb and the first phase that have been built y 5e 19x 4e 22 where y is the ecosystem services loss x is the installed capacity free local nonrenewable resources n we assume that the conditions of hydropower projects and their construction in the lower reaches of the jinsha river are similar the relationship between free local nonrenewable resources n and installed capacity was simplified as a linear relationship renewable fraction of purchased inputs fr according to the emergy assessment results of xld and xjb hydropower stations the fr was only approximately 1 of f the fr was ignored therefore f fn renewable fraction of ecosystem service losses lr es in this paper it was considered that les is nonrenewable therefore lr es was ignored les ln es the relevant parameters of the esi and their functional relationship with the installed capacity are as follows 4 e s i e y r e l r y f l e s n f n l n e s r f r l r e s 10 3408 e 05 x 3 849 x 2 9 932 e 03 x 6 4 e 06 where x is the installed capacity mw y 3 68e 20 x sej f 1e 19 x 4e 22 sej les 5e 19 x 4e 22 sej n 4 15e 18 x sej and r 2 81e 24 sej according to eq 4 we obtain the diagram of esi as it changes with the installed capacity as shown in fig 7 we define the reasonable range of the sustainability index esi of hydropower development in river basins as 10 to 5 therefore the reasonable scale of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is 29000 mw to 54000 mw while the transformity of hydroelectricity is 9 50e 04sej j to 6 85e 04sej j then the annual power generation ranges from 134 11 billion kw h to 249 73 billion kw h 4 discussion 4 1 emergy based indicators for hydropower power generation in this paper the emergy method was applied to evaluate hydropower sustainability at the basin scale the results can provide data beyond that of a single hydropower station and directly show the sustainability of hydropower development in the basin as presented in fig 8 other kinds of hydropower generation stations worldwide were selected for comparison to obtain better insight into the lhps in the jinsha river transformity is a crucial parameter that measures the overall efficiency of a production system from the view of emergy it is noted that the transformity 1 14e 05 0 18e 04sej j of a first phase hydropower station is obviously lower than that of either the xld 1 70e 05 0 3e 05sej j or xjb 2 85e 05 5 4e 04sej j which means that cascade hydropower stations improve the conversion efficiency of hydropower resources to electric energy obviously increasing the development scale by the cascade development mode could improve the utilization efficiency of hydropower resources as well however the power system xld and xjb was less efficient than that of other lhps whose transformities ranged from 4 52e 04 sej j to 1 20e 05 sej j ren and feng 2021 this finding was associated with the lack of full exploitation of the hydropower resources in the lower reaches of the jinsha river compared with shps whose transformity ranges from 1 18e 05 to 2 07e 05 sej j zhang et al 2016 pang et al 2015 the lhp system in the jinsha river was more efficient although the installed capacities of shps 500 mw are much smaller than those of lhps 500 mw the consumption of both construction minerals and economic resources per unit of power generation is higher due to the scale effect the eyr is frequently used to measure the ability of a production system to exploit local resources by investing resources from the economic system for hydropower development the natural resources involved are mainly the river geopotential which can be considered renewable it is generally believed that high values of eyr seem to reflect a good situation of system behavior and result from the contribution of local free resources tassinari et al 2016 a value of approximately 7 was calculated in the paper lhps in the lower reaches of the jinsha river are significantly superior to other forms of power generation which is mainly due to the superiority of the quality of hydropower resources and extensive use of local free resources sand and gravel in the construction of hydropower stations elr provides a measure of the pressure on the environment with a higher value corresponding to higher stress on the environment in this research as the number of hydropower stations increases the elr gradually rises although the pressure on the environment is still at a low level values less than 0 42 were estimated in our research which was similar to the elrs of hydropower stations in the lancang river 0 15 0 55 ren and feng 2021 and much lower than the elrs of shps 2 92 4 78 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2020 pang et al 2015 this finding may be due to the huge river geopotential of lhp the esi provides a comprehensive assessment of system sustainability as a relative measure our research has confirmed that an esi higher than 5 indicates sustainable lhp development although the esi of the power station system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river declined with increases in the development scale 22 6 or 53 4 declined to 17 1 the power system is still sustainable but insufficient brown and ulgiati 2002 from a comprehensive perspective the development of the xld and xjb hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river did not fully exploit the hydropower resources in the basin if the scale of the power system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river increases then this region might produce cheaper clean energy under the premise of sustainable development 4 2 development of hydropower and sustainable development goals the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs emphasize the importance of energy sdg 7 ensures access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all and sustainable and economical energy must be generated for socioeconomic development and quality of life wegner et al 2020 for the power generation system sdg7 includes two levels of meaning one is the sustainability of the power generation system and the other is the affordability of power from an economic point of view to achieve the above goals the cost of power generation should be economic due to the high development costs of small hydropower stations shps most shps cannot achieve independent profits and might need state subsidies zhang et al 2014 lhps perform better economically ren and feng 2021 in view of the emergy method eer is used to assess the equity of the trade the revenue of the system could be fair and equitable in terms of market price when eer 1 when the eer is assumed to be 1 we can calculate the fair on grid price of hydropower then the economics of hydropower projects could be evaluated through the difference between the fair on grid price and the actual on grid price according to the calculation formula we can obtain the relationship between the fair on grid electricity price and installed capacity of cascade power stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river as shown in eq 5 the diagram is shown in fig 9 5 f a i r p r i c e o f e l e c t r i c i t y r n l e s f h y d r o e l e c t r i c i t y u e v c n y 2 73 e 24 6 415 e 19 x 3 02 e 20 x where the x represents the installed capacity the parameters are described in section 3 3 apparently the fair on grid price decreases with the installed capacity according to the state grid electricity purchase plan the on grid electricity price of the hydropower system in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is approximately 0 3218 cny kw h correspondingly the fair price of electricity for hydropower station system in the lower reach of jinsha river is 0 38 to 0 51 cny kw h as shown in fig 9 which is higher than the on grid electricity price according to the hydropower development plan the hydropower development plan in the lower reaches of the jinsha river adopt a two phase development scheme the first phase includes the xld 12600 mw and xjb 6400 mw hydropower stations and the second phase includes the wdd 10200 mw and bht 16000 mw stations which are still under construction the total installed capacity of the cascade power stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river will be 45200 mw the fair price of electricity would be 0 40 cny kw h the results shown that the planned development scale of the hydropower station system is ecologically rational however for the hydropower station system the higher fair price of electricity is not conducive to maintaining the economic sustainability of the power plant itself which is consistent with the research of a small hydropower plant in southwestern china zhang et al 2014 the research provides more quantitative evidence for increasing the on grid electricity price of electricity the on grid electricity price was suggested to increase to 0 40 cny kw h in this research in this case the development of hydropower stations in the lower reaches of the jinsha river could provide support for the sdg7 4 3 the substitution effect of hydropower to thermal power in china although the proportion of renewable energy in the energy supply is increasing thermal power is still in the dominant position wang et al 2019 the coal dominated energy structure results in a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions thus green energy including hydropower must be developed to optimize the energy structure and fulfill the emission reduction commitments li et al 2018 according to the results of the emergy evaluation the reasonable scale of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river is 29000 mw 54000 mw and power generation ranges from 1 34e 13 to 2 50e 13 kw h throughout the lifetime the purchased inputs f would be 4 15 1 25 1e 23sej as the two most important forms of energy in china the relationship between hydropower and thermal power was not only competitive but also complementary wang et al 2019 the eyr of coal fired power station was evaluated as 5 41 here eyr y f and the transformity was evaluated as 1 63e 05 sej j andrić et al 2015 power generation would be 2 82 0 85 1e 12 kw h in the lifetime if emergy inputs of lphs in the lower reaches of the jinsha river were used in the construction of a coal fired power station compared with the power generation of lhps power generation of coal fired station has decreased by approximately 82 which is mainly because hydropower uses many renewable river potential resources while thermal power uses nonrenewable coal the development of hydropower is a form of power generation that can efficiently replace thermal power 5 conclusions we proposed an emergy estimation method to evaluate environmental sustainability and cascade hydropower development taken the lower reaches of the jinsha river as an example the simple and easy approach based on theory elaborated the reasonable development scale of cascade hydropower in river basin uncertainty analysis was applied to increases the credibility of the emergy evaluation of large hydropower projects we concluded that the reasonable scale of hydropower development in the lower reaches of the jinsha river would be 29000 mw 54000 mw the current hydropower development plan 45200mw could achieve ecologically sustainability however the current on grid electricity price is lower than the actual emergy cost of power generation it is suggested that the on grid electricity price of hydropower should be raised to 0 40 cny kw h which will contribute to the sustainable development of hydropower stations although this research proposed an estimation method and preliminary carried on the application to evaluate the reasonable development scale of hydropower based on emergy such method did not study further on the cumulative effects of cascade hydropower station further development and applications are needed credit authorship

24441,co occurence of related congeners is one of the most complicated ecological phenomena although such species are characterised by niche conservatism which should exclude their stable co existence a communities often consist of sister species thus there must be some ecological mechanism that separates them spatially or temporally this study advocates that the answer is niche divergence that results from interspecific competition despite numerous studies documenting this biotic interaction as an important ecological process that segregates species spatially only few deal with niche divergence between allotopy and syntopy in a mosaic of a large sympatric zone that is why i decided to analyse the co existence of two sister species the whinchat saxicola rubetra and the stonechat saxicola rubicola in a sympatric zone where both species occur alongside in syntopic sites and separately in allotopic sites besides i analyse the whinchat s potential niche divergence between sympatric and allopatric zones which can be designated on the territory of poland it is assumed that niche divergence resulting from interspecific competition can be observed on the basis of differences in habitat preferences of one or both species between syntopy and allotopy and also for the whinchat between the sympatric and the allopatric zone the assumptions were tested in generalised mixed effect modelling and contrast analyses based on a large dataset of bird density in poland both species demonstrated shifted environmental preferences between syntopy and allotopy while in allopatry both species had similar niche preferences the whinchat also indicated no differences between allopatry and allotopy thus the adopted analytical system clearly proves that the co existence of congeneric species is possible due to niche divergence which most likely results from interspecific competition keywords co existence niche divergence ecological niche habitat preference interspecific competition 1 introduction one of the most important dogmas in ecology is that two congeneric species that are characterised by niche conservatism cannot co exist stably hadly et al 2009 lee yaw and irwin 2015 wiens et al 2010 violle et al 2011 however biological communities also include related species storch et al 2007 pigot et al 2016 so there must be some ecological processes which enable their spatial or temporal separation and maintaining species diversity in the long term despite numerous studies mechanisms that ensure such separation have not been fully understood according to the niche theory macarthur and levins 1967 hadly et al 2009 when congeneric species explore niches in a very similar way they compete with each other for space which either leads to a local extinction of one of the species or segregation of the sister species niches thus reducing the level of competition macarthur and levins 1967 nevertheless the latter phenomenon known as niche divergence does not have to be a consequence of competition for many related species especially vertebrates niche segregation can be caused by independent adaptations to environmental conditions in the past on both sides of the barrier e g a glacier once the barrier collapses and the species reach a secondary contact zone they can co exist stably because their niches do not at least partially overlap due to evolutionary changes which took place independently on both sides of the barrier e g dufour et al 2015 hanane 2015 wereszczuk and zalewski 2015 these concepts have been subject to numerous empirical analyses based on comparisons of niche preferences of closely related species in sympatric and allopatric zones benítez lópez et al 2014 peers et al 2013 wiens et al 2010 as expected similar niche preferences usually stem from the species common ancestry whereas in the secondary contact zone there is a shift in niche preferences as a result of competition processes benítez lópez et al 2014 peers et al 2013 wiens et al 2010 mayfield and levine 2010 however it should be noted that in the secondary contact zone i e the sympatric one congeneric species most often show a mosaic distribution rather than a continuous one losin et al 2016 for this reason i decided to analyse differences of niche preferences for sister species not between sympatric and allopatric zones but between syntopic places habitats occupied by both species and allotopic sites places occupied by only one species from the pair within a sympatric zone nomenclature after eichler 1966 see appendix a fig s1 such an approach is highly justified because on a large area of the sympatric zone studies on the co existence of congeneric species have not been frequently conducted but see laiolo 2012 et al 2017 reif et al 2018 however mosaic distribution of related non hybridising congeners may result from interspecific competition in the past thus by analysing differences of habitat preferences for both species between allotopy and syntopy it was possible to assess habitat resources that have been subject to competition wogan and richmond 2015 this study addresses the issue and analyses differences of habitats preferences between allotopy and syntopy within sympatric zone of the co occurring related congeners the whinchat saxicola rubetra and the european stonechat saxicola rubicola moreover the whinchat whose allopatric zone can be determined in poland is analysed with regard to differences between the allopatric and the sympatric zones the species diverged approximately 8 09 mya illera et al 2008 and currently co exist in western europe i e france western germany and northern spain as well as in southern europe from northern greece to central poland fig 1 additionally the ranges of both species overlap in asia namely east of the urals fig 1 from the morphological point of view the species are different and distinctive in body size coloration wing formula as well as songs svensson 1992 also there is no hybridisation between them which means that their post zygotic isolation is complete both species in the sympatric zone fig 1 are distributed in allotopic places where only one species occurs breeds but also in syntopic sites where both species occur breed during the breeding season the whinchat is a species of open areas especially wet meadows pastures peat bogs located both in lowlands and highlands hagemeier and blair 1997 müller et al 2005 kosicki 2018 it should be emphasised that this species is particularly sensitive to any modernisation of agriculture including mechanisation and excessive use of pesticides hulme and cresswell 2012 henderson et al 2014 in poland the range of the species partially overlaps with its sibling stonechat and both may occur in the same habitats fuller and glue 1977 kosicki 2020 however as small spatial scale studies emerge the stonechat has been observed to prefer drier open spaces while the whinchat likes moors hagemeier and blair 1997 according to previous studies it can be presumed that interspecific competition occurs between the two species regardless of their prefered habitat and morphological separation first of all both species have opposite population trends unlike the stonechat the whinchat is a species whose number has decreased sanderson et al 2006 ockendon et al 2012 which is usually explained by changes in habitats and climates from which the stonechat benefits henderson et al 2014 vickery et al 2014 i suspect that due to the loss of optimal breeding habitats the whinchat is outcompeted by the larger and competitively dominant stonechat this speculation is supported by behavioural observations in which the stonechat shows strong aggression towards the whinchat phillips 1970 however in order to test this assumption it is necessary to compare habitat preference between allotopic and syntopic sites in the sympatric zone which has not been done so far thus both species may be considered suitable for studying mechanisms of competition related shifts of niche preferences of congeneric species in this approach a niche preference is considered to be a relationship between the density of the population and the value of a given environmental variable an assumption which corresponds to previous studies e g reidy et al 2017 rodenhouse et al 1997 whittingham et al 2005 in order to meet the aims of this study i developed statistical models of habitat preferences for both species in which potentially different preferences driven by competition were taken into account in syntopy and allotopy within the sympatry zone in addition for the whinchat the differences between the sympatry and allopatry zones were analysed because unlike for the stonechat it is possible to identify an allopatric zone in poland following this modelling framework four hypothesis were formulated i due to interspecific competition in the sympatric zone habitat segregations occur and as a result there are allotopic and syntopic sites where different habitat preferences between the species can be observed a shift in habitat preferences from allotopy to syntopy is expected from at least one of the species ii for the whinchat if competition drives the segregation of niches of congeneric species differences in habitat preferences between syntopic places and allopatric zones should be noted and no differences in preferred habitats between allotopy and allopatry iii niche conservatism of congeneric species should result in no differences in habitat preferences between species in allotopic sites within a sympatric zone thus the aim of this study is to show that a shift in habitat preferences in the secondary contact zone is observed not only for closely related species reif et al 2018 but also other congeneric species 2 material and methods 2 1 bird data and species density estimation data for estimating the density of birds were collected under the common breeding birds monitoring scheme cbbms chylarecki and jawińska 2007 the cbbms is focused on monitoring population changes of widespread breeding bird species throughout poland field study methodology is consistent with the british breeding bird survey and a detailed survey design described by gregory et al 1996 and gregory and baillie 1998 following the random approach survey plots of 1 km2 area were selected out of 312 000 km2 area of poland fig 2 in the period of 2005 2016 field work conducted by skilled volunteer ornithologists was carried out on 1050 survey plots in each breeding season each survey plot was controlled twice the first visit took place between 10 april and 15 may and the second at least 4 weeks later i e between 16 may and 30 june each visit usually started between 6 a m and 10 a m on each survey plot volunteer ornithologists walked along two parallel 1 kilometre long transects spaced approximately 500 m apart in the north south or east west axis noting birds perpendicularly to the transect line and recording them in three distance categories 25 m 25 100 m 100 m during the eleven year period each grid cell was controlled on average sd in 6 9 3 5 breeding seasons in the analysis i used only plots occupied by at least one of the studied species and the maximum number of individuals observed on the study plot during the eleven year period due to the fact that birds were counted in transects in three distance categories the hayne estimator of species density was used hayne 1949 krebs 1999 d h n 2 l 1 n 1 r i where h hayne s estimator of density n number of animals seen l length of transect ri sighting distance to each animal i this estimation was carried out for each network cell and for each of the studied species 2 2 predictors and data processing on the basis of a previous study on habitat preferences of the whinchat and the stonechat in poland kosicki 2018 kosicki 2020 i chose predictor groups with the highest predictive power for modelling population density of these species four kinds of environmental predictors were used 1 bioclimatic variables 2 land cover types 3 topography and 4 artificial light at night all data were referred to 1 km² survey plots and re projected to the coordinate system epsg4284 projection http spatialreference org ref epsg 4284 climate data were obtained from the worldclim database www worldclim org which is a set of global climate layers with spatial resolution of 1 km2 hijmans et al 2005 i considered six climatic variables for each grid cell the annual mean temperature amt mean temperature of the warmest quarter mtwaq mean temperature of the coldest quarter mtcq annual precipitation ap precipitation of the warmest quarter pwaq and precipitation of the coldest quarter pcq in order to avoid intercorrelation of the variables and to simplify interpretations of bioclimatic variables i used the principal components analysis with the varimax normalised rotation appendix a table s1 the procedure revealed two new axes the first axis prec had the highest loadings with precipitation variables while the second temp with temperature variables land cover types were derived from the corine land cover database which is based on remote sensing with basic spatial units of 100 m x 100 m on average in each study plot nine types of habitats were recognised the most frequent environments were classified as non irrigated arable land followed by fruit tree and berry plantations pastures coniferous deciduous and mixed forest as well as mixed cultivation patterns a sum of the area of complex cultivation patterns and land principally occupied by agriculture scrub a sum of moors and heathland and transitional woodland shrub inland wetlands a sum of inland marshes and peat bogs water courses and water bodies on the basis of these data i calculated for each habitat patch 1 the buffer zone expressed as an area within 100 m from the outside edge of the patch and 2 the core being a patch excluding the 100 metre buffer zone from the patch s edge both indices are expressed as a percentage of the area in each grid cell 1 1 km topography data were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model rabus et al 2003 in the analysis i considered four variables 1 elevation expressed as mean altitude in the study plots 2 aspect where 0 means that the slope faces the north 90 the east 180 the south and 270 the west 3 roughness being the largest intercell difference of a central pixel and its surrounding cell wilson et al 2007 and 4 slope with the average slope in the square expressed in the data on the level of artificial light at night alan coming from meteorological satellites with the operation linescan system osl were obtained from svs gsfc nasa gov database the data including luminescence intensity of artificial light on the night map in the range from 0 no lighting to 63 maximum value of artificial lux is expressed in the digital number values of visible band data units dnv 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 the boundary between sympatric and allopatric zones study plots in which both species were recorded were considered as sympatric squares while plots with only one species were labelled as allopatric squares however such an approach does not mean that boundaries between allopatric and sympatric zones on a large geographical scale can be determined nor that allotopic and syntopic sites can be defined within the sympatric zone therefore i consider regional co occurrence for each study plot for this purpose for each study plot a circle of a 10 km radius was drawn with the centre in the centre of each square when one circle had one or more squares with two species this circle was considered as a sympatric area if the circles overlapped and the squares within the circles contained both species the whole area was also treated as sympatric and vice versa if there was a square with one species in the circle or if there was one and the same species in the overlapping circles in all squares it was treated as allopatric the 10 km radius was not determined arbitrarily this distance corresponds to the maximum 10 dispersion distance of both species bastian 1992 cramp 1988 in other words a circle of 10 km is potentially the maximum area of the dispersion of the species such an assumption is also justified in the case of our data see appendix fig s1 drawing the border between sympatric and allopatric areas or the determination of sympatric and allopatric zones in poland is possible owing to generalised additive models gam these models are excellent for detecting non linear relationships and can also be used as classifiers in establishing decision boundaries hastie et al 2009 as a response variable in the model i used co occurrence of species within the 10 km radius i e 0 if both species were found within this radius or 1 otherwise geographical coordinates were used as predictors of the centre of all study plots in this way boundaries were embedded in the cartesian coordinate system the gam was defined as bernoulli distribution with the log link function the analysis was performed in the mgcv package for r wood 2017 such a procedure ensured that all study plots 1 km squares were classified into two groups sympatric or allopatric zones based only on their geographic coordinates in the next step both species were recorded in sympatric zone squares which were considered as syntopic or allotopic squares if only one species was recorded there on the basis of this classification i found a sympatric zone which was relatively stable over the years the conversion allotopic sites to syntopic or vice versa in the following years were on average1 8 1 3 grid cells 2 3 2 mixed effect modelling approach it was assumed that any divergence in the preferences of niches amongst closely related species was due to the presence of a competitor in the study plot these divergences can be described by the analysis of different habitat preferences of each species in relation to their co occurrence status this status was defined by 1 allopatry where only one species occurs in the region outside the sympatric zone 2 allotopy where only one species occurs in the study plot within the sympatric zone and 3 syntopy where both species occur in the square within the sympatric zone next habitat preferences were considered as a slope between environmental variables and population density assuming that the density increased in more optimal environmental conditions statistical differences between particular slopes of different co occurrence statuses can be interpreted as the effect of competition these modelling conditions were employed in the glmm the hayne estimator of species density was modelled as a response variable by using the poisson distribution and log link function in the glmm framework for species density i calculated slopes for nine predictors in three co occurrence statuses thus enabling in the next step comparisons of habitat preferences of species in relation to different levels of their co occurrence status two stochastic processes were also included in the analysis model firstly each study plot was likely to have unquantifiable characteristics that could not be detected by remote sensing data to control this effect i included a research plot identifier as a random intercept in the model secondly field studies were conducted over a period of 15 years but not all squares were inspected every year thus i added the number of years when the squares had been controlled as weight in the model in order to verify whether full models of both species all predictors could be simplified the akaike information criterion burnham and anderson 2002 was employed it generated all possible combinations of candidate models by adding or removing predictors but keeping the random structure two random factors the model with the lowest aic value and thus the highest akaike weight was considered to be the most parsimonious and the best model the probability of including a predictor in the best model was calculated as the relative importance ri by summing the akaike weights of all candidate models in which this predictor was included burnham and anderson 2002 differences between slopes relationships between the given predictor and density were assessed by a contrast analysis implemented in the emmeans library for r this analysis assumes that a predictor in a model has a different trend depending on its co occurrence status in this procedure i calculated differences contrasts between the slopes of interest and then z statistics with estimating p value to check if the given contrast equalled zero or not 2 3 3 variants of contrast analysis 1 differences in habitat preferences of the two species in syntopy vs allotopy whin alot vs whin synt and or ston alot vs ston synt i assumed that the contrast should reflect a shift in habitat preferences between the species in the study plots sympatric zone occupied by one species allotopy and the study plots with both species syntopy if p value for t statistics in a contrast analysis is 0 05 it means that this element of the environment is not subject to competition between the species in other words there is no shift in environmental preferences due to the presence of closely related species 2 differences in habitat preferences of the whinchat in allopatry vs allotopy whin alop vs whin alot in poland there are no allopatric zones of the stonechat therefore i assumed that there was a shift in a habitat preferences between the study plots in the allopatric zone which is a region with no potential competition of a closely related competitor and b allotopy i e a region with potential competition which in fact does not occur due to spatial separation of both species if the contrast in not statistically significant i e different from zero it means that there is no shift in environmental preferences and spatial avoidance does not result from the occurrence of closely related species 3 differences in habitat preferences between the two species in allotopy whin alot vs ston alot this contrast reflects environmental preferences of the species in the regional absence of a closely related competitor species if t statistic for the contrast analysis is not statistically different from zero it means that the species do not differ in their preferences 4 differences in habitat preferences of the two species in syntopy whin synt vs ston synt this contrast shows environmental preferences of the species in the regional presence of a closely related competitor species if t statistic for the contrast analysis is not statistically different from zero it means that the given habitat is not subject to competition 5 differences in habitat preferences of the whinchat in allopatry vs syntopy whin alop vs whin synt i assumed a shift in habitat preferences between the study plots in the allopatric zone which is a region with no potential competition from closely related competitors as well as in syntopy where competition occurs if the contrast is not statistically significant different form zero it means that there is no shift in environmental preferences and the given environmental component is not a factor which separates competitors spatially 2 3 4 large scale habitat gradients effect differences in habitat preferences between the two species in the sympatric zone and preferences of the whinchat between allopary and sympatry zones can be masked by large scale environmental gradients case and taper 2000 goldberg and lande 2006 reif et al 2018 according to previous research on this phenomenon differences in habitat preferences along the habitat gradient can be detected if this gradient is perpendicular to the species distribution range and if it so long that it covers both sympatry and allopatry zones reif et al 2018 furthermore the gradient should be linear i e change linearly across the species ranges any other spatial variation non linear cubic square etc cannot be considered as a gradient reif et al 2018 to check whether any of the predictors used in the models depends on a large scale gradient i used an approach similar to reif et al 2018 in the first step i used glm with settings of the bernoulli distribution for the response and logit link function where binary variables were used as the response sympatric sites 1 and allopatric sites 0 and the longitude and latitude of central grid cells as independent variables thus i developed a linear geographical gradient perpendicular to the border between the species next i calculated residuals between this generated line and each grid cell s centre so the squares on both sides of the line had an opposite character or to test whether the ten independent variables used in the modelling procedure depended on the environmental gradient i calculated a linear regression between the gradient and the value of the given environmental variable if the beta coefficient is significantly different from 0 which was checked with the t test i assume that this environmental variation is gradient dependant and this relationship must be used in the glmm construction in all cases beta did not differ from 0 appendix which did not require taking into account the gradient in the analysis in addition i made maps of all predictors to check visually whether the gradient problem may masque any conclusions resulting from the glmm 3 results 3 1 sympatric and allopatric zones on the basis of generalised additive models appendix s2 it was established sympatric and allopatric regions for the whinchat a sympatric region for the stonechat and syntopic and allotopic sites within the sympatry for the two species the whinchat s allopatric region covered 67 620 km2 in the north east part of poland fig 2 within the sympatric zone allotopic sites of the stonechat were more often located along the east west axis in the central and southern parts of poland while allotopic sites of the stonechat were distributed throughout the whole sympatry syntopic sites within sympatric regions increased from the north to the south of poland fig 2 3 2 models selection out of all the analysed models all gained support using information theoretic criteria showing aic weights 0 0001 appendix table s3 and in all cases a full model was the most parsimonious that is why the final interpretation was based on this kind of model 3 3 a shift of habitat preferences for the whinchat in the sympatric zone during the research on the whinchat population i discovered that relationships between temperature and the species density switched from non significant in allotopy slope se for this relationship was 0 032 0 023 z 1 38 p 0 165 fig 3 to positively significant in

this study i analysed the niche divergence mechanism that allows co existence of related congeners although our analysis showed that there were no allopatric zones for the stonechat in poland differences emerged in habitat preferences in the secondary contact zone sympatric zone of the whinchat and the stonechat as expected the two species are separated habitably in this zone so this factor is likely to ensure their stable co existence therefore apart from allotopic sites no differences in habitat preferences between species syntopic sites were also formed where both species showed not only clear differences in habitat preferences but also opposite associations to certain environmental components what is more the whinchat whose allopatric zone can be defined in poland demonstrated differences in habitat preferences between allopatry and syntopy but no differences between the allopatric and allotopic sites on the basis of a study on closely related species reif et al 2018 i assumed that these differences in habitat preferences between syntopy and allotopy were also the result of interspecific competition so far interspecific competition has not been considered as a biotic interaction that shapes ranges of species and their habitat use primarily competition predation and parasitism have been suggested to shape a community only on the local and mesoscales whereas on broad spatial scales like in our research species co existence is regulated according to climate and geographic gradients ricklefs 2010 keil et al 2012 royan et al 2016 kosicki et al 2017 d andrea and ostling 2016 the assumption was empirically tested and confirmed for example in communities of river birds in the uk and island bird species royan et al 2016 ricklefs et al 2016 therefore this study extends the pattern and contributes to a debate on a notion that interspecific competition does not have to be considered exclusively in theory d andrea and ostling 2016 indeed empirical evidence can be provided showing that competition shapes range patterns legault et al 2020 and influences spatial segregation of not only two closely related species reif et al 2018 but also other congeneric species as demonstrated by my analyses based on comprehensive data from the area of poland despite morphological differences between the species especially the wing length only one study showed that the larger of the two species had better competitive abilities phillips 1970 however this phenomenon was not confirmed in this study in the case of these two species it is also possible that competitive abilities may be influenced by migration strategies and adaptations to environmental changes the whinchat is a sub saharan migrant while the stonechat is less of a migrator besides the stonechat feels better in dry habitats which tend to be increasingly present in poland whereas the whinchat definitely avoids them so interactions between the habitat and the migration strategy may be favoured by the short distance or sometimes resident migrant stonechat thanks to its ability to adapt to current habitat conditions such an adaptive scheme may favour the competitive ability of the stonechat however it is highly probable that this kind of interspecific competition concerns only closely related congeneric species that cannot be treated as a general pattern of competition in a community the speculation is confirmed by royan et al 2016 or ricklefs et al 2016 who found no such effect this is exactly due to the fact that in both cases was consider communities of species which are not related to each other on the other hand an analogical relationship to this study was found in reifa s et al 2018 study on two sister species of nightingales in this case it was discovered that two hybridising luscinia megarhynchos and l luscinia differed in habitat use between allotopy and syntopy which was due to competition between tchem and this is the main mechanism that accelerates completion of the speciation process sottas et al 2018 this fact strengthens a supposition that competition between sister species brings about a separation of the realised niches and this pattern is characteristic of the co existence of related congeners hence these results provide evidence that the co existence of related congeners is possible through evolving phenotypic plasticity with respect to habitat preferences in the sympatric zone in other words along with habitat use climatic gradients and parasites competition between species should be considered as a biotic interaction responsible for shaping spatial patterns of the species ranges in abundance so they can maintain a stably functioning community gaston 2003 regardless of whether niche divergence is a consequence of competition or other mechanisms that have not been described so far this research has proven beyond doubt that the sympatric zone should not be treated as a coherent area of an even distribution of two species the sympatric zone is a rather heterogeneous region interspersed with sites of co occurrence syntopy and sites where there is only one species allotopy the models show that there is a strong shift in habitat preferences of both species in the two sites i suspect that the sympatric zone developed as a secondary site due to changes in the boundary of the range as well as competition in the allotopic zone this study provides direct evidence for this conclusion because there is no difference between allotopia and allopatry for the whinchat and no significant divergence in habitat use between both species in allotopy whereas a shift of habitat preferences is observed only in syntopy obviously it is possible that syntopia was formed by other mechanisms such as relationships between density and distance from the edge of the range brown et al al 1995 but our study does not confirm this assumption if syntopy is an adaptation shaped by competition some cost of breeding in sub optimal habitats should have been observed i have no such data but i do speculate that the cost of the sub optimal habitat is balanced by interspecific competition in allotopic sites which is caused by high densities a fact partly confirmed by our results showing a difference in densities between allotopy and syntopy it should be also noted that the lack of sufficient evidence that competition plays a key role in shaping a stable co existence of closely related species in spatially broad domains may result from methodological limitations mainly insufficient data resolution for wide spatial scales d andrea and ostling 2016 nevertheless in my studies this effect does not occur because i use high resolution data on birds and habitats that come from an area of 388 000 km2 and environmental gradients have been controlled in the models in conclusion it was demonstrated that co existence of related congeneric birds is possible as a result of a shift habitat preferences in their secondary contact zone pigot and tobias 2013 this conclusion is based on the adopted analytical approach in which the range was divided into allopatric the whinchat and sympatric zones the whinchat and the stonechat and then into allotopic and syntopic sites in this way it was possible to assess the degree of niche segregation resulting from interspecific competition this discovery has serious implications for research on species habitat preferences on large spatial scales including species distribution modelling because it shows that habitat preference is a function of species range and occurrence of sister species large scale predictive models are effective tools for conservation strategies louthan et al 2015 including modelling of invasion species fourcade 2021 and they require biotic interactions as an additional predictor or co variate in order to limit the unexplained variance of models whose utmost goal is to provide comprehensive knowledge for the field of biodiversity conservation credit

24441,co occurence of related congeners is one of the most complicated ecological phenomena although such species are characterised by niche conservatism which should exclude their stable co existence a communities often consist of sister species thus there must be some ecological mechanism that separates them spatially or temporally this study advocates that the answer is niche divergence that results from interspecific competition despite numerous studies documenting this biotic interaction as an important ecological process that segregates species spatially only few deal with niche divergence between allotopy and syntopy in a mosaic of a large sympatric zone that is why i decided to analyse the co existence of two sister species the whinchat saxicola rubetra and the stonechat saxicola rubicola in a sympatric zone where both species occur alongside in syntopic sites and separately in allotopic sites besides i analyse the whinchat s potential niche divergence between sympatric and allopatric zones which can be designated on the territory of poland it is assumed that niche divergence resulting from interspecific competition can be observed on the basis of differences in habitat preferences of one or both species between syntopy and allotopy and also for the whinchat between the sympatric and the allopatric zone the assumptions were tested in generalised mixed effect modelling and contrast analyses based on a large dataset of bird density in poland both species demonstrated shifted environmental preferences between syntopy and allotopy while in allopatry both species had similar niche preferences the whinchat also indicated no differences between allopatry and allotopy thus the adopted analytical system clearly proves that the co existence of congeneric species is possible due to niche divergence which most likely results from interspecific competition keywords co existence niche divergence ecological niche habitat preference interspecific competition 1 introduction one of the most important dogmas in ecology is that two congeneric species that are characterised by niche conservatism cannot co exist stably hadly et al 2009 lee yaw and irwin 2015 wiens et al 2010 violle et al 2011 however biological communities also include related species storch et al 2007 pigot et al 2016 so there must be some ecological processes which enable their spatial or temporal separation and maintaining species diversity in the long term despite numerous studies mechanisms that ensure such separation have not been fully understood according to the niche theory macarthur and levins 1967 hadly et al 2009 when congeneric species explore niches in a very similar way they compete with each other for space which either leads to a local extinction of one of the species or segregation of the sister species niches thus reducing the level of competition macarthur and levins 1967 nevertheless the latter phenomenon known as niche divergence does not have to be a consequence of competition for many related species especially vertebrates niche segregation can be caused by independent adaptations to environmental conditions in the past on both sides of the barrier e g a glacier once the barrier collapses and the species reach a secondary contact zone they can co exist stably because their niches do not at least partially overlap due to evolutionary changes which took place independently on both sides of the barrier e g dufour et al 2015 hanane 2015 wereszczuk and zalewski 2015 these concepts have been subject to numerous empirical analyses based on comparisons of niche preferences of closely related species in sympatric and allopatric zones benítez lópez et al 2014 peers et al 2013 wiens et al 2010 as expected similar niche preferences usually stem from the species common ancestry whereas in the secondary contact zone there is a shift in niche preferences as a result of competition processes benítez lópez et al 2014 peers et al 2013 wiens et al 2010 mayfield and levine 2010 however it should be noted that in the secondary contact zone i e the sympatric one congeneric species most often show a mosaic distribution rather than a continuous one losin et al 2016 for this reason i decided to analyse differences of niche preferences for sister species not between sympatric and allopatric zones but between syntopic places habitats occupied by both species and allotopic sites places occupied by only one species from the pair within a sympatric zone nomenclature after eichler 1966 see appendix a fig s1 such an approach is highly justified because on a large area of the sympatric zone studies on the co existence of congeneric species have not been frequently conducted but see laiolo 2012 et al 2017 reif et al 2018 however mosaic distribution of related non hybridising congeners may result from interspecific competition in the past thus by analysing differences of habitat preferences for both species between allotopy and syntopy it was possible to assess habitat resources that have been subject to competition wogan and richmond 2015 this study addresses the issue and analyses differences of habitats preferences between allotopy and syntopy within sympatric zone of the co occurring related congeners the whinchat saxicola rubetra and the european stonechat saxicola rubicola moreover the whinchat whose allopatric zone can be determined in poland is analysed with regard to differences between the allopatric and the sympatric zones the species diverged approximately 8 09 mya illera et al 2008 and currently co exist in western europe i e france western germany and northern spain as well as in southern europe from northern greece to central poland fig 1 additionally the ranges of both species overlap in asia namely east of the urals fig 1 from the morphological point of view the species are different and distinctive in body size coloration wing formula as well as songs svensson 1992 also there is no hybridisation between them which means that their post zygotic isolation is complete both species in the sympatric zone fig 1 are distributed in allotopic places where only one species occurs breeds but also in syntopic sites where both species occur breed during the breeding season the whinchat is a species of open areas especially wet meadows pastures peat bogs located both in lowlands and highlands hagemeier and blair 1997 müller et al 2005 kosicki 2018 it should be emphasised that this species is particularly sensitive to any modernisation of agriculture including mechanisation and excessive use of pesticides hulme and cresswell 2012 henderson et al 2014 in poland the range of the species partially overlaps with its sibling stonechat and both may occur in the same habitats fuller and glue 1977 kosicki 2020 however as small spatial scale studies emerge the stonechat has been observed to prefer drier open spaces while the whinchat likes moors hagemeier and blair 1997 according to previous studies it can be presumed that interspecific competition occurs between the two species regardless of their prefered habitat and morphological separation first of all both species have opposite population trends unlike the stonechat the whinchat is a species whose number has decreased sanderson et al 2006 ockendon et al 2012 which is usually explained by changes in habitats and climates from which the stonechat benefits henderson et al 2014 vickery et al 2014 i suspect that due to the loss of optimal breeding habitats the whinchat is outcompeted by the larger and competitively dominant stonechat this speculation is supported by behavioural observations in which the stonechat shows strong aggression towards the whinchat phillips 1970 however in order to test this assumption it is necessary to compare habitat preference between allotopic and syntopic sites in the sympatric zone which has not been done so far thus both species may be considered suitable for studying mechanisms of competition related shifts of niche preferences of congeneric species in this approach a niche preference is considered to be a relationship between the density of the population and the value of a given environmental variable an assumption which corresponds to previous studies e g reidy et al 2017 rodenhouse et al 1997 whittingham et al 2005 in order to meet the aims of this study i developed statistical models of habitat preferences for both species in which potentially different preferences driven by competition were taken into account in syntopy and allotopy within the sympatry zone in addition for the whinchat the differences between the sympatry and allopatry zones were analysed because unlike for the stonechat it is possible to identify an allopatric zone in poland following this modelling framework four hypothesis were formulated i due to interspecific competition in the sympatric zone habitat segregations occur and as a result there are allotopic and syntopic sites where different habitat preferences between the species can be observed a shift in habitat preferences from allotopy to syntopy is expected from at least one of the species ii for the whinchat if competition drives the segregation of niches of congeneric species differences in habitat preferences between syntopic places and allopatric zones should be noted and no differences in preferred habitats between allotopy and allopatry iii niche conservatism of congeneric species should result in no differences in habitat preferences between species in allotopic sites within a sympatric zone thus the aim of this study is to show that a shift in habitat preferences in the secondary contact zone is observed not only for closely related species reif et al 2018 but also other congeneric species 2 material and methods 2 1 bird data and species density estimation data for estimating the density of birds were collected under the common breeding birds monitoring scheme cbbms chylarecki and jawińska 2007 the cbbms is focused on monitoring population changes of widespread breeding bird species throughout poland field study methodology is consistent with the british breeding bird survey and a detailed survey design described by gregory et al 1996 and gregory and baillie 1998 following the random approach survey plots of 1 km2 area were selected out of 312 000 km2 area of poland fig 2 in the period of 2005 2016 field work conducted by skilled volunteer ornithologists was carried out on 1050 survey plots in each breeding season each survey plot was controlled twice the first visit took place between 10 april and 15 may and the second at least 4 weeks later i e between 16 may and 30 june each visit usually started between 6 a m and 10 a m on each survey plot volunteer ornithologists walked along two parallel 1 kilometre long transects spaced approximately 500 m apart in the north south or east west axis noting birds perpendicularly to the transect line and recording them in three distance categories 25 m 25 100 m 100 m during the eleven year period each grid cell was controlled on average sd in 6 9 3 5 breeding seasons in the analysis i used only plots occupied by at least one of the studied species and the maximum number of individuals observed on the study plot during the eleven year period due to the fact that birds were counted in transects in three distance categories the hayne estimator of species density was used hayne 1949 krebs 1999 d h n 2 l 1 n 1 r i where h hayne s estimator of density n number of animals seen l length of transect ri sighting distance to each animal i this estimation was carried out for each network cell and for each of the studied species 2 2 predictors and data processing on the basis of a previous study on habitat preferences of the whinchat and the stonechat in poland kosicki 2018 kosicki 2020 i chose predictor groups with the highest predictive power for modelling population density of these species four kinds of environmental predictors were used 1 bioclimatic variables 2 land cover types 3 topography and 4 artificial light at night all data were referred to 1 km² survey plots and re projected to the coordinate system epsg4284 projection http spatialreference org ref epsg 4284 climate data were obtained from the worldclim database www worldclim org which is a set of global climate layers with spatial resolution of 1 km2 hijmans et al 2005 i considered six climatic variables for each grid cell the annual mean temperature amt mean temperature of the warmest quarter mtwaq mean temperature of the coldest quarter mtcq annual precipitation ap precipitation of the warmest quarter pwaq and precipitation of the coldest quarter pcq in order to avoid intercorrelation of the variables and to simplify interpretations of bioclimatic variables i used the principal components analysis with the varimax normalised rotation appendix a table s1 the procedure revealed two new axes the first axis prec had the highest loadings with precipitation variables while the second temp with temperature variables land cover types were derived from the corine land cover database which is based on remote sensing with basic spatial units of 100 m x 100 m on average in each study plot nine types of habitats were recognised the most frequent environments were classified as non irrigated arable land followed by fruit tree and berry plantations pastures coniferous deciduous and mixed forest as well as mixed cultivation patterns a sum of the area of complex cultivation patterns and land principally occupied by agriculture scrub a sum of moors and heathland and transitional woodland shrub inland wetlands a sum of inland marshes and peat bogs water courses and water bodies on the basis of these data i calculated for each habitat patch 1 the buffer zone expressed as an area within 100 m from the outside edge of the patch and 2 the core being a patch excluding the 100 metre buffer zone from the patch s edge both indices are expressed as a percentage of the area in each grid cell 1 1 km topography data were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model rabus et al 2003 in the analysis i considered four variables 1 elevation expressed as mean altitude in the study plots 2 aspect where 0 means that the slope faces the north 90 the east 180 the south and 270 the west 3 roughness being the largest intercell difference of a central pixel and its surrounding cell wilson et al 2007 and 4 slope with the average slope in the square expressed in the data on the level of artificial light at night alan coming from meteorological satellites with the operation linescan system osl were obtained from svs gsfc nasa gov database the data including luminescence intensity of artificial light on the night map in the range from 0 no lighting to 63 maximum value of artificial lux is expressed in the digital number values of visible band data units dnv 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 the boundary between sympatric and allopatric zones study plots in which both species were recorded were considered as sympatric squares while plots with only one species were labelled as allopatric squares however such an approach does not mean that boundaries between allopatric and sympatric zones on a large geographical scale can be determined nor that allotopic and syntopic sites can be defined within the sympatric zone therefore i consider regional co occurrence for each study plot for this purpose for each study plot a circle of a 10 km radius was drawn with the centre in the centre of each square when one circle had one or more squares with two species this circle was considered as a sympatric area if the circles overlapped and the squares within the circles contained both species the whole area was also treated as sympatric and vice versa if there was a square with one species in the circle or if there was one and the same species in the overlapping circles in all squares it was treated as allopatric the 10 km radius was not determined arbitrarily this distance corresponds to the maximum 10 dispersion distance of both species bastian 1992 cramp 1988 in other words a circle of 10 km is potentially the maximum area of the dispersion of the species such an assumption is also justified in the case of our data see appendix fig s1 drawing the border between sympatric and allopatric areas or the determination of sympatric and allopatric zones in poland is possible owing to generalised additive models gam these models are excellent for detecting non linear relationships and can also be used as classifiers in establishing decision boundaries hastie et al 2009 as a response variable in the model i used co occurrence of species within the 10 km radius i e 0 if both species were found within this radius or 1 otherwise geographical coordinates were used as predictors of the centre of all study plots in this way boundaries were embedded in the cartesian coordinate system the gam was defined as bernoulli distribution with the log link function the analysis was performed in the mgcv package for r wood 2017 such a procedure ensured that all study plots 1 km squares were classified into two groups sympatric or allopatric zones based only on their geographic coordinates in the next step both species were recorded in sympatric zone squares which were considered as syntopic or allotopic squares if only one species was recorded there on the basis of this classification i found a sympatric zone which was relatively stable over the years the conversion allotopic sites to syntopic or vice versa in the following years were on average1 8 1 3 grid cells 2 3 2 mixed effect modelling approach it was assumed that any divergence in the preferences of niches amongst closely related species was due to the presence of a competitor in the study plot these divergences can be described by the analysis of different habitat preferences of each species in relation to their co occurrence status this status was defined by 1 allopatry where only one species occurs in the region outside the sympatric zone 2 allotopy where only one species occurs in the study plot within the sympatric zone and 3 syntopy where both species occur in the square within the sympatric zone next habitat preferences were considered as a slope between environmental variables and population density assuming that the density increased in more optimal environmental conditions statistical differences between particular slopes of different co occurrence statuses can be interpreted as the effect of competition these modelling conditions were employed in the glmm the hayne estimator of species density was modelled as a response variable by using the poisson distribution and log link function in the glmm framework for species density i calculated slopes for nine predictors in three co occurrence statuses thus enabling in the next step comparisons of habitat preferences of species in relation to different levels of their co occurrence status two stochastic processes were also included in the analysis model firstly each study plot was likely to have unquantifiable characteristics that could not be detected by remote sensing data to control this effect i included a research plot identifier as a random intercept in the model secondly field studies were conducted over a period of 15 years but not all squares were inspected every year thus i added the number of years when the squares had been controlled as weight in the model in order to verify whether full models of both species all predictors could be simplified the akaike information criterion burnham and anderson 2002 was employed it generated all possible combinations of candidate models by adding or removing predictors but keeping the random structure two random factors the model with the lowest aic value and thus the highest akaike weight was considered to be the most parsimonious and the best model the probability of including a predictor in the best model was calculated as the relative importance ri by summing the akaike weights of all candidate models in which this predictor was included burnham and anderson 2002 differences between slopes relationships between the given predictor and density were assessed by a contrast analysis implemented in the emmeans library for r this analysis assumes that a predictor in a model has a different trend depending on its co occurrence status in this procedure i calculated differences contrasts between the slopes of interest and then z statistics with estimating p value to check if the given contrast equalled zero or not 2 3 3 variants of contrast analysis 1 differences in habitat preferences of the two species in syntopy vs allotopy whin alot vs whin synt and or ston alot vs ston synt i assumed that the contrast should reflect a shift in habitat preferences between the species in the study plots sympatric zone occupied by one species allotopy and the study plots with both species syntopy if p value for t statistics in a contrast analysis is 0 05 it means that this element of the environment is not subject to competition between the species in other words there is no shift in environmental preferences due to the presence of closely related species 2 differences in habitat preferences of the whinchat in allopatry vs allotopy whin alop vs whin alot in poland there are no allopatric zones of the stonechat therefore i assumed that there was a shift in a habitat preferences between the study plots in the allopatric zone which is a region with no potential competition of a closely related competitor and b allotopy i e a region with potential competition which in fact does not occur due to spatial separation of both species if the contrast in not statistically significant i e different from zero it means that there is no shift in environmental preferences and spatial avoidance does not result from the occurrence of closely related species 3 differences in habitat preferences between the two species in allotopy whin alot vs ston alot this contrast reflects environmental preferences of the species in the regional absence of a closely related competitor species if t statistic for the contrast analysis is not statistically different from zero it means that the species do not differ in their preferences 4 differences in habitat preferences of the two species in syntopy whin synt vs ston synt this contrast shows environmental preferences of the species in the regional presence of a closely related competitor species if t statistic for the contrast analysis is not statistically different from zero it means that the given habitat is not subject to competition 5 differences in habitat preferences of the whinchat in allopatry vs syntopy whin alop vs whin synt i assumed a shift in habitat preferences between the study plots in the allopatric zone which is a region with no potential competition from closely related competitors as well as in syntopy where competition occurs if the contrast is not statistically significant different form zero it means that there is no shift in environmental preferences and the given environmental component is not a factor which separates competitors spatially 2 3 4 large scale habitat gradients effect differences in habitat preferences between the two species in the sympatric zone and preferences of the whinchat between allopary and sympatry zones can be masked by large scale environmental gradients case and taper 2000 goldberg and lande 2006 reif et al 2018 according to previous research on this phenomenon differences in habitat preferences along the habitat gradient can be detected if this gradient is perpendicular to the species distribution range and if it so long that it covers both sympatry and allopatry zones reif et al 2018 furthermore the gradient should be linear i e change linearly across the species ranges any other spatial variation non linear cubic square etc cannot be considered as a gradient reif et al 2018 to check whether any of the predictors used in the models depends on a large scale gradient i used an approach similar to reif et al 2018 in the first step i used glm with settings of the bernoulli distribution for the response and logit link function where binary variables were used as the response sympatric sites 1 and allopatric sites 0 and the longitude and latitude of central grid cells as independent variables thus i developed a linear geographical gradient perpendicular to the border between the species next i calculated residuals between this generated line and each grid cell s centre so the squares on both sides of the line had an opposite character or to test whether the ten independent variables used in the modelling procedure depended on the environmental gradient i calculated a linear regression between the gradient and the value of the given environmental variable if the beta coefficient is significantly different from 0 which was checked with the t test i assume that this environmental variation is gradient dependant and this relationship must be used in the glmm construction in all cases beta did not differ from 0 appendix which did not require taking into account the gradient in the analysis in addition i made maps of all predictors to check visually whether the gradient problem may masque any conclusions resulting from the glmm 3 results 3 1 sympatric and allopatric zones on the basis of generalised additive models appendix s2 it was established sympatric and allopatric regions for the whinchat a sympatric region for the stonechat and syntopic and allotopic sites within the sympatry for the two species the whinchat s allopatric region covered 67 620 km2 in the north east part of poland fig 2 within the sympatric zone allotopic sites of the stonechat were more often located along the east west axis in the central and southern parts of poland while allotopic sites of the stonechat were distributed throughout the whole sympatry syntopic sites within sympatric regions increased from the north to the south of poland fig 2 3 2 models selection out of all the analysed models all gained support using information theoretic criteria showing aic weights 0 0001 appendix table s3 and in all cases a full model was the most parsimonious that is why the final interpretation was based on this kind of model 3 3 a shift of habitat preferences for the whinchat in the sympatric zone during the research on the whinchat population i discovered that relationships between temperature and the species density switched from non significant in allotopy slope se for this relationship was 0 032 0 023 z 1 38 p 0 165 fig 3 to positively significant in syntopy 0 301 0 119 z 2 53 p 0 011 fig 3 table 1 then the impact of precipitation on this species density was not significant either in allotopy 0 143 0 999 z 1 43 p 0 150 fig 3 or syntopy 0 697 0 370 z 0 509 p 0 610 fig 3 table 1 whereas the area of arable fields had a positive influence on the density of both species in allotopy and syntopy respectively 0 475 0 234 z 2 03 p 0 04 fig 3 1 14 0 275 z 4 138 p 0 0001 fig 3 however the percentage of the buffer zone of this area had a negative impact on the density in syntopy 0 237 0 984 z 2 374 p 0 017 fig 3 while no statistical significance was

pressure in syntopy i found significant differences between the species in relation to their density temperature precipitation area of arable fields as well as the percentage of the buffer zone of this habitat meadows the buffer zone of mixed arable fields alan and roughness table 1 on the other hand in allotopy there were no significant differences between the species table 1 4 discussion in this study i analysed the niche divergence mechanism that allows co existence of related congeners although our analysis showed that there were no allopatric zones for the stonechat in poland differences emerged in habitat preferences in the secondary contact zone sympatric zone of the whinchat and the stonechat as expected the two species are separated habitably in this zone so this factor is likely to ensure their stable co existence therefore apart from allotopic sites no differences in habitat preferences between species syntopic sites were also formed where both species showed not only clear differences in habitat preferences but also opposite associations to certain environmental components what is more the whinchat whose allopatric zone can be defined in poland demonstrated differences in habitat preferences between allopatry and syntopy but no differences between the allopatric and allotopic sites on the basis of a study on closely related species reif et al 2018 i assumed that these differences in habitat preferences between syntopy and allotopy were also the result of interspecific competition so far interspecific competition has not been considered as a biotic interaction that shapes ranges of species and their habitat use primarily competition predation and parasitism have been suggested to shape a community only on the local and mesoscales whereas on broad spatial scales like in our research species co existence is regulated according to climate and geographic gradients ricklefs 2010 keil et al 2012 royan et al 2016 kosicki et al 2017 d andrea and ostling 2016 the assumption was empirically tested and confirmed for example in communities of river birds in the uk and island bird species royan et al 2016 ricklefs et al 2016 therefore this study extends the pattern and contributes to a debate on a notion that interspecific competition does not have to be considered exclusively in theory d andrea and ostling 2016 indeed empirical evidence can be provided showing that competition shapes range patterns legault et al 2020 and influences spatial segregation of not only two closely related species reif et al 2018 but also other congeneric species as demonstrated by my analyses based on comprehensive data from the area of poland despite morphological differences between the species especially the wing length only one study showed that the larger of the two species had better competitive abilities phillips 1970 however this phenomenon was not confirmed in this study in the case of these two species it is also possible that competitive abilities may be influenced by migration strategies and adaptations to environmental changes the whinchat is a sub saharan migrant while the stonechat is less of a migrator besides the stonechat feels better in dry habitats which tend to be increasingly present in poland whereas the whinchat definitely avoids them so interactions between the habitat and the migration strategy may be favoured by the short distance or sometimes resident migrant stonechat thanks to its ability to adapt to current habitat conditions such an adaptive scheme may favour the competitive ability of the stonechat however it is highly probable that this kind of interspecific competition concerns only closely related congeneric species that cannot be treated as a general pattern of competition in a community the speculation is confirmed by royan et al 2016 or ricklefs et al 2016 who found no such effect this is exactly due to the fact that in both cases was consider communities of species which are not related to each other on the other hand an analogical relationship to this study was found in reifa s et al 2018 study on two sister species of nightingales in this case it was discovered that two hybridising luscinia megarhynchos and l luscinia differed in habitat use between allotopy and syntopy which was due to competition between tchem and this is the main mechanism that accelerates completion of the speciation process sottas et al 2018 this fact strengthens a supposition that competition between sister species brings about a separation of the realised niches and this pattern is characteristic of the co existence of related congeners hence these results provide evidence that the co existence of related congeners is possible through evolving phenotypic plasticity with respect to habitat preferences in the sympatric zone in other words along with habitat use climatic gradients and parasites competition between species should be considered as a biotic interaction responsible for shaping spatial patterns of the species ranges in abundance so they can maintain a stably functioning community gaston 2003 regardless of whether niche divergence is a consequence of competition or other mechanisms that have not been described so far this research has proven beyond doubt that the sympatric zone should not be treated as a coherent area of an even distribution of two species the sympatric zone is a rather heterogeneous region interspersed with sites of co occurrence syntopy and sites where there is only one species allotopy the models show that there is a strong shift in habitat preferences of both species in the two sites i suspect that the sympatric zone developed as a secondary site due to changes in the boundary of the range as well as competition in the allotopic zone this study provides direct evidence for this conclusion because there is no difference between allotopia and allopatry for the whinchat and no significant divergence in habitat use between both species in allotopy whereas a shift of habitat preferences is observed only in syntopy obviously it is possible that syntopia was formed by other mechanisms such as relationships between density and distance from the edge of the range brown et al al 1995 but our study does not confirm this assumption if syntopy is an adaptation shaped by competition some cost of breeding in sub optimal habitats should have been observed i have no such data but i do speculate that the cost of the sub optimal habitat is balanced by interspecific competition in allotopic sites which is caused by high densities a fact partly confirmed by our results showing a difference in densities between allotopy and syntopy it should be also noted that the lack of sufficient evidence that competition plays a key role in shaping a stable co existence of closely related species in spatially broad domains may result from methodological limitations mainly insufficient data resolution for wide spatial scales d andrea and ostling 2016 nevertheless in my studies this effect does not occur because i use high resolution data on birds and habitats that come from an area of 388 000 km2 and environmental gradients have been controlled in the models in conclusion it was demonstrated that co existence of related congeneric birds is possible as a result of a shift habitat preferences in their secondary contact zone pigot and tobias 2013 this conclusion is based on the adopted analytical approach in which the range was divided into allopatric the whinchat and sympatric zones the whinchat and the stonechat and then into allotopic and syntopic sites in this way it was possible to assess the degree of niche segregation resulting from interspecific competition this discovery has serious implications for research on species habitat preferences on large spatial scales including species distribution modelling because it shows that habitat preference is a function of species range and occurrence of sister species large scale predictive models are effective tools for conservation strategies louthan et al 2015 including modelling of invasion species fourcade 2021 and they require biotic interactions as an additional predictor or co variate in order to limit the unexplained variance of models whose utmost goal is to provide comprehensive knowledge for the field of biodiversity conservation credit

24442,forest fires profoundly affect the nature of watershed responses to precipitation increases in runoff rate and volume and post fire sediment discharge a post fire watershed assessment to identify potential trouble spots for soil erosion and flooding can help land managers for decision making on deploy mitigation remediation measures and restoration action plans predicting the potential impact of fires on runoff and soil erosion requires distributed hydrological modeling methods this study used the soil and water assessment tool swat a rainfall runoff model to investigate the hydrological consequences of forest fires and their impact on sediment load under different burnt scenarios for the pre fire baseline scenario the watershed is calibrated by using the measured discharge and suspended sediment concentration data from the weather station during the time step to estimate post fire changes at the sub catchment scale the total water and sediment yield for the selected sub catchment in the post fire scenario with the highest spatial distribution of forest fire due to the excessive surface runoff an increase of 14 5 increased significantly resulted in 6 5 times increase in sediment yield the results obtained from the study indicate a significant increase in sediment transport into the stream in the post fire scenario a large volume of soil losses occurred during the time step in contrast due to removing trees and vegetation from the ground less evapotranspiration and infiltration occurred in selected sub catchment areas after forest fires in terms of watershed management understanding the consequences of forest fires on hydrological services will be an effective method for sediment budget control therefore applying the rainfall runoff and erosion models for the watershed with developing plausible forest fire scenarios can be a productive method to deal with the threats and hydrological risks such as soil erosion and sediment transfer to the downstream environment keywords wildfire land use change swat hydrological model erosion sediment yield watershed management 1 introduction erosion and related issues have always presented significant challenges in water resources management and development water consistently erodes sediment from the bed and banks of the reaches and carries it downriver through the catchment different phenomena such as ground deformations or landslides can also lead to the overrun of sediments in the river system and forming an unexpected build up of sediments deposition in addition to the naturally occurring sediment the impact of activities such as agriculture deforestation mining urbanization and road building on soil erosion rates is inevitable amundson et al 2015 hassan et al 2017 a significant cause of changes in sedimentation and erosion patterns is through hydrological modifications in the forests forests have a variety of ecological and hydrological benefits for example contributing to enhanced infiltration and water retention the filtration process in the soil column helps to improve water quality bredemeier 2010 furthermore the combined effects of vegetation litter cover and reduced water yield imply decreased erosion rates under forest cover baseline sedimentation reducing flood hazards and affecting both the soil quality and the downstream aquatic environments farley et al 2005 schüler 2006 therefore through the changes in hydrological processes deforestation and degradation of forests cause significant downstream impacts to the freshwater and estuarine environments increasing the amount of sediment iwata et al 2003 pattanayak and wendland 2007 forest fires are the most common way of degrading forests and their ecosystems forest fires seriously affect ecosystems and cause lost totally or partly forests positive effects i e soil erosion protection enrichment of soil properties certini 2005 decreasing hydrophobicity enhancing infiltration capacity and decreasing surface runoff martin and moody 2001 fires cause the destruction of vegetation coverage which have an important role in hydrological control in the forests such as helping to intercept rainfall reaching the ground or the canopy s buffering that reduces the rainfall intensity effect on subsoil helping to keep the soil structure forest fires clear the ground cover of vegetation and trees exposing the soil causing sediment to be entrained by the impact of raindrops reducing roughness altering hydrological connectivity fernández et al 2020 forming water repellency of soil debano 2000 ice et al 2004 and causing runoff to flow down slopes more quickly these changes in hillside conditions directly affect increment peak runoff volume sediment discharge and sedimentation rates therefore runoff under post fire conditions has a high potential for downstream flooding occurrence and sedimentation which will reduce the capacity of the reservoirs designed for drinking water supply robichaud et al 2000 the hydrological changes reduce the time for water to accumulate and infiltrate on the hillslope resulting in a higher runoff rate and higher sediment concentration and transport capacity canfield et al 2005 previous studies have evaluated the forest fires adverse effects and hydrological impacts on runoff and sediment loads earlier beaty 1994 was studied the impact of two consecutive forest fires between 1974 and 1982 on sediment transport in the river bed the study results showed that bed load transport increased by 20 times after the first forest fire and three times after the second fire and the particle sizes tended to increase during the investigation period with the dominance of 87 dissolved load the us department of agriculture forest service burned area emergency repair baer invested considerably in emergency watershed restoration measures after a fire to reduce flood runoff on site erosion off site sedimentation and hydrological damage robichaud et al 2000 various studies have revealed that the erosion impact was most significant in the first year after the fire and steadily declined in the following years and returned to baseline values within three to five years ewing 1996 moody and martin 2001 robichaud et al 2000 ryan et al 2011 found that the total suspended sediment load during the snowmelt runoff and summer storms were increased by 54 and 44 percent respectively for the first post fire year and the following year started to return to levels observed in the unburned watersheds and during the pre fire period a post fire watershed assessment to identify potential trouble spots for erosion and flooding may help land managers to deploy mitigation and restoration resources due to the inherent complexity and spatiality decision making requires distributed hydrological modeling methods the automated geospatial watershed assessment agwa is a geographic information system gis based tool that was developed and called an early distributed hydrological model to predict the potential impact of fire on runoff and erosion and to assess the watershed before and after the fire in the north of tucson arizona goodrich et al 2005 the results showed that the hydrological model of the fire affected area obtained from the agwa tool provides the ability to quickly assess the watershed after a fire to target the remedial work more effectively however two models the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and the kinematic runoff and erosion model kineros2 smith et al 1990 were incorporated into agwa to perform multi scale watershed assessments swat is a time continuous simulation model used to assess land cover climate change and management practices for example agriculture in large river basin scale watersheds although other hydrological soil erosion models have long been used to assess post fire runoff and soil erosion it was only recently that they began to be modeled in swat in some cases through a simulation of the hydrological responses after wildfires and their impact on the water supply of a large urban area carvalho santos et al 2019 havel et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 soulis et al 2021 in other cases by modifying key model parameters at different magnitudes and spatial scales of the fire conditions coupled with a land use update model to study the forest fires on the water quality and modeling river discharge pattern influenced from a forest fire basso et al 2020 or most recently modeling forest fire scenarios to investigate its impact on sediment loads thomas et al 2021 this study investigates the potential of applying the swat hydrological model to examine the impact of forest fires on sediment load the purpose of this study is to evaluate the hydrological consequences of forest fires and their effects on streamflow and use runoff and erosion models to analyze their respective impacts on sediment load under different burnt scenarios 2 material and methods within the context of this work we investigated the impact of forest fires on streamflow discharge and sediment yield at sub catchment scale to demonstrate the total contribution of the current study we outline the following three main aspects 1 there are no hydrological model studies available in the study area in the existing literature and the current research will fill this gap in the literature 2 since there are two main water regulator stations to supply water to mega city istanbul examining and identifying existing and possible sediment resources in the watershed is critical for decision makers the results provide essential clues for developing recommendations to reduce sediment transport improve water quality maintain resources and sustainable management 3 two dams the sungurlu and osmangazi dams are planned on streams in the basin the results obtained from this study guide the dam project design in terms of economy and environment hence reductions in sediment yield in their basins extend the life of dams and reduce the dead volume in reservoirs by applying the rainfall runoff model of the göksu çanakdere rivers basin we designed wildfire scenarios similar to previously observed fires in the basin to provide relevant mitigation strategies to deal with natural threats and hydrological risks therefore we chose to use measured data rainfall discharge suspended sediment concentration and use existing catchment characteristics land use soil and topography to design forest fire scenarios 2 1 site description the göksu çanakdere rivers basin 40 59ˮ n 29 51ˮ e with an area of approximately 800 km2 is in northeast of istanbul and west of kocaeli province turkey reaching into the black sea fig 1 the climate of the black sea region the balkans and anatolia characterizes its climate properties the two main tributaries in the study area are göksu and çanakdere with a total length of 122 and 77 km respectively the geological types include clay limestone sandy limestone sandstone and limestone citiroglu et al 2011 the topographic pattern is partly undulating ranging from 1 to 649 m the annual temperatures range from 8 c to 15 c and annual rainfall ranges from 350 to 1400 mm aksoy et al 2010 the watershed receives an average annual rainfall of about 815 mm and an average annual temperature of about 14 8 c state meteorological service mgm flow and suspended sediment data were purchased from dsi turkish state of hydraulics which was collected from rain gage stations located in major rivers the total rainfall drainage basin area for collecting data from these two stations is 782 km2 the predominant land use type in the watershed is agriculture 55 2 and forest 43 6 the largest forest area is in the central part of the watershed between istanbul and kocaeli province mainly covering pure oak stands forests with the rest being mixed stands forest species atalay 1986 these properties affect the likelihood that the area may be burned and the anticipated potential fire behavior the presence of trees shrubs flammable vegetation and other potential fuels topography and climate change impacts are vital factors that create favorable conditions for wildfires due to the potential environmental factors leading to the fire in the study area it may spread quickly and it can be tough to prevent its spread in addition most areas of main rivers surrounded by forests significantly impact water quality and sedimentation rate after a fire event therefore in this study it considered that the fire intensity of the forest fire scenario is very high 2 2 field surveys in site measurements were conducted to obtain detailed information on land use cover and structure to improve the accuracy of determining the required parameters during the modeling process since most land use is dominated by the agricultural activities and due to the basins properties such as the topology soil type the river s geomorphological characteristics and the climate condition of the area the sediment dynamics and rates are high in this watershed a fast hydrological response characterizes the catchment and flash floods occur within a few hours causing the water body to transport a large amount of sediment according to the results obtained by the dynamic erosion model and monitoring system demis cem 2018 the sediment yield per unit area of the göksu çanakdere rivers basin ranges from 6 92 to 9 35 ton ha 1 which is affected by water erosion in the drainage area of this watershed between 305 103 to 332 103 tons of soil are displaced annually because of water erosion cem 2018 field studies were carried out also to ensure that the model created by determining the characteristics of the basin better reflects the actual situation in addition the factors affecting the formation of sediments in the basin were determined and their influence and importance level were studied daily flow rate and water level and velocity were automatically collected in the flow and observation stations by dsi screening analysis is performed in a laboratory environment to determine the particle distribution and diameter of samples collected from the bottom of the creek using a multifunctional sediment collection mechanism 2 3 forest fires scenarios this study was conducted in two phases the first phase corresponds to the baseline scenario where the model is calibrated and validated based on the current land use and meteorological data with no forest fire during the period 2005 2017 for the first scenario the corresponding rainfall event characteristics and model parameters did not change in the second phase of the study different forest fire scenarios table 1 were performed to analyze the effect of fires on flow rates and sediment fluxes in these scenarios homogeneous forest patches with 25 50 and 100 burnt forest areas in relative to the area of baseline scenario wildfire prone area as shown in fig 1 are defined for use in the model as shown in fig 2 c b and d in this step some model inputs such as land use type and cn curve number value were changed to evaluate the forest fires impacts 2 4 swat hydrological model the swat model is a physical conceptual and the semi distributed model that operates on daily or sub daily time steps and process based time continuous simulation it can run under different management conditions over extended periods in small to large complex watersheds divided into hydrological response units according to dem soil and land use types the model developed to predict the effects of different management practices on hydrological and water quality processes sediment yield and pollution loading yen et al 2014 and is also used to analyze the impact of climate soil vegetation and agricultural activities on the flow and chemical yields in watersheds swat is being applied to simulate streamflow sediment and nutrient transport within a watershed and to search for a good planning strategy which depends to a large extent on the integrated watershed model de vente et al 2013 in addition it has several sub models to calculate various components such as evapotranspiration flow routing and loss in the swat model the watershed is subdivided into multiple sub basins and each sub basin is further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus each hru comprises a unique and homogeneous combination of land use management topographical and soil characteristics in each sub basin arnold et al 2012 water balance is the driving force behind all processes in swat as it affects plant growth and the movement of sediments nutrients pesticides and pathogens water balance is a function of inputs driven by climates such as daily precipitation maximum minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity the hydrological simulation of the watershed is divided into the land phase and the in stream or routing phase arnold et al 2012 the land phase baselines the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticides in the main channel in each sub basin while the routing phase deals with the movement of water and sediments through the basin s channel network to the outlet neitsch et al 2011 swat simulated hydrological processes are including of canopy storage infiltration surface runoff evapotranspiration et lateral flow percolation groundwater flow tile drainage water redistribution within the soil profile pumped consumption use if any return flow and recharge by infiltration from surface waters ponds and tributaries all water balance processes in the same hru are consistent the hydrologic cycle modeled by swat relies on the water balance eq 1 neitsch et al 2005 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where the final soil water content s w t in mm at the simulation time t in days is obtained from the sum of s w 0 in mm the initial soil water content on day i and the amount of total precipitation r d a y in mm on day i when the total losses on day i including the amount of surface runoff q s u r f in mm the amount of evapotranspiration e a in mm the amount of water that percolates from the soil profile w s e e p in mm and the amount of return flow q g w in mm are subtracted from the total precipitation once the water application rate to the surface exceeds the infiltration rate of surface runoff the surface runoff will occur when the water reaches dry soil the permeability is usually very high but the permeability decreases as the soil gets wet if the surface water ratio is higher than the permeability the surface depressions begin to fill surface runoff will occur once all surface depressions are filled by water and the application rate continues to be higher than the permeability rate to estimate surface runoff the swat model uses the method of the scs cn procedure usda soil conservation service usda 1972 and the green and ampt green and ampt 1911 infiltration method in this study the scs cn method was used to estimate surface runoff which is a function of the soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions as described in eq 2 neitsch et al 2005 2 q s u r f r d a y 0 2 s 2 r d a y 0 8 s where q s u r f is the accumulated runoff or excess rainfall in mm and r d a y is the rainfall depth in the day in mm s is the retention parameter in mm defined by eq 3 neitsch et al 2005 3 s 25 4 100 c n 10 to estimate potential evapotranspiration the model recommends three methods including penman monteith monteith 1965 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 and priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 the penman monteith method requires the input of solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity the priestley taylor method requires solar radiation and air temperature while the hargreaves method only requires air temperature as model input briak et al 2016 yebdri et al 2007 in the swat model the erosion of each hru and the sediment yield from subbasins is predicted with the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 which is calculated as follows 4 s e d 11 8 q s u r f q p e a k a r e a h r u 0 56 k u s l e c u s l e p u s l e l s u s l e c f r g where s e d is the sediment yield to the stream network at the outlet on a given day metric tons q s u r f is the surface runoff volume from a given rainfall event mm ha 1 q p e a k is the peak flow rate m3 s 1 a r e a h r u is the area of the hru ha k u s l e is soil erodibility factor 0 013 t m2 hr m3 metric ton cm 1 which is a soil property available from the universal soil loss equation usle c u s l e is the usle cover crop vegetation management factor and can be derived from land cover data p u s l e is the usle support conservation practice factor the erosion baseline practice factor which is a field specific value l s u s l e is the usle topographic slope length gradient factor and c f r g is the coarse fragment factor the scale factor values of 11 8 and 0 56 are parameters associated with the location and were used to calibrate the model in the derivation of musle adegede and mbajiorgu 2019 j williams 1975 the channel s sediment routing consists of the channel s degradation by means of stream power and the deposit in the channel through the fall velocity channel degradation is regulated using usle soil erodibility and channel cover factor arnold et al 1995 williams 1980 swat employs manning s equation to determine flow rate and velocity water is routed through the channel network using the muskingum river routing method and the variable storage routing method both variations of the kinematic wave model neitsch et al 2005 2 5 model set up as a physically based hydrological model swat requires a large amount of input data to represent the spatial variability of the primary runoff sediment yield baseline characteristics such as soil land use cover topography river channels and reservoirs to avoid the parameter uncertainty problems in the results and to depend on the availability of data and computation resources the model was set up to derive the distribution characteristics of sediment yield and erosion and baseline the sensitive parameters of the runoff and sediment routing process in the study basin spatial data including digital elevation model dem land use maps soil maps and meteorological data as mandatory inputs are used in the preprocessing phase for the swat model the methods used to prepare watershed primary input data for the swat hydrological model are described below 2 5 1 topographic map dem is used to determine terrain attributes such as elevation slope and aspect extraction of flow direction flow accumulation flow network generation and watershed and sub basins delineation process therefore dem is often used to refer to any digital representation of a terrain surface and is the simplest form of digital representation topographic parameters such as overland slope channel slope and river length both the primary and tributary rivers are also the main geomorphic parameter derived from the dem hence the quality of the remote sensing derived dem used in hydrological processing directly affects the model s accuracy for this reason the radiometrically terrain corrected rtc high resolution rt1 dem products alaska satellite facility asf 2015 with a pixel spacing of 12 5 m spatial resolution in geotiff format was used for hydrological modeling in this study in the swat model pre defined watersheds and existing river network data sets are used for delineating the watersheds and generating watershed configurations quantum gis qgis development team 2021 an open source geographical information system gis software has been used as an interface and platform for the swat process and spatial analysis 2 5 2 land use cover map land use defines the permanent types of land use in a watershed land use and vegetation changes affect the water cycle and their impact is a function of plant cover density and plant species morphology the land use cover type is mainly agricultural and forest land in the study site the land use cover map was obtained from the corine land cover clc 2018 dataset of the european union copernicus land monitoring service to generate hydrological response units hru for each sub basin area as shown in fig 2 a the land use cover is partitioned into 16 categories and converted to swat s land use classification code 2 5 3 soil map the soil map was obtained from the soil map of the turkish dataset prepared by an interdisciplinary team composed of soil scientists geologists geomorphologists and gis experts cullu et al 2018 the main soil types in the study area are cambisols and leptosols which were reclassified according to the soil texture and hydrological soil groups fao soil classification provided by the european commission and the european soil bureau network kük and burgess 2010 cambisol is related to leptosols and kastanozems and is usually located on the northern edge of calcisols widespread in semi arid areas on slopes and eroded terrains occupied by extensive forests and steppes ntouros et al 2009 2 5 4 hydrological and meteorological data thirteen hydrological years 2005 to 2017 were used to simulate the swat model two water years 2005 and 2006 were used to get the system hydrology to warm up which enabled the model to cycle multiple times to minimize the effects of the user s estimates of initial state variables zhang et al 2008 the 7 year 2007 2013 data is used for calibration and the 4 year 2014 2017 data is used for verification the trend analysis of rainfall data and mean and standard deviation methods were used to reduce inhomogeneities of the datasets and the over or under estimation of the model due to the dry and wet years in data selected for calibration and validation to this end the datasets selected for calibration and validation are expected to have a close mean and standard deviation values the hydrological and meteorological data are acquired from the dsi turkish state of hydraulics and mgm state meteorological service climatic data including daily precipitation minimum maximum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from meteorological stations for the model inputs global weather data downloaded from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr https globalweather tamu edu and world weather for water data service w3s https www uoguelph ca watershed w3s to evaluate the accuracy of the collected meteorological data dile and srinivasan 2014 observed streamflow and sediment datasets collected from the göksu and çanakdere rain gage stations are used for model calibration and verification 2 6 optimization algorithms due to the significant uncertainties in hydrological simulations the definition and quantification of model uncertainties have become the subject of many studies the different optimization algorithms converge to different calibrated parameter ranges and each finds a different solution at different locations in the parameter spaces with more or less the same discharge results yang et al 2007 in this study the sequence uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 algorithm was used to calibrate the swat model due to the availability of many parameters in the water balance modeling and having the ability to implement a combined calibration uncertainty analysis parameter uncertainty is calculated based on all input and output sources such as the uncertainty of input rainfall data land use and soil types parameters and the observation data in sufi 2 the simulation uncertainty is quantified by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and referred to as the p factor the 95ppu is calculated at the 2 5 lower95ppu and 97 5 upper95ppu levels of the cumulative distribution function of the output variable obtained from the latin hypercube sampling method disallowing 5 of the very bad simulations the relative width of the 95 probability band is the r factor value the p factor of 1 and the r factor of 0 are simulations that correspond precisely to the measured data arnold et al 2012 2 7 model performance evaluation the model evaluation was performed based on the calibration and validation with a comparison of the observed and simulated flow and sediment loads to constrain the model and achieve more robust characterizations of the land and the stream phases over a period the calibration and validation of process based distributed hydrological models are often challenging due to the high data requirements to support complexity difficulty in data acquisition scarcity of observed data and limited resources three model evaluation methods based on error statistics were used as the objective functions to determine the model performance in this study the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and percent bias pbias were used as statistical and graphical model evaluation techniques moriasi et al 2007 the values of r2 nse and pbias are determined by eqs 5

assessment the performance of the swat model was evaluated in simulating streamflow in the göksu çanakdere rivers basin using 13 years for calibration and validation autocalibration and validation and uncertainty analysis of the model were performed for monthly periods using sufi 2 method within swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty procedures abbaspour et al 2000 the sufi 2 algorithm maps all the uncertainties of the parameters to a uniform distribution or range by fixing the parameters to the best values obtained through preliminary runs most of the measured data within the model s 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu will be captured in the iterative process in this study 13 relative sensitivity value parameters were evaluated and determined during the parameter estimation process these variables parameters descriptions uncertainty ranges and fitted values are provided in table 2 since the hydrological model studies for the watershed in the study area are not available in the existing literature hence selecting sensitivity parameters was a challenging issue to this end field surveys were carried out to collect detailed information on land use cover and structure to improve the accuracy of determining the required parameters during the modeling process in addition an extensive literature review was conducted to obtain source information on the sensitivity parameters of hydrological models used in adjacent watersheds or watersheds that were geographically close to the study area the model was calibrated using the observed flow from 2005 to 2013 and it was validated from 2014 to 2017 for calibration two years are used as the warm up period for the model for each iteration of the discharge calibration 2000 simulations were run after each iteration the range of parameters were modified and narrowed down based on the program s abbaspour et al 2007 suggested values and initial limits in model calibration after obtaining reasonable flow parameters and their value ranges from the final simulation of the model the values were used without any modification for the model validation to evaluate the model s performance with calibrated parameters for model validation the same hydrological parameters and value ranges were used to simulate the hydrological functions of the basin during another period 2014 to 2017 that was not used in the calibration phase sensitivity analysis results indicated that the most sensitive parameter of hydrological parameters was the scs runoff curve number cn2 the scs cn soil conservation service curve number method is an empirical equation developed by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service used to predict direct surface runoff for a given rainfall event mishra et al 2019 in scs cn runoff was estimated with the appropriate cn for antecedent moisture condition i e cn1 dry condition cn2 average condition or cn3 wet condition the second group of parameters with similar significance was the base flow alpha factor alpha bf the groundwater delay gw delay and the threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer gwqmn other parameters such as the available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc the manning s value for the main channel ch n2 the depth from the soil surface to the bottom of the layer soil z and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity soil k were identified as slightly significant 3 2 sediment yield assessment the suspended sediment values measured at two stations are used for sediment model calibration and verification similarly the calibration and validation model for discharge rate the observed suspended sediment data are divided into two parts from 2005 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2017 to use model calibration and validation for the sediment rate respectively the acceptable ranges of swat parameters and the values chosen for this study which were obtained after several simulations in swat cup are shown in table 2 sediment parameters sensitivity analysis indicated that the most important parameters were the channel erodibility factor ch cov1 followed by the exponent parameter for calculating the channel sediment routing spexp the average slope length slsubbsn the linear parameter for calculating the channel sediment routing spcon the soil erodibility factor in usle usle k and the usle support practice factor usle p 3 3 swat model performance in this study r2 nse and pbias as objective functions were used to evaluate the calibration validation performance between the observed data and the model predictions two indices the p factor ranges 0 to 1 and the r factor ranges 0 to were used to judge the goodness and strength of the uncertainty performance the p factor is the percentage of data captured by the 95ppu band and the r factor is the average thickness of the uncertainty band divided by the standard deviation of the related measured variable abbaspour et al 2007 the goodness of fitting between the simulated and the observed discharge for each gauged station was computed for the calibration and validation periods the p factor and the r factor indices are used to assess the model output uncertainty of the flow and sediment loads the performance of the swat model simulation with monthly time steps is obtained according to the recommended assessment criteria moriasi et al 2007 the nse values for flow and sediment were obtained as 0 85 and 0 63 for calibration and 0 94 and 0 42 for validation periods respectively model predictions of flow and sediment loads were also evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination r2 0 86 and r2 0 65 and pbias 5 8 and 1 3 for calibration periods respectively although the flow model performed well the consistency between the measured and simulated sediment concentrations during the validation period was not satisfactory nse 0 5 however for the validation period higher performance values of the flow model r2 0 94 and good sediment model performance r2 0 58 were obtained which indicates that the estimation of the research process is favored the performance of the model simulations is determined based on the statistical scales obtained by eqs 5 to 7 and the results are shown in table 3 the scatter plot and the obtained r2 values for discharge and sediment simulations and observations during calibration and validation periods to identify correlations between flow and suspended sediment are shown in fig 4 in addition to the quantitative statistics table 3 fig 5 also provides an intuitive comparison of the graphical representations of calibration and uncertainty analysis indicating the best simulated flow rate and sediment yield with measured data and the 95 uncertainty area predicted by the model calibration and validation of the swat model in the basin through the sufi 2 method was performed for monthly flow rates and sediment concentration records from the hydrometric stations by comparison with the flow rates and sediment concentration of the simulated values over 13 years period the results show that the model successfully simulates the flow rate and sediment concentration the linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between monthly measured flow and suspended sediment 2005 2017 it is worth noting that the gap between the monthly measured values for sediment concentration was filled by applying the interpolation method and finding the relation between the sediment as the dependent variable and the discharge as the independent variable in the linear regression model 3 4 estimation of forest fire consequences on flow and sediment yield the forest patches were defined and burnt according to the scenarios defined in table 1 resulting in different micro basins burnt locations and areas affected by simulated fires in the göksu çanakdere rivers basin as shown in fig 2 b c and d according to the scenarios under consideration the resulting burnt area is approaching between 3000 and 12 000 hectares corresponding to the model run from the most minor burnt patch i e scenario 1 to the most giant burnt patch i e scenario 3 respectively forest fires have affected the catchment area occupying an average of 8 5 of the watershed area and up to 15 to conduct post fire scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of forest fires on discharge and sediment some model inputs such as land use type cn value and soil erodibility factor k factor have been changed the cn method is often used in hydrology to predict runoff or infiltration caused by excessive rainfall based on land use and soil type and used to address post fire enhanced hydrological response rodrigues et al 2019 likewise k factor is used to estimate the sensitivity of soil to erosion by an external force or energy renard et al 1997 for burnt patches and lands overlapped by burnt area distribution k factor increases by 0 016 then for converting into the swat unit the k factor value is divided by 0 1317 fernández et al 2010 following the recommendations of havel et al 2018 cn is increased by 15 for burnt areas those changes were introduced to the swat database to create new land use and soil classes finally the model was re run for each scenario with new inputs and parameters to evaluate discharge and sediment variables according to different forest burnt scenarios in the annual time step the water balance components are summarized according to the model results of all scenarios as shown in fig 6 the model output indicates that in scenario 3 in comparing without forest fires baseline scenario the average annual total water yield i e the total amount of surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow of the burnt sub catchment increased by 14 5 following the increase in water yield and due to the high erosiveness ability of excessive surface runoff the sediment yield after the forest fire has increased by 1 5 to 3 5 fold compared to the sediment yield prior to the burnt time in the burnt scenario 3 the sediment yield raised to 6 5 fold that before the forest fire and in the baseline model fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the total annual amounts of water water yield that leaves the sub basins and contribute to streamflow in the reach before baseline and after the burnt scenarios 1 to 3 within the time step for the selected sub catchment the progressive increase of burnt area brings along a gradual increase in the flow rates and the maximum runoff occurs when fire consumes the significant portion of selected forest and removal of ground vegetation cover in the post fire conditions surface flow increased by about 70 from 151 8 mm to 256 6 mm while infiltration rates decreased 37 compared with the baseline scenario accordingly water yield increase after the fire effect is the result of the higher surface runoff 14 5 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the total annual amounts of transported sediment from the subbasin sediment yield by surface runoff into the reach before baseline and after the burnt scenarios 1 to 3 for the selected sub catchment within the time step in contrast less evapotranspiration and percolation have occurred after forest fire due to removing trees and vegetation from the ground this change is reasoned by the decrease in soil permeability following the forest fire which is achieved by increasing the cn value in the burned areas therefore the soil is lesser permeable and lesser infiltration will occur resulting from increasing the peak flows in the post fire scenarios the decreases in percolation and evapotranspiration values in the post fire scenario with the maximum burnt area at selected sub catchment was obtained at 37 and 9 respectively fig 9 and fig 10 show the spatial distribution of the total annual amounts of percolation and evapotranspiration before baseline and after the burnt scenarios 1 to 3 for the selected sub catchment within the time step the simulation output of the baseline no forest fire and burnt scenarios were further analyzed and compared to quantify the change in the average annual hydrological budget caused by the fire during the simulation period for the selected sub watershed of the study area table 4 the results show that the hydrological budget has significantly changed on the sub basins and the watershed scale in post fire periods compared with the baseline scenario a large amount of soil loss and a significant increase in the amount of sediment transported into the stream were observed within the time step correspondingly the total biomass i e above ground and roots and leaf area index dropped sharply in the post fire scenario directly affecting evapotranspiration and its reduction rainfall runoff discharge and sediment rates are model variables that have linear interaction with each other forest fires force changes in land use cover types i e conversion of forests to bare land and affect model variables differently it removes the ground cover from trees and vegetation helping quick move the raindrops on the ground and changing it to the surface runoff degrading the soil while moving to the downstream and transporting the degraded soil i e sediment into the reach and depositing in the river or discharges it into the sea the relationship between the monthly measured discharge and simulated surface runoff rainfall and simulated sediment yield in pre fire baseline and post fire scenarios 1 to 3 for the sub catchment area are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the results indicate that the expansion of the burnt forest area can significantly impact discharge rates and sediment yields larger fires increase flow rates and amplitudes and at the same time reduce the infiltration percolation rates of water in the soil by reducing the soil hydraulic conductivity thereby increasing runoff swat uses the musle equation to simulate the predicted post fire erosion rate at the sub basin scale the musle combines multiple factors including runoff soil type land use topography and land management practices the amount of sediment that was eroded and transported to the hydrological network of the sub catchment varied between 116 3 and 196 2 ton ha 1 for post fire conditions resulted in an almost 2 fold increase compared with no fire baseline scenario corresponding to an erosion rate increase of 95 9 ton ha 1 erosion rate and sediment yield analysis allow identifying areas with very high soil loss the highest sedimentation rates were predicted particularly at sub basins 5 13 and 51 the soil type or land topography land on steep slopes affects this soil loss and increases soil erosion and sediment loss under high runoff conditions according to the post fire scenario analysis the sedimentation rate of almost all distribution areas is very high this indicates that the selected sub catchment has different areas where soil erosion is a substantial issue nevertheless in the post fire scenarios the erosion rates would be above the tolerable soil losses limit verheijen et al 2009 and thus are an indication of lack of long term sustainability which can lead to the land degradation of the watershed since the erosion rates would be possibly higher than the soil formation rates based on the results obtained from this study in the post fire scenario the model predicts that soil loss and sedimentation will increase due to changes in land use cover and increased surface runoff after the fire the results help identify the perilous areas in the watershed that have a greater risk of erosion when forest fires occur accordingly to investigate of impacts of forest fires on sediment loads and more generally for planning mitigation strategies of adverse effects of fires on environmental socio economical or hydrological issues the hydrological model such as the one used in this study may be an efficacious method and helpful tool for decision makers to protect forests from intensive fires impacts the model can be used to design fire protection zones or exam the effect of implanting soft hydraulic conservation measures such as a linear vegetative filter after a fire to limit the impact of the fire on the sediment load this paper studied the impact of possible forest fires on sediment load at the catchment scale considering the spatial configuration of the burnt patches and the changes in different parameters of the model although the model has inferred actual results to consider the sediment load variations in the watershed in respect to the different burnt scenarios however additional research is also required to investigate the combined effects of ecological disturbances such as forest fires and their hydrological consequences on the sediment load under the future climate conditions climate model scenarios 4 conclusions change analysis and assessment of forest post fire hydrologic response are critical in developing a plan to remediate potential post fire flooding and erosion developing the physical conceptual hydrological models can be an efficacious and helpful tool for management practices and planning appropriate mitigation strategies to deal with the harmful effects of forest fires such as soil erosion sediment transfer to the downstream environment and degradation water quality this study investigated the potential of applying the swat rainfall runoff model to evaluate the hydrological consequences of forest fires and their effects on streamflow and use runoff and erosion models to analyze their respective impacts on sediment load under baseline pre fire and different burnt scenarios the model was calibrated using discharge and suspended sediment concentration observations at the stations during the periods to estimate post fire changes at the sub catchment scale compared to the baseline scenario the predictions and performance of the model in the calibration stage for discharge and sediment were high in respect to the nse objective function and were obtained as 0 85 and 0 63 respectively the sensitivity analysis results indicated that the most sensitive parameter of hydrological and sediment variables are the scs runoff curve number cn2 and the channel erodibility factor ch cov1 respectively for forest fires the model was implemented by changing the land use type cn value and soil erodibility factor as reported in the literature according to different post fire scenarios the hydrological and sedimentological changes in the selected sub catchment area after the forest fire are compared with the values obtained in the pre fire baseline scenario compared with the pre fire scenario the total water and sediment yield and soil erosion rate of the selected sub catchment in the post fire scenario increased significantly in the forest fire scenario with the highest fire spatial distribution the sediment yield increased by 6 5 times due to the high erosiveness of the excess surface runoff an increase of 14 5 in post fire the results of this study show that forest fires can have a serious negative impact on the water quality and sediment budget in the watershed this study suggested adapting a runoff and erosion model in the case of forest fires to analyze the effects of fires on sediment yield under various post fire scenarios understanding the consequences of wildfires on the provision of hydrological services may help decision makers choose better adaptation plans and post fire mitigation and recovery options to limit the impact of the fire on the sediment load and environmental issues hydrological impacts of future large fires under climate change according to climate model simulations will be used as further work to estimate the extent of hydrological and sedimentological changes that may occur after forest fires in the watershed credit authorship contribution statement rouhollah nasirzadehdizaji conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

24442,forest fires profoundly affect the nature of watershed responses to precipitation increases in runoff rate and volume and post fire sediment discharge a post fire watershed assessment to identify potential trouble spots for soil erosion and flooding can help land managers for decision making on deploy mitigation remediation measures and restoration action plans predicting the potential impact of fires on runoff and soil erosion requires distributed hydrological modeling methods this study used the soil and water assessment tool swat a rainfall runoff model to investigate the hydrological consequences of forest fires and their impact on sediment load under different burnt scenarios for the pre fire baseline scenario the watershed is calibrated by using the measured discharge and suspended sediment concentration data from the weather station during the time step to estimate post fire changes at the sub catchment scale the total water and sediment yield for the selected sub catchment in the post fire scenario with the highest spatial distribution of forest fire due to the excessive surface runoff an increase of 14 5 increased significantly resulted in 6 5 times increase in sediment yield the results obtained from the study indicate a significant increase in sediment transport into the stream in the post fire scenario a large volume of soil losses occurred during the time step in contrast due to removing trees and vegetation from the ground less evapotranspiration and infiltration occurred in selected sub catchment areas after forest fires in terms of watershed management understanding the consequences of forest fires on hydrological services will be an effective method for sediment budget control therefore applying the rainfall runoff and erosion models for the watershed with developing plausible forest fire scenarios can be a productive method to deal with the threats and hydrological risks such as soil erosion and sediment transfer to the downstream environment keywords wildfire land use change swat hydrological model erosion sediment yield watershed management 1 introduction erosion and related issues have always presented significant challenges in water resources management and development water consistently erodes sediment from the bed and banks of the reaches and carries it downriver through the catchment different phenomena such as ground deformations or landslides can also lead to the overrun of sediments in the river system and forming an unexpected build up of sediments deposition in addition to the naturally occurring sediment the impact of activities such as agriculture deforestation mining urbanization and road building on soil erosion rates is inevitable amundson et al 2015 hassan et al 2017 a significant cause of changes in sedimentation and erosion patterns is through hydrological modifications in the forests forests have a variety of ecological and hydrological benefits for example contributing to enhanced infiltration and water retention the filtration process in the soil column helps to improve water quality bredemeier 2010 furthermore the combined effects of vegetation litter cover and reduced water yield imply decreased erosion rates under forest cover baseline sedimentation reducing flood hazards and affecting both the soil quality and the downstream aquatic environments farley et al 2005 schüler 2006 therefore through the changes in hydrological processes deforestation and degradation of forests cause significant downstream impacts to the freshwater and estuarine environments increasing the amount of sediment iwata et al 2003 pattanayak and wendland 2007 forest fires are the most common way of degrading forests and their ecosystems forest fires seriously affect ecosystems and cause lost totally or partly forests positive effects i e soil erosion protection enrichment of soil properties certini 2005 decreasing hydrophobicity enhancing infiltration capacity and decreasing surface runoff martin and moody 2001 fires cause the destruction of vegetation coverage which have an important role in hydrological control in the forests such as helping to intercept rainfall reaching the ground or the canopy s buffering that reduces the rainfall intensity effect on subsoil helping to keep the soil structure forest fires clear the ground cover of vegetation and trees exposing the soil causing sediment to be entrained by the impact of raindrops reducing roughness altering hydrological connectivity fernández et al 2020 forming water repellency of soil debano 2000 ice et al 2004 and causing runoff to flow down slopes more quickly these changes in hillside conditions directly affect increment peak runoff volume sediment discharge and sedimentation rates therefore runoff under post fire conditions has a high potential for downstream flooding occurrence and sedimentation which will reduce the capacity of the reservoirs designed for drinking water supply robichaud et al 2000 the hydrological changes reduce the time for water to accumulate and infiltrate on the hillslope resulting in a higher runoff rate and higher sediment concentration and transport capacity canfield et al 2005 previous studies have evaluated the forest fires adverse effects and hydrological impacts on runoff and sediment loads earlier beaty 1994 was studied the impact of two consecutive forest fires between 1974 and 1982 on sediment transport in the river bed the study results showed that bed load transport increased by 20 times after the first forest fire and three times after the second fire and the particle sizes tended to increase during the investigation period with the dominance of 87 dissolved load the us department of agriculture forest service burned area emergency repair baer invested considerably in emergency watershed restoration measures after a fire to reduce flood runoff on site erosion off site sedimentation and hydrological damage robichaud et al 2000 various studies have revealed that the erosion impact was most significant in the first year after the fire and steadily declined in the following years and returned to baseline values within three to five years ewing 1996 moody and martin 2001 robichaud et al 2000 ryan et al 2011 found that the total suspended sediment load during the snowmelt runoff and summer storms were increased by 54 and 44 percent respectively for the first post fire year and the following year started to return to levels observed in the unburned watersheds and during the pre fire period a post fire watershed assessment to identify potential trouble spots for erosion and flooding may help land managers to deploy mitigation and restoration resources due to the inherent complexity and spatiality decision making requires distributed hydrological modeling methods the automated geospatial watershed assessment agwa is a geographic information system gis based tool that was developed and called an early distributed hydrological model to predict the potential impact of fire on runoff and erosion and to assess the watershed before and after the fire in the north of tucson arizona goodrich et al 2005 the results showed that the hydrological model of the fire affected area obtained from the agwa tool provides the ability to quickly assess the watershed after a fire to target the remedial work more effectively however two models the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and the kinematic runoff and erosion model kineros2 smith et al 1990 were incorporated into agwa to perform multi scale watershed assessments swat is a time continuous simulation model used to assess land cover climate change and management practices for example agriculture in large river basin scale watersheds although other hydrological soil erosion models have long been used to assess post fire runoff and soil erosion it was only recently that they began to be modeled in swat in some cases through a simulation of the hydrological responses after wildfires and their impact on the water supply of a large urban area carvalho santos et al 2019 havel et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 soulis et al 2021 in other cases by modifying key model parameters at different magnitudes and spatial scales of the fire conditions coupled with a land use update model to study the forest fires on the water quality and modeling river discharge pattern influenced from a forest fire basso et al 2020 or most recently modeling forest fire scenarios to investigate its impact on sediment loads thomas et al 2021 this study investigates the potential of applying the swat hydrological model to examine the impact of forest fires on sediment load the purpose of this study is to evaluate the hydrological consequences of forest fires and their effects on streamflow and use runoff and erosion models to analyze their respective impacts on sediment load under different burnt scenarios 2 material and methods within the context of this work we investigated the impact of forest fires on streamflow discharge and sediment yield at sub catchment scale to demonstrate the total contribution of the current study we outline the following three main aspects 1 there are no hydrological model studies available in the study area in the existing literature and the current research will fill this gap in the literature 2 since there are two main water regulator stations to supply water to mega city istanbul examining and identifying existing and possible sediment resources in the watershed is critical for decision makers the results provide essential clues for developing recommendations to reduce sediment transport improve water quality maintain resources and sustainable management 3 two dams the sungurlu and osmangazi dams are planned on streams in the basin the results obtained from this study guide the dam project design in terms of economy and environment hence reductions in sediment yield in their basins extend the life of dams and reduce the dead volume in reservoirs by applying the rainfall runoff model of the göksu çanakdere rivers basin we designed wildfire scenarios similar to previously observed fires in the basin to provide relevant mitigation strategies to deal with natural threats and hydrological risks therefore we chose to use measured data rainfall discharge suspended sediment concentration and use existing catchment characteristics land use soil and topography to design forest fire scenarios 2 1 site description the göksu çanakdere rivers basin 40 59ˮ n 29 51ˮ e with an area of approximately 800 km2 is in northeast of istanbul and west of kocaeli province turkey reaching into the black sea fig 1 the climate of the black sea region the balkans and anatolia characterizes its climate properties the two main tributaries in the study area are göksu and çanakdere with a total length of 122 and 77 km respectively the geological types include clay limestone sandy limestone sandstone and limestone citiroglu et al 2011 the topographic pattern is partly undulating ranging from 1 to 649 m the annual temperatures range from 8 c to 15 c and annual rainfall ranges from 350 to 1400 mm aksoy et al 2010 the watershed receives an average annual rainfall of about 815 mm and an average annual temperature of about 14 8 c state meteorological service mgm flow and suspended sediment data were purchased from dsi turkish state of hydraulics which was collected from rain gage stations located in major rivers the total rainfall drainage basin area for collecting data from these two stations is 782 km2 the predominant land use type in the watershed is agriculture 55 2 and forest 43 6 the largest forest area is in the central part of the watershed between istanbul and kocaeli province mainly covering pure oak stands forests with the rest being mixed stands forest species atalay 1986 these properties affect the likelihood that the area may be burned and the anticipated potential fire behavior the presence of trees shrubs flammable vegetation and other potential fuels topography and climate change impacts are vital factors that create favorable conditions for wildfires due to the potential environmental factors leading to the fire in the study area it may spread quickly and it can be tough to prevent its spread in addition most areas of main rivers surrounded by forests significantly impact water quality and sedimentation rate after a fire event therefore in this study it considered that the fire intensity of the forest fire scenario is very high 2 2 field surveys in site measurements were conducted to obtain detailed information on land use cover and structure to improve the accuracy of determining the required parameters during the modeling process since most land use is dominated by the agricultural activities and due to the basins properties such as the topology soil type the river s geomorphological characteristics and the climate condition of the area the sediment dynamics and rates are high in this watershed a fast hydrological response characterizes the catchment and flash floods occur within a few hours causing the water body to transport a large amount of sediment according to the results obtained by the dynamic erosion model and monitoring system demis cem 2018 the sediment yield per unit area of the göksu çanakdere rivers basin ranges from 6 92 to 9 35 ton ha 1 which is affected by water erosion in the drainage area of this watershed between 305 103 to 332 103 tons of soil are displaced annually because of water erosion cem 2018 field studies were carried out also to ensure that the model created by determining the characteristics of the basin better reflects the actual situation in addition the factors affecting the formation of sediments in the basin were determined and their influence and importance level were studied daily flow rate and water level and velocity were automatically collected in the flow and observation stations by dsi screening analysis is performed in a laboratory environment to determine the particle distribution and diameter of samples collected from the bottom of the creek using a multifunctional sediment collection mechanism 2 3 forest fires scenarios this study was conducted in two phases the first phase corresponds to the baseline scenario where the model is calibrated and validated based on the current land use and meteorological data with no forest fire during the period 2005 2017 for the first scenario the corresponding rainfall event characteristics and model parameters did not change in the second phase of the study different forest fire scenarios table 1 were performed to analyze the effect of fires on flow rates and sediment fluxes in these scenarios homogeneous forest patches with 25 50 and 100 burnt forest areas in relative to the area of baseline scenario wildfire prone area as shown in fig 1 are defined for use in the model as shown in fig 2 c b and d in this step some model inputs such as land use type and cn curve number value were changed to evaluate the forest fires impacts 2 4 swat hydrological model the swat model is a physical conceptual and the semi distributed model that operates on daily or sub daily time steps and process based time continuous simulation it can run under different management conditions over extended periods in small to large complex watersheds divided into hydrological response units according to dem soil and land use types the model developed to predict the effects of different management practices on hydrological and water quality processes sediment yield and pollution loading yen et al 2014 and is also used to analyze the impact of climate soil vegetation and agricultural activities on the flow and chemical yields in watersheds swat is being applied to simulate streamflow sediment and nutrient transport within a watershed and to search for a good planning strategy which depends to a large extent on the integrated watershed model de vente et al 2013 in addition it has several sub models to calculate various components such as evapotranspiration flow routing and loss in the swat model the watershed is subdivided into multiple sub basins and each sub basin is further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus each hru comprises a unique and homogeneous combination of land use management topographical and soil characteristics in each sub basin arnold et al 2012 water balance is the driving force behind all processes in swat as it affects plant growth and the movement of sediments nutrients pesticides and pathogens water balance is a function of inputs driven by climates such as daily precipitation maximum minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity the hydrological simulation of the watershed is divided into the land phase and the in stream or routing phase arnold et al 2012 the land phase baselines the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticides in the main channel in each sub basin while the routing phase deals with the movement of water and sediments through the basin s channel network to the outlet neitsch et al 2011 swat simulated hydrological processes are including of canopy storage infiltration surface runoff evapotranspiration et lateral flow percolation groundwater flow tile drainage water redistribution within the soil profile pumped consumption use if any return flow and recharge by infiltration from surface waters ponds and tributaries all water balance processes in the same hru are consistent the hydrologic cycle modeled by swat relies on the water balance eq 1 neitsch et al 2005 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where the final soil water content s w t in mm at the simulation time t in days is obtained from the sum of s w 0 in mm the initial soil water content on day i and the amount of total precipitation r d a y in mm on day i when the total losses on day i including the amount of surface runoff q s u r f in mm the amount of evapotranspiration e a in mm the amount of water that percolates from the soil profile w s e e p in mm and the amount of return flow q g w in mm are subtracted from the total precipitation once the water application rate to the surface exceeds the infiltration rate of surface runoff the surface runoff will occur when the water reaches dry soil the permeability is usually very high but the permeability decreases as the soil gets wet if the surface water ratio is higher than the permeability the surface depressions begin to fill surface runoff will occur once all surface depressions are filled by water and the application rate continues to be higher than the permeability rate to estimate surface runoff the swat model uses the method of the scs cn procedure usda soil conservation service usda 1972 and the green and ampt green and ampt 1911 infiltration method in this study the scs cn method was used to estimate surface runoff which is a function of the soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions as described in eq 2 neitsch et al 2005 2 q s u r f r d a y 0 2 s 2 r d a y 0 8 s where q s u r f is the accumulated runoff or excess rainfall in mm and r d a y is the rainfall depth in the day in mm s is the retention parameter in mm defined by eq 3 neitsch et al 2005 3 s 25 4 100 c n 10 to estimate potential evapotranspiration the model recommends three methods including penman monteith monteith 1965 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 and priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 the penman monteith method requires the input of solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity the priestley taylor method requires solar radiation and air temperature while the hargreaves method only requires air temperature as model input briak et al 2016 yebdri et al 2007 in the swat model the erosion of each hru and the sediment yield from subbasins is predicted with the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 which is calculated as follows 4 s e d 11 8 q s u r f q p e a k a r e a h r u 0 56 k u s l e c u s l e p u s l e l s u s l e c f r g where s e d is the sediment yield to the stream network at the outlet on a given day metric tons q s u r f is the surface runoff

a soil property available from the universal soil loss equation usle c u s l e is the usle cover crop vegetation management factor and can be derived from land cover data p u s l e is the usle support conservation practice factor the erosion baseline practice factor which is a field specific value l s u s l e is the usle topographic slope length gradient factor and c f r g is the coarse fragment factor the scale factor values of 11 8 and 0 56 are parameters associated with the location and were used to calibrate the model in the derivation of musle adegede and mbajiorgu 2019 j williams 1975 the channel s sediment routing consists of the channel s degradation by means of stream power and the deposit in the channel through the fall velocity channel degradation is regulated using usle soil erodibility and channel cover factor arnold et al 1995 williams 1980 swat employs manning s equation to determine flow rate and velocity water is routed through the channel network using the muskingum river routing method and the variable storage routing method both variations of the kinematic wave model neitsch et al 2005 2 5 model set up as a physically based hydrological model swat requires a large amount of input data to represent the spatial variability of the primary runoff sediment yield baseline characteristics such as soil land use cover topography river channels and reservoirs to avoid the parameter uncertainty problems in the results and to depend on the availability of data and computation resources the model was set up to derive the distribution characteristics of sediment yield and erosion and baseline the sensitive parameters of the runoff and sediment routing process in the study basin spatial data including digital elevation model dem land use maps soil maps and meteorological data as mandatory inputs are used in the preprocessing phase for the swat model the methods used to prepare watershed primary input data for the swat hydrological model are described below 2 5 1 topographic map dem is used to determine terrain attributes such as elevation slope and aspect extraction of flow direction flow accumulation flow network generation and watershed and sub basins delineation process therefore dem is often used to refer to any digital representation of a terrain surface and is the simplest form of digital representation topographic parameters such as overland slope channel slope and river length both the primary and tributary rivers are also the main geomorphic parameter derived from the dem hence the quality of the remote sensing derived dem used in hydrological processing directly affects the model s accuracy for this reason the radiometrically terrain corrected rtc high resolution rt1 dem products alaska satellite facility asf 2015 with a pixel spacing of 12 5 m spatial resolution in geotiff format was used for hydrological modeling in this study in the swat model pre defined watersheds and existing river network data sets are used for delineating the watersheds and generating watershed configurations quantum gis qgis development team 2021 an open source geographical information system gis software has been used as an interface and platform for the swat process and spatial analysis 2 5 2 land use cover map land use defines the permanent types of land use in a watershed land use and vegetation changes affect the water cycle and their impact is a function of plant cover density and plant species morphology the land use cover type is mainly agricultural and forest land in the study site the land use cover map was obtained from the corine land cover clc 2018 dataset of the european union copernicus land monitoring service to generate hydrological response units hru for each sub basin area as shown in fig 2 a the land use cover is partitioned into 16 categories and converted to swat s land use classification code 2 5 3 soil map the soil map was obtained from the soil map of the turkish dataset prepared by an interdisciplinary team composed of soil scientists geologists geomorphologists and gis experts cullu et al 2018 the main soil types in the study area are cambisols and leptosols which were reclassified according to the soil texture and hydrological soil groups fao soil classification provided by the european commission and the european soil bureau network kük and burgess 2010 cambisol is related to leptosols and kastanozems and is usually located on the northern edge of calcisols widespread in semi arid areas on slopes and eroded terrains occupied by extensive forests and steppes ntouros et al 2009 2 5 4 hydrological and meteorological data thirteen hydrological years 2005 to 2017 were used to simulate the swat model two water years 2005 and 2006 were used to get the system hydrology to warm up which enabled the model to cycle multiple times to minimize the effects of the user s estimates of initial state variables zhang et al 2008 the 7 year 2007 2013 data is used for calibration and the 4 year 2014 2017 data is used for verification the trend analysis of rainfall data and mean and standard deviation methods were used to reduce inhomogeneities of the datasets and the over or under estimation of the model due to the dry and wet years in data selected for calibration and validation to this end the datasets selected for calibration and validation are expected to have a close mean and standard deviation values the hydrological and meteorological data are acquired from the dsi turkish state of hydraulics and mgm state meteorological service climatic data including daily precipitation minimum maximum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from meteorological stations for the model inputs global weather data downloaded from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr https globalweather tamu edu and world weather for water data service w3s https www uoguelph ca watershed w3s to evaluate the accuracy of the collected meteorological data dile and srinivasan 2014 observed streamflow and sediment datasets collected from the göksu and çanakdere rain gage stations are used for model calibration and verification 2 6 optimization algorithms due to the significant uncertainties in hydrological simulations the definition and quantification of model uncertainties have become the subject of many studies the different optimization algorithms converge to different calibrated parameter ranges and each finds a different solution at different locations in the parameter spaces with more or less the same discharge results yang et al 2007 in this study the sequence uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 algorithm was used to calibrate the swat model due to the availability of many parameters in the water balance modeling and having the ability to implement a combined calibration uncertainty analysis parameter uncertainty is calculated based on all input and output sources such as the uncertainty of input rainfall data land use and soil types parameters and the observation data in sufi 2 the simulation uncertainty is quantified by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and referred to as the p factor the 95ppu is calculated at the 2 5 lower95ppu and 97 5 upper95ppu levels of the cumulative distribution function of the output variable obtained from the latin hypercube sampling method disallowing 5 of the very bad simulations the relative width of the 95 probability band is the r factor value the p factor of 1 and the r factor of 0 are simulations that correspond precisely to the measured data arnold et al 2012 2 7 model performance evaluation the model evaluation was performed based on the calibration and validation with a comparison of the observed and simulated flow and sediment loads to constrain the model and achieve more robust characterizations of the land and the stream phases over a period the calibration and validation of process based distributed hydrological models are often challenging due to the high data requirements to support complexity difficulty in data acquisition scarcity of observed data and limited resources three model evaluation methods based on error statistics were used as the objective functions to determine the model performance in this study the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and percent bias pbias were used as statistical and graphical model evaluation techniques moriasi et al 2007 the values of r2 nse and pbias are determined by eqs 5

represent measured or simulated and i is the i t h measured or simulated data 2 8 conceptual framework the conceptual schema of the main steps such as the inputs and fitting process of the swat model the calibration and verification of the model and the output analysis is shown in fig 3 the terrain model dem land use and soil maps and climate data are the main inputs to the swat models a and b to

assessment the performance of the swat model was evaluated in simulating streamflow in the göksu çanakdere rivers basin using 13 years for calibration and validation autocalibration and validation and uncertainty analysis of the model were performed for monthly periods using sufi 2 method within swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty procedures abbaspour et al 2000 the sufi 2 algorithm maps all the uncertainties of the parameters to a uniform distribution or range by fixing the parameters to the best values obtained through preliminary runs most of the measured data within the model s 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu will be captured in the iterative process in this study 13 relative sensitivity value parameters were evaluated and determined during the parameter estimation process these variables parameters descriptions uncertainty ranges and fitted values are provided in table 2 since the hydrological model studies for the watershed in the study area are not available in the existing literature hence selecting sensitivity parameters was a challenging issue to this end field surveys were carried out to collect detailed information on land use cover and structure to improve the accuracy of determining the required parameters during the modeling process in addition an extensive literature review was conducted to obtain source information on the sensitivity parameters of hydrological models used in adjacent watersheds or watersheds that were geographically close to the study area the model was calibrated using the observed flow from 2005 to 2013 and it was validated from 2014 to 2017 for calibration two years are used as the warm up period for the model for each iteration of the discharge calibration 2000 simulations were run after each iteration the range of parameters were modified and narrowed down based on the program s abbaspour et al 2007 suggested values and initial limits in model calibration after obtaining reasonable flow parameters and their value ranges from the final simulation of the model the values were used without any modification for the model validation to evaluate the model s performance with calibrated parameters for model validation the same hydrological parameters and value ranges were used to simulate the hydrological functions of the basin during another period 2014 to 2017 that was not used in the calibration phase sensitivity analysis results indicated that the most sensitive parameter of hydrological parameters was the scs runoff curve number cn2 the scs cn soil conservation service curve number method is an empirical equation developed by the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service used to predict direct surface runoff for a given rainfall event mishra et al 2019 in scs cn runoff was estimated with the appropriate cn for antecedent moisture condition i e cn1 dry condition cn2 average condition or cn3 wet condition the second group of parameters with similar significance was the base flow alpha factor alpha bf the groundwater delay gw delay and the threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer gwqmn other parameters such as the available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc the manning s value for the main channel ch n2 the depth from the soil surface to the bottom of the layer soil z and the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity soil k were identified as slightly significant 3 2 sediment yield assessment the suspended sediment values measured at two stations are used for sediment model calibration and verification similarly the calibration and validation model for discharge rate the observed suspended sediment data are divided into two parts from 2005 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2017 to use model calibration and validation for the sediment rate respectively the acceptable ranges of swat parameters and the values chosen for this study which were obtained after several simulations in swat cup are shown in table 2 sediment parameters sensitivity analysis indicated that the most important parameters were the channel erodibility factor ch cov1 followed by the exponent parameter for calculating the channel sediment routing spexp the average slope length slsubbsn the linear parameter for calculating the channel sediment routing spcon the soil erodibility factor in usle usle k and the usle support practice factor usle p 3 3 swat model performance in this study r2 nse and pbias as objective functions were used to evaluate the calibration validation performance between the observed data and the model predictions two indices the p factor ranges 0 to 1 and the r factor ranges 0 to were used to judge the goodness and strength of the uncertainty performance the p factor is the percentage of data captured by the 95ppu band and the r factor is the average thickness of the uncertainty band divided by the standard deviation of the related measured variable abbaspour et al 2007 the goodness of fitting between the simulated and the observed discharge for each gauged station was computed for the calibration and validation periods the p factor and the r factor indices are used to assess the model output uncertainty of the flow and sediment loads the performance of the swat model simulation with monthly time steps is obtained according to the recommended assessment criteria moriasi et al 2007 the nse values for flow and sediment were obtained as 0 85 and 0 63 for calibration and 0 94 and 0 42 for validation periods respectively model predictions of flow and sediment loads were also evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination r2 0 86 and r2 0 65 and pbias 5 8 and 1 3 for calibration periods respectively although the flow model performed well the consistency between the measured and simulated sediment concentrations during the validation period was not satisfactory nse 0 5 however for the validation period higher performance values of the flow model r2 0 94 and good sediment model performance r2 0 58 were obtained which indicates that the estimation of the research process is favored the performance of the model simulations is determined based on the statistical scales obtained by eqs 5 to 7 and the results are shown in table 3 the scatter plot and the obtained r2 values for discharge and sediment simulations and observations during calibration and validation periods to identify correlations between flow and suspended sediment are shown in fig 4 in addition to the quantitative statistics table 3 fig 5 also provides an intuitive comparison of the graphical representations of calibration and uncertainty analysis indicating the best simulated flow rate and sediment yield with measured data and the 95 uncertainty area predicted by the model calibration and validation of the swat model in the basin through the sufi 2 method was performed for monthly flow rates and sediment concentration records from the hydrometric stations by comparison with the flow rates and sediment concentration of the simulated values over 13 years period the results show that the model successfully simulates the flow rate and sediment concentration the linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between monthly measured flow and suspended sediment 2005 2017 it is worth noting that the gap between the monthly measured values for sediment concentration was filled by applying the interpolation method and finding the relation between the sediment as the dependent variable and the discharge as the independent variable in the linear regression model 3 4 estimation of forest fire consequences on flow and sediment yield the forest patches were defined and burnt according to the scenarios defined in table 1 resulting in different micro basins burnt locations and areas affected by simulated fires in the göksu çanakdere rivers basin as shown in fig 2 b c and d according to the scenarios under consideration the resulting burnt area is approaching between 3000 and 12 000 hectares corresponding to the model run from the most minor burnt patch i e scenario 1 to the most giant burnt patch i e scenario 3 respectively forest fires have affected the catchment area occupying an average of 8 5 of the watershed area and up to 15 to conduct post fire scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of forest fires on discharge and sediment some model inputs such as land use type cn value and soil erodibility factor k factor have been changed the cn method is often used in hydrology to predict runoff or infiltration caused by excessive rainfall based on land use and soil type and used to address post fire enhanced hydrological response rodrigues et al 2019 likewise k factor is used to estimate the sensitivity of soil to erosion by an external force or energy renard et al 1997 for burnt patches and lands overlapped by burnt area distribution k factor increases by 0 016 then for converting into the swat unit the k factor value is divided by 0 1317 fernández et al 2010 following the recommendations of havel et al 2018 cn is increased by 15 for burnt areas those changes were introduced to the swat database to create new land use and soil classes finally the model was re run for each scenario with new inputs and parameters to evaluate discharge and sediment variables according to different forest burnt scenarios in the annual time step the water balance components are summarized according to the model results of all scenarios as shown in fig 6 the model output indicates that in scenario 3 in comparing without forest fires baseline scenario the average annual total water yield i e the total amount of surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow of the burnt sub catchment increased by 14 5 following the increase in water yield and due to the high erosiveness ability of excessive surface runoff the sediment yield after the forest fire has increased by 1 5 to 3 5 fold compared to the sediment yield prior to the burnt time in the burnt scenario 3 the sediment yield raised to 6 5 fold that before the forest fire and in the baseline model fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the total annual amounts of water water yield that leaves the sub basins and contribute to streamflow in the reach before baseline and after the burnt scenarios 1 to 3 within the time step for the selected sub catchment the progressive increase of burnt area brings along a gradual increase in the flow rates and the maximum runoff occurs when fire consumes the significant portion of selected forest and removal of ground vegetation cover in the post fire conditions surface flow increased by about 70 from 151 8 mm to 256 6 mm while infiltration rates decreased 37 compared with the baseline scenario accordingly water yield increase after the fire effect is the result of the higher surface runoff 14 5 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the total annual amounts of transported sediment from the subbasin sediment yield by surface runoff into the reach before baseline and after the burnt scenarios 1 to 3 for the selected sub catchment within the time step in contrast less evapotranspiration and percolation have occurred after forest fire due to removing trees and vegetation from the ground this change is reasoned by the decrease in soil permeability following the forest fire which is achieved by increasing the cn value in the burned areas therefore the soil is lesser permeable and lesser infiltration will occur resulting from increasing the peak flows in the post fire scenarios the decreases in percolation and evapotranspiration values in the post fire scenario with the maximum burnt area at selected sub catchment was obtained at 37 and 9 respectively fig 9 and fig 10 show the spatial distribution of the total annual amounts of percolation and evapotranspiration before baseline and after the burnt scenarios 1 to 3 for the selected sub catchment within the time step the simulation output of the baseline no forest fire and burnt scenarios were further analyzed and compared to quantify the change in the average annual hydrological budget caused by the fire during the simulation period for the selected sub watershed of the study area table 4 the results show that the hydrological budget has significantly changed on the sub basins and the watershed scale in post fire periods compared with the baseline scenario a large amount of soil loss and a significant increase in the amount of sediment transported into the stream were observed within the time step correspondingly the total biomass i e above ground and roots and leaf area index dropped sharply in the post fire scenario directly affecting evapotranspiration and its reduction rainfall runoff discharge and sediment rates are model variables that have linear interaction with each other forest fires force changes in land use cover types i e conversion of forests to bare land and affect model variables differently it removes the ground cover from trees and vegetation helping quick move the raindrops on the ground and changing it to the surface runoff degrading the soil while moving to the downstream and transporting the degraded soil i e sediment into the reach and depositing in the river or discharges it into the sea the relationship between the monthly measured discharge and simulated surface runoff rainfall and simulated sediment yield in pre fire baseline and post fire scenarios 1 to 3 for the sub catchment area are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the results indicate that the expansion of the burnt forest area can significantly impact discharge rates and sediment yields larger fires increase flow rates and amplitudes and at the same time reduce the infiltration percolation rates of water in the soil by reducing the soil hydraulic conductivity thereby increasing runoff swat uses the musle equation to simulate the predicted post fire erosion rate at the sub basin scale the musle combines multiple factors including runoff soil type land use topography and land management practices the amount of sediment that was eroded and transported to the hydrological network of the sub catchment varied between 116 3 and 196 2 ton ha 1 for post fire conditions resulted in an almost 2 fold increase compared with no fire baseline scenario corresponding to an erosion rate increase of 95 9 ton ha 1 erosion rate and sediment yield analysis allow identifying areas with very high soil loss the highest sedimentation rates were predicted particularly at sub basins 5 13 and 51 the soil type or land topography land on steep slopes affects this soil loss and increases soil erosion and sediment loss under high runoff conditions according to the post fire scenario analysis the sedimentation rate of almost all distribution areas is very high this indicates that the selected sub catchment has different areas where soil erosion is a substantial issue nevertheless in the post fire scenarios the erosion rates would be above the tolerable soil losses limit verheijen et al 2009 and thus are an indication of lack of long term sustainability which can lead to the land degradation of the watershed since the erosion rates would be possibly higher than the soil formation rates based on the results obtained from this study in the post fire scenario the model predicts that soil loss and sedimentation will increase due to changes in land use cover and increased surface runoff after the fire the results help identify the perilous areas in the watershed that have a greater risk of erosion when forest fires occur accordingly to investigate of impacts of forest fires on sediment loads and more generally for planning mitigation strategies of adverse effects of fires on environmental socio economical or hydrological issues the hydrological model such as the one used in this study may be an efficacious method and helpful tool for decision makers to protect forests from intensive fires impacts the model can be used to design fire protection zones or exam the effect of implanting soft hydraulic conservation measures such as a linear vegetative filter after a fire to limit the impact of the fire on the sediment load this paper studied the impact of possible forest fires on sediment load at the catchment scale considering the spatial configuration of the burnt patches and the changes in different parameters of the model although the model has inferred actual results to consider the sediment load variations in the watershed in respect to the different burnt scenarios however additional research is also required to investigate the combined effects of ecological disturbances such as forest fires and their hydrological consequences on the sediment load under the future climate conditions climate model scenarios 4 conclusions change analysis and assessment of forest post fire hydrologic response are critical in developing a plan to remediate potential post fire flooding and erosion developing the physical conceptual hydrological models can be an efficacious and helpful tool for management practices and planning appropriate mitigation strategies to deal with the harmful effects of forest fires such as soil erosion sediment transfer to the downstream environment and degradation water quality this study investigated the potential of applying the swat rainfall runoff model to evaluate the hydrological consequences of forest fires and their effects on streamflow and use runoff and erosion models to analyze their respective impacts on sediment load under baseline pre fire and different burnt scenarios the model was calibrated using discharge and suspended sediment concentration observations at the stations during the periods to estimate post fire changes at the sub catchment scale compared to the baseline scenario the predictions and performance of the model in the calibration stage for discharge and sediment were high in respect to the nse objective function and were obtained as 0 85 and 0 63 respectively the sensitivity analysis results indicated that the most sensitive parameter of hydrological and sediment variables are the scs runoff curve number cn2 and the channel erodibility factor ch cov1 respectively for forest fires the model was implemented by changing the land use type cn value and soil erodibility factor as reported in the literature according to different post fire scenarios the hydrological and sedimentological changes in the selected sub catchment area after the forest fire are compared with the values obtained in the pre fire baseline scenario compared with the pre fire scenario the total water and sediment yield and soil erosion rate of the selected sub catchment in the post fire scenario increased significantly in the forest fire scenario with the highest fire spatial distribution the sediment yield increased by 6 5 times due to the high erosiveness of the excess surface runoff an increase of 14 5 in post fire the results of this study show that forest fires can have a serious negative impact on the water quality and sediment budget in the watershed this study suggested adapting a runoff and erosion model in the case of forest fires to analyze the effects of fires on sediment yield under various post fire scenarios understanding the consequences of wildfires on the provision of hydrological services may help decision makers choose better adaptation plans and post fire mitigation and recovery options to limit the impact of the fire on the sediment load and environmental issues hydrological impacts of future large fires under climate change according to climate model simulations will be used as further work to estimate the extent of hydrological and sedimentological changes that may occur after forest fires in the watershed credit authorship contribution statement rouhollah nasirzadehdizaji conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

24443,it is critical to predict urban growth for understanding of urbanization process traditional urban ca mainly focused on discovery of conversion rules from a series of biophysical and social economic factors many varying factors are generally treated as constant and the simulation result is none of great reference value for decision making in order to eliminate these limitations an easy cellular automata easyca was proposed with integration of seed searching and clone stamp growth strategy it aims to provide feasible scenario analysis for decision making only four steady variables namely distance to current urban patches difficulty coefficient of land conversion density of urban land and topographic conditions were applied to estimate urban suitability policy intervention was further considered for adjustment of urban suitability and patch growth templates were collected as clone stamps for updating the status of cells during iteration this easyca was then tested with example area of guangzhou city located in the pearl river delta of china accuracy indices of averaged fuzzy kappa fuzzyk and figure of merit fom were calculated with the values of 0 8419 and 0 2874 respectively and both of them were higher than those from cell growth based ca indicating that easyca is efficient in utility and reliability comparison analysis verified that few steady variables can obtain reliable result of urban suitability and it is greatly necessary to integrate policy intervention into estimation of urban growth probability and the simulation pattern in 2035 is maximally close to actual status compared with the planning layout it shows that easyca is potentially applicable and effective for planning practices in metropolitan areas keywords urban growth simulation

contributed to understanding the urbanization process and promoting sustainable urban development yu et al 2019 domingo et al 2021 hence developing effective simulation models to predict urban growth in the future can better serve the promotion of urbanization to gain insight into urban growth scenario a series of models have been extensively developed and applied by researchers in the past decades santé et al 2010 aburas et al 2016 gonzález méndez et al 2021 among these models cellular automata ca model has been widely applied due to its structural flexibility and bottom up simulation mechanism mustafa et al 2017 guzman et al 2020 this makes it have the ability to effectively simulate plot based process of land use cover change usually there are two main components for urban growth simulation by using ca as follows the first one is the quantitative demand of urban land in the future and the second one is to determine which units will be urbanized under this quantitative demand gharaibeh et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in general urban suitability has been regarded as the basic element for discovering the conversion rules and then determining the distribution of increased urban lands and there are hundreds and millions of cells involved in the data processing it is impossible to define a conversion rule for each unit and then estimating urban suitability from a series of spatial factors has been commonly implemented in spatial allocation module parry et al 2018 xu et al 2018 there are so many spatial factors e g elevation slope distance to roads and built up areas influencing urban growth for instance the land plots under the conditions of flat terrain convenient transportation and proximity to existing cities are generally more likely to be converted into urban lands the contribution of each factor is required to be first confirmed to estimate the contribution of each selected factor for calculating urban suitability a series of methods including statistical models machine learning models and tree based models have been widely used shafizadeh moghadam et al 2017 therein models such as spatial logistic regression ma et al 2020 deep learning xing et al 2020 random forest zhou et al 2020 have been especially and commonly popular in suitability estimation some research also compared the performance of different methods and validate their reasonability in the estimation of urban suitability however a series of volatile variables may continue to change in the space no matter what method is used it is difficult to confirm driving effect on surrounding local regions from volatile variables for example a new expressway may be planned and built at some point in the future it will correspondingly result in the variation of growth direction this variation cannot be discovered and the validation accuracy of ca model is actually none meaningful just with the samples selected from historical dataset ahmadzai 2020 in actual some variables will keep invariant over time that is their attributes and locations will be relatively stable in a medium long time we defined these as steady variables in this study if urban suitability can be estimated from those steady variables then the simulation validation with historical samples can be meaningfully for example some research use distance to built up area for extrapolating urban growth and found distance to built up as a single factor is as powerful as all variables shafizadeh moghadam et al 2021 this validated that it is feasible to simulate urban growth with steady variables however as for medium and long term simulation of urban growth only considering distance to built up will result in marginal expansion newly increased urban land will aggregate around current built up over large urban patches will be generated in the simulation pattern and local spatial heterogeneity cannot well be revealed most importantly the mode of urban growth will not always follow the historical trend especially during the period of medium to long term planning previous researches have validated that spatial constrains and policy interventions from the government may change the growth mode particularly in china for example the ecological sensitive areas are usually not allowed for urban growth liao et al 2019 government may design several development centers to meet the demand of urbanization in land use and social economy the influence on the evolution mode from these factors cannot be reflected in the simulation with only distance to built up and other spatial variables it is greatly necessary to consider the adjustment of urban suitability from planning interventions into the simulation mechanism under this situation the main task of ca is how to derive accurate evolution pattern from steady variables and policy interventions almost all the ca simulations have been performed on the raster or vector units to obtain the evolution patterns from urban suitability barreira gonzález et al 2015 most studies have focused on how to get growth patches of a certain size from urban suitability and aim to make the simulation patten better in conformity with practical situation previous studies have introduced a patchy growth mechanism into the raster based ca to meet such goal as can as possible chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 and the monte carlo algorithm was adopted to scatter the seeds into the space for generating the urban patches through the expansion around those seeds chen et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in this way the shape quantity and pattern of urban patches is mainly determined by the set threshold of urban patch size and the growth probability of the cells around the seeds this may result in the increased urban patches almost growing around the scattered seeds and also exhibiting a marginal expansion mode the whole simulation process is relatively complicated and some time consuming and the local simulation patterns may be yet unreasonable compared with the actual conditions therefore developing an easier and more rational way to get the urban patches from ca simulation is greatly expected for medium and long term decision making in this study it aims to introduce an easy evolution mode to improve ca model and obtain more realistic result of urban growth in metropolitan areas the improved ca is accordingly named as easyca we try to answer the following questions 1 what steady variables can be used to estimate urban suitability 2 is the consideration of policy interventions necessary for the adjustment of urban suitability in metropolitan areas 3 what evolution rules can be efficiently used to generate reasonable urban patches this article is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the study area and datasets used for the implementation of easyca then in section 3 we describe the main framework of easyca in section 4 we perform the easyca on the study area and validate its efficiency after that we discuss the advantages of easyca and draw conclusions about this study 2 materials 2 1 study area to calibrate and validate easyca guangzhou city was chosen as the study area it is a fast developing metropolitan area located in the peral river delta of china bounded by latitudes 22 26 and 23 56 n and longitudes 112 57 and 114 03 e covering an area of 7434 4 km2 since the policy of reform and opening up promulgated in 1978 guangzhou has experienced massive and rapid urban growth meng et al 2020 by the end of 2020 the permanent resident population and gdp has already exceeded 18 7 million and 2 5 trillion cny respectively guangzhou bureau of statistics 2021 for future urban growth guangzhou will mainly develop the northern eastern and southern part due to the high development density of the central part main center including yuexiu liwan tianhe and haizhu district in addition the chinese government has proposed a national strategy named guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba in 2019 and guangzhou will be facing a new development opportunity hui et al 2020 nansha district has been set as a vice center by the government of guangzhou considering that it is located in the geometric center of gba therefore there is no way around the fact that guangzhou s future urban growth will not completely follow the historical development pattern developing a more reasonable ca model for the simulation of urban growth in guangzhou is crucial to make spatial planning policy 2 2 dataset and spatial variables landsat 5 tm landsat 8 oli images and digital elevation model dem were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn to provide basic materials for the easyca model all the raster datasets were projected into wgs 1984 utm zone 49 n with a resolution of 30 m 30 m six categories of land use namely urban cultivated land forest grass water and unused land were classified from landsat images collected in 1995 2005 and 2015 by using support vector machine method embedded in envi environment for visualizing images software the overall classification accuracy of urban land is about 88 by the comparison with reference samples that were manually and randomly interpreted from high resolution images of 0 5 m acquired in google earth fig 1 in previous research a series of biophysical and social economic factors were introduced for land suitability evaluation natural conditions namely elevation and slope soil quality kernel density of points of interest poi and several proximity based variables have been generally used gharaibeh et al 2020 guzman et al 2020 xing et al 2020 as mentioned before the relationship between the urban suitability and many social economic factors may be dynamic whereas some steady variables keep relatively stable with the process of urban growth with this consideration only four steady variables were used to evaluate urban suitability fig 2 a d they include 1 terrain conditions measured with the digital elevation model dem which was downloaded from https www gscloud cn 2 distance to urban patches in 1995 3 transformation coefficient it is used to measure the conversion cost of newly increased urban land from other land use it can be approximately estimated according to the land expropriation standard set by the government 4 structure of the urban landscape in 1995 it was measured by the density of urban patches in this study on the other hand policy interventions and ecological constraints were considered and quantitatively converted into probabilities to adjust the urban suitability in this study the regions of the nature reserves public parks rivers great mountains as well as other protected areas were strictly prevented from urban growth these space units were marked as 0 we assigned the other space units with different values of urban development priority according to the government s planning policy these values that is the development probability were set with 0 2 0 5 and 1 in terms of the urban development priority from low to high and they were actually varied with the adjustment of the government s development strategy fig 2 e for example the development probability of nansha district in the years before 2015 was assigned as the value of 0 5 considering that it was not regarded as the vice center during that time and can be then improved from 0 5 to 1 during the follow up period when it has been set as the vice center since the general planning of territorial space of guangzhou 2018 2035 was raised 3 methodology 3 1 formwork of easyca in this study easyca was performed on the raster grids we rasterize the study area into r rows and c columns and define a binary variable x i j to label the status of the cell i j in easyca then the important task is to set the value of x i j and the urban growth probability estimated from the above variables is expressed as p i j if the estimated value of p i j is higher than the set threshold then x i j 1 meaning that the cell i j will be inclined to be converted into urban land otherwise x i j 0 referring to that the status of the cell i j will keep unchanged with the above definition the urban growth probability obtained from a typical raster based ca can be described as eq 1 1 p i j t s i j ω i j t ψ i j y i j t where t is the iteration time of ca p i j t is the urban growth probability of the cell i j i 1 2 r j 1 2 c at time t s i j is the urban suitability estimated from spatial variables at time t ω i j t is the urban growth potential due to the influence from the neighborhood cells at time t this is usually calculated by the urban density with a moving window such as moore or expanded moore ψ i j is the growth priority ranging from 0 to 1 y i j t is set randomly to represent the influence of uncertain factors to the urban growth generally cells around present urban units will have the higher probability to be transformed into urban land if only considering the p i j t this will result in marginal growth pattern around current urban units which is obviously deviating from the actual expansion mode as shown in fig 1 it shows that the new increased urban areas usually aggregated as the patches rather than scattered as single cells this phenomenon can be especially presented in the mapping of land use change with high resolution image considering the patch growth mode into the transition rules of the raster based ca is conducive to the improvement of simulation ability and this has also been proven in many previous studies li et al 2017 yang et al 2020 based on above analysis we designed an easyca framework with the consideration of the patch growth strategy the overall flowchart of easyca is listed in fig 3 and it is mainly composed of the following steps first the relationship between historical urban growth and four steady spatial variables were analyzed as random forest is regarded as a non parametric ensemble learning algorithm and it is embedded in the toolbox of arcgis software for convenient performance it was applied to estimate the relationship between historical urban growth and four steady spatial variables with the default parameters in the tool module and then urban growth suitability s was calculated with this obtained relationship second urban growth probability p 0 was then calculated by the integration of s and ψ third a number of cells was further selected as the growth seeds referring to the urban growth probability finally we adopted a patch growth template to update the status of the neighborhood cells around the seeds until the total quantity of urban land reaches the value set for the simulation year 3 2 definition of the patch growth mode of easyca previous patch growth based ca was mainly implemented through a suitability based sorting stochastically seeding and moving window scanning process the urban patches generated by this means are conglomerated into a compact and rounded mass that is the shapes of the patches are inclined to be regular and similar to overcome this limitation a clone stamp means was induced to the patch growth mode of easyca in this study this includes two main steps as follows 1 selection of the seeds in general new urban patches will be commonly expanded around a urban central cell this cell can be regarded as a seed to generate reasonable urban patches through the simulation of ca the significant task is to choose suitable seeds in terms of the principle that the cell with higher probability is more likely to be selected for urban growth the growth probability was also used as the important reference for the selection of seeds in this study first the cells allowed for urban growth with the probability p 0 0 were counted and stored into the dataset l and then the probabilities of those cells were sorted in descending order and remarked as the new set of p secondly we selected a total number of h seeds from the available dataset l in order to ensure the reasonable and balanced distribution of seeds in the space that is the denser seeds concentrated at positions of the higher probability and the sparser seeds were scattered at the positions of the lower probability we used a window with the size of w to mark the space interval and selected which cell as the seed by the means expressed as eq 3 3 l l α w 2 l l h l i f l l β p h where l is the random index increasing from 1 to l α and β are random parameters ranging from 0 to 1 w is the size of patch searching window it is highly relative to the landscape pattern of urban patches and significant to the agglomeration degree of urban patches derived from easyca and the larger window will result in the weaker interaction between the neighborhood h is the index number of the l t h selected seed and p h is the probability of the h t h seed it can be found that h is continuously increasing until it reaches to the maximum position of l we further adopted a roulette selection with a linear change l l to adjust the distribution of seeds when all the set number of seeds was selected the index numbers of l and h were converted into the corresponding locations of the cells in the two dimensional space 2 definition of the patch growth template when the seeds were selected the main task is to simulate the growing urban patches around the seeds if only the growth probability p is considered for the selection of seeds then the shapes and patterns of urban patches will be generally lack of variety in this step we put forward a creative idea of a patch growth template namely clone stamp to overcome this limitation to define the patch growth templates the size of a searching window was first set and then we used this window to collect a number of u growth patches existing in the historical dataset with the moving searching strategy these patches were then regarded as clone stamps and the examples of clone stamps are shown in fig 4 this can make urban growth templates scattered diversely in order to obtain a better simulation effect the size of u can also be efficiently set by the simulation testing with different sizes of the searching window during the iteration a clone stamp was selected randomly from u and stamped at the place surrounding the selected seed then the status of those cells was accordingly updated this can be described as eq 4 4 x i j t 1 w r a n d u ψ i j 0 where i j is the index of the seed h in two dimensional raster space x i j t 1 w refers to the status of the cells around the seed h within the searching window w at t 1 time and they are given with the values of the selected patch template from u of course when those cells forbidden for urban growth were scanning searched their status was not updated 3 3 evaluation of the easyca it is actually difficult for any ca model to accurately predict the urban growth of each cell particularly for the medium long terms but it can simulate the overall growth trend of the city in the future this is also significant for planners to understand the development direction of a city so far there is none effective way for validating the simulation accuracy of urban ca the conventional method is to apply ca in the urban growth simulation during a known period then a comparative analysis between the simulation scenario and the observation result was carried out to verify its performance the two quantitative indices namely fuzzy kappa fuzzyk and figure of merit fom index have been generally used to verify the location agreement and pattern similarity of the simulation result derived from ca varga et al 2019 the fuzzyk index compares the simulation and observation maps using a vicinity based approach that considers the fuzziness of locations in a defined scanning window e g w w used in this study yang et al 2020 the farther the distance is the lower the similarity is so an exponential distance decayed function with an attenuation parameter of 2 was applied in the fuzzyk index to quantify different impacts of the neighboring cells on the map similarity the fuzzyk index pays excessive attention to the similarity of the spatial pattern and the cell level agreement of model outputs is also important the fom index has been proven efficient in measuring cell level similarity pontius et al 2008 and it can be calculated as eq 5 5 f o m b a b c where a is the inconsistent area that is observed changes but is simulated as persistence b is the consistent area that is observed changes and is also simulated as changes and c is the inconsistent area that is observed persistence while is simulated as changes in addition to quantitative evaluation we can also make some qualitative evaluation between the simulation scenario and the government strategic planning or the latest remote sensing images e g landsat 8 oli image collected in 2020 4 results and analysis the size of searching window in eq 3 and the clone stamps u in eq 4 were set to perform the easyca usually w is set as a moore neighborhood maybe it is unsuitable for metropolitan areas especially when the cell size is 30 m 30 m or even smaller to set the value of w as reasonably as possible the increased urban patches during the period from 1995 to 2005 were identified the small and shattered patches were excluded to eliminate the pseudo change and the speckles influence by means of statistical analysis urban growth patches less than 1 hm2 were deleted the average area of the remaining patches was calculated about 90 hm2 then we set the size of searching window as w 15 15 under this condition hundreds and thousands of urban growth templates were moving searching extracted automatically the simulation scenario in 2020 was derived from easyca and shown in fig 5 and the observation result representing the actual urban pattern was extracted from the landsat 8 oli image collected in 2020 4 1 performance validation of easyca a compassion was made between the simulation scenario from easyca cell growth based ca and the observed result to validate the performance of easyca fig 5 the same suitability estimated with rf was used for the performance of essyca and cell growth based ca based on visual inspection though large independent site projects namely airport station high speed railway station automobile factory and port terminal the identified areas a b c and d in fig 5 are exceedingly difficult to be simulated accurately with easyca this is just like traditional ca models by quantitative comparison easyca achieved the values of 0 8419 and 0 2874 for the fuzzyk and fom index respectively this is exactly comparable to those published in previous literature reports chen et al 2016 varga et al 2019 yang et al 2020 while cell growth based ca achieved the values of 0 7796 and 0 2512 for the fuzzyk and fom index respectively it reflected that easyca can achieve higher efficiency in simulation and has the ability of simulating urban growth in metropolitan areas under the situation of fewer data and less parameters we further made the overall and local contrasts between the simulation result obtained from easyca and that obtained from cell growth based ca with the same dataset the result was shown in fig 6 it can be found that the urban growth obtained by easyca just expanded in a patch way and the urban patches were well in accordance with the actual situations presented in landsat 8 oli image whereas urban units simulated by cell growth based ca sprawled on the edge of initial urban land this is obviously exhibited in the local enlarged images a and b in fig 6 the comparison verified that patch growth of clone stamp strategy coupled in easyca is more efficient in the simulation of urban growth scenario 4 2 simulation efficiency in future urban growth based on the above verification easyca was applied in the simulation of growth scenario from 2015 to 2035 according to the report from the planning agency of guangzhou the urban size of guangzhou city in 2035 should not exceed 30 of the total area therefore we set 2230 km2 about 30 of total area as the quantitative demand in 2035 the result was shown in fig 7 generally it shows that the urban growth will keep stable trend and expand along different directions especially in the areas of main center colored with green circle to verify the simulation efficiency in future urban growth we collected the actual urban design plans of three typical spots that are exhibited in the subgraphs a b and c one spot is the planned modern logistics and comprehensive expo center around baiyun airport in huadu district subgraph a the simulation scenario can provide a showcase of the pervasion effects from baiyun airport the other spot is china singapore guangzhou knowledge city subgraph b in huangpu district technological innovation industries will be located in this area according to the spatial development strategy the simulation scenario can also reflect the expansion requirement of this development planning another spot is nansha new town subgraph c it has been set as a sub center in the latest spatial development strategy of guangzhou city a large quantity of urban growth will spring up in the future this was well presented in the simulation scenario there is a number of urban lands increased in the simulation result thus we can conclude that simulation scenario from easyca can provide reliable reference for the assignment planning of infrastructure construction 5 discussion 5 1 reasonability of coupling steady variables and planning intervention it is assumed that urban growth follows historical rules in typical ca modeling it basically weakens the factors of human intervention then a series of spatial variables has been commonly analyzed for the discover of transition rules in this study space development strategy was considered as an important factor to adjust the growth pattern and only four steady variables were selected to discuss the reasonability of the proposed easyca we made a compassion between the simulation results by using different variables a total of 10 variables namely dem slope distances to different urban elements e g urban centers transportation elements and urban patches were chosen to estimate urban suitability by using rf for the compassion then the simulation result of urban growth in 2020 based on this suitability was derived from easyca the results are shown in fig 8 it can be found that the two sets of urban suitability are basically in consistent with the overall pattern in spite of local difference instead urban suitability estimated from four steady variables can reflect the growth trend in the north south expansion particularly underdeveloped areas at present also have the higher suitability of urban growth indicating that they can provide more expansion space for future development it conforms to actual planning strategy however more spatial variables just resulted in the space aggregation of higher suitability around current urban areas it indicated that the urban suitability estimated from only four steady variables was more conductive to selecting growth seeds on the other hand the layout of urban growth has been usually adjusted by government in china this actually cannot be simulated only with spatial variables to validate the necessity of coupling the policy interventions into the suitability estimation simulation scenarios were obtained from easyca with the two different sets of variables respectively and the results are shown in fig 8 c and fig 8 d it can be found that the overall simulation patterns also have none obvious difference this reveals that easyca has none sensitivity to spatial variables it further verified that more spatial variables cannot improve the simulation efficiency meanwhile these simulation scenarios are both actually inconsistent with the requirement of spatial planning for instance china singapore guangzhou knowledge city subgraph a in fig 8 and nansha new zone subgraph b in fig 8 has been set as the significant growth pole in the spatial planning strategy of 2035 and remote sensing images in 2020 covering these two regions also indicates there has been greatly developed while the simulation scenarios cannot efficiently obtain the reasonable pattern either with four steady variables or ten spatial variables when space development strategy was regarded as an important factor for the adjustment of suitability the development status and trend of the planned spots can be reflected in the simulation scenario as shown in subgraphs in fig 7 it can be concluded that the integration of policy interventions and historic development rules into easyca is necessary to urban growth simulation this will make the simulation scenario reliable for supporting decision making and it is more suitable for the urban growth simulation in china 5 2 efficiency of easyca in supporting decision making to discuss whether easyca can be efficient in supporting spatial planning the simulation result obtained from cell growth based ca fig 9 c and the actual planning map from the official agency fig 9b was used to make a comparison according to the master spatial planning of guangzhou for 2035 new urban areas will be allocated along three main directions marked as arrows a b and c colored in purple outward from the main center meanwhile with the strategy of developing guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba raised by chinese government since 2019 the southern part located in the geometric center of gba has been set as the vice center of guangzhou accordingly a lot of urban lands will increase in the southern area and the scope and rate of urban expansion in the northern part will be limited due to the ecological barrier this inference has just been confirmed to the strategic spatial planning about the ecological agriculture and urban space for 2035 from official agency fig 9b it indicates that the newly increased urban land in the simulation result derived from traditional cell growth based ca mainly presented uniform distribution around the existing towns fig 9c which cannot well reflect the actual evolution trend of spatial expansion by comparison new urban lands presented in simulation scenario from easyca commonly expand along the three main directions and details were described in the result section based on the above analysis it can be concluded that easyca is relatively reliable for the medium and long term simulation of urban expansion during the period from 2015 to 2035 in guangzhou metropolitan area 6 conclusion simulation of urban growth is very important for planners to understand the future development trend of a city cellular automata have been recognized as an effective modeling tool for urban growth simulation at present more and more spatial variables have been applied in traditional ca for discovering the conversion rules to explain the urban growth mechanism in fact urban growth is a comprehensive dynamic system coupling natural and human processes no matter how many variables are integrated ca still cannot achieve a 100 accurate simulation of future urban growth particularly many commonly used variables are dynamic during the medium and long term planning especially in the metropolitan areas their influence to urban growth is actually uncertain therefore using few representative spatial variables which are relatively stable to simulate urban growth makes more sense to support the decision making in medium and long term planning this study proposed an easyca framework which requires only four spatial variables and one factor of government policy for the estimation of urban suitability in metropolitan area and the random forest was used to discuss the relationship between urban growth patches and the four spatial variables based on this we induced a clone stamp strategy into the evolution rule of easyca higher density of seeds was selected in the space of higher suitability whereas lower density of seeds was selected in the space of lower suitability historical growth patches were then collected as clone stamps to update the status of the cells around the seeds the results indicated that this patch growth strategy greatly enhances the diversity of simulated urban patches and can overcome the limitation of marginal growth regarding the master plan during the medium and long term it is exceedingly difficult for cell growth based ca to accurately estimate the growth pattern of multiple developing centers with the dynamic spatial variables easyca proposed in this study can simulate the urban growth of metropolitan areas requiring only few steady variables and most of the parameters in the model can be calibrated automatically according to historical urban growth the comparisons verified that four steady variables can efficiently estimate the urban suitability and coupling the policy interventions can improve the reliability of simulation scenario for medium and long term planning and easyca has great potential to be popularized because of the simplify fewer parameters and simulation efficiency urban growth simulation should not only be based on historical evolution rules but also consider the demand of the future cognitive model analysis can provide reliable reference for decision making in future study we should further deeply understand the simulation mechanism such as a better understanding of the behavior from local real estate developers and major engineering facility site selection and so on the following question is required to be further validated to improve the feasibility of easyca is it possible to set up some known sites namely major development items as seeds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

24443,it is critical to predict urban growth for understanding of urbanization process traditional urban ca mainly focused on discovery of conversion rules from a series of biophysical and social economic factors many varying factors are generally treated as constant and the simulation result is none of great reference value for decision making in order to eliminate these limitations an easy cellular automata easyca was proposed with integration of seed searching and clone stamp growth strategy it aims to provide feasible scenario analysis for decision making only four steady variables namely distance to current urban patches difficulty coefficient of land conversion density of urban land and topographic conditions were applied to estimate urban suitability policy intervention was further considered for adjustment of urban suitability and patch growth templates were collected as clone stamps for updating the status of cells during iteration this easyca was then tested with example area of guangzhou city located in the pearl river delta of china accuracy indices of averaged fuzzy kappa fuzzyk and figure of merit fom were calculated with the values of 0 8419 and 0 2874 respectively and both of them were higher than those from cell growth based ca indicating that easyca is efficient in utility and reliability comparison analysis verified that few steady variables can obtain reliable result of urban suitability and it is greatly necessary to integrate policy intervention into estimation of urban growth probability and the simulation pattern in 2035 is maximally close to actual status compared with the planning layout it shows that easyca is potentially applicable and effective for planning practices in metropolitan areas keywords urban growth simulation cellular automata patch based growth clone stamp metropolitan areas 1 introduction with the development of the economy and society a large amount of population will live in coastal cities and urban land will be correspondingly expanded egidi et al 2020 song et al 2021 currently many areas particularly fast developing countries are experiencing rapid urban growth liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 intensive urban growth has resulted in a significant challenge for regional and global sustainability hassan and lee 2015 huang et al 2018 though it not only destroys the natural ecological environment but also accelerates climate change urbanization is yet a necessary process of human social development kourtit et al 2020 lin et al 2020 cao et al 2021 hong et al 2021 therefore analysis of urban growth scenario in the future is important for planners to make efficient decision making in spatial planning aburas et al 2016 wang et al 2021 simulation models have contributed to understanding the urbanization process and promoting sustainable urban development yu et al 2019 domingo et al 2021 hence developing effective simulation models to predict urban growth in the future can better serve the promotion of urbanization to gain insight into urban growth scenario a series of models have been extensively developed and applied by researchers in the past decades santé et al 2010 aburas et al 2016 gonzález méndez et al 2021 among these models cellular automata ca model has been widely applied due to its structural flexibility and bottom up simulation mechanism mustafa et al 2017 guzman et al 2020 this makes it have the ability to effectively simulate plot based process of land use cover change usually there are two main components for urban growth simulation by using ca as follows the first one is the quantitative demand of urban land in the future and the second one is to determine which units will be urbanized under this quantitative demand gharaibeh et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in general urban suitability has been regarded as the basic element for discovering the conversion rules and then determining the distribution of increased urban lands and there are hundreds and millions of cells involved in the data processing it is impossible to define a conversion rule for each unit and then estimating urban suitability from a series of spatial factors has been commonly implemented in spatial allocation module parry et al 2018 xu et al 2018 there are so many spatial factors e g elevation slope distance to roads and built up areas influencing urban growth for instance the land plots under the conditions of flat terrain convenient transportation and proximity to existing cities are generally more likely to be converted into urban lands the contribution of each factor is required to be first confirmed to estimate the contribution of each selected factor for calculating urban suitability a series of methods including statistical models machine learning models and tree based models have been widely used shafizadeh moghadam et al 2017 therein models such as spatial logistic regression ma et al 2020 deep learning xing et al 2020 random forest zhou et al 2020 have been especially and commonly popular in suitability estimation some research also compared the performance of different methods and validate their reasonability in the estimation of urban suitability however a series of volatile variables may continue to change in the space no matter what method is used it is difficult to confirm driving effect on surrounding local regions from volatile variables for example a new expressway may be planned and built at some point in the future it will correspondingly result in the variation of growth direction this variation cannot be discovered and the validation accuracy of ca model is actually none meaningful just with the samples selected from historical dataset ahmadzai 2020 in actual some variables will keep invariant over time that is their attributes and locations will be relatively stable in a medium long time we defined these as steady variables in this study if urban suitability can be estimated from those steady variables then the simulation validation with historical samples can be meaningfully for example some research use distance to built up area for extrapolating urban growth and found distance to built up as a single factor is as powerful as all variables shafizadeh moghadam et al 2021 this validated that it is feasible to simulate urban growth with steady variables however as for medium and long term simulation of urban growth only considering distance to built up will result in marginal expansion newly increased urban land will aggregate around current built up over large urban patches will be generated in the simulation pattern and local spatial heterogeneity cannot well be revealed most importantly the mode of urban growth will not always follow the historical trend especially during the period of medium to long term planning previous researches have validated that spatial constrains and policy interventions from the government may change the growth mode particularly in china for example the ecological sensitive areas are usually not allowed for urban growth liao et al 2019 government may design several development centers to meet the demand of urbanization in land use and social economy the influence on the evolution mode from these factors cannot be reflected in the simulation with only distance to built up and other spatial variables it is greatly necessary to consider the adjustment of urban suitability from planning interventions into the simulation mechanism under this situation the main task of ca is how to derive accurate evolution pattern from steady variables and policy interventions almost all the ca simulations have been performed on the raster or vector units to obtain the evolution patterns from urban suitability barreira gonzález et al 2015 most studies have focused on how to get growth patches of a certain size from urban suitability and aim to make the simulation patten better in conformity with practical situation previous studies have introduced a patchy growth mechanism into the raster based ca to meet such goal as can as possible chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 and the monte carlo algorithm was adopted to scatter the seeds into the space for generating the urban patches through the expansion around those seeds chen et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in this way the shape quantity and pattern of urban patches is mainly determined by the set threshold of urban patch size and the growth probability of the cells around the seeds this may result in the increased urban patches almost growing around the scattered seeds and also exhibiting a marginal expansion mode the whole simulation process is relatively complicated and some time consuming and the local simulation patterns may be yet unreasonable compared with the actual conditions therefore developing an easier and more rational way to get the urban patches from ca simulation is greatly expected for medium and long term decision making in this study it aims to introduce an easy evolution mode to improve ca model and obtain more realistic result of urban growth in metropolitan areas the improved ca is accordingly named as easyca we try to answer the following questions 1 what steady variables can be used to estimate urban suitability 2 is the consideration of policy interventions necessary for the adjustment of urban suitability in metropolitan areas 3 what evolution rules can be efficiently used to generate reasonable urban patches this article is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the study area and datasets used for the implementation of easyca then in section 3 we describe the main framework of easyca in section 4 we perform the easyca on the study area and validate its efficiency after that we discuss the advantages of easyca and draw conclusions about this study 2 materials 2 1 study area to calibrate and validate easyca guangzhou city was chosen as the study area it is a fast developing metropolitan area located in the peral river delta of china bounded by latitudes 22 26 and 23 56 n and longitudes 112 57 and 114 03 e covering an area of 7434 4 km2 since the policy of reform and opening up promulgated in 1978 guangzhou has experienced massive and rapid urban growth meng et al 2020 by the end of 2020 the permanent resident population and gdp has already exceeded 18 7 million and 2 5 trillion cny respectively guangzhou bureau of statistics 2021 for future urban growth guangzhou will mainly develop the northern eastern and southern part due to the high development density of the central part main center including yuexiu liwan tianhe and haizhu district in addition the chinese government has proposed a national strategy named guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba in 2019 and guangzhou will be facing a new development opportunity hui et al 2020 nansha district has been set as a vice center by the government of guangzhou considering that it is located in the geometric center of gba therefore there is no way around the fact that guangzhou s future urban growth will not completely follow the historical development pattern developing a more reasonable ca model for the simulation of urban growth in guangzhou is crucial to make spatial planning policy 2 2 dataset and spatial variables landsat 5 tm landsat 8 oli images and digital elevation model dem were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn to provide basic materials for the easyca model all the raster datasets were projected into wgs 1984 utm zone 49 n with a resolution of 30 m 30 m six categories of land use namely urban cultivated land forest grass water and unused land were classified from landsat images collected in 1995 2005 and 2015 by using support vector machine method embedded in envi environment for visualizing images software the overall classification accuracy of urban land is about 88 by the comparison with reference samples that were manually and randomly interpreted from high resolution images of 0 5 m acquired in google earth fig 1 in previous research a series of biophysical and social economic factors were introduced for land suitability evaluation natural conditions namely elevation and slope soil quality kernel density of points of interest poi and several proximity based variables have been generally used gharaibeh et al 2020 guzman et al 2020 xing et al 2020 as mentioned before the relationship between the urban suitability and many social economic factors may be dynamic whereas some steady variables keep relatively stable with the process of urban growth with this consideration only four steady variables were used to evaluate urban suitability fig 2 a d they include 1 terrain conditions measured with the digital elevation model dem which was downloaded from https www gscloud cn 2 distance to urban patches in 1995 3 transformation coefficient it is used to measure the conversion cost of newly increased urban land from other land use it can be approximately estimated according to the land expropriation standard set by the government 4 structure of the urban landscape in 1995 it was measured by the density of urban patches in this study on the other hand policy interventions and ecological constraints were considered and quantitatively converted into probabilities to adjust the urban suitability in this study the regions of the nature reserves public parks rivers great mountains as well as other protected areas were strictly prevented from urban growth these space units were marked as 0 we assigned the other space units with different values of urban development priority according to the government s planning policy these values that is the development probability were set with 0 2 0 5 and 1 in terms of the urban development priority from low to high and they were actually varied with the adjustment of the government s development strategy fig 2 e for example the development probability of nansha district in the years before 2015 was assigned as the value of 0 5 considering that it was not regarded as the vice center during that time and can be then improved from 0 5 to 1 during the follow up period when it has been set as the vice center since the general planning of territorial space of guangzhou 2018 2035 was raised 3 methodology 3 1 formwork of easyca in this study easyca was performed on the raster grids we rasterize the study area into r rows and c columns and define a binary variable x i j to label the status of the cell i j in easyca then the important task is to set the value of x i j and the urban growth probability estimated from the above variables is expressed as p i j if the estimated value of p i j is higher than the set threshold then x i j 1 meaning that the cell i j will be inclined to be converted into urban land otherwise x i j 0 referring to that the status of the cell i j will keep unchanged with the above definition the urban growth probability obtained from a typical raster based ca can be described as eq 1 1 p i j t s i j ω i j t ψ i j y i j t where t is the iteration time of ca p i j t is the urban growth probability of the cell i j i 1 2 r j 1 2 c at time t s i j is the urban suitability estimated from spatial variables at time t ω i j t is the urban growth potential due to the influence from the neighborhood cells at time t this is usually calculated by the urban density with a moving window such as moore or expanded moore ψ i j is the growth priority ranging from 0 to 1 y i j t is set randomly to represent the influence of uncertain factors to the urban growth generally cells around present urban units will have the higher probability to be transformed into urban land if only considering the p i j t this will result in marginal growth pattern around current urban units which is obviously deviating from the actual expansion mode as shown in fig 1 it shows that the new increased urban areas usually aggregated as the patches rather than scattered as single cells this phenomenon can be especially presented in the mapping of land use change with high resolution image considering the patch growth mode into the transition rules of the raster based ca is conducive to the improvement of simulation ability and this has also been proven in many previous studies li et al 2017 yang et al 2020 based on above analysis we designed an easyca framework with the consideration of the patch growth strategy the overall flowchart of easyca is listed in fig 3 and it is mainly composed of the following steps first the relationship between historical urban growth and four steady spatial variables were analyzed as random forest is regarded as a non parametric ensemble learning algorithm and it is embedded in the toolbox of arcgis software for convenient performance it was applied to estimate the relationship between historical urban growth and four steady spatial variables with the default parameters in the tool module and then urban growth suitability s was calculated with this obtained relationship second urban growth probability p 0 was then calculated by the integration of s and ψ third a number of cells was further selected as the growth seeds referring to the urban growth probability finally we adopted a patch growth template to update the status of the neighborhood cells around the seeds until the total quantity of urban land reaches the value set for the simulation year 3 2 definition of the patch growth mode of easyca previous patch growth based ca was mainly implemented through a suitability based sorting stochastically seeding and moving window scanning process the urban patches generated by this means are conglomerated into a compact and rounded mass that is the shapes of the patches are inclined to be regular and similar to overcome this limitation a clone stamp means was induced to the patch growth mode of easyca in this study this includes two main steps as follows 1 selection of the seeds in general new urban patches will be commonly expanded around a urban central cell this cell can be regarded as a seed to generate reasonable urban patches through the simulation of ca the significant task is to choose suitable seeds in terms of the principle that the cell with higher probability is more likely to be selected for urban growth the growth probability was also used as the important reference for the selection of seeds in this study first the cells allowed for urban growth with the probability p 0 0 were counted and stored into the dataset l and then the probabilities of those cells were sorted in descending order and remarked as the new set of p secondly we selected a total number of h seeds from the available dataset l in order to ensure the reasonable and balanced distribution of seeds in the space that is the denser seeds concentrated at positions of the higher probability and the sparser seeds were scattered at the positions of the lower probability we used a window with the size of w to mark the space interval and selected which cell as the seed by the means expressed as eq 3 3 l l α w 2 l l h l i f l l β p h where l is the random index increasing from 1 to l α and β are random parameters ranging from 0 to 1 w is the size of patch searching window it is highly relative to the landscape pattern of urban patches and significant to the agglomeration degree of urban patches derived from easyca and the larger window will result in the weaker interaction between the neighborhood h is the index number of the l t h selected seed and p h is the probability of the h t h seed it can be found that h is continuously increasing until it reaches to the maximum position of l we further adopted a roulette selection with a linear change l l to adjust the distribution of seeds when all the set number of seeds was selected the index numbers of l and h were converted into the corresponding locations of the cells in the two dimensional space 2 definition of the patch growth template when the seeds were selected the main task is to simulate the growing urban patches around the seeds if only the growth probability p is considered for the selection of seeds then the shapes and patterns of urban patches will be generally lack of variety in this step we put forward a creative idea of a patch growth template namely clone stamp to overcome this limitation to define the patch growth templates the size of a searching window was first set and then we used this window to collect a number of u growth patches existing in the historical dataset with the moving searching strategy these patches were then regarded as clone stamps and the examples of clone stamps are shown in fig 4 this can make urban growth templates scattered diversely in order to obtain a better simulation effect the size of u can also be efficiently set by the simulation testing with different sizes of the searching window during the iteration a clone stamp was selected randomly from u and stamped at the place surrounding the selected seed then the status of those cells was accordingly updated this can be described as eq 4 4 x i j t 1 w r a n d u ψ i j 0 where i j is the index of the seed h in two dimensional raster space x i j t 1 w refers to the status of the cells around the seed h within the searching window w at t 1 time and they are given with the values of the selected patch template from u of course when those cells forbidden for urban growth were scanning searched their status was not updated 3 3 evaluation of the easyca it is actually difficult for any ca model to accurately predict the urban growth of each cell particularly for the medium long terms but it can simulate the overall growth trend of the city in the future this is also significant for planners to understand the development direction of a city so far there is none effective way for validating the simulation accuracy of urban ca the conventional method is to apply ca in the urban growth simulation during a known period then a comparative analysis between the simulation scenario and the observation result was carried out to verify its performance the two quantitative indices namely fuzzy kappa fuzzyk and figure of merit fom index have been generally used to verify the location agreement and pattern similarity of the simulation result derived from ca varga et al 2019 the fuzzyk index compares the simulation and observation maps using a vicinity based approach that considers the fuzziness of locations in a defined scanning window e g w w used in this study yang et al 2020 the farther the distance is the lower the similarity is so an exponential distance decayed function with an attenuation parameter of 2 was applied in the fuzzyk index to quantify different impacts of the neighboring cells on the map similarity the fuzzyk index pays excessive attention to the similarity of the spatial pattern and the cell level agreement of model outputs is also important the fom index has been proven efficient in measuring cell level similarity pontius et al 2008 and it can be calculated as eq 5 5 f o m b a b c where a is the inconsistent area that is observed changes but is simulated as persistence b is the consistent area that is observed changes and is also simulated as changes and c is the inconsistent area that is observed persistence while is simulated as changes in addition to quantitative evaluation we can also make some qualitative evaluation between the simulation scenario and the government strategic planning or the latest remote sensing images e g landsat 8 oli image collected in 2020 4 results and analysis the size of searching window in eq 3 and the clone stamps u in eq 4 were set to perform the easyca usually w is set as a moore neighborhood maybe it is unsuitable for metropolitan areas especially when the cell size is 30 m 30 m or even smaller to set the value of w as reasonably as possible the increased urban patches during the period from 1995 to 2005 were identified the small and shattered patches were excluded to eliminate the pseudo change and the speckles influence by means of statistical analysis urban growth patches less than 1 hm2 were deleted the average area of the remaining patches was calculated about 90 hm2 then we set the size of searching window as w 15 15 under this condition hundreds and thousands of urban growth templates were moving searching extracted automatically the simulation scenario in 2020 was derived from easyca and shown in fig 5 and the observation result representing the actual urban pattern was extracted from the landsat 8 oli image collected in 2020 4 1 performance validation of easyca a compassion was made between the simulation scenario from easyca cell growth based ca and the observed result to validate the performance of easyca fig 5 the same suitability estimated with rf was used for the performance of essyca and cell growth based ca based on visual inspection though large independent site projects namely airport station high speed railway station automobile factory and port terminal the identified areas a b c and d in fig 5 are exceedingly difficult to be simulated accurately with easyca this is just like traditional ca models by quantitative comparison easyca achieved the values of 0 8419 and 0 2874 for the fuzzyk and fom index respectively this is exactly comparable to those published in previous literature reports chen et al 2016 varga et al 2019 yang et al 2020 while cell growth based ca achieved the values of 0 7796 and 0 2512 for the fuzzyk and fom index respectively it reflected that easyca can achieve higher efficiency in simulation and has the ability of simulating urban growth in metropolitan areas under the situation of fewer data and less parameters we further made the overall and local contrasts between the simulation result obtained from easyca and that obtained from cell growth based ca with the same dataset the result was shown in fig 6 it can be found that the urban growth obtained by easyca just expanded in a patch way and the urban patches were well in accordance with the actual situations presented in landsat 8 oli image whereas urban units simulated by cell growth based ca sprawled on the edge of initial urban land this is obviously exhibited in the local enlarged images a and b in fig 6 the comparison verified that patch growth of clone stamp strategy coupled in easyca is more efficient in the simulation of urban growth scenario 4 2 simulation efficiency in future urban growth based on the above verification easyca was applied in the simulation of growth scenario from 2015 to 2035 according to the report from the planning agency of guangzhou the urban size of guangzhou city in 2035 should not exceed 30 of the total area therefore we set 2230 km2 about 30 of total area as the quantitative demand in 2035 the result was shown in fig 7 generally it shows that the urban growth will keep stable trend and expand along different directions especially in the areas of main center colored with green circle to verify the simulation efficiency in future urban growth we collected the actual urban design plans of three typical spots that are exhibited in the subgraphs a b and c one spot is the planned modern logistics and comprehensive expo center around baiyun airport in huadu district subgraph a the simulation scenario can provide a showcase of the pervasion effects from baiyun airport the other spot is china singapore guangzhou knowledge city subgraph b in huangpu district technological innovation industries will be located in this area according to the spatial development strategy the simulation scenario can also reflect the expansion requirement of this development planning another spot is nansha new town subgraph c it has been set as a sub center in the latest spatial development strategy of guangzhou city a large quantity of urban growth will spring up in the future this was well presented in the simulation scenario there is a number of urban lands increased in the simulation result thus we can conclude that simulation scenario from easyca can provide reliable reference for the assignment planning of infrastructure construction 5 discussion 5 1 reasonability of coupling steady variables and planning intervention it is assumed that urban growth follows historical rules in typical ca modeling it basically weakens the factors of human intervention then a series of spatial variables has been commonly analyzed for the discover of transition rules in this study space development strategy was considered as an important factor to adjust the growth pattern and only four steady variables were selected to discuss the reasonability of the proposed easyca we made a compassion between the simulation results by using different variables a total of 10 variables namely dem slope distances to different urban elements e g urban centers transportation elements and urban patches were chosen to estimate urban suitability by using rf for the compassion then the simulation result of urban growth in 2020 based on this suitability was derived from easyca the results are shown in fig 8 it can be found that the two sets of urban suitability are basically in consistent with the overall pattern in spite of local difference instead urban suitability estimated from four steady variables can reflect the growth trend in the north south expansion particularly underdeveloped areas at present also have the higher suitability of urban growth indicating that they can provide more expansion space for future development it conforms to actual planning strategy however more spatial variables just resulted in the space aggregation of higher suitability around current urban areas it indicated that the urban suitability estimated from only four steady variables was more conductive to selecting growth seeds on the other hand the layout of urban growth has been usually adjusted by government in china this actually cannot be simulated only with spatial variables to validate the necessity of coupling the policy interventions into the suitability estimation simulation scenarios were obtained from easyca with the two different sets of variables respectively and the results are shown in fig 8 c and fig 8 d it can be found that the overall simulation patterns also have none obvious difference this reveals that easyca has none sensitivity to spatial variables it further verified that more spatial variables cannot improve the simulation efficiency meanwhile these simulation scenarios are both actually inconsistent with the requirement of spatial planning for instance china singapore guangzhou knowledge city subgraph a in fig 8 and nansha new zone subgraph b in fig 8 has been set as the significant growth pole in the spatial planning strategy of 2035 and remote sensing images in 2020 covering these two regions also indicates there has been greatly developed while the simulation scenarios cannot efficiently obtain the reasonable pattern either with four steady variables or ten spatial variables when space development strategy was regarded as an important factor for the adjustment of suitability the development status and trend of the planned spots can be reflected in the simulation scenario as shown in subgraphs in fig 7 it can be concluded that the integration of policy interventions and historic development rules into easyca is necessary to urban growth simulation this will make the simulation scenario reliable for supporting decision making and it is more suitable for the urban growth simulation in china 5 2 efficiency of easyca in supporting decision making to discuss whether easyca can be efficient in supporting spatial planning the simulation result obtained from cell growth based ca fig 9 c and the actual planning map from the official agency fig 9b was used to make a comparison according to the master spatial planning of guangzhou for 2035 new urban areas will be allocated along three main directions marked as arrows a b and c colored in purple outward from the main center meanwhile with the strategy of developing guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba raised by chinese government since 2019 the southern part located in the geometric center of gba has been set as the vice center of guangzhou accordingly a lot of urban lands will increase in the southern area and the scope and rate of urban expansion in the northern part will be limited due to the ecological barrier this inference has just been confirmed to the strategic spatial planning about the ecological agriculture and urban space for 2035 from official agency fig 9b it indicates that the newly increased urban land in the simulation result derived from traditional cell growth based ca mainly presented uniform distribution around the existing towns fig 9c which cannot well reflect the actual evolution trend of spatial expansion by comparison new urban lands presented in simulation scenario from easyca commonly expand along the three main directions and details were described in the result section based on the above analysis it can be concluded that easyca is relatively reliable for the medium and long term simulation of urban expansion during the period from 2015 to 2035 in guangzhou metropolitan area 6 conclusion simulation of urban growth is very important for planners to understand the future development trend of a city cellular automata have been recognized as an effective modeling tool for urban growth simulation at present more and more spatial variables have been applied in traditional ca for discovering the conversion rules to explain the urban growth mechanism in fact urban growth is a comprehensive dynamic system coupling natural and human processes no matter how many variables are integrated ca still cannot achieve a 100 accurate simulation of future urban growth particularly many commonly used variables are dynamic during the medium and long term planning especially in the metropolitan areas their influence to urban growth is actually uncertain therefore using few representative spatial variables which are relatively stable to simulate urban growth makes more sense to support the decision making in medium and long term planning this study proposed an easyca framework which requires only four spatial variables and one factor of government policy for the estimation of urban suitability in metropolitan area and the random forest was used to discuss the relationship between urban growth patches and the four spatial variables based on this we induced a clone stamp strategy into the evolution rule of easyca higher density of seeds was selected in the space of higher suitability whereas lower density of seeds was selected in the space of lower suitability historical growth patches were then collected as clone stamps to update the status of the cells around the seeds the results indicated that this patch growth strategy greatly enhances the diversity of simulated urban patches and can overcome the limitation of marginal growth regarding the master plan during the medium and long term it is exceedingly difficult for cell growth based ca to accurately estimate the growth pattern of multiple developing centers with the dynamic spatial variables easyca proposed in this study can simulate the urban growth of metropolitan areas requiring only few steady variables and most of the parameters in the model can be calibrated automatically according to historical urban growth the comparisons verified that four steady variables can efficiently estimate the urban suitability and coupling the policy interventions can improve the reliability of simulation scenario for medium and long term planning and easyca has great potential to be popularized because of the simplify fewer parameters and simulation efficiency urban growth simulation should not only be based on historical evolution rules but also consider the demand of the future cognitive model analysis can provide reliable reference for decision making in future study we should further deeply understand the simulation mechanism such as a better understanding of the behavior from local real estate developers and major engineering facility site selection and so on the following question is required to be further validated to improve the feasibility of easyca is it possible to set up some known sites namely major development items as seeds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

24444,the sterile insect technique sit is a method of biological control of pests and disease vector insects it includes mass rearing and release of sterile males of the target species so that wild females mated with sterile males would not produce offspring an innovative version of this technique called boosted sit relies on the use of sterile males as vectors of biocides to trigger an epizootic in the wild fruit fly population we built an agent based model to assess the feasibility of this technique and main modalities of field implementation for the control of the oriental fruit fly bactrocera dorsalis using the entomopathogenic fungi metarizhium anisopliae as a biocide the model called boostit bactrocera dorsalis boosted sit simulates the spatio temporal population dynamics of fruit flies in three different realistic landscape contexts the releases of infected and uninfected sterile males were simulated and allowed the transmission of the pathogen within the wild fly population as a result of interactions between individuals a main output was the measurement of losses in mango production validation of the model was done by comparing the simulated population dynamics with data from field monitoring pheromone traps in three landscapes of the niayes area in senegal the population dynamics of wild flies were then simulated in an intensive cropping and mono mango cultivar landscape under three scenarios 1 without the release of sterile males 2 with the release of non contaminated sterile males sit and 3 with the release of sterile contaminated males boosted sit the results showed that sit and boosted sit strongly reduced the density of wild flies and the amount of infested fruits although parameters of the pathogen transfer between individuals need to be studied more deeply results encourage the implementation of field trials to validate the efficacy of boosted sit to control fruit flies keywords population dynamics pattern oriented modelling pest management entomovectoring bactrocera dorsalis metarhizium anisopliae 1 introduction the sterile insect technique sit is a biological control method that was proposed by knipling in the 1950s klassen et al 2021 it is defined as a method of pest control using area wide inundative releases of sterile insects to reduce reproduction in a field population of the same species sit represents therefore a type of birth control in which wild female insects do not reproduce when they are inseminated by released sterilized males in this type of autocidal control sequential releases of the sterilized insects in adequate sterile to wild male overflooding ratio lead to a reduction in the pest population effective control using sterile males is achieved as part of area wide integrated pest management aw ipm programs the sit was first developed in usa about fifty years ago dyck et al 2021 it is currently applied worldwide and the four strategic options in which sterile insects are being deployed as a component of aw ipm for insect pest control are suppression eradication containment and prevention dyck et al 2021 the sit has been applied to a number of species of fruit flies moths mosquitoes tsetse flies and screwworm flies sit was first successfully applied to eradicate the new world screwworm cochliomyia hominivorax coquerel 1958 in 1954 in curaçao north america baumhover et al 1955 it has proven successful for the management of fruit flies of economic importance worldwide including prevention e g ceratitis capitata wiedmann 1824 in california anastrepha ludens loew 1873 in texas containment e g c capitata in guatemala and mexico eradication e g bactrocera cucurbitae coquillet 1899 in japan or c capitata in chile or suppression e g c capitata in south africa israel spain and hawaï bactrocera spp in thailand orankanok et al 2007 enkerlin 2021 to improve the efficiency of the sit the entomovectoring technique proposes the use of sterile insects entomo as vectors vectoring of a biocide to one or more targeted life stages of a pest population hokkanen and menzler hokkanen 2007 this is known as boosted sit bouyer and lefrançois 2014 bouyer et al 2016 used this concept on sterile male mosquitoes coated with pyriproxyfen that contaminated females that could in turn contaminate the larval habitats this technique has shown its potential in coffee growing areas in guatemala where c capitata sterile males inoculated with beauveria bassiana balsamo crivelli vuillemin 1912 transmitted spores to 44 of the captured wild males flores et al 2013 the application of this technique for a given pest in a given area requires knowledge of the life history system of target pests lance and mcinnis 2021 to consider how the interactions between individuals and their environment may promote or hinder the boosted sit modelling is a relevant tool as it can generate scenarios that can reduce incertitude and guide field experiments many models have been built to answer issues on the effectiveness of sit most focused on release strategies cai et al 2014 strugarek 2019 the sterility level of sterile males barclay 1982 kean et al 2011 the competitiveness of sterile males and mating preference of females vreysen et al 2006 chargui et al 2018 their movement and dispersal sometimes including the impact of spatial structure of the environment tyson et al 2007 dufourd and dumont 2013 other studies have looked at the economic cost of sit thomé et al 2010 ramirez and gordillo 2016 and its combination with other control methods barclay and vreysen 2011 douchet et al 2021 for the boosted sit two modelling studies evaluated the feasibility of the approach using pyriproxyfen with aedes spp mosquitoes pleydell and bouyer 2019 developed a mathematical model to evaluate the gain of the boosted sit over conventional sit they showed that boosted sit reduced mosquito suppression time and required fewer males to be released including environmental conditions in their mathematical model haramboure et al 2020 found that boosted sit could increase the effectiveness of the sit when sterile males are not very competitive most of the models that we reviewed on both techniques are mathematical population level models and focus on mosquitoes few of them 11 are generic while only 23 target pests such as fruit flies tsetse flies or lepidopterans rather than mosquitoes in the present study the oriental fruit fly bactrocera dorsalis hendel 1912 was selected as a model system originally from asia b dorsalis was first reported on the african continent in kenya lux et al 2003 initially thought to be a new species b invadens schutze et al 2015 after its detection the pest rapidly spread to several african countries including senegal where it was reported in 2004 manrakhan et al 2015 it is highly polyphagous and considerable damages have been observed in mango orchards since its introduction rwomushana et al 2008 damage is caused when females lay their eggs in the fruit the larvae feed on it making the fruit rot and inedible badii et al 2015 these losses have a great socio economic impact on people in rural and urban communities involved in the mango value chains across africa wangithi et al 2021 in addition the presence of the pest limits farmers access to export markets as it is classified as an organism under quarantine restrictions by most countries in the world clarke 2005 badii et al 2015 this led many producers to apply insecticides that are hazardous to the environment and health of users and consumers wangithi et al 2021 various control tools have been proposed to growers or tested by research and extension services in africa early harvesting male annihilation technique mat protein bait spot treatments auto disseminating of fungal pathogen using traps mass trapping or the sit sutantawong et al 2002 mwatawala et al 2015 faye et al 2016 wangithi et al 2021 however b dorsalis remains a critical issue in fruit and vegetable production in african countries the understanding of the population dynamics and dispersal abilities can be very useful to develop appropriate control strategies including those that are area wide such as sit hendrichs et al 2020 thus the dynamics and the potential distribution of b dorsalis or related fruit flies have been predicted by various populational models yonow et al 2004 presented and simulated with dymex a mathematical model describing the population dynamics of bactrocera tryoni froggatt 1897 according to temperature precipitation and humidity stephens et al 2007 and de villiers et al 2015 used climex to study the effects of climate on the distribution and relative abundance of b dorsalis they showed that tropical and subtropical climates except the desert as well as warm temperate areas are favorable for b dorsalis to predict the potential distribution of b dorsalis liu et al 2011 magagula et al 2015 and qin et al 2019 used the maxent software for the same purpose gutierrez et al 2021 used weather driven physiologically based demographic models the sit has been tested to control b dorsalis with other monitoring and control methods in thailand this study was conducted in pilot programs at the orchard level in ratchaburi province from 1999 to 2000 sutantawong et al 2002 and from 2000 to 2004 orankanok et al 2007 and in the phichit province from 2003 to 2004 orankanok et al 2007 from 2008 to 2013 an aw ipm program using the sit was implemented in the chantaburi province chinvinijkul et al 2019 these programs were effective in controlling the fruit fly and fruit infestations were reduced by at least 50 in all targeted areas to our knowledge control programs including boosted sit have not been yet carried out on b dorsalis even if the use of entomopathogenic fungi like metarhizium anisopliae metchnikoff sorokin 1883 or beauvaria bassiana for the control of tephritid is gaining interest in the scientific community several studies explored the use of some m anisopliae isolates for the control of many fruit fly species ekesi et al 2002 quesada moraga et al 2006 2008 dimbi et al 2009 2013 sookar et al 2014 onsongo et al 2019 when the spores of m anisopliae come into contact with the cuticle of the insect they germinate and penetrate it if the fungus overcomes the insect s defences it grows leads to the death of the insect and then external sporulation follows zimmermann 2007 on b dorsalis ouna et al 2010 ekesi et al 2011 and tora and azerefegn 2021 showed that m anisopliae induce high mortality and inoculated sterile or wild fly males could successfully interact with other flies thus they could transfer the fungus to wild flies during mating mating attempts and male interactions novelo rincón et al 2009 flores et al 2013 sookar et al 2014 agent based modelling has been increasingly used to represent insect pest population dynamics and control techniques e g manoukis and colliers 2021 manoukis and hoffman 2014 the present study presents boostit bactrocera dorsalis boosted sit an agent based model that aims to test the performance of sit using b dorsalis sterile males coated with the entomopathogenic fungi metarhizium anisopliae when released in mango orchards of the niayes region of senegal to enhance the realism of the model we based it on the approach of pattern oriented modelling pom that uses real patterns for designing testing and parameterizing models pom attempts to optimize model complexity and reduce uncertainty as it relies on additional data contained in observed patterns these patterns are defined as a characteristic clearly identifiable structure in nature itself or in the data extracted from nature they also provide information on the essential properties of a system grimm et al 1996 wiegand et al 2003 grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2013 pom explicitly refers to spatial and temporal scales and produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field grimm et al 1996 pom is useful for all types of modelling in the case of agent based models also called individual based models in ecology grimm et al 2005 patterns can guide model structure by showing what kinds of entities need to be considered and what state variables are needed grimm and railsback 2013 using pom for development the model was designed to integrate strong knowledge on the biology and ecology of b dorsalis their dependence on climatic conditions and the phenology of different host plants in the niayes landscape the model was evaluated using field data collected over 4 years in the niayes area we then compared sterile male release scenarios to study their effect on the b dorsalis population dynamics 2 materials and

cells fig 2 three types of landscapes of 30 25 ha each with 11 11 cells of 2500 m2 50 50 m were available 1 the monocultivar landscape that formed a landscape of four intensive orchards 2 the low diversified landscape that formed a landscape of two intensive orchards an extensive orchard and a diversified orchard 3 the high diversified landscape that formed a landscape of one intensive orchard an extensive orchard and two diversified orchards intensive orchards i e intensive cropping system were considered as monocultivar orchards of high density of kent mango trees extensive orchards i e extensive cropping system were made of different cultivars of mango trees and few citrus trees planted at lower density diversified i e diversified cropping system orchards were characterized by egual presence of mango trees of different cultivars and citrus trees these orchard types followed the classification of grechi et al 2013 the spatial extent of these orchards 6 25ha corresponded to realistic senegalese orchards in boostit they were built with a random spatial distribution of the plant types typ from existing proportions of host plants in real orchards from the niayes area in senegal sarron et al 2018 we assumed that an average fruit tree covered 25 m² so there were 100 trees per cell the simulation area was with closed borders moving flies could not go out of the landscape the model did not consider emigration nor immigration time was simulated discretely through daily time steps and the horizon of a simulation was a maximum of 1 year 365 time steps one fly agent in the model was considered to represent 100 flies of the same gender and life stage in the real world this choice was a good compromise between computation capacities and realism in terms of population structure and size 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling a simulation of the boostit model began by selecting a type of landscape and by reading a csv file containing the daily temperature and the ripening period of the fruits of different mango trees cultivars see initialization at each time step processes were run in the following order table 1 1 reading input data and calculation of the ripening period of the host plants 2 the growth and survival processes of the fly 3 adults that received the minimum dose of infecting spores became infected 4 the healthy sterile or infected sterile males were released at a chosen date 5 adults that had not mated had a random movement 6 lek areas were determined 7 adult males first increased their attractiveness and then moved to the lek area if there were males carrying pathogens in leks they could transmit some of them to some healthy males 8 some females that had already mated may mate again after a refractory period 9 some flies died from the infection 10 a part of female visited the leks in turn and each one chose a male among the most competitive ones and mated with him if the male carried pathogens he transmitted some of them to the female 11 females that had mated and had passed the preoviposition period laid eggs in cells containing fruit for the infection time counter to start on the day after contamination the processes of releasing sterile and infected males contamination in leks and contamination during mating came after the infection process these processes are detailed in section 7 sub models 2 1 4 design concepts 2 1 4 1 basic principles the boostit model is based on the representation of an epizooty within the population the individual fly centred approach favoured the representation of fine local interactions influencing the life histories of the flies and the transmission of pathogens 2 1 4 2 emergence explosive population dynamics emerged from simulated demographic processes at the individual level the propagation of the disease emerged from inter individual interactions 2 1 4 3 perception male individuals perceived the cells with plants containing methyl eugenol php true and moved to them to increase their attractiveness they also perceived potential lek areas see sm7 females could perceive leks and cells from a distance equal to their perception radius and on which they could lay eggs see sm10 sm11 females perceived the males but these could not perceive them see sm10 2 1 4 4 interactions interactions were multiple at the inter individual level and between individual and environmental cells males fertile and sterile visited cells containing methyl eugenol to increase their attractiveness and to form lek areas a female chose a male partner from the most attractive ones before mating fertilized females laid their eggs in cells containing ripe fruit infected flies could infect other flies during contact in leks or while mating 2 1 4 5 stochasticity stochasticity of the model was found both at the initialization and in the dynamics initially adult flies were distributed equitably in the four orchards of the landscape but they positioned themselves on the orchard cells in a random way according to a homogeneous process of spatial poisson distribution the fly s survival was a bernoulli variable at each stage of life a fly could either live or die the selection of the number of flies that died each day or that grew to a higher stage was also a random process see sm2 the number of females and males visiting the lek areas was determined by a bounded random rate see sm7 and sm10 the number of females re mating was randomly selected from those that had already mated see sm8 if healthy and infected males met in a lek the selection of healthy males to contaminate was a random process see sm7 the same applied to the contamination of males and females through mating see sm10 the mortality of infected adult flies was also a random process see sm9 the cells of a host plant that would produce mature fruits were chosen randomly the position of the lek areas on cells with mango trees was random unmated adults also had a random movement see sm5 2 1 4 6 observation during a simulation of boostit the following output variables were monitored graphically on the interface the number of adult flies the total number of released sterile or sterile and infected males the number of infected flies the quantities of stung fruit per species and per cultivar the total quantity of infested mango fruits was calculated by summing the quantities of stung fruit for each cell where eggs were laid the quantity of stung mango fruits for a cell was calculated by the following equation s f a s f ln n p e g g b s f n p f r u i t 100 where a s f and b s f were parameters table 4 n p e g g was the counter of the viable egg number deposited in the given cell see sm11 n p f r u i t was a parameter giving a mean number of mango fruits per cell and per cultivar table 4 here the number of viable eggs deposited in the cell see sm11 was used because fruits containing eggs that would not hatch were not considered as damage in addition 5 global variables stored the values of the numbers of wild flies and stung fruits at peaks the dates of these peaks and the annual amount of stung fruit which was the sum of all patches of stung fruit during 365 days 2 1 5 initialization 2 1 5 1 landscape at t 0 the orchard cells had different egg laying carrying capacities mep depending on the type of host plant typ it was equal to ackn for kent acki for keitt acbdh for bdh acom for other mango cultivars and acc for citrus table 4 to calculate the carrying capacity we used the maximum number of flies per kilogram of mangoes 130 adults given by rwomushana et al 2008 we supposed that a kilogram of mangoes is composed of two fruits so we had 65 adults fruit then the egg laying carrying capacity per fruit was calculated by adding to the number of adults per fruit the proportion of eggs that did not reach the adult stage 45 given by ekesi et al 2006 to compute the carrying capacity of a cell we multiplied the carrying capacity of a fruit by the number of fruits per cell n p f r u i t table 4 due to a lack of knowledge on laying preferences the same carrying capacity was considered for all cultivars of mango trees ackn acki acbdh acom the same computation was done for the carrying capacity of citrus the methyl eugenol presence variable php was set to true for all cells with mango or citrus trees see sm7 2 1 5 2 fly a simulation was typically initialized with the number of adult flies finit table 4 flies were distributed equally in the four orchards with a female male ratio fmr see table 4 2 1 6 inputs boostit took as input a file that contained time series representing the evolution of the following data over a year the date in julian day the mean daily temperature the ripening period of different mango cultivars and citrus as infestation increased as fruits ripened grechi et al 2021 this period was considered the mango ripening period ripe and over ripened stages these different fruits were grouped under the following categories the mango cultivars kent keitt bdh bouko diekhal the other mango trees and the citrus the daily temperature came from the average of three years of data of a weather station hobo u30 onset corp usa equipped with a temperature and relative humidity s thb m002 sensor located in sangalkam in the niayes area of senegal 14 47 338 n 17 13 602 w the mango ripening periods were extracted from work carried out in the same area these corresponded to probabilities for each cultivar to become mature during the year 2 1 7 submodels the model included 11 sub models described below and referenced with their procedure names found in table 1 2 1 7 1 landscape dynamic sm1 2 1 7 1 1 reading input data for a given host plant type when the time of its fruit maturity given by the input data file arrived the proportion of cells of this plant type that would produce mature fruits frt true was given by a rate chosen in the range of 0 to pm following a uniform distribution considering that cells that already had mature fruit in the year could not produce mature fruit again the upper limit pm was calculated by p m p a c c n p v n p v m n p v with pacc the probability of daily maturity given by the input file for the fruit cultivar considered npv the number of cells of the given host plant and npvm the number of cells of the same host plant which fruits were already mature once fruits were available the counters of the deposited egg npegg and the ripening period sensibility to fruit flies of the fruit mtp were at 0 the duration of host plant maturity depended on the type of plant we had mlkn for the kent mlki for the keitt mlb for the bdh mlo for the other mango cultivars and mlc for citrus table 4 at the end of the maturity period given by the csv file the counter of the deposited eggs npegg became equal to the carrying capacity of the cell see initialization 2 1 7 1 2 calculation of the fruit s maturity time the mtp counter was incremented for the cell containing ripe and over ripened fruit and during this period females could lay their eggs in the cell when the counter reached the ripening time mlkn or mlki or mlbdh or mlom or mlc table 4 we supposed that the trees had lost their fruits frt false so no more eggs could be laid in that cell until the following year 2 1 7 2 life cycle sm2 2 1 7 2 1 development the fruit fly had 5 developmental stages egg larva pupa immature adult mature adult garcía adeva et al 2012 each individual of the immature stage had a daily development rate δf and a cumulative development level dev that allowed it to move on to the next stage at each time step the model calculated for each individual its daily development rate δf based on daily temperature table 2 this δf was then incrementing the variable dev d e v t 1 δ f d e v t and when dev was greater than or equal to 1 the fly moved on to the next stage 2 1 7 2 2 mortality the model included two types of fly mortality the establishment mortality em applied to the immature stages of the fly when they entered a given stage and the daily mortality dm which varied with temperature t table 3 and was applied to all stages at each time step these mortality events were simulated using a random selection based on a uniform distribution in intervals from 0 to em and 0 to dm respectively 2 1 7 3 b dorsalis infection sm3 flies carrying pathogens became infected if their number of spores sp was greater than the minimum number of spores required to cause the death of the fly spmin table 4 the counter of days of infected fly inft was incremented from the time step following infection 2 1 7 4 sterile male release sm4 when the simulation day corresponded to the first release day chosen rmt table 4 sterile adult males were released these males were released by cells chosen either at the centre or at four points in the 4 orchards of the landscape they had at that moment the maximum degree of attractiveness a t s m a t m a x table 4 this supposes that sterile males were fed with methyl eugenol before their release to make them equally or more competitive than wild males orankanok et al 2013 they were either healthy meaning that they did not carry the pathogen or infected meaning that they carried the pathogen the number of sterile males to be released rmnb was calculated by r m n b w m t r s w where wmt was the number of wild males present in the landscape at the release time rsw was the ratio of sterile males by wild males desired for release table 4 the maximum number of sterile males to be released was rmmax and the minimum was rmmin table 4 these limits were added to avoid the release of too few or too many sterile males making the model outputs unrealistic two release modalities were possible for a landscape on the one hand for the one zone option the number of sterile males was divided by 4 and then the cell in the centre of each orchard of the landscape released 1 4 of the number of sterile males on the other hand for the multi zone option the number of sterile males was divided by 16 and four cells of each orchard of the landscape were picked to release each 1 16 from the number of sterile males the number of releases was defined as nbrel and the time interval between releases as intrel table 4 for sterile and infected males the number of spores on each of them followed a normal distribution with a mean smsp and standard deviation sdsp table 4 2 1 7 5 random move sm5 although b dorsalis can fly for many kilometres we assume that it can also restrict its movements in a favourable environment fletcher 1987 for this study long distance fly migrations were not included in the simulated landscape to simulate the dispersion ability of b dorsalis this submodel of random move is called for all adult immature or mature flies that were not mated the previous time step these flies were set to follow a random movement in the orchard they turn left or right between 0 and 180 degrees and then move forward for 50 m this random move led some flies to cross the boundary cells separating the orchards of the landscape but could not go out of the landscape 2 1 7 6 lek setup sm6 at each time step the number of lek areas nlek was calculated from the number of adult males nam that were present in the orchard n l e k n a m m e a n m l e k where meanmlek table 4 was an observed mean number of males per lek ekanayake et al 2017 the lek areas could be located on any potential cells located in the orchard and containing mango trees or citrus trees the lek areas were not fixed they changed at each time step 2 1 7 7 pre coupling behaviour of males and contamination in lek sm7 before mating adult males sterile or not that entered a cell with methyl eugenol increased their attractiveness of a rate incat table 4 this was based on the fact that plant products containing methyl eugenol ingested by males are incorporated into their sex pheromone making them more attractive to female flies clarke 2005 any adult male in the model could visit the nearest lek area to mate the proportion of male rmlek table 4 visiting lek each day was the result of random selection for each male following a uniform distribution over an interval from 0 to rmlek if a male took part in the courtship in the leks it released a part lekat table 4 of its attractiveness otherwise it continued to increase its attractiveness up to the maximum atmax table 4 if there were infected males in a lek they could transmit spores to a randomly chosen number of males according to a uniform distribution with a probability between zero and trc table 4 the number of spores collected by the recipient male was calculated by s p r s p c s p d where spc was the proportion of spores transmitted during male interactions in leks and spd was the number of spores from the donor male table 4 the remaining number of spores from the donor male was thus calculated by ns p d s p d s p r 2 1 7 8 female re mating sm8 female polyandry is common in fruit flies shelly 2000 in boostit a portion of adult females among those that had already mated would re mate after a refractory period pmat table 4 the cpmat counter first incremented for females for which it was positive sm10 and when it became equal to the refractory period pmat the female had a probability rmate table 4 to re mate simulated through the comparison of a random number following a uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 1 and rmate table 4 the cpmat counter was then reset to zero for these females 2 1 7 9 pathogen

equal to the chosen incubation period tincub table 4 the infected flies had a probability to die fmort for females and mmort for males table 4 these flies were then removed from the simulation 2 1 7 10 partner searching mating and contamination during mating sm10 a proportion of adult female fmate table 4 that was not mated mat false or that had exceeded the refractory period after a first mating was set to go to the nearest lek area each female chose and mated with one of the most competitive unmated males i e the ones who had released the most pheromone lekat the female immediately became mated mat true and the cpmat counter became equal to 1 if the selected male was sterile the matsterile counter incremented and if it was fertile the matwild counter incremented these counters respectively measured the number of matings with sterile males and the number of matings with wild males if the male was contaminated there was a probability trf table 4 that the female became also contaminated in that case the number of spores transmitted to the female by the donor male was calculated by s p f s p m s p d where spm was the percentage of spores transmitted during mating and spd was the number of spores of the donor male table 4 the male became mated mat true and its residual spore number became ns p d s p d s p f 2 1 7 11 preoviposition period and laying sm11 a female that

where matwild and matsterile were counters see sm10 the number of eggs laid by a female nfegg was the sum of the numbers of viable and non viable eggs the number of eggs deposited on the cells npegg was considered to be the sum of the viable egg only 2 2 simulations 2 2 1 validation experiment the data for validation came from three studied orchards located in the niayes area of senegal for each orchard the host plant composition of surrounding orchards recorded in a database of orchard monitored in the niayes area in 2011 within a radius of 275m around the centre was considered to define the landscape cropping system type to which the orchards belong the mango cultivars and other tree species of each of these landscapes matched with the composition of a boostit landscape an intensive landscape with only kent cultivar a low diversified landscape with mainly kent some other mango cultivars citrus and other tree and a high diversified landscape with many mango cultivars citrus and other trees the b dorsalis males captured with methyl eugenol traps were recorded weekly from january 2011 to december 2014 in the three chosen orchards the high diversified orchard had 2 traps the two others had three traps we first computed the mean daily number of trapped males per trap for each orchard then we computed the relative proportions of the number of males captured to the maximum number of annual captured males during each of the four years a running average over a 7 days window was computed across the 4 years of data to have a mean minimum and maximum relative number of captured flies per julian day the boostit simulations were done on 365 julian days from january the 1st for the three landscapes each run was replicated 100 times with input data as described in section 2 1 6 and parameters in table 4 we assume that the traps capture a proportion of the males present in the real orchards these data cannot be directly compared to the fly data simulated by the model to make a comparison the relative proportions to the maximum number of annual males in each of the two cases captured and simulated were used to validate our model we focused on the reproduction of four aspects of the time series 1 the sharp increase of population size at a given date 2 the time of the maximum population size peak 3 the decrease rate of the population after the peak 4 the differences between the three landscapes 2 2 2 scenarios of sterile fly releases to examine the effect of sit and boosted sit on the fly population dynamics and the infested fruit abundance we simulated three scenarios with the intensive landscape 1 a scenario of the fly population dynamics according to the resource availability and the daily temperature without management implementation 2 a scenario of the fly population dynamics under effects of sit 3 a scenario of the fly population dynamics under effects of boosted sit we chose the intensive landscape because for this paper we did not focus on the effect of the different landscapes on sit and boosted sit preliminary exploration of the parameters related to the release of sterile males allowed to choose a combination of values of these parameters that showed an effect of both sit and boosted sit on the amount of stung fruit the first release of sterile males was on day 153 rmt table 4 which corresponds to the beginning of june ten releases were done in total at an interval of 7 days nbrel and intrel table 4 males were released at the centre of each of the four orchards with a ratio sterile wild of 5 1 rsw table 4 we simulated the model with selected parameters following table 4 from january the 1st over 365 julian days for each simulation we made 100 replicates the mature wild adult number at each time step and the annual amount of fruit were recorded then we calculated the annual mean of the 50 replications for each output to obtain density per square meter measures the mean numbers of wild adult fly was first multiplied by the aggregation unit 100 and divided by the real area of the simulation landscape see section 2 1 2 3 results 3 1 model validation the dynamics of simulated males was close to that of males captured in niayes orchards fig 3 the simulated fly abundance was related to the host plant availability on day 160 when no mature mango of the kent cultivar occurred yet the simulated mean males number for the landscapes a b and c respectively were 1300 3000 and 3700 this presence of flies more pronounced in landscapes b and c was due to the abundance of alternative host plants that enabled flies to reproduce until the sensitive period of the kent cultivar this is why there was a faster increase in the number of simulated males in landscapes b and c than in landscape a this trend was also observed on field data with peaks occurring earlier on days 209 and 210 for b and c and later on days 223 for a in simulations the peak occurred around the 226th day for the three landscapes the predominance of kent in landscapes compared to other host plants strongly influenced the abundance of the flies hence the model successfully reproduced the sharp increase of population size for the three landscapes the timing of the population peak was well reproduced for landscape a but was not as good for the two other landscapes the decrease rate of the population after the peak was slower in the simulation than what was observed in the field 3 2 scenario simulations 3 2 1 reduction of fly abundance the exploration of fly abundance per square meter in the unmanaged scenario showed an important variation of mean values with a peak around the 234th julian day fig 4 as expected we observed a decrease in the density of flies when sterile males were released with a greater effect of boosted sit the mean peaks for the sit and boosted sit scenarios occurred on day 244 both techniques succeeded in delaying the fly peak by 10 days these delays were caused by the slower growth of populations under sit and boosted sit also limited by the beginning of the decrease of fruit availability after these peaks the number of flies decreased until the end of the year in all three scenarios as the resources for egg laying decreased we observed a faster decrease of wild adults in the case of boosted sit than in sit this was caused by mortality resulting from the contamination of wild adults by infected sterile males 3 2 2 reduction of stung fruit the amount of infested fruit was summarized at three julian dates table 5 these dates were chosen to refer to the end of harvesting in the niayes area for the exportation market july 16th the peak of adult flies when sterile males were released september 1st and the end of a simulation year december 31st the amount of infested fruits was reduced by about 30 when sterile contaminated or not males were released for all three dates table 5 the number of females was therefore reduced with both control methods boosted sit reduced the average and minimum values of stung fruits compared to the sit however the boosted sit sometimes increased the variability of outputs with higher maximums at the 197th and 244th days than sit this originated from additional random processes of contamination and mortality due to the pathogen the gain in the reduction of the number of flies with boosted sit seen in the previous section was largely reflected in the amount of stung fruit however in some simulations boosted sit was not successful because pathogen transmission was very low and mortality of sterile males was very high the fly population exploded and reached the peak more quickly than in the sit simulations see the maximum curve in fig 4 in the sit scenario the mortality of sterile males was very low so even if control was not entirely successful it could delay the peak compared to boosted sit when the peak was delayed the number of stung fruits was lower than when the peak occured early fig 5 hence the quantity of stung fruits in the boosted sit scenario was higher than in the sit scenario 4 discussion we developed the agent based model boostit to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations of the oriental fruit fly in heterogeneous landscapes under the influence of resource availability and releases of sterile males the simulated dynamics of fruit flies was consistent with that observed in the field then we compared three scenarios in the monocultivar landscape no release of sterile males release of sterile males and release of sterile and contaminated males results showed that sit and boosted sit can significantly reduce the abundance of flies in orchards especially with the boosted sit option we also observed a decrease in the amount of infested fruits but with high variability between simulations of the boosted sit scenario the boostit model allowed an in depth representation of interactions between flies and with their environment as the success of the pathogen transmission relied on them we used time series of daily temperature and maturity probability of the mango cultivars and citrus measured in the niayes area the maps used to build landscapes were simplified from three orchards mapped in the same area with realistic and various host tree spatial distributions and composition an interesting aspect of our pom approach is that we used spatial and temporal information to design our model but only temporal information for validation adjusting complex agent based models on time series is challenging e g wiegand et al 1998 piou and prévost 2012 however in our case the population dynamics following field data emerge from the interactions between individual fly and the fruit resource phenology relying on observed patterns optimize the structure and reduce parameter uncertainty of agent based models grimm et al 2005 the complexity of boostit with 11 sub models and almost 60 parameters allowed a satisfactory level of realism it was important for us to represent many detailed processes to answer the questions related to the boosted sit for b dorsalis in the niayes area we started our modelling process by selecting some available empirical and expert knowledge as the development progressed we added processes that were relevant to modelling goals our model had become so complex with integrated knowledge that it could be considered a kids keep it descriptive stupid model edmond sand moss 2005 however the kids approach proposes to start with a model that includes all variables and mechanisms that appear relevant and then remove the ones that do not add to the quality of the model in our case we did not use the validation patterns to remove processes as the kids approach proposes mainly because we wished boostit to be as generic as possible to be used in other contexts and scenarios boostit represents the spatial distribution of host trees and the related life history events and movements of flies with inter individual interactions in lek areas and during reproduction the construction of the three types of landscapes allowed us to evidence variations of fly abundance according to the quantity and carrying capacity of host fruits to evaluate the success of sit and boosted sit we focused on the simple monocultivar landscape including landscape heterogeneity in the model will serve to explore further the management techniques of b dorsalis as was shown for the control of many other insect pests e g huang et al 2017 we also plan to explore the consequences of applying the sit or boosted sit in one or two orchards instead of the four orchards of a landscape for these two objectives deeper explorations of the sit and boosted sit will be conducted our model validation based on comparisons with captured males pheromone traps in different landscapes was the result of the interaction of several processes represented in boostit we used a visual method of comparison of our model dynamics with real world data as adopted by yonow et al 2004 and garcía adeva and al 2012 on capture data of b tryoni because we were interested in the general pattern of the dynamic of fruit fly abundance yonow and al 2004 and garcía adeva and al 2012 observed discrepancies between the predicted and observed numbers of flies but their host plants phenological patterns used in their models were approximately correct this same situation was observed in the validation of our model though male capture data and the results of our simulation were expressed as a percentage of the maximum to compare them the decrease rate after the peak was slower in the simulation than what was observed in the field this could be explained by the effect of management methods used in orchards and natural regulation by predators as noted in our simulation results early population growth was linked to early maturing host fruits the first process explaining the landscape differences is the availability of the resource for egg laying the earlier maturation dynamics of citrus compared to mango allowed diversified landscapes to have early population growth all our different mango cultivars had the same initial carrying capacity because little data on egg laying preferences and larval performance of b dorsalis between mango cultivars were found however diatta et al 2013 showed no differences of emerged adults per fruit between the kent keitt and bdh cultivars the availability of resources was the main factor influencing the abundance of flies with more flies when many ripe fruits were available schwarzmueller and al 2019 developed a spatially explicit model to predict the population dynamics of b tryoni they found that abundance of b tryoni was affected by resource compositions in our model differences in the simulated landscapes are probably linked to these differences of fruit phenology and carrying capacity the second process influencing fly phenology is the thermal dependency of the development survival and reproduction performances of b dorsalis we have a high degree of confidence in our functions because this strong dependence on temperature was demonstrated in different countries under laboratory conditions by yang et al 1994 salum et al 2014 and dongmo et al 2021 and field conditions by chen et ye 2007 the relative humidity was not included we have supposed that in our chosen orchards humidity is favorable throughout the year because of the irrigation systems used from march to august these provide favorable humidity for flies while waiting for the rainy season de villiers et al 2015 the temperature regime used in the presented simulation of boostit were obtained from the niayes area it will be interesting in further work to explore how temperature regimes may influence population dynamics in different latitudes the entomopathogen metharizium anisopliae was represented in boostit as a number of spores that were introduced in the simulation by the sterile contaminated males and were transferred during flies interactions each released sterile male had its spore number that decreased when it joined a lek and when it mated until it died by representing the spores we brought more realism to the m anisopliae transfer unlike bacteria or virus borned diseases a fly contaminated with m anisopliae does not contaminate other flies until it dies because if it survives a long time it may not have enough spores to transfer the fatal dose to others it was demonstrated that an inoculated fly could transfer the m anisopliae to at least 3 mating lines of flies of the opposite sex before they died dimbi et al 2013 this situation is reproduced by boostit the mortality of contaminated sterile males being low during the first three days after their release they actively transmit the pathogen it was proven that m anisopliae is pathogenic for b dorsalis ekesi et al 2011 tora and azerefegn 2021 however for modelling purposes some lacking pieces of knowledge could have been very helpful for example we did not find any published data on the minimal spore dose of the entomopathogen that can kill the fly knowledge on the effects of temperature or relative humidity on the efficacy of the entomopathogen on flies in a natural environment would be very useful too this information could provide more precision on our contamination process by modifying the values of some parameters boostit could also simulate outbreaks caused by other entomopathogenic fungi such as beauveria bassiana our results showed that both the boosted sit and the sit could reduce the population size of b dorsalis with a better effect of boosted sit models of pleydell and bouyer 2019 and haramboure et al 2020 also predict this result for a population of aedes with the pyriproxyfen that targets the juvenile stage in our model m anisopliae exerts its effect on the adult stage of the fly only without any vertical transmission also it was demonstrated on a grasshopper that when an insect dies from m anisopliae contamination this last emerges from the cadaver and sporulates if experiencing favorable climatic conditions arthurs et al 2001 thus to improve the effectiveness of the boosted sit on the reduction of the fly population it would be interesting to see if the dead flies falling to the ground would be able to contaminate the pupas pleydell and bouyer 2019 and haramboure et al 2020 have considered different sterile male competitiveness and demonstrated that boosted sit supported lower competitiveness of sterile males than the sit unlike aedes albopictus b dorsalis has a lek mating system where males participate in aggressive encounters with other males to defend sites from which to signal and court females these in turn actively choose the most competitive males as partners hendrichs et al 2002 we know that laboratory reared b dorsalis can be fed with methyl eugenol and be particularly competitive at lek time shelly 1995 orankanok et al 2013 thus in our model we assumed that sterile males are released with a high competitiveness level this promotes boosted sit and sit and sterile males have a strong chance to transmit the entomopathogenic fungi further exploration of the model could consider to which level of competitiveness the sterile males could be reduced with still satisfactory results of the boosted sit the sit and the boosted sit reduced and delayed the peak of fly population since the introduction of the oriental fruit fly mango producers harvest at an early maturity stage to avoid fruit fly infestation wangithi et al 2021 in senegal the harvest period of the kent cultivar generally lasts about one month so delay of 10 days allowed by the two control techniques is an important time saving to harvest non stung fruits the reduction of fly abundance with boosted sit and sit was not reflected in the same way on the number of stung fruits this is a non intuitive result with fewer flies one logically expects to have fewer damages this suggests that looking at other aspects in addition to pest population size is very helpful to assess the success of the two control techniques most of the mathematical models assessed the success of the sit by looking at the reduction of the population size only cai et al 2014 evans and bishop 2014 some authors like mishra et al 2018 evaluated the success of the sit on mosquitoes by looking at the disappearance or the persistence of the dengue fever william et al 2020 proposed control methods of sit that allow reducing the mosquito population and the number of infected humans to the zika virus it would be very useful to know from the models how much for example a 20 reduction in the fly population could reduce the amount of infested fruits such information could allow an optimization of the resources that are deployed for the management of the pest we chose an initial number of flies in our simulations to have enough of them surviving the period without available resources this choice had been motivated by simulations with the intensive landscape where there is no alternative host fruit before the kent maturity stage another way to proceed could be to estimate the fly population density in the landscape by the mark recapture method chailleux et al 2021 ito et al 2021 the principle of this method consists of calculations based on the recapture of a percentage of marked and previously released insects despite not using this methodology our model still succeeded in maintaining the fly population from year to year the existence of this residual population shows that b dorsalis can survive in the niayes area of senegal for a long time when climatic conditions are not optimal and resources are not available this is a new understanding of the invasion of this species in senegal it confirms previous studies de villiers et al 2015 magagula et al 2015 that used two different programs climex and maxent to show the capacities of b dorsalis to extend its distribution area despite sub optimal conditions as long as irrigation is applied it could be interesting to evaluate this in other places where b dorsalis recently arrived to our knowledge there are no data available on the predation rates of the fly thus the fly mortality rate due to predation was not included some vertebrates birds bats rodents eat aborted fruits on the ground or ripe on the tree in the process they consume larvae contained in the fruits also some insects such as weaver ants prey on larvae and pupae diame l et al 2015 the mortality of eggs and larvae due to larval competition has not been included in boostit unlike in the models of yonow et al 2004 and garcía adeva et al 2012 there is no consideration of a density dependence because the information on larval density for the mango case in the niayes area was not sufficient however we defined a carrying capacity for host plant patches which makes that females could no longer lay eggs when the maximum carrying capacity was reached research on these different mortalities and the density dependence would be very useful to improve the model because they could reduce the fly population size for the moment boostit does not include other control methods of b dorsalis like traps or orchard sanitation wangithi et al 2021 future developments could consider them in the context of studying the inclusion of boosted sit in integrated pest management against b dorsalis we have been able to use the available data to simulate the dynamics of the fly population in mango orchards under releases of sterile males and sterile contaminated males the overall degree of correspondence between the model results and the field data and its ability to simulate sit and boosted sit scenarios suggest that the processes and parameters that drive the model are quite robust further research on some of the points described above would improve the model as well as our understanding of the pathogen transmission additionally boostit can be adapted to other fruit flies or other climatic contexts we expect boostit to become a useful tool to assist in the implementation

24444,the sterile insect technique sit is a method of biological control of pests and disease vector insects it includes mass rearing and release of sterile males of the target species so that wild females mated with sterile males would not produce offspring an innovative version of this technique called boosted sit relies on the use of sterile males as vectors of biocides to trigger an epizootic in the wild fruit fly population we built an agent based model to assess the feasibility of this technique and main modalities of field implementation for the control of the oriental fruit fly bactrocera dorsalis using the entomopathogenic fungi metarizhium anisopliae as a biocide the model called boostit bactrocera dorsalis boosted sit simulates the spatio temporal population dynamics of fruit flies in three different realistic landscape contexts the releases of infected and uninfected sterile males were simulated and allowed the transmission of the pathogen within the wild fly population as a result of interactions between individuals a main output was the measurement of losses in mango production validation of the model was done by comparing the simulated population dynamics with data from field monitoring pheromone traps in three landscapes of the niayes area in senegal the population dynamics of wild flies were then simulated in an intensive cropping and mono mango cultivar landscape under three scenarios 1 without the release of sterile males 2 with the release of non contaminated sterile males sit and 3 with the release of sterile contaminated males boosted sit the results showed that sit and boosted sit strongly reduced the density of wild flies and the amount of infested fruits although parameters of the pathogen transfer between individuals need to be studied more deeply results encourage the implementation of field trials to validate the efficacy of boosted sit to control fruit flies keywords population dynamics pattern oriented modelling pest management entomovectoring bactrocera dorsalis metarhizium anisopliae 1 introduction the sterile insect technique sit is a biological control method that was proposed by knipling in the 1950s klassen et al 2021 it is defined as a method of pest control using area wide inundative releases of sterile insects to reduce reproduction in a field population of the same species sit represents therefore a type of birth control in which wild female insects do not reproduce when they are inseminated by released sterilized males in this type of autocidal control sequential releases of the sterilized insects in adequate sterile to wild male overflooding ratio lead to a reduction in the pest population effective control using sterile males is achieved as part of area wide integrated pest management aw ipm programs the sit was first developed in usa about fifty years ago dyck et al 2021 it is currently applied worldwide and the four strategic options in which sterile insects are being deployed as a component of aw ipm for insect pest control are suppression eradication containment and prevention dyck et al 2021 the sit has been applied to a number of species of fruit flies moths mosquitoes tsetse flies and screwworm flies sit was first successfully applied to eradicate the new world screwworm cochliomyia hominivorax coquerel 1958 in 1954 in curaçao north america baumhover et al 1955 it has proven successful for the management of fruit flies of economic importance worldwide including prevention e g ceratitis capitata wiedmann 1824 in california anastrepha ludens loew 1873 in texas containment e g c capitata in guatemala and mexico eradication e g bactrocera cucurbitae coquillet 1899 in japan or c capitata in chile or suppression e g c capitata in south africa israel spain and hawaï bactrocera spp in thailand orankanok et al 2007 enkerlin 2021 to improve the efficiency of the sit the entomovectoring technique proposes the use of sterile insects entomo as vectors vectoring of a biocide to one or more targeted life stages of a pest population hokkanen and menzler hokkanen 2007 this is known as boosted sit bouyer and lefrançois 2014 bouyer et al 2016 used this concept on sterile male mosquitoes coated with pyriproxyfen that contaminated females that could in turn contaminate the larval habitats this technique has shown its potential in coffee growing areas in guatemala where c capitata sterile males inoculated with beauveria bassiana balsamo crivelli vuillemin 1912 transmitted spores to 44 of the captured wild males flores et al 2013 the application of this technique for a given pest in a given area requires knowledge of the life history system of target pests lance and mcinnis 2021 to consider how the interactions between individuals and their environment may promote or hinder the boosted sit modelling is a relevant tool as it can generate scenarios that can reduce incertitude and guide field experiments many models have been built to answer issues on the effectiveness of sit most focused on release strategies cai et al 2014 strugarek 2019 the sterility level of sterile males barclay 1982 kean et al 2011 the competitiveness of sterile males and mating preference of females vreysen et al 2006 chargui et al 2018 their movement and dispersal sometimes including the impact of spatial structure of the environment tyson et al 2007 dufourd and dumont 2013 other studies have looked at the economic cost of sit thomé et al 2010 ramirez and gordillo 2016 and its combination with other control methods barclay and vreysen 2011 douchet et al 2021 for the boosted sit two modelling studies evaluated the feasibility of the approach using pyriproxyfen with aedes spp mosquitoes pleydell and bouyer 2019 developed a mathematical model to evaluate the gain of the boosted sit over conventional sit they showed that boosted sit reduced mosquito suppression time and required fewer males to be released including environmental conditions in their mathematical model haramboure et al 2020 found that boosted sit could increase the effectiveness of the sit when sterile males are not very competitive most of the models that we reviewed on both techniques are mathematical population level models and focus on mosquitoes few of them 11 are generic while only 23 target pests such as fruit flies tsetse flies or lepidopterans rather than mosquitoes in the present study the oriental fruit fly bactrocera dorsalis hendel 1912 was selected as a model system originally from asia b dorsalis was first reported on the african continent in kenya lux et al 2003 initially thought to be a new species b invadens schutze et al 2015 after its detection the pest rapidly spread to several african countries including senegal where it was reported in 2004 manrakhan et al 2015 it is highly polyphagous and considerable damages have been observed in mango orchards since its introduction rwomushana et al 2008 damage is caused when females lay their eggs in the fruit the larvae feed on it making the fruit rot and inedible badii et al 2015 these losses have a great socio economic impact on people in rural and urban communities involved in the mango value chains across africa wangithi et al 2021 in addition the presence of the pest limits farmers access to export markets as it is classified as an organism under quarantine restrictions by most countries in the world clarke 2005 badii et al 2015 this led many producers to apply insecticides that are hazardous to the environment and health of users and consumers wangithi et al 2021 various control tools have been proposed to growers or tested by research and extension services in africa early harvesting male annihilation technique mat protein bait spot treatments auto disseminating of fungal pathogen using traps mass trapping or the sit sutantawong et al 2002 mwatawala et al 2015 faye et al 2016 wangithi et al 2021 however b dorsalis remains a critical issue in fruit and vegetable production in african countries the understanding of the population dynamics and dispersal abilities can be very useful to develop appropriate control strategies including those that are area wide such as sit hendrichs et al 2020 thus the dynamics and the potential distribution of b dorsalis or related fruit flies have been predicted by various populational models yonow et al 2004 presented and simulated with dymex a mathematical model describing the population dynamics of bactrocera tryoni froggatt 1897 according to temperature precipitation and humidity stephens et al 2007 and de villiers et al 2015 used climex to study the effects of climate on the distribution and relative abundance of b dorsalis they showed that tropical and subtropical climates except the desert as well as warm temperate areas are favorable for b dorsalis to predict the potential distribution of b dorsalis liu et al 2011 magagula et al 2015 and qin et al 2019 used the maxent software for the same purpose gutierrez et al 2021 used weather driven physiologically based demographic models the sit has been tested to control b dorsalis with other monitoring and control methods in thailand this study was conducted in pilot programs at the orchard level in ratchaburi province from 1999 to 2000 sutantawong et al 2002 and from 2000 to 2004 orankanok et al 2007 and in the phichit province from 2003 to 2004 orankanok et al 2007 from 2008 to 2013 an aw ipm program using the sit was implemented in the chantaburi province chinvinijkul et al 2019 these programs were effective in controlling the fruit fly and fruit infestations were reduced by at least 50 in all targeted areas to our knowledge control programs including boosted sit have not been yet carried out on b dorsalis even if the use of entomopathogenic fungi like metarhizium anisopliae metchnikoff sorokin 1883 or beauvaria bassiana for the control of tephritid is gaining interest in the scientific community several studies explored the use of some m anisopliae isolates for the control of many fruit fly species ekesi et al 2002 quesada moraga et al 2006 2008 dimbi et al 2009 2013 sookar et al 2014 onsongo et al 2019 when the spores of m anisopliae come into contact with the cuticle of the insect they germinate and penetrate it if the fungus overcomes the insect s defences it grows leads to the death of the insect and then external sporulation follows zimmermann 2007 on b dorsalis ouna et al 2010 ekesi et al 2011 and tora and azerefegn 2021 showed that m anisopliae induce high mortality and inoculated sterile or wild fly males could successfully interact with other flies thus they could transfer the fungus to wild flies during mating mating attempts and male interactions novelo rincón et al 2009 flores et al 2013 sookar et al 2014 agent based modelling has been increasingly used to represent insect pest population dynamics and control techniques e g manoukis and colliers 2021 manoukis and hoffman 2014 the present study presents boostit bactrocera dorsalis boosted sit an agent based model that aims to test the performance of sit using b dorsalis sterile males coated with the entomopathogenic fungi metarhizium anisopliae when released in mango orchards of the niayes region of senegal to enhance the realism of the model we based it on the approach of pattern oriented modelling pom that uses real patterns for designing testing and parameterizing models pom attempts to optimize model complexity and reduce uncertainty as it relies on additional data contained in observed patterns these patterns are defined as a characteristic clearly identifiable structure in nature itself or in the data extracted from nature they also provide information on the essential properties of a system grimm et al 1996 wiegand et al 2003 grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2013 pom explicitly refers to spatial and temporal scales and produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field grimm et al 1996 pom is useful for all types of modelling in the case of agent based models also called individual based models in ecology grimm et al 2005 patterns can guide model structure by showing what kinds of entities need to be considered and what state variables are needed grimm and railsback 2013 using pom for development the model was designed to integrate strong knowledge on the biology and ecology of b dorsalis their dependence on climatic conditions and the phenology of different host plants in the niayes landscape the model was evaluated using field data collected over 4 years in the niayes area we then compared sterile male release scenarios to study their effect on the b dorsalis population dynamics 2 materials and

cells fig 2 three types of landscapes of 30 25 ha each with 11 11 cells of 2500 m2 50 50 m were available 1 the monocultivar landscape that formed a landscape of four intensive orchards 2 the low diversified landscape that formed a landscape of two intensive orchards an extensive orchard and a diversified orchard 3 the high diversified landscape that formed a landscape of one intensive orchard an extensive orchard and two diversified orchards intensive orchards i e intensive cropping system were considered as monocultivar orchards of high density of kent mango trees extensive orchards i e extensive cropping system were made of different cultivars of mango trees and few citrus trees planted at lower density diversified i e diversified cropping system orchards were characterized by egual presence of mango trees of different cultivars and citrus trees these orchard types followed the classification of grechi et al 2013 the spatial extent of these orchards 6 25ha corresponded to realistic senegalese orchards in boostit they were built with a random spatial distribution of the plant types typ from existing proportions of host plants in real orchards from the niayes area in senegal sarron et al 2018 we assumed that an average fruit tree covered 25 m² so there were 100 trees per cell the simulation area was with closed borders moving flies could not go out of the landscape the model did not consider emigration nor immigration time was simulated discretely through daily time steps and the horizon of a simulation was a maximum of 1 year 365 time steps one fly agent in the model was considered to represent 100 flies of the same gender and life stage in the real world this choice was a good compromise between computation capacities and realism in terms of population structure and size 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling a simulation of the boostit model began by selecting a type of landscape and by reading a csv file containing the daily temperature and the ripening period of the fruits of different mango trees cultivars see initialization at each time step processes were run in the following order table 1 1 reading input data and calculation of the ripening period of the host plants 2 the growth and survival processes of the fly 3 adults that received the minimum dose of infecting spores became infected 4 the healthy sterile or infected sterile males were released at a chosen date 5 adults that had not mated had a random movement 6 lek areas were determined 7 adult males first increased their attractiveness and then moved to the lek area if there were males carrying pathogens in leks they could transmit some of them to some healthy males 8 some females that had already mated may mate again after a refractory period 9 some flies died from the infection 10 a part of female visited the leks in turn and each one chose a male among the most competitive ones and mated with him if the male carried pathogens he transmitted some of them to the female 11 females that had mated and had passed the preoviposition period laid eggs in cells containing fruit for the infection time counter to start on the day after contamination the processes of releasing sterile and infected males contamination in leks and contamination during mating came after the infection process these processes are detailed in section 7 sub models 2 1 4 design concepts 2 1 4 1 basic principles the boostit model is based on the representation of an epizooty within the population the individual fly centred approach favoured the representation of fine local interactions influencing the life histories of the flies and the transmission of pathogens 2 1 4 2 emergence explosive population dynamics emerged from simulated demographic processes at the individual level the propagation of the disease emerged from inter individual interactions 2 1 4 3 perception male individuals perceived the cells with plants containing methyl eugenol php true and moved to them to increase their attractiveness they also perceived potential lek areas see sm7 females could perceive leks and cells from a distance equal to their perception radius and on which they could lay eggs see sm10 sm11 females perceived the males but these could not perceive them see sm10 2 1 4 4 interactions interactions were multiple at the inter individual level and between individual and environmental cells males fertile and sterile visited cells containing methyl eugenol to increase their attractiveness and to form lek areas a female chose a male partner from the most attractive ones before mating fertilized females laid their eggs in cells containing ripe fruit infected flies could infect other flies during contact in leks or while mating 2 1 4 5 stochasticity stochasticity of the model was found both at the initialization and in the dynamics initially adult flies were distributed equitably in the four orchards of the landscape but they positioned themselves on the orchard cells in a random way according to a homogeneous process of spatial poisson distribution the fly s survival was a bernoulli variable at each stage of life a fly could either live or die the selection of the number of flies that died each day or that grew to a higher stage was also a random process see sm2 the number of females and males visiting the lek areas was determined by a bounded random rate see sm7 and sm10 the number of females re mating was randomly selected from those that had already mated see sm8 if healthy and infected males met in a lek the selection of healthy males to contaminate was a random process see sm7 the same applied to the contamination of males and females through mating see sm10 the mortality of infected adult flies was also a random process see sm9 the cells of a host plant that would produce mature fruits were chosen randomly the position of the lek areas on cells with mango trees was random unmated adults also had a random movement see sm5 2 1 4 6 observation during a simulation of boostit the following output variables were monitored graphically on the interface the number of adult flies the total number of released sterile or sterile and infected males the number of infected flies the quantities of stung fruit per species and per cultivar the total quantity of infested mango fruits was calculated by summing the quantities of stung fruit for each cell where eggs were laid the quantity of stung mango fruits for a cell was calculated by the following equation s f a s f ln n p e g g b s f n p f r u i t 100 where a s f and b s f were parameters table 4 n p e g g was the counter of the viable egg number deposited in the given cell see sm11 n p f r u i t was a parameter giving a mean number of mango fruits per cell and per cultivar table 4 here the number of viable eggs deposited in the cell see sm11 was used because fruits containing eggs that would not hatch were not considered as damage in addition 5 global variables stored the values of the numbers of wild flies and stung fruits at peaks the dates of these peaks and the annual amount of stung fruit which was the sum of all patches of stung fruit during 365 days 2 1 5 initialization 2 1 5 1 landscape at t 0 the orchard cells had different egg laying carrying capacities mep depending on the type of host plant typ it was equal to ackn for kent acki for keitt acbdh for bdh acom for other mango cultivars and acc for citrus table 4 to calculate the carrying capacity we used the maximum number of flies per kilogram of mangoes 130 adults given by rwomushana et al 2008 we supposed that a kilogram of mangoes is composed of two fruits so we had 65 adults fruit then the egg laying carrying capacity per fruit was calculated by adding to the number of adults per fruit the proportion of eggs that did not reach the adult stage 45 given by ekesi et al 2006 to compute the carrying capacity of a cell we multiplied the carrying capacity of a fruit by the number of fruits per cell n p f r u i t table 4 due to a lack of knowledge on laying preferences the same carrying capacity was considered for all cultivars of mango trees ackn acki acbdh acom the same computation was done for the carrying capacity of citrus the methyl eugenol presence variable php was set to true for all cells with mango or citrus trees see sm7 2 1 5 2 fly a simulation was typically initialized with the number of adult flies finit table 4 flies were distributed equally in the four orchards with a female male ratio fmr see table 4 2 1 6 inputs boostit took as input a file that contained time series representing the evolution of the following data over a year the date in julian day the mean daily temperature the ripening period of different mango cultivars and citrus as infestation increased as fruits ripened grechi et al 2021 this period was considered the mango ripening period ripe and over ripened stages these different fruits were grouped under the following categories the mango cultivars kent keitt bdh bouko diekhal the other mango trees and the citrus the daily temperature came from the average of three years of data of a weather station hobo

data file arrived the proportion of cells of this plant type that would produce mature fruits frt true was given by a rate chosen in the range of 0 to pm following a uniform distribution considering

containing ripe and over ripened fruit and during this period females could lay their eggs in the cell when the counter reached the ripening time mlkn or mlki or mlbdh or mlom or mlc table 4 we supposed that the trees had lost their fruits frt false so no more eggs could be laid in that cell until the following year 2 1 7 2 life cycle sm2 2 1 7 2 1 development the fruit fly had 5 developmental stages egg larva pupa immature adult mature adult garcía adeva et al 2012 each individual of the immature stage had a daily development rate δf and a cumulative development level dev that allowed it to move on to the next stage at each time step the model calculated for each individual its daily development rate δf based on daily temperature table 2 this δf was then incrementing the variable dev d e v t 1 δ f d e v t and when dev was greater than or equal to 1 the fly moved on to the next stage 2 1 7 2 2 mortality the model included two types of fly mortality the establishment mortality em applied to the immature stages of the fly when they entered a given stage and the daily mortality dm which varied with temperature t table 3 and was applied to all stages at each time step these mortality events were simulated using a random selection based on a uniform distribution in intervals from 0 to em and 0 to dm respectively 2 1 7 3 b dorsalis infection sm3 flies carrying pathogens became infected if their number of spores sp was greater than the minimum number of spores required to cause the death of the fly spmin table 4 the counter of days of infected fly inft was incremented from the time step following infection 2 1 7 4 sterile male release sm4 when the simulation day corresponded to the first release day chosen rmt table 4 sterile adult males were released these males were released by cells chosen either at the centre or at four points in the 4 orchards of the landscape they had at that moment the maximum degree of attractiveness a t s m a t m a x table 4 this supposes that sterile males were fed with methyl eugenol before their release to make them equally or more competitive than wild males orankanok et al 2013 they were either healthy meaning that they did not carry the pathogen or infected meaning that they carried the pathogen the number of sterile males to be released rmnb was calculated by r m n b w m t r s w where wmt was the number of wild males present in the landscape at the release time rsw was the ratio of sterile males by wild males desired for release table 4 the maximum number of sterile males to be released was rmmax and the minimum was rmmin table 4 these limits were added to avoid the release of too few or too many sterile males making the model outputs unrealistic two release modalities were possible for a landscape on the one hand for the one zone option the number of sterile males was divided by 4 and then the cell in the centre of each orchard of the landscape released 1 4 of the number of sterile males on the other hand for the multi zone option the number of sterile males was divided by 16 and four cells of each orchard of the landscape were picked to release each 1 16 from the number of sterile males the number of releases was defined as nbrel and the time interval between releases as intrel table 4 for sterile and infected males the number of spores on each of them followed a normal distribution with a mean smsp and standard deviation sdsp table 4 2 1 7 5 random move sm5 although b dorsalis can fly for many kilometres we assume that it can also restrict its movements in a favourable environment fletcher 1987 for this study long distance fly migrations were not included in the simulated landscape to simulate the dispersion ability of b dorsalis this submodel of random move is called for all adult immature or mature flies that were not mated the previous time step these flies were set to follow a random movement in the orchard they turn left or right between 0 and 180 degrees and then move forward for 50 m this random move led some flies to cross the boundary cells separating the orchards of the landscape but could not go out of the landscape 2 1 7 6 lek setup

not fixed they changed at each time step 2 1 7 7 pre coupling behaviour of males and contamination in lek sm7 before mating adult males sterile or not that entered a cell with methyl eugenol increased their attractiveness of a rate incat table 4 this was based on the fact that plant products containing methyl eugenol ingested by males are incorporated into their sex pheromone making them more attractive to female flies clarke 2005 any adult male in the model could visit the nearest lek area to mate the proportion of male rmlek table 4 visiting lek each day was the result of random selection for each male following a uniform distribution over an interval from 0 to rmlek if a male took part in the courtship in the leks it released a part lekat table 4 of its attractiveness otherwise it continued to increase its attractiveness up to the maximum atmax table 4 if there were infected males in a lek they could transmit spores to a randomly chosen number of males according to a uniform distribution with a probability between zero and trc table 4 the number of spores collected by the recipient male was calculated by s p r s p c s p d where spc was the proportion of spores transmitted during male interactions in leks and spd was the number of spores from the donor male table 4 the remaining number of spores from the donor male was thus calculated by ns p d s p d s p r 2

mated mat true and the cpmat counter became equal to 1 if the selected male was sterile the matsterile counter incremented and if it was fertile the matwild counter incremented these counters respectively measured the number of matings with sterile males and the number of matings with wild males if the male was contaminated there was a probability trf table 4 that the female became also contaminated in that case the number of spores transmitted to the female by the donor male was calculated by s p f s p m s p d where spm was the percentage of spores transmitted during mating and spd

was considered to be the sum of the viable egg only 2 2 simulations 2 2 1 validation experiment the data for validation came from three studied orchards located in the niayes area of senegal for each orchard the host plant composition of surrounding orchards recorded in a database of orchard monitored in the niayes area in 2011 within a radius of 275m around the centre was considered to define the landscape cropping system type to which the orchards belong the mango cultivars and other tree species of each of these landscapes matched with the composition of a boostit landscape an intensive landscape with only kent cultivar a low diversified landscape with mainly kent some other mango cultivars citrus and other tree and a high diversified landscape with many mango cultivars citrus and other trees the b dorsalis males captured with methyl eugenol traps were recorded weekly from january 2011 to december 2014 in the three chosen orchards the high diversified orchard had 2 traps the two others had three traps we first computed the mean daily number of trapped males per trap for each orchard then we computed the relative proportions of the number of males captured to the maximum number of annual captured males during each of the four years a running average over a 7 days window was computed across the 4 years of data to have a mean minimum and maximum relative number of captured flies per julian day the boostit simulations were done on 365 julian days from january the 1st for the three landscapes each run was replicated 100 times with input data as described in section 2 1 6 and parameters in table 4 we assume that the traps capture a proportion of the males present in the real orchards these data cannot be directly compared to the fly data simulated by the model to make a comparison the relative proportions to the maximum number of annual males in each of the two cases captured and simulated were used to validate our model we focused on the reproduction of four aspects of the time series 1 the sharp increase of population size at a given date 2 the time of the maximum population size peak 3 the decrease rate of the population after the peak 4 the differences between the three landscapes 2 2 2 scenarios of sterile fly releases to examine the effect of sit and boosted sit on the fly population dynamics and the infested fruit abundance we simulated three scenarios with the intensive landscape 1 a scenario of the fly population dynamics according to the resource availability and the daily temperature without management implementation 2 a scenario of the fly population dynamics under effects of sit 3 a scenario of the fly population dynamics under effects of boosted sit we chose the intensive landscape because for this paper we did not focus on the effect of the different landscapes on sit and boosted sit preliminary exploration of the parameters related to the release of sterile males allowed to choose a combination of values of these parameters that showed an effect of both sit and boosted sit on the amount of stung fruit the first release of sterile males was on day 153 rmt table 4 which corresponds to the beginning of june ten releases were done in total at an interval of 7 days nbrel and intrel table 4 males were released at the centre of each of the four orchards with a ratio sterile wild of 5 1 rsw table 4 we simulated the model with selected parameters following table 4 from january the 1st over 365 julian days for each simulation we made 100 replicates the mature wild adult number at each time step and the annual amount of fruit were recorded then we calculated the annual mean of the 50 replications for each output to obtain density per square meter measures the mean numbers of wild adult fly was first multiplied by the aggregation unit 100 and divided by the real area of the simulation landscape see section 2 1 2 3 results 3 1 model validation the dynamics of simulated males was close to that of males captured in niayes orchards fig 3 the simulated fly abundance was related to the host plant availability on day 160 when no mature mango of the kent cultivar occurred yet the simulated mean males number for the landscapes a b and c respectively were 1300 3000 and 3700 this presence of flies more pronounced in landscapes b and c was due to the abundance of alternative host plants that enabled flies to reproduce until the sensitive period of the kent cultivar this is why there was a faster increase in the number of simulated males in landscapes b and c than in landscape a this trend was also observed on field data with peaks occurring earlier on days 209 and 210 for b and c and later on days 223 for a in simulations the peak occurred around the 226th day for the three landscapes the predominance of kent in landscapes compared to other host plants strongly influenced the abundance of the flies hence the model successfully reproduced the sharp increase of population size for the three landscapes the timing of the population peak was well reproduced for landscape a but was not as good for the two other landscapes the decrease rate of the population after the peak was slower in the simulation than what was observed in the field 3 2 scenario simulations 3 2 1 reduction of fly abundance the exploration of fly abundance per square meter in the unmanaged scenario showed an important variation of mean values with a peak around the 234th julian day fig 4 as expected we observed a decrease in the density of flies when sterile males were released with a greater effect of boosted sit the mean peaks for the sit and boosted sit scenarios occurred on day 244 both techniques succeeded in delaying the fly peak by 10 days these delays were caused by the slower growth of populations under sit and boosted sit also limited by the beginning of the decrease of fruit availability after these peaks the number of flies decreased until the end of the year in all three scenarios as the resources for egg laying decreased we observed a faster decrease of wild adults in the case of boosted sit than in sit this was caused by mortality resulting from the contamination of wild adults by infected sterile males 3 2 2 reduction of stung fruit the amount of infested fruit was summarized at three julian dates table 5 these dates were chosen to refer to the end of harvesting in the niayes area for the exportation market july 16th the peak of adult flies when sterile males were released september 1st and the end of a simulation year december 31st the amount of infested fruits was reduced by about 30 when sterile contaminated or not males were released for all three dates table 5 the number of females was therefore reduced with both control methods boosted sit reduced the average and minimum values of stung fruits compared to the sit however the boosted sit sometimes increased the variability of outputs with higher maximums at the 197th and 244th days than sit this originated from additional random processes of contamination and mortality due to the pathogen the gain in the reduction of the number of flies with boosted sit seen in the previous section was largely reflected in the amount of stung fruit however in some simulations boosted sit was not successful because pathogen transmission was very low and mortality of sterile males was very high the fly population exploded and reached the peak more quickly than in the sit simulations see the maximum curve in fig 4 in the sit scenario the mortality of sterile males was very low so even if control was not entirely successful it could delay the peak compared to boosted sit when the peak was delayed the number of stung fruits was lower than when the peak occured early fig 5 hence the quantity of stung fruits in the boosted sit scenario was higher than in the sit scenario 4 discussion we developed the agent based model boostit to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations of the oriental fruit fly in heterogeneous landscapes under the influence of resource availability and releases of sterile males the simulated dynamics of fruit flies was consistent with that observed in the field then we compared three scenarios in the monocultivar landscape no release of sterile males release of sterile males and release of sterile and contaminated males results showed that sit and boosted sit can significantly reduce the abundance of flies in orchards especially with the boosted sit option we also observed a decrease in the amount of infested fruits but with high variability between simulations of the boosted sit scenario the boostit model allowed an in depth representation of interactions between flies and with their environment as the success of the pathogen transmission relied on them we used time series of daily temperature and maturity probability of the mango cultivars and citrus measured in the niayes area the maps used to build landscapes were simplified from three orchards mapped in the same area with realistic and various host tree spatial distributions and composition an interesting aspect of our pom approach is that we used spatial and temporal information to design our model but only temporal information for validation adjusting complex agent based models on time series is challenging e g wiegand et al 1998 piou and prévost 2012 however in our case the population dynamics following field data emerge from the interactions between individual fly and the fruit resource phenology relying on observed patterns optimize the structure and reduce parameter uncertainty of agent based models grimm et al 2005 the complexity of boostit with 11 sub models and almost 60 parameters allowed a satisfactory level of realism it was important for us to represent many detailed processes to answer the questions related to the boosted sit for b dorsalis in the niayes area we started our modelling process by selecting some available empirical and expert knowledge as the development progressed we added processes that were relevant to modelling goals our model had become so complex with integrated knowledge that it could be considered a kids keep it descriptive stupid model edmond sand moss 2005 however the kids approach proposes to start with a model that includes all variables and mechanisms that appear relevant and then remove the ones that do not add to the quality of the model in our case we did not use the validation patterns to remove processes as the kids approach proposes mainly because we wished boostit to be as generic as possible to be used in other contexts and scenarios boostit represents the spatial distribution of host trees and the related life history events and movements of flies with inter individual interactions in lek areas and during reproduction the construction of the three types of landscapes allowed us to evidence variations of fly abundance according to the quantity and carrying capacity of host fruits to evaluate the success of sit and boosted sit we focused on the simple monocultivar landscape including landscape heterogeneity in the model will serve to explore further the management techniques of b dorsalis as was shown for the control of many other insect pests e g huang et al 2017 we also plan to explore the consequences of applying the sit or boosted sit in one or two orchards instead of the four orchards of a landscape for these two objectives deeper explorations of the sit and boosted sit will be conducted our model validation based on comparisons with captured males pheromone traps in different landscapes was the result of the interaction of several processes represented in boostit we used a visual method of comparison of our model dynamics with real world data as adopted by yonow et al 2004 and garcía adeva and al 2012 on capture data of b tryoni because we were interested in the general pattern of the dynamic of fruit fly abundance yonow and al 2004 and garcía adeva and al 2012 observed discrepancies between the predicted and observed numbers of flies but their host plants phenological patterns used in their models were approximately correct this same situation was observed in the validation of our model though male capture data and the results of our simulation were expressed as a percentage of the maximum to compare them the decrease rate after the peak was slower in the simulation than what was observed in the field this could be explained by the effect of management methods used in orchards and natural regulation by predators as noted in our simulation results early population growth was linked to early maturing host fruits the first process explaining the landscape differences is the availability of the resource for egg laying the earlier maturation dynamics of citrus compared to mango allowed diversified landscapes to have early population growth all our different mango cultivars had the same initial carrying capacity because little data on egg laying preferences and larval performance of b dorsalis between mango cultivars were found however diatta et al 2013 showed no differences of emerged adults per fruit between the kent keitt and bdh cultivars the availability of resources was the main factor influencing the abundance of flies with more flies when many ripe fruits were available schwarzmueller and al 2019 developed a spatially explicit model to predict the population dynamics of b tryoni they found that abundance of b tryoni was affected by resource compositions in our model differences in the simulated landscapes are probably linked to these differences of fruit phenology and carrying capacity the second process influencing fly phenology is the thermal dependency of the development survival and reproduction performances of b dorsalis we have a high degree of confidence in our functions because this strong dependence on temperature was demonstrated in different countries under laboratory conditions by yang et al 1994 salum et al 2014 and dongmo et al 2021 and field conditions by chen et ye 2007 the relative humidity was not included we have supposed that in our chosen orchards humidity is favorable throughout the year because of the irrigation systems used from march to august these provide favorable humidity for flies while waiting for the rainy season de villiers et al 2015 the temperature regime used in the presented simulation of boostit were obtained from the niayes area it will be interesting in further work to explore how temperature regimes may influence population dynamics in different latitudes the entomopathogen metharizium anisopliae was represented in boostit as a number of spores that were introduced in the simulation by the sterile contaminated males and were transferred during flies interactions each released sterile male had its spore number that decreased when it joined a lek and when it mated until it died by representing the spores we brought more realism to the m anisopliae transfer unlike bacteria or virus borned diseases a fly contaminated with m anisopliae does not contaminate other flies until it dies because if it survives a long time it may not have enough spores to transfer the fatal dose to others it was demonstrated that an inoculated fly could transfer the m anisopliae to at least 3 mating lines of flies of the opposite sex before they died dimbi et al 2013 this situation is reproduced by boostit the mortality of contaminated sterile males being low during the first three days after their release they actively transmit the pathogen it was proven that m anisopliae is pathogenic for b dorsalis ekesi et al 2011 tora and azerefegn 2021 however for modelling purposes some lacking pieces of knowledge could have been very helpful for example we did not find any published data on the minimal spore dose of the entomopathogen that can kill the fly knowledge on the effects of temperature or relative humidity on the efficacy of the entomopathogen on flies in a natural environment would be very useful too this information could provide more precision on our contamination process by modifying the values of some parameters boostit could also simulate outbreaks caused by other entomopathogenic fungi such as beauveria bassiana our results showed that both the boosted sit and the sit could reduce the population size of b dorsalis with a better effect of boosted sit models of pleydell and bouyer 2019 and haramboure et al 2020 also predict this result for a population of aedes with the pyriproxyfen that targets the juvenile stage in our model m anisopliae exerts its effect on the adult stage of the fly only without any vertical transmission also it was demonstrated on a grasshopper that when an insect dies from m anisopliae contamination this last emerges from the cadaver and sporulates if experiencing favorable climatic conditions arthurs et al 2001 thus to improve the effectiveness of the boosted sit on the reduction of the fly population it would be interesting to see if the dead flies falling to the ground would be able to contaminate the pupas pleydell and bouyer 2019 and haramboure et al 2020 have considered different sterile male competitiveness and demonstrated that boosted sit supported lower competitiveness of sterile males than the sit unlike aedes albopictus b dorsalis has a lek mating system where males participate in aggressive encounters with other males to defend sites from which to signal and court females these in turn actively choose the most competitive males as partners hendrichs et al 2002 we know that laboratory reared b dorsalis can be fed with methyl eugenol and be particularly competitive at lek time shelly 1995 orankanok et al 2013 thus in our model we assumed that sterile males are released with a high competitiveness level this promotes boosted sit and sit and sterile males have a strong chance to transmit the entomopathogenic fungi further exploration of the model could consider to which level of competitiveness the sterile males could be reduced with still satisfactory results of the boosted sit the sit and the boosted sit reduced and delayed the peak of fly population since the introduction of the oriental fruit fly mango producers harvest at an early maturity stage to avoid fruit fly infestation wangithi et al 2021 in senegal the harvest period of the kent cultivar generally lasts about one month so delay of 10 days allowed by the two control techniques is an important time saving to harvest non stung fruits the reduction of fly abundance with boosted sit and sit was not reflected in the same way on the number of stung fruits this is a non intuitive result with fewer flies one logically expects to have fewer damages this suggests that looking at other aspects in addition to pest population size is very helpful to assess the success of the two control techniques most of the mathematical models assessed the success of the sit by looking at the reduction of the population size only cai et al 2014 evans and bishop 2014 some authors like mishra et al 2018 evaluated the success of the sit on mosquitoes by looking at the disappearance or the persistence of the dengue fever william et al 2020 proposed control methods of sit that allow reducing the mosquito population and the number of infected humans to the zika virus it would be very useful to know from the models how much for example a 20 reduction in the fly population could reduce the amount of infested fruits such information could allow an optimization of the resources that are deployed for the management of the pest we chose an initial number of flies in our simulations to have enough of them surviving the period without available resources this choice had been motivated by simulations with the intensive landscape where there is no alternative host fruit before the kent maturity stage another way to proceed could be to estimate the fly population density in the landscape by the mark recapture method chailleux et al 2021 ito et al 2021 the principle of this method consists of calculations based on the recapture of a percentage of marked and previously released insects despite not using this methodology our model still succeeded in maintaining the fly population from year to year the existence of this residual population shows that b dorsalis can survive in the niayes area of senegal for a long time when climatic conditions are not optimal and resources are not available this is a new understanding of the invasion of this species in senegal it confirms previous studies de villiers et al 2015 magagula et al 2015 that used two different programs climex and maxent to show the capacities of b dorsalis to extend its distribution area despite sub optimal conditions as long as irrigation is applied it could be interesting to evaluate this in other places where b dorsalis recently arrived to our knowledge there are no data available on the predation rates of the fly thus the fly mortality rate due to predation was not included some vertebrates birds bats rodents eat aborted fruits on the ground or ripe on the tree in the process they consume larvae contained in the fruits also some insects such as weaver ants prey on larvae and pupae diame l et al 2015 the mortality of eggs and larvae due to larval competition has not been included in boostit unlike in the models of yonow et al 2004 and garcía adeva et al 2012 there is no consideration of a density dependence because the information on larval density for the mango case in the niayes area was not sufficient however we defined a carrying capacity for host plant patches which makes that females could no longer lay eggs when the maximum carrying capacity was reached research on these different mortalities and the density dependence would be very useful to improve the model because they could reduce the fly population size for the moment boostit does not include other control methods of b dorsalis like traps or orchard sanitation wangithi et al 2021 future developments could consider them in the context of studying the inclusion of boosted sit in integrated pest management against b dorsalis we have been able to use the available data to simulate the dynamics of the fly population in mango orchards under releases of sterile males and sterile contaminated males the overall degree of correspondence between the model results and the field data and its ability to simulate sit and boosted sit scenarios suggest that the processes and parameters that drive the model are quite robust further research on some of the points described above would improve the model as well as our understanding of the pathogen transmission additionally boostit can be adapted to other fruit flies or other climatic contexts we expect boostit to become a useful tool to assist in the implementation
