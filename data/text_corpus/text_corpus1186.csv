5930,investigating mixing processes between groundwater and surface water is important to manage groundwater system especially because the study site is located around a groundwater heat pump gwhp system at a riverside area external effects such as an operation of gwhp system and or river level fluctuations can disturb the water system it can result in artificial mixing of two water bodies thereby changing original hydrogeochemical and biological characteristics for this research a multi tracer approach combining strontium isotopes 222rn microbial communities and hydrochemical composition was undertaken for nineteen water samples to quantify how and to what extent mixing may occur due to external processes before this approach was applied the physical experiment using flowmeter was also conducted for defining the effects of dam discharge rates to the flow system estimated mixing ratios based on radon tracer showed spatio temporal variations influenced by the dam discharge rate seasonal effects and gwhp the average mixing ratio values by strontium tracer were in accordance with the results of radon tracer suggesting that a dual tracer approach would be a more reliable means mass transfer calculation indicated that spatio temporal variations in strontium isotopes were affected by hydrological events results from the microbial community using a heat map and principal coordinate analyses also supported the mixing process characteristics of the study area based on the results the interactive and dynamic mixing occurred in the riverside area in relation to external factors causing hydraulic disturbances and the mixing could be estimated from the combined application of isotopic tracers with microbial community keywords strontium isotopes radon mixing process microbial community a groundwater heat pump gwhp hydrochemistry 1 introduction groundwater surface water interactions and the associated variations in hydrogeochemical and biological factors have major impacts on the management of water resources hayashi and rosenberry 2002 kim et al 2018 may and winter 1999 sophocleous 2002 westbrook et al 2006 generally the hydrogeochemistry has been found to change along the path of a flowing water mass due to interactions with bedrock and mixing with other water bodies haque and johannesson 2006 therefore numerous studies have been conducted to trace groundwater surface water interactions using hydrogeochemical parameters including water isotopes cook and herczeg 2012 hunt et al 2005 katz et al 1997 kendall and caldwell 1998 zhu et al 2008 among such methods 222rn represents an environmental tracer with higher concentrations in groundwater than in surface water banks et al 1995 cook et al 2008 dimova and burnett 2011 dimova et al 2013 ellins et al 1990 it generally has a low concentration in surface water because the solubility of 226ra is low so it is useful for studies of groundwater surface water mixing however few studies have investigated the quantitative mixing process using radon as a tracer due to its short half life of 3 8 days and rapid degassing properties yu et al 2013 another isotope the sr isotope ratio 87sr 86sr has been also widely used to investigate water source changes négrel et al 2004 petrides and furnham 2006 water rock interactions frape et al 1984 frost and toner 2004 shand et al 2009 and groundwater mixing lyons et al 1995 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 but these isotopes have been applied in a few studies as an indicator of groundwater surface water mixing 87sr is derived from the slow decay t 4 8 1010 yr of 87rb and its content can be considered stable over observable time scales cook and herczeg 2012 thus sr isotopes can be used as another tracer for clarifying the mixing processes between two water bodies moreover combining two isotopes can allow for better understanding of such mixing processes in addition abundant and diverse microbes are the key to a functioning ecosystem in natural waters microorganisms form clusters in pursuit of a suitable environment in which to live due to the differing environments provided by groundwater and surface water microorganisms will cluster within each habitat and investigation of the microbial communities allows for differentiation among environments however this approach has been conducted only in limited studies of mixing zones therefore in this study a culture independent amplicon sequencing approach pyrosequencing was applied with hydrochemical analysis including that of environmental isotopes these mixing processes can be affected by numerous factors including natural events their interactions with the environment and anthropogenic effects especially at our study site groundwater is commonly used for groundwater heat pump gwhp systems water curtain cultivation and provision of drinking water meeting the water requirements of local residents the gwhp system is a centralheatingand or coolingsystemthat transfersheatto or from the ground using a water resource specifically these gwhp systems are open loop systems which pump and inject water between two or more wells this process affects the groundwater level around the system and its changes influence the operation of the system in addition the study site is located along a riverside which means that surface water contributes considerably to the local groundwater via inflow and therefore mixing between these two water bodies should be analyzed to ensure effective water resource management nearby dams also impact the flow rates between the two water bodies therefore groundwater surface water interactions at this study site should be investigated including consideration of various external factors consequently the aim of this study was to characterize and quantify mixing processes between groundwater and surface water while considering external factors using a new multi tracer approach here we integrate several proxies including elemental and isotope geochemistry 87sr 86sr ratios and 222rn concentrations with data regarding microbial communities this process is helpful for efficient management of groundwater systems in accordance with this primary objective our investigation was carried out via 1 describing the site characteristics with artificial hydraulic events using hydrogeochemical parameters and flowmeter measurements 2 quantifying mixing processes by calculating the mixing ratios of groundwater and surface water using 222rn and sr isotopes 3 deducing the hydrochemical variations of sr mass and isotopic ratio with the flow path using the mass transfer calculation and 4 conducting microbial analyses to reveal the distinctive and diverse communities of mixing zones 2 site description the study site is located at the confluence of the north han river and south han river where twenty two monitoring wells are installed around the han river environment research center hrerc fig 1 information about the hydrostratigraphic layers and well depth is provided in table s1 the groundwater hydraulic gradient is influenced by river flow the north han river flows from the chungpyung dam located to the north of the study site and the south han river flows from the paldang dam located to the southwest of the site fig 1 groundwater flows from north to south when the flow of the north han river is stronger and from south to north when the flow of the south han river is dominant downhole log data from twenty two wells indicate the presence of a highly permeable layer composed of coarse gravel and sandy sediments at depths of 14 17 m ministry of land infrastructure and maritime affairs 2008 this layer contains three distinct sections silty sand gravel and precambrian gneiss in order of increasing

operating since then with groundwater usage of 350 m3 day test operation was conducted in november 2014 the injection well and pumping well of the gwhp system are designated ysg 1 and ysg 3 respectively fig 1 the land around the study area consists of a cultivated area 90 of the island where water curtain cultivation is commonly employed with vinyl houses using thermal energy from the relatively warm groundwater for warmth to support cultivation during the cold winter months usually from november to mid march ministry of land infrastructure and maritime affairs 2015 3 water

δ r sample r standard 1 1000 and r represents 18o 16o or 2h 1h the radon concentrations of each water sample were measured for all sampling events except january 2016 using an rtm1688 2 radon and thoron monitor sarad germany sample water was placed in a 500 ml air bubbling flask connected to the monitor in a closed air loop measurements were taken at 15 min intervals after which an equilibrium value was obtained and adjusted for the short half life of radon for bacterial community analysis four groundwater and two surface water samples july and november 2014 were processed using 16s rrna

the groundwater flow direction and velocity and a physical based experiment were also performed to clarify the dynamic interactions between the two water bodies in the study area this experiment was conducted on august 20 2014 in three wells yso 1 yso 7 and yso 12 using aquavision colloidal borescopes geotech environmental equipment inc usa two instruments of the same type were used one was fixed in one well yso 1 as a standard point and the other was installed in wells yso 7 and yso 12 at different time periods am and pm the borescope probe was placed at 15 m b g l during the experiment the measured data were recorded automatically using a laptop computer prior to conducting the main experiment a pilot test was performed to determine the appropriate tracking configuration the optimal tracking settings were derived as follows minimum particle size 5 capture delay 5 0 0 particle sensitivity 1058 minimum velocity 2 maximum velocity 5 0 0 and data point frequency 2 more detailed

for fifteen parameters t ec do orp ph tds salinity k na ca mg cl so4 no3 and hco3 are summarized in table 1 concentrations of cl increased after gwhp operation march 2016 compared to those before gwhp operation february 2014 due to soil leaching during gwhp operation other parameters showed considerable changes due to gwhp operation during which do and orp decreased while ph increased table 1 these changes could be attributed to active pumping and injection of groundwater which accelerated the reduction of ferrous iron to ferric hydroxide in the surface environment and also resulted in surplus hydroxide increasing the ph of the reduced groundwater dinkel et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 chemical data from the water samples were plotted on a piper diagram before and after gwhp operation the groundwater in the study area is unclassified regarding chemical type most of the water samples belonged to the ca hco3 water type indicating dominant alkaline earth minerals with increased levels of alkali due to the prevalence of hco3 a small difference was observed between the two months with the data from march 2016 having a broader distribution of anions than those from february 2014 in total 18 groundwater wells and one surface water sample were analyzed for δ2h and δ18o in march 2016 the variations in δ2h and δ18o in the groundwater wells were small except for those from yso 10 the isotopic compositions of the groundwater ranged from 60 4 to 49 for δ18h and 8 77 and 7 7 for δ18o fig 3 a most samples fell near the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl for the rainy season indicating that the groundwater in the study area was recharged primarily during this season the lmwl for the rainy season in korea is δd 7 94 0 20 δ18o 8 84 1 47 lee et al 1999 well yso 11 showed the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values among all samples fig 3a samples plotted on a gibbs diagram were dispersed in the precipitation and water rock interaction areas except for the yso 11 sample collected prior to operation fig 3b the dominance of dissolved components such as ca na and tds values implies that the hydrochemical evolution of these sites was affected by minerals in rainfall and the bedrock in contrast the groundwater at the site of yso 11 had undergone different processes compared to other groundwater wells likely because this site lies near an agricultural area and houses used for water curtain cultivation therefore the yso 11 could be considered as an end member which has distinct characteristics compared to other groundwater wells 4 2 general groundwater surface water flow system for background information about the flow system at the study site flowmeter analysis was carried out during the season prior to gwhp operation august 2014 to determine how the flow direction was related to the discharge rates of two nearby dams paldang and chungpyung because pumping can affect the flow system this experiment was conducted without water sampling flowmeter results under two dam discharge rates are shown in fig 4 the experiment was conducted using wells yso 1 10 00 12 00 17 00 18 00 yso 7 12 47 17 14 and yso 12 10 00 12 24 before 10 00 the paldang dam discharged at a constant rate about 300 m3 s and no discharge was released from the chungpyung dam after that time discharge from the paldang dam increased to 800 m3 s the chungpyung dam also began to discharge causing strong flow from north to south after 12 00 fig 4a the paldang dam lies to the southwest and the chungpyung dam lies to the north of the study site fig 1 therefore the flow direction was from north to south when the discharge rates of both dams were high wells yso 1 and yso 12 showed regional variations in flow direction during the period 10 00 12 00 fig 4b after that time wells yso 1 and yso 7 showed strong flow in the direction of north to south due to the external factor of dam discharge fig 4c 4 3 quantifying the mixing ratio in the groundwater surface water interaction zone 4 3 1 radon concentration 222rn using radon concentrations measured in surface water and groundwater table s2 the mixing ratio was calculated for the interaction zone based on the measured data the trend in concentrations was independent of location meaning that wells near the river did not always show lower radon concentrations than those further from the river thus site characteristics should be considered when identifying the external factors affecting a sample before calculating the mixing ratio the background radon concentration was estimated using the equation based on the key determinants radioactive decay and diffusion processes and measured concentrations of groundwater samples the following steady state solution considering the radioactive decay and diffusion was used to calculate the background radon concentration clements and wilkening 1974 pinault and baubron 1997 rogers and nielson 1991 1 rn maximum rn z 1 exp z l where rn maximum is the potential regenerated radon concentration in the groundwater based on the decay of 226ra during transport bq m3 rn z is the radon concentration at depth z bq m3 z is the depth of sampling m l d r n γ is the diffusion length of radon m in which d r n is the effective diffusion coefficient of radon in groundwater s 1 and is the decay constant of radon s 1 assuming that the subsurface has a constant temperature of around 18 c the appropriate diffusion coefficient is approximately 5 10 5 s 1 singh et al 1993 usman et al 2004 the measured radon concentrations were corrected using the calculated background radon concentration the mixing ratio was then calculated using a simple mass balance equation as follows 2 q g q s q w 3 c g q g c s q s c w q w where cg is the radon concentration in background groundwater bq m3 cs is the radon concentration in surface water bq m3 cw is the radon concentration in each well bq m3 qg is the discharge of groundwater to the well m3 s qs is the discharge of surface water to the well m3 s and qw is the discharge from each well m3 s by substituting qw in equations 2 and 3 mixing ratio equations can be obtained for groundwater δ g c w c s c g c s and surface water δ s c w c g c s c g these equations were determined based on the following assumptions the water sampled consisted only of groundwater and infiltrated surface water the flow of groundwater and surface water to the sampling well is the same with constant velocity and no chemical changes after they mix the decrease in radon can be described using the law of radioactive decay the progenitors of radon are homogeneously distributed in the aquifer on a macroscopic scale and the changes in radon concentrations are influenced only by diffusion radioactive decay and infiltration of surface water the calculated mixing ratios of surface water and groundwater for each well at all sampling time are shown in table 2 among them some important sampling months are presented as pie graphs in fig 5 the fraction of surface water was high in most wells average 40 5 the results indicate that interaction between groundwater and surface water occurred at the study site and that a significant amount of surface water infiltrated into the groundwater during gwhp operation the high percentages of groundwater during january and february 2015 could be due to low radon efflux from the frozen topsoil hoehn and von gunten 1989 pearson and jones 1965 while the high surface water percentages during november 2014 were likely due to high precipitation 4 5 mm day spatial analysis of the results from march and april 2015 showed similar patterns in wells yso 5 yso 6 yso 7 yso 8 yso 9 and yso 10 which are located near ysg 1 and ysg 3 indicating that the gwhp system affected groundwater flow characteristics therefore the radon concentration data show that the mixing processes observed at this site result from surface water flow direction seasonal effects and gwhp operation 4 3 2 strontium isotope ratios 87sr 86sr the 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater samples ranged from 0 7243 to 0 7584 with an average of 0 7341 whereas those of surface water ranged from 0 7197 to 0 7282 with an average of 0 7249 as illustrated in fig 6 the data plots for january and march show three end members while those from april show two end members the presence of three end members may be attributed to the influence of water curtain houses in the cultivated area which operated from november to mid march in this study we employed a two end member mixing model for calculation of the mixing ratios on two sampling dates in april and a three end member mixing model for the march data these results can be compared to those based on radon tracer data binary mixing can also be calculated using a simple mass balance equation as follows 4 87 sr 86 sr m sr m f 87 sr 86 sr 1 sr 1 1 f 87 sr 86 sr 2 sr 2 where 87sr 86sr m is the measured 87sr 86sr ratio sr m is the measured strontium concentration 87sr 86sr 1 and 87sr 86sr 2 represent the 87sr 86sr ratios of the first and second end members respectively and sr 1 and sr 2 are the strontium concentrations of the first and second end members the symbol f represents the fraction of the first end member we assumed that the first end member is from the surface water and the second from yso 6 april 7th or yso 7 april 28th as these groundwater wells had the highest 87sr 86sr m sr m values the three end member model was carried out using the same approach as follows 5 87 sr 86 sr m a 87 sr 86 sr 1 b 87 sr 86 sr 2 100 a b 87 sr 86 sr 3 100 6 sr m a sr 1 b sr 2 100 a b sr 3 100 where a and b are the mixing ratios of end members 1 and 2 respectively while 87sr 86sr 3 and sr 3 represent the 87sr 86sr ratio and strontium concentration of the third end member respectively the first end member flows from yso 2 january and yso 1 march the second from yso 11 and the third is from surface water fig 7 a illustrates the possibility of dual tracer application using 222rn and sr isotopes to analyze mixing processes at the study site based on the triangular shape made by water sample values in particular the data from april 28 are distributed in a broad triangular shape indicating active mixing mixing ratios calculated from the two tracers are shown in table 2 for march the groundwater mixing ratio was calculated by adding the values of a and b in the equations 5 and 6 due to three end member model the results of the mixing model using strontium as the tracer revealed that the average groundwater ratio 48 4 which excludes the end member values was similar to the results obtained using radon as the tracer 47 1 the average values of strontium isotopes and radon concentrations during each sampling month were 51 8 and 44 4 respectively for march 11 54 3 and 53 6 for april 7 39 3 and 43 3 for april 28 excluding the end member values the results from april 7 show numerically similar average mixing ratios fig 7 also shows the calculated groundwater mixing ratios based on strontium versus those based on radon the mixing ratios using strontium were higher than the radon tracer results due to the use of different end members the background radon concentrations were calculated using equations 2 and 3 however the highest value among groundwater samples was found to be the sr end member the data from march showed a nearly linear relationship between the two isotopes except for the two end members and yso 12 on the plot from april 7 the data fall onto two lines the data from april 28 again showed a nearly linear relationship not two different slopes the data from march 11 and april 28 indicate groundwater mixing due to gwhp operation as sampling was conducted one day after operation on march 11 and during operation on april 28 during these sampling events mixing between surface water and groundwater occurred as illustrated in the flow pattern during gwhp operation the results supported the applicability of the dual tracer approach on april 7 in contrast sampling was performed long after gwhp operation and therefore this plot shows interactions in the transition zone between groundwater and surface water due to external factors such as dam discharge to overcome the uncertainty caused by differences in origins and chemical processes that affect strontium concentrations in groundwater the strontium concentrations in 87sr 86sr m versus 1 sr m plots can be replaced with δ18o data santoni et al 2016 sr isotopic ratios were plotted as a function of δ18o using data from march 2016 as shown in fig 8 the groundwater samples spread into three triangular shapes excluding those from yso 10 the ysn wells formed their own distinct mixing zone separate from the yso wells indicating that these groups of wells have different characteristics among the yso wells one mixing zone included yso 5 yso 11 and yso 9 another was yso 5 yso 11 and yso 4 and the third zone was made up of yso 5 yso 11 and yso 1 the zone including yso 5 yso 11 and yso 1 implies that mixing zones may be affected by gwhp operation as the injection pumping well is near yso 1 and yso 11 especially 18o values of groundwater wells reveal relatively wide distributed values whereas the sr isotope ratios remain similar in spite of mixing these results could reflect the groundwater mixing affected by original groundwater reacted with bedrock minerals and surface water influence on the oxygen isotope especially yso 10 of mixed water body which makes heavier isotope value 4 3 3 mass transfer calculation using dissolved strontium based on dam discharge data from the national groundwater information center of korea two groundwater surface water mixing conditions can be suggested with different dominant flow directions along various flow paths from the study site to the river one condition has dominant inflow from the southeast due to the large influx from the south han river on march 11 the second case is dominated by strong flow from the north related to surface water discharge from the chungpyung dam on april 28 while the gwhp was in operation these dates correspond to the dry season in korea so this model can be expected to reflect the hydrochemical properties of the groundwater with minimal effect of dilution thus it is possible to infer the mean 87sr 86sr and sr concentrations of the sr bearing minerals that affect the hydrochemistry of the groundwater using mass transfer calculations for mass transfer calculations point solutions are selected to represent each flow path from the groundwater wells to surface water fig 6 c and d illustrate the isotopic variations after gwhp operation well yso 7 is considered to have the groundwater composition most similar to that of the bedrock minerals wells yso 1 10 and 11 were distinguished by having three end members as shown in fig 8 moreover yso 1 and yso 7 are located on the injection side whereas yso 10 and yso 11 wells are on the extraction side of the heat pump for these reasons yso 1 yso 7 yso 10 and yso 11 were selected as the initial water samples while surface water was selected as the final water target water sample and the flow path was bisected into surface water and groundwater points in this study the mass transfer calculations showed four types of solute mineral relationship due to differences in the water chemistry and matrix properties to estimate the mineral water relationship and isotopic evolution of sr species reference values for mineral phases of sr were used which were in the ranges of 500 6300 ppm for anhydrite 40 400 ppm for calcite 20 200 ppm for dolomite and 400 2000 ppm for gypsum these values are commonly used for calculating mineral water relationships and isotopic variations in sr ions kinsman and holland 1969 uliana et al 2007 xie et al 2013a xie et al 2013b strontium concentrations of 690 ppm 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 717824 for diorite and 338 ppm 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 720915 for gabbroic diorite have been reported from a study area in gyeonggi massif granite this study site lay on precambrian biotite gneiss and the sampling aquifer was composed mainly of quaternary alluvial sediments thus molar sr transfer and the isotope ratios of sr bearing minerals such as carbonates or sulfates can explain the distribution and properties of groundwater that has followed different pathways the mass transfer calculation can be expressed using the following equation banner and hanson 1990 7 s r final 87 sr 86 s r final s r initial 87 sr 86 s r initial s r mineral 87 sr 86 s r mineral where sr final and sr initial are the strontium concentrations of the final surface water and initial groundwater respectively sr mineral is the amount of dissolved or precipitated strontium in the mineral phase and 87sr 86sr final 87sr 86sr initial and 87sr 86sr mineral are the 87sr 86sr ratios of the final surface water initial groundwater and bedrock mineral phase respectively this equation is similar to equation 4 but has been rewritten to clearly define each endmember used in the mole transfer calculation representing different strontium concentration types the 87sr 86sr ratio affected by half life period of 87rb which is useful tracer for groundwater flow path on the other hand dissolved sr ion concentrations could be changed by cation transfer of mineral dissolution precipitation processes based on these properties it can be inferred that groundwater surface water mixing by using mass transfer calculation of sr species comparing the groundwater as the initial sample to surface water as the final sample it showed the lowest strontium concentrations during the study period table 3 groundwater was considered to show influences of sr bearing minerals due to water rock interactions whereas surface water may be diluted due to meteoric water and other water sources during the water mixing processes variations in the amounts of sr transferred in moles and in 87sr 86sr ratios occurred as a result of dissolution or precipitation processes between the initial groundwater and the bedrock minerals wells yso 7 and yso 11 showed the highest and the lowest sr concentrations among the initial and final water samples regardless of the dominant water flow direction table 3 differences in sr concentrations expressed in moles per liter between the initial and final water samples were used to estimate the amount of surface water dilution assuming that sr leaches into the groundwater from bedrock minerals its concentration can be inferred from the 87sr 86sr mineral at that time calculated 87sr 86sr mineral values ranged from 0 72438 to 0 76533 in accordance with the measured groundwater and surface water values the measured and calculated results showed notably high sr ratios apparently reflecting the influence of sr leached from gneiss in the bedrock liégeois and stern 2010 the 87sr 86sr values of sr bearing minerals and the initial groundwater converged at the final surface water value showing that sr is transferred from the solid phase in bedrock through dissolution or ion exchange lee et al 2011 measured and calculated 87sr 86sr values from yso 7 along flow path 2 showed the greatest difference between dominant flow directions as this well location is nearest to the river 4 4 characterization of microbial communities 4 4 1 heat map analysis heat map analysis of bacterial communities at the family level showed differences between surface water and groundwater diversity in multiple seasons july and november 2014 for example sterolibacterium f and sphingomonadaceae were the most abundant families in the groundwater yso 1 n 53 48 and 16 02 whereas planktophila f was dominant in the surface water sw j 14 12 fig 9 a sphingomonadaceae is easily isolated from contaminated groundwater nielsen et al 2015 suggesting that yso 1 groundwater is the most contaminated groundwater sample notably sterolibacterium f is closely related to denitrifying bacteria found in anaerobic environments the abundance of sterolibacterium f in surface water was insignificant whereas the high levels of sterolibacterium f in the groundwater samples yso 1 n yso 2 n and yso 2 j indicate that it was the dominant species with percentages of 53 48 10 63 and 9 60 of total bacteria respectively the level of sterolibacterium f in the yso 1 j groundwater was similar to that of the surface water which indicates that yso 1 groundwater was highly influenced by surface water in july during july the chungpyung dam discharge rate was high and the south han river was dominant flowing into the site from the southeast this combination of factors means that water flowed from both the north and southeast during this time 4 4 2 pcoa a pcoa plot based on fast unifrac calculation of community distance values was constructed for analysis of the relationships among the samples fig 9b although the bacterial communities in surface water and groundwater differed in multiple seasons all other communities were more closely related to each other than to the communities from the surface water and groundwater yso 1 sampled during july fig 9a bacterial communities of groundwater wells yso 1 and yso 2 were similar across all seasons if yso 1 j was excluded from the plot this result might have occurred because the samples obtained from the surface water and groundwater yso 1 in july were influenced strongly by mixing of surface water and groundwater due to the high dam discharge rate on the north han river however communities from groundwater samples yso 1 and yso 2 collected in november were more similar to those of surface water this microbial community distribution reflected the hydrological conditions i e low rainfall discharge of water from the dam frequent operation of the gwhp system of the site during november sampling was conducted during a rainfall event this result might indicate that the effects of groundwater and surface water exchange were insignificant compared to those in july due to the influence of rainfall the variations in the microbial communities are similar to the results of chemical analysis of hydrological conditions the 16s rrna sequences and pcoa analysis showed that the bacterial community distribution and assemblage correlated with hydrological conditions this result shows that pyrosequencing is a practical tool for evaluating groundwater and surface water mixing processes to support the results obtained from isotopic approaches 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the usefulness of multiple tracers strontium isotopes 222rn microbial communities and major ions to explain groundwater surface water mixing characteristics in a riverside area the tracers indicated highly active mixing processes in this area that were influenced by anthropogenic factors caused by dam discharge and the operation of a gwhp system and seasonal effects hydrochemical analysis showed some significant changes related to gwhp operation and flowmeter results provided physical data supporting the effect of an external factor namely dam discharge the average ratio of surface water from radon tracer was much higher 40 5 at the study site than the typical site suggesting that river flow has a considerable impact on the flow system using two and three end member mixing models allows strontium and radon to be used as a dual tracer the data of 18o also showed the groundwater mixing with bedrock minerals and surface water which makes heavier isotope value moreover spatio temporal variations due to external factors were observed in the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios which showed differences in mass transfer along each flow path indicating dissolution or ion exchange during mixing of groundwater and surface water exploration of the microbial communities in these two water bodies also revealed unique bacterial taxa well yso 1 located furthest from the river was particularly strongly influenced by surface water during july indicating that anomalies in bacterial community structure might be caused by exchange between the two water bodies rather than distance from the river the major outcome of this study is evidence for the usefulness of environmental isotopes strontium and radon as tracers in combination with microbial communities for mixing analysis in complex environments such as riverside areas and gwhp sites as well as general application thus this study clearly shows the need for consideration of groundwater surface water mixing to support effective management of the groundwater system in any area including the impacts of external factors this new approach therefore improves the scope of multi tracer methods for studying mixing processes between water bodies credit authorship contribution statement jaeyeon kim conceptualization methodology data curation

5930,investigating mixing processes between groundwater and surface water is important to manage groundwater system especially because the study site is located around a groundwater heat pump gwhp system at a riverside area external effects such as an operation of gwhp system and or river level fluctuations can disturb the water system it can result in artificial mixing of two water bodies thereby changing original hydrogeochemical and biological characteristics for this research a multi tracer approach combining strontium isotopes 222rn microbial communities and hydrochemical composition was undertaken for nineteen water samples to quantify how and to what extent mixing may occur due to external processes before this approach was applied the physical experiment using flowmeter was also conducted for defining the effects of dam discharge rates to the flow system estimated mixing ratios based on radon tracer showed spatio temporal variations influenced by the dam discharge rate seasonal effects and gwhp the average mixing ratio values by strontium tracer were in accordance with the results of radon tracer suggesting that a dual tracer approach would be a more reliable means mass transfer calculation indicated that spatio temporal variations in strontium isotopes were affected by hydrological events results from the microbial community using a heat map and principal coordinate analyses also supported the mixing process characteristics of the study area based on the results the interactive and dynamic mixing occurred in the riverside area in relation to external factors causing hydraulic disturbances and the mixing could be estimated from the combined application of isotopic tracers with microbial community keywords strontium isotopes radon mixing process microbial community a groundwater heat pump gwhp hydrochemistry 1 introduction groundwater surface water interactions and the associated variations in hydrogeochemical and biological factors have major impacts on the management of water resources hayashi and rosenberry 2002 kim et al 2018 may and winter 1999 sophocleous 2002 westbrook et al 2006 generally the hydrogeochemistry has been found to change along the path of a flowing water mass due to interactions with bedrock and mixing with other water bodies haque and johannesson 2006 therefore numerous studies have been conducted to trace groundwater surface water interactions using hydrogeochemical parameters including water isotopes cook and herczeg 2012 hunt et al 2005 katz et al 1997 kendall and caldwell 1998 zhu et al 2008 among such methods 222rn represents an environmental tracer with higher concentrations in groundwater than in surface water banks et al 1995 cook et al 2008 dimova and burnett 2011 dimova et al 2013 ellins et al 1990 it generally has a low concentration in surface water because the solubility of 226ra is low so it is useful for studies of groundwater surface water mixing however few studies have investigated the quantitative mixing process using radon as a tracer due to its short half life of 3 8 days and rapid degassing properties yu et al 2013 another isotope the sr isotope ratio 87sr 86sr has been also widely used to investigate water source changes négrel et al 2004 petrides and furnham 2006 water rock interactions frape et al 1984 frost and toner 2004 shand et al 2009 and groundwater mixing lyons et al 1995 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 but these isotopes have been applied in a few studies as an indicator of groundwater surface water mixing 87sr is derived from the slow decay t 4 8 1010 yr of 87rb and its content can be considered stable over observable time scales cook and herczeg 2012 thus sr isotopes can be used as another tracer for clarifying the mixing processes between two water bodies moreover combining two isotopes can allow for better understanding of such mixing processes in addition abundant and diverse microbes are the key to a functioning ecosystem in natural waters microorganisms form clusters in pursuit of a suitable environment in which to live due to the differing environments provided by groundwater and surface water microorganisms will cluster within each habitat and investigation of the microbial communities allows for differentiation among environments however this approach has been conducted only in limited studies of mixing zones therefore in this study a culture independent amplicon sequencing approach pyrosequencing was applied with hydrochemical analysis including that of environmental isotopes these mixing processes can be affected by numerous factors including natural events their interactions with the environment and anthropogenic effects especially at our study site groundwater is commonly used for groundwater heat pump gwhp systems water curtain cultivation and provision of drinking water meeting the water requirements of local residents the gwhp system is a centralheatingand or coolingsystemthat transfersheatto or from the ground using a water resource specifically these gwhp systems are open loop systems which pump and inject water between two or more wells this process affects the groundwater level around the system and its changes influence the operation of the system in addition the study site is located along a riverside which means that surface water contributes considerably to the local groundwater via inflow and therefore mixing between these two water bodies should be analyzed to ensure effective water resource management nearby dams also impact the flow rates between the two water bodies therefore groundwater surface water interactions at this study site should be investigated including consideration of various external factors consequently the aim of this study was to characterize and quantify mixing processes between groundwater and surface water while considering external factors using a new multi tracer approach here we integrate several proxies including elemental and isotope geochemistry 87sr 86sr ratios and 222rn concentrations with data regarding microbial communities this process is helpful for efficient management of groundwater systems in accordance with this primary objective our investigation was carried out via 1 describing the site characteristics with artificial hydraulic events using hydrogeochemical parameters and flowmeter measurements 2 quantifying mixing processes by calculating the mixing ratios of groundwater and surface water using 222rn and sr isotopes 3 deducing the hydrochemical variations of sr mass and isotopic ratio with the flow path using the mass transfer calculation and 4 conducting microbial analyses to reveal the distinctive and diverse communities of mixing zones 2 site description the study site is located at the confluence of the north han river and south han river where twenty two monitoring wells are installed around the han river environment research center hrerc fig 1 information about the hydrostratigraphic layers and well depth is provided in table s1 the groundwater hydraulic gradient is influenced by river flow the north han river flows from the chungpyung dam located to the north of the study site and the south han river flows from the paldang dam located to the southwest of the site fig 1 groundwater flows from north to south when the flow of the north han river is stronger and from south to north when the flow of the south han river is dominant downhole log data from twenty two wells indicate the presence of a highly permeable layer composed of coarse gravel and sandy sediments at depths of 14 17 m ministry of land infrastructure and maritime affairs 2008 this layer contains three distinct sections silty sand gravel and precambrian gneiss in order of increasing

irregular characteristics are present in the study area a diorite of unknown age is found on the southeastern side of the study area and a geomorphological system of quaternary alluvium comprised of sediments from the north han river and south han river is also present the north han river flows in a rectilinear path along a fault trace the gwhp system was installed in january 2015 and has been operating since then with groundwater usage of 350 m3 day test operation was conducted in november 2014 the injection well and pumping well of the gwhp system are designated ysg 1 and ysg 3 respectively fig 1 the land around the study area consists of a cultivated area 90 of the island where water curtain cultivation is commonly employed with vinyl houses using thermal energy from the relatively warm groundwater for warmth to support cultivation during the cold winter months usually from november to mid march ministry of land infrastructure and maritime affairs 2015 3 water

δ r sample r standard 1 1000 and r represents 18o 16o or 2h 1h the radon concentrations of each water sample were measured for all sampling events except january 2016 using an rtm1688 2 radon and thoron monitor sarad germany sample water was placed in a 500 ml air bubbling flask connected to the monitor in a closed air loop measurements were taken at 15 min intervals after which an equilibrium

the groundwater flow direction and velocity and a physical based experiment were also performed to clarify the dynamic interactions between the two water bodies in the study area this experiment was conducted on august 20 2014 in three wells yso 1 yso 7 and yso 12 using aquavision colloidal borescopes geotech environmental equipment inc usa two instruments of the same type were used one was fixed in one well yso 1 as a standard point and the other was installed in wells yso 7 and yso 12 at different time periods am and pm the borescope probe was placed at 15 m b g l during the experiment the measured data were recorded automatically using a laptop computer prior to conducting the main experiment a pilot test was performed to determine the appropriate tracking configuration the optimal tracking settings were derived as follows minimum particle size 5 capture delay 5 0 0 particle sensitivity 1058 minimum velocity 2 maximum velocity 5 0 0 and data point frequency 2 more detailed

for fifteen parameters t ec do orp ph tds salinity k na ca mg cl so4 no3 and hco3 are summarized in table 1 concentrations of cl increased after gwhp operation march 2016 compared to those before gwhp operation february 2014 due to soil leaching during gwhp operation other parameters showed considerable changes due to gwhp operation during which do and orp decreased while ph increased table 1 these changes could be attributed to active pumping and injection of groundwater which accelerated the reduction of ferrous iron to ferric hydroxide in the surface environment and also resulted in surplus hydroxide increasing the ph of the reduced groundwater dinkel et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 chemical data from the water samples were plotted on a piper diagram before and after gwhp operation the groundwater in the study area is unclassified regarding chemical type most of the water samples belonged to the ca hco3 water type indicating dominant alkaline earth minerals with increased levels of alkali due to the prevalence of hco3 a small difference was observed between the two months with the data from march 2016 having a broader distribution of anions than those from february 2014 in total 18 groundwater wells and one surface water sample were analyzed for δ2h and δ18o in march 2016 the variations in δ2h and δ18o in the groundwater wells were small except for those from yso 10 the isotopic compositions of the groundwater ranged from 60 4 to 49 for δ18h and 8 77 and 7 7 for δ18o fig 3 a most samples fell near the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl for the rainy season indicating that the groundwater in the study area was recharged primarily during this season the lmwl for the rainy season in korea is δd 7 94 0 20 δ18o 8 84 1 47 lee et al 1999 well yso 11 showed the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values among all samples fig 3a samples plotted on a gibbs diagram were dispersed in the precipitation and water rock interaction areas except for the yso 11 sample collected prior to operation fig 3b the dominance of dissolved components such as ca na and tds values implies that the hydrochemical evolution of these sites was affected by minerals in rainfall and the bedrock in contrast the groundwater at the site of yso 11 had undergone different processes compared to other groundwater wells likely because this site lies near an agricultural area and houses used for water curtain cultivation therefore the yso 11 could be considered as an end member which has distinct characteristics compared to other groundwater wells 4 2 general groundwater surface water flow system for background information about the flow system at the study site flowmeter analysis was carried out during the season prior to gwhp operation august 2014 to determine how the flow direction was related to the discharge rates of two nearby dams paldang and chungpyung because pumping can affect the flow system this experiment was conducted without water sampling flowmeter results under two dam discharge rates are shown in fig 4 the experiment was conducted using wells yso 1 10 00 12 00 17 00 18 00 yso 7 12 47 17 14 and yso 12 10 00 12 24 before 10 00 the paldang dam discharged at a constant rate about 300 m3 s and no discharge was released from the chungpyung dam after that time discharge from the paldang dam increased to 800 m3 s the chungpyung dam also began to discharge causing strong flow from north to south after 12 00 fig 4a the paldang dam lies to the southwest and the chungpyung dam lies to the north of the study site fig 1 therefore the flow direction was from north to south when the discharge rates of both dams were high wells yso 1 and yso 12 showed regional variations in flow direction during the period 10 00 12 00 fig 4b after that time wells yso 1 and yso 7 showed strong flow in the direction of north to south due to the external factor of dam discharge fig 4c 4 3 quantifying the mixing ratio in the groundwater surface water interaction zone 4 3 1 radon concentration 222rn using radon concentrations measured in surface water and groundwater table s2 the mixing ratio was calculated for the interaction zone based on the measured data the trend in concentrations was independent of location meaning that wells near the river did not always show lower radon concentrations than those further from the river thus site characteristics should be considered when identifying the external factors affecting a sample before calculating the mixing ratio the background radon concentration was estimated using the equation based on the key determinants radioactive decay and diffusion processes and measured concentrations of groundwater samples the following steady state solution considering the radioactive decay and diffusion was used to calculate the background radon concentration clements and wilkening 1974 pinault and baubron 1997 rogers and nielson 1991 1 rn maximum rn z 1 exp z l where rn maximum is the potential regenerated radon concentration in the groundwater based on the decay of 226ra during transport bq m3 rn z is the radon concentration at depth z bq m3 z is the depth of sampling m l d r n γ is the diffusion length of radon m in which d r n is the effective diffusion coefficient of radon in groundwater s 1 and is the decay constant of radon s 1 assuming that the subsurface has a constant temperature of around 18 c the appropriate diffusion coefficient is approximately 5 10 5 s 1 singh et al 1993 usman et al 2004 the measured radon concentrations were corrected using the calculated background radon concentration the mixing ratio was then calculated using a simple mass balance equation as follows 2 q g q s q w 3 c g q g c s q s c w q w where cg is the radon concentration in background groundwater bq m3 cs is the radon concentration in surface water bq m3 cw is the radon concentration in each well bq m3 qg is the discharge of groundwater to the well m3 s qs is the discharge of surface water to the well m3 s and qw is the discharge from each well m3 s by substituting qw in equations 2 and 3 mixing ratio equations can be obtained for groundwater δ g c w c s c g c s and surface water δ s c w c g c s c g these equations were determined based on the following assumptions the water sampled consisted only of groundwater and infiltrated surface water the flow of groundwater and surface water to the sampling well is the same with constant velocity and no chemical changes after they mix the decrease in radon can be described using the law of radioactive decay the progenitors of radon are homogeneously distributed in the aquifer on a macroscopic scale and the changes in radon concentrations are influenced only by diffusion radioactive decay and infiltration of surface water the calculated mixing ratios of surface water and groundwater for each well at all sampling time are shown in table 2 among them some important sampling months are presented as pie graphs in fig 5 the fraction of surface water was high in most wells average 40 5 the results indicate that interaction between groundwater and surface water occurred at the study site and that a significant amount of surface water infiltrated into the groundwater during gwhp operation the high percentages of groundwater during january and february 2015 could be due to low radon efflux from the frozen topsoil hoehn and von gunten 1989 pearson and jones 1965 while the high surface water percentages during november 2014 were likely due to high precipitation 4 5 mm day spatial analysis of the results from march and april 2015 showed similar patterns in wells yso 5 yso 6 yso 7 yso 8 yso 9 and yso 10 which are located near ysg 1 and ysg 3 indicating that the gwhp system affected groundwater flow characteristics therefore the radon concentration data show that the mixing processes observed at this site result from surface water flow direction seasonal effects and gwhp operation 4 3 2 strontium isotope ratios 87sr 86sr the 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater samples ranged from 0 7243 to 0 7584 with an average of 0 7341 whereas those of surface water ranged from 0 7197 to 0 7282 with an average of 0 7249 as illustrated in fig 6 the data plots for january and march show three end members while those from april show two end members the presence of three end members may be attributed to the influence of water curtain houses in the cultivated area which operated from november to mid march in this study we employed a two end member mixing model for calculation of the mixing ratios on two sampling dates in april and a three end member mixing model for the march data these results can be compared to those based on radon tracer data binary mixing can also be calculated using a simple mass balance equation as follows 4 87 sr 86 sr m sr m f 87 sr 86 sr 1 sr 1 1 f 87 sr 86 sr 2 sr 2 where 87sr 86sr m is the measured 87sr 86sr ratio sr m is the measured strontium concentration 87sr 86sr 1 and 87sr 86sr 2 represent the 87sr 86sr ratios of the first and second end members respectively and sr 1 and sr 2 are the strontium concentrations of the first and second end members the symbol f represents the fraction of the first end member we assumed that the first end member is from the surface water and the second from yso 6 april 7th or yso 7 april 28th as these groundwater wells had the highest 87sr 86sr m sr m values the three end member model was carried out using the same approach as follows 5 87 sr 86 sr m a 87 sr 86 sr 1 b 87 sr 86 sr 2 100 a b 87 sr 86 sr 3 100 6 sr m a sr 1 b sr 2 100 a b sr 3 100 where a and b are the mixing ratios of end members 1 and 2 respectively while 87sr 86sr 3 and sr 3 represent the 87sr 86sr ratio and strontium concentration of the third end member respectively the first end member flows from yso 2 january and yso 1 march the second from yso 11 and the third is from surface water fig 7 a illustrates the possibility of dual tracer application using 222rn and sr isotopes to analyze mixing processes at the study site based on the triangular shape made by water sample values in particular the data from april 28 are distributed in a broad triangular shape indicating active mixing mixing ratios calculated from the two tracers are shown in table 2 for march the groundwater mixing ratio was calculated by adding the values of a and b in the equations 5 and 6 due to three end member model the results of the mixing model using strontium as the tracer revealed that the average groundwater ratio 48 4 which excludes the end member values was similar to the results obtained using radon as the tracer 47 1 the average values of strontium isotopes and radon concentrations during each sampling month were 51 8 and 44 4 respectively for march 11 54 3 and 53 6 for april 7 39 3 and 43 3 for april 28 excluding the end member values the results from april 7 show numerically similar average mixing ratios fig 7 also shows the calculated groundwater mixing ratios based on strontium versus those based on radon the mixing ratios using strontium were higher than the radon tracer results due to the use of different end members the background radon concentrations were calculated using equations 2 and 3 however the highest value among groundwater samples was found to be the sr end member the data from march showed a nearly linear relationship between the two isotopes except for the two end members and yso 12 on the plot from april 7 the data fall onto two lines the data from april 28 again showed a nearly linear relationship not two different slopes the data from march 11 and april 28 indicate groundwater mixing due to gwhp operation as sampling was conducted one day after operation on march 11 and during operation on april 28 during these sampling events mixing between surface water and groundwater occurred as illustrated in the flow pattern during gwhp operation the results supported the applicability of the dual tracer approach on april 7 in contrast sampling was performed long after gwhp operation and therefore this plot shows interactions in the transition zone between groundwater and surface water due to external factors such as dam discharge to overcome the uncertainty caused by differences in origins and chemical processes that affect strontium concentrations in groundwater the strontium concentrations in 87sr 86sr m versus 1 sr m plots can be replaced with δ18o data santoni et al 2016 sr isotopic ratios were plotted as a function of δ18o using data from march 2016 as shown in fig 8 the groundwater samples spread into three triangular shapes excluding those from yso 10 the ysn wells formed their own distinct mixing zone separate from the yso wells indicating that these groups of wells have different characteristics among the yso wells one mixing zone included yso 5 yso 11 and yso 9 another was yso 5 yso 11 and yso 4 and the third zone was made up of yso 5 yso 11 and yso 1 the zone including yso 5 yso 11 and yso 1 implies that mixing zones may be affected by gwhp operation as the injection pumping well is near yso 1 and yso 11 especially 18o values of groundwater wells reveal relatively wide distributed values whereas the sr isotope ratios remain similar in spite of mixing these results could reflect the groundwater mixing affected by original groundwater reacted with bedrock minerals and surface water influence on the oxygen isotope especially yso 10 of mixed water body which makes heavier isotope value 4 3 3 mass transfer calculation using dissolved strontium based on dam discharge data from the national groundwater information center of korea two groundwater surface water mixing conditions can be suggested with different dominant flow directions along various flow paths from the study site to the river one condition has dominant inflow from the southeast due to the large influx from the south han river on march 11 the second case is dominated by strong flow from the north related to surface water discharge from the chungpyung dam on april 28 while the gwhp was in operation these dates correspond to the dry season in korea so this model can be expected to reflect the hydrochemical properties of the groundwater with minimal effect of dilution thus it is possible to infer the mean 87sr 86sr and sr concentrations of the sr bearing minerals that affect the hydrochemistry of the groundwater using mass transfer calculations for mass transfer calculations point solutions are selected to represent each flow path from the groundwater wells to surface water fig 6 c and d illustrate the isotopic variations after gwhp operation well yso 7 is considered to have the groundwater composition most similar to that of the bedrock minerals wells yso 1 10 and 11 were distinguished by having three end members as shown in fig 8 moreover yso 1 and yso 7 are located on the injection side whereas yso 10 and yso 11 wells are on the extraction side of the heat pump for these reasons yso 1 yso 7 yso 10 and yso 11 were selected as the initial water samples while surface water was selected as the final water target water sample and the flow path was bisected into surface water and groundwater points in this study the mass transfer calculations showed four types of solute mineral relationship due to differences in the water chemistry and matrix properties to estimate the mineral water relationship and isotopic evolution of sr species reference values for mineral phases of sr were used which were in the ranges of 500 6300 ppm for anhydrite 40 400 ppm for calcite 20 200 ppm for dolomite and 400 2000 ppm for gypsum these values are commonly used for calculating mineral water relationships and isotopic variations in sr ions kinsman and holland 1969 uliana et al 2007 xie et al 2013a xie et al 2013b strontium concentrations of 690 ppm 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 717824 for diorite and 338 ppm 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 720915 for gabbroic diorite have been reported from a study area in gyeonggi massif granite this study site lay on precambrian biotite gneiss and the sampling aquifer was composed mainly of quaternary alluvial sediments thus molar sr transfer and the isotope ratios of sr bearing minerals such as carbonates or sulfates can explain the distribution and properties of groundwater that has followed different pathways the mass transfer calculation can be expressed using the following equation banner and hanson 1990 7 s r final 87 sr 86 s r final s r initial 87 sr 86 s r initial s r mineral 87 sr 86 s r mineral where sr final and sr initial are the strontium concentrations of the final surface water and initial groundwater respectively sr mineral is the amount of dissolved or precipitated strontium in the mineral phase and 87sr 86sr final 87sr 86sr initial and 87sr 86sr mineral are the 87sr 86sr ratios of the final surface water initial groundwater and bedrock mineral phase respectively this equation is similar to equation 4 but has been rewritten to clearly define each endmember used in the mole transfer calculation representing different strontium concentration types the 87sr 86sr ratio affected by half life period of 87rb which is useful tracer for groundwater flow path on the other hand dissolved sr ion concentrations could be changed by cation transfer of mineral dissolution precipitation processes based on these properties it can be inferred that groundwater surface water mixing by using mass transfer calculation of sr species comparing the groundwater as the initial sample to surface water as the final sample it showed the lowest strontium concentrations during the study period table 3 groundwater was considered to show influences of sr bearing minerals due to water rock interactions whereas surface water may be diluted due to meteoric water and other water sources during the water mixing processes variations in the amounts of sr transferred in moles and in 87sr 86sr ratios occurred as a result of dissolution or precipitation processes between the initial groundwater and the bedrock minerals wells yso 7 and yso 11 showed the highest and the lowest sr concentrations among the initial and final water samples regardless of the dominant water flow direction table 3 differences in sr concentrations expressed in moles per liter between the initial and final water samples were used to estimate the amount of surface water dilution assuming that sr leaches into the groundwater from bedrock minerals its concentration can be inferred from the 87sr 86sr mineral at that time calculated 87sr 86sr mineral values ranged from 0 72438 to 0 76533 in accordance with the measured groundwater and surface water values the measured and calculated results showed notably high sr ratios apparently reflecting the influence of sr leached from gneiss in the bedrock liégeois and stern 2010 the 87sr 86sr values of sr bearing minerals and the initial groundwater converged at the final surface water value showing that sr is transferred from the solid phase in bedrock through dissolution or ion exchange lee et al 2011 measured and calculated 87sr 86sr values from yso 7 along flow path 2 showed the greatest difference between dominant flow directions as this well location is nearest to the river 4 4 characterization of microbial communities 4 4 1 heat map analysis heat map analysis of bacterial communities at the family level showed differences between surface water and groundwater diversity in multiple seasons july and november 2014 for example sterolibacterium f and sphingomonadaceae were the most abundant families in the groundwater yso 1 n 53 48 and 16 02 whereas planktophila f was dominant in the surface water sw j 14 12 fig 9 a sphingomonadaceae is easily isolated from contaminated groundwater nielsen et al 2015 suggesting that yso 1 groundwater is the most contaminated groundwater sample notably sterolibacterium f is closely related to denitrifying bacteria found in anaerobic environments the abundance of sterolibacterium f in surface water was insignificant whereas the high levels of sterolibacterium f in the groundwater samples yso 1 n yso 2 n and yso 2 j indicate that it was the dominant species with percentages of 53 48 10 63 and 9 60 of total bacteria respectively the level of sterolibacterium f in the yso 1 j groundwater was similar to that of the surface water which indicates that yso 1 groundwater was highly influenced by surface water in july during july the chungpyung dam discharge rate was high and the south han river was dominant flowing into the site from the southeast this combination of factors means that water flowed from both the north and southeast during this time 4 4 2 pcoa a pcoa plot based on fast unifrac calculation of community distance values was constructed for analysis of the relationships among the samples fig 9b although the bacterial communities in surface water and groundwater differed in multiple seasons all other communities were more closely related to each other than to the communities from the surface water and groundwater yso 1 sampled during july fig 9a bacterial communities of groundwater wells yso 1 and yso 2 were similar across all seasons if yso 1 j was excluded from the plot this result might have occurred because the samples obtained from the surface water and groundwater yso 1 in july were influenced strongly by mixing of surface water and groundwater due to the high dam discharge rate on the north han river however communities from groundwater samples yso 1 and yso 2 collected in november were more similar to those of surface water this microbial community distribution reflected the hydrological conditions i e low rainfall discharge of water from the dam frequent operation of the gwhp system of the site during november sampling was conducted during a rainfall event this result might indicate that the effects of groundwater and surface water exchange were insignificant compared to those in july due to the influence of rainfall the variations in the microbial communities are similar to the results of chemical analysis of hydrological conditions the 16s rrna sequences and pcoa analysis showed that the bacterial community distribution and assemblage correlated with hydrological conditions this result shows that pyrosequencing is a practical tool for evaluating groundwater and surface water mixing processes to support the results obtained from isotopic approaches 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the usefulness of multiple tracers strontium isotopes 222rn microbial communities and major ions to explain groundwater surface water mixing characteristics in a riverside area the tracers indicated highly active mixing processes in this area that were influenced by anthropogenic factors caused by dam discharge and the operation of a gwhp system and seasonal effects hydrochemical analysis showed some significant changes related to gwhp operation and flowmeter results provided physical data supporting the effect of an external factor namely dam discharge the average ratio of surface water from radon tracer was much higher 40 5 at the study site than the typical site suggesting that river flow has a considerable impact on the flow system using two and three end member mixing models allows strontium and radon to be used as a dual tracer the data of 18o also showed the groundwater mixing with bedrock minerals and surface water which makes heavier isotope value moreover spatio temporal variations due to external factors were observed in the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios which showed differences in mass transfer along each flow path indicating dissolution or ion exchange during mixing of groundwater and surface water exploration of the microbial communities in these two water bodies also revealed unique bacterial taxa well yso 1 located furthest from the river was particularly strongly influenced by surface water during july indicating that anomalies in bacterial community structure might be caused by exchange between the two water bodies rather than distance from the river the major outcome of this study is evidence for the usefulness of environmental isotopes strontium and radon as tracers in combination with microbial communities for mixing analysis in complex environments such as riverside areas and gwhp sites as well as general application thus this study clearly shows the need for consideration of groundwater surface water mixing to support effective management of the groundwater system in any area including the impacts of external factors this new approach therefore improves the scope of multi tracer methods for studying mixing processes between water bodies credit authorship contribution statement jaeyeon kim conceptualization methodology data curation

5931,flash flood research crucially relies on historical event information for hypothesis testing however flash flood science suffers from data scarcity due to the high effort for event data collection few long term and comprehensive flash flood datasets exist yet to advance flash flood research scientists should spend time on creating event datasets therefore to reduce the data collection and preparation effort this paper takes a first step towards structuring the flash flood documentation procedure in this context we first investigate the current documentation approaches by reviewing 11 published flash flood datasets we found great differences between the flash flood datasets regarding temporal and spatial scope information density flash flood definition and usability by others based on the review findings and the cross industry standard process for data mining we propose a structured 4 step approach for flash flood documentation we provide recommendations on efficient flash flood documentation and exemplify a possible implementation based on a german flash flood dataset starting from flash flood definition through the identification of sources to the schematic event documentation the key feature of our approach is a documentation scheme specifying what event information to report and how within the documentation scheme it proved particularly helpful to use fixed categories for attribute description to rate information quality and to document events separated by source following our approach we were able to create a comprehensive event dataset composed of a variety of sources in addition to flash flood events our dataset also includes surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain adding up to nearly 23 800 german events scientists can employ this approach to document flash floods more efficiently in the future keywords flash flood data collection documentation scheme database damage categorization 1 introduction flash flood research starts with a journey into the past based on historical flash flood events we aim to learn for the future however being able to learn from past events requires documentation of the generation course and impacts of flash flood events therefore event documentation marks the beginning of flash flood research and thus is of fundamental importance regardless of whether researchers want to advance flash flood understanding modeling or forecasting they rely on historical event information for their investigations recently researchers used flash flood event datasets for verification of forecasts and warnings e g creutin et al 2009 calianno et al 2013 gourley et al 2017 auer et al 2019 for investigations of flash flood characteristics e g gaume et al 2009 marchi et al 2010 tarolli et al 2012 he et al 2018 for studies on flood risk management e g einfalt et al 2009 and for identification of flood prone areas e g vinet et al 2016 saharia et al 2017 in recent years researchers have increasingly used post flood field surveys and hydrometeorological networks to collect flash flood data post flood investigations help to reproduce the mechanisms and the course of a flash flood event besides the reconstruction of the event the post flash flood surveys focus on understanding the damage processes e g laudan et al 2017 investigating the geomorphic response e g lucía et al 2018

2018 there is also a growing number of scientific papers investigating data collected from radar rain gauge networks with regard to flash floods e g bouilloud et al 2010 boudevillain et al 2016 varlas et al 2019 in particular radar images private rain gauge networks unmanned aerial vehicles and citizen science offer new opportunities for data collation e g smith and rodriguez 2017 diakakis et al 2019 seibert et al 2019 despite the increasing number of possible data sources long term flash flood datasets are still limited braud et al 2016 therefore in the editorial of the special issue of journal of hydrology entitled flash floods hydro geomorphic response and risk management braud et al 2016 call on the community to intensify data collection efforts for advancing knowledge gain conceivable reasons for the lack of data inventories are manifold but certainly include i the high effort for data collection and preparation ii lack of data especially weather radar data iii lack of funds and iv lack of recognition one reason why flash flood documentation is time consuming is because event information is usually scattered among different sources e g agencies media and action forces furthermore no documentation guidelines exist describing the dataset generation process also the few published datasets provide little information on how to document flash floods while lack of funds and lack of recognition are difficult to solve flash flood science should try to facilitate dataset generation to tackle data scarcity in flash flood research we are convinced that it is necessary to simplify and clarify the process of flash flood documentation a structured documentation approach for instance makes data preparation more efficient ensures data quality and facilitates data use by third parties therefore we aim to streamline the process of flash flood documentation to increase the number of available flash flood datasets and thus foster flash flood research in this paper we demonstrate how to document flash flood events by following a structured approach that applies a comprehensive and flexible documentation scheme first we prove why a structured approach is needed by highlighting key differences and limitations of existing flash flood datasets and databases section 2 subsequently we propose a structured approach for flash flood documentation to make dataset generation more efficient section 3 following we give recommendations for flash flood documentation based on the conducted dataset review and our experience in flash flood dataset generation section 4 we exemplify the practical implementation of our recommendations based on a german dataset then we shortly present the created flash flood dataset section 5 finally we discuss our findings from dataset creation and review section 6 and provide concluding remarks section 7 2 current flash flood documentation a review 2 1 comparison of published flash flood datasets and databases several published datasets exist that document flash flood and surface runoff events triggered by heavy precipitation most of these flash flood datasets are results from scientific studies and projects however institutions such as the european severe storms laboratory essl the national severe storms laboratory nssl or the national weather service nws of the united states also operate topical databases according to our review only eleven published flash flood datasets exist table 1 the purposes of these eleven flash flood datasets vary greatly some datasets serve as a basis for modeling studies and advancing process understanding cf euromedeff flash other flash flood datasets are created to raise awareness and to improve preparedness and action planning cf sinatra urbas vennari et al 2016 vinet et al 2016 also researchers collect flash flood information to verify warnings and to forecast events cf eswd hydrate shave storm events database another reason to set up a flash flood dataset is the investigation of flash flood characteristics on a larger scale e g at state level or for a climate region cf flash he et al 2018 hydrate as a result of the different objectives and applications the flash flood datasets differ regarding structure accuracy and scope a flash flood dataset suitable for historical event modeling for example requires detailed and accurate spatial information on precipitation and discharge for global investigations in contrast it may be sufficient to have aggregated and less detailed space time event information hereafter we will elaborate on the dataset differences in more detail we compared the eleven flash flood datasets regarding their spatial and temporal extent content and event numbers event definitions and accessibility table 1 the flash flood datasets vary regarding to their spatial and temporal extent seven of the 11 listed datasets document flash flood events in europe three datasets concern the united states and one dataset covers china table 1 most of the european datasets cover the mediterranean region where flash floods tend to be more intense than in continental europe gaume et al 2009 furthermore the flash flood datasets comprise different periods while the shortest dataset by he et al 2018 covers 5 years the most comprehensive dataset by vennari et al 2016 starts in 1540 the datasets also differ in regard to content and number of events for instance the smallest dataset the euromedeff dataset includes 49 flash flood events whereas the larger datasets such as the shave dataset and the storms event database comprise several thousand events as a rule the fewer entries a flash flood dataset has the more detailed the event information still the content of the datasets is not completely identical since some researchers interpret the term flash flood more broadly or tackle the hazard from a different perspective the vict in dataset by vinet et al 2016 for instance reports indirectly about flash floods as it documents flash flood fatalities furthermore the datasets by archer et al 2019 and he et al 2018 comprise more than flash flood events while archer et al 2019 include additionally surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain he et al 2018 also consider landslides and debris flows caused by heavy precipitation regarding content the european severe weather database eswd is also a special case since the eswd amongst others reports heavy precipitation events having caused an extreme impact or exceeding a defined threshold amount table 1 the eswd therefore covers the entire range from surface runoff through flash flood events to landslides caused by heavy precipitation the differences among the flash flood datasets emerge when comparing the applied event definition depending on the study objective and climatic region investigated the applied flash flood definitions vary greatly most researchers define event thresholds for considered catchment size 50 to 3 000 km2 and causative rainfall duration up to 48 h conversely the flash dataset limits the flooding rise time to 6 h and the catchment size to 250 km2 whereas a flash flood must have posed a potential threat to life or property and moving and standing water must have exceeded 0 15 m and 0 91 m respectively for inclusion into the storm events database overall the hazard and damage aspect controls the flash flood definition in several datasets see storm events database eswd urbas he et al 2018 vinet et al 2016 however for some datasets it remains unclear which event definition has been applied since the definition is not stated in the dataset description cf vennari et al 2016 vinet et al 2016 archer et al 2019 with the exception of the datasets by vinet et al 2016 and he et al 2018 the presented flash flood datasets are available either through an online database or a publication for many datasets a bulk data download is possible facilitating the use by other researchers although the eswd urbas and sinatra datasets are online a download of selected entries or the entire dataset is not possible this lack of a download possibility severely complicates the dataset use researchers can get access to the events of interest only by manual extraction alternatively the eswd offers event data for sale however the ease of use pays off the hydrate flash and shave datasets which allow for easy use by third parties have already served as the basis in several studies 2 2 collected event information the investigated flash flood datasets contain differently detailed event information depending on the purpose of use while some datasets include a wide range of facts others only provide basic information about event time and location as well as an event description however the event description usually focuses on the damage aspect indicating the occurred losses and the number of injured and killed people except for the us american datasets and the dataset by vinet et al 2016 all datasets provide quantitative information about the triggering precipitation such as amount and duration however some flash flood datasets go beyond that precipitation information specifying for example the peak amount and duration 6 h 12 h and 24 h accumulated rainfall cf eswd or the number of rain gauges and the spatial extent cf hydrate if available furthermore the flash shave hydrate and euromedeff datasets report about the flooding and discharge of the event while the shave and the flash dataset provide estimated values for water depth and bank overflow the hydrate and euromedeff databases indicate mostly modeled flood hydrographs and reconstructed peak discharges as well as measurements from gauging stations moreover the flash and hydrate datasets specify catchment characteristics such as concentration time average slope or land use typically flash flood datasets are of qualitative descriptive information referring to a point namely the impacted town or city event reports therefore usually provide no information on affected areas or event extent the only exceptions to this are the storm events database which has been specifying bounding polygons of flash flood impact and the shave dataset which estimates the spatial event extent since 2008 calianno et al 2013 the hydrate and euromedeff datasets do not provide event extents but indicate peak discharge estimations for various locations in the catchment however spatially distributed precipitation and discharge information as provided by the hydrate and euromedeff datasets remain the exception the eswd dataset is distinguished from the other investigated datasets since the eswd rates the quality of the event reports each event entry submitted via the public eswd interface undergoes quality control qc by the essl according to the qc levels the essl classifies the event report as received qc0 plausibility checked qc0 report confirmed qc1 or event fully verified qc2 dotzek et al 2009 2 3 concluding remarks on the available flash flood datasets the available flash flood datasets reveal large differences regarding scope content and usability however the greatest difference is the spatiotemporal resolution of the provided precipitation and runoff information among the eleven flash flood datasets the precipitation runoff information ranges from no information through aggregated point information to spatially distributed estimates and measurements it generally applies the more detailed and higher the resolution of the hydro meteorological data the smaller the dataset flash flood records underestimate reality by nature as they only cover a subset of occurred events furthermore flash flood documentation naturally focuses on urban areas since this is where the damage occurs and where the events are witnessed as a result flash flood events outside of settlements or without damages are often less documented overall in flash flood documentation we report positive events rather than false alarms however the investigation of events where no flash flood occurred despite enough heavy precipitation could improve the process understanding of flash floods another dataset issue is the inherent uncertainty in event information due to subjectivity in reporting in particular the perception of affected persons may be distorted gourley et al 2013 calianno et al 2013 therefore gourley et al 2013 consider reports from the general public as unreliable according to dotzek et al 2009 media reports are sometimes exaggerated and should thus be treated with caution since these uncertainties can hardly be eliminated researchers have to consider them in the evaluation of the datasets in order to advance flash flood research scientists rely on using existing datasets in particular since available flash flood datasets are still rare however due to differences in event definition and collected event information investigating existing datasets or combining several datasets for further research is challenging besides data integration is hampered by the different focuses of the datasets and resolutions of the information furthermore flash floods are highly region and climate dependent which complicates the merging of datasets as temporal and spatial scales of the flash floods may vary nevertheless dataset pooling across climate regions is possible but requires documentation of the hydro meteorological differences of the flash flood events in the database using existing flash flood datasets is further complicated by the fact that simple reuse of datasets by third parties is often not foreseen by the authors following a consistent and structured approach of flash flood documentation would however facilitate dataset use by others 3 a structured approach for flash flood documentation data collection and preparation are of fundamental importance for knowledge gain before researchers gain insights from a dataset they must perform many preparatory steps however these preparatory steps such as data gathering cleaning and transformation require a considerable amount of time it is assumed that data collection and preparation take 70 to 90 of the total investigation time consequently the time scientists spend on analyses leading to findings is comparatively low scientists therefore lay the foundation for future results during the data collection and preparation process to support the entire process from data preparation to data insights we propose a structured step by step approach our approach is based on the first three steps of the cross industry standard process for data mining known as crisp dm chapman et al 2000 we adapted the approach to the processes of flash flood documentation our process model consists of four steps with no strict order of the steps fig 1 the result of each step determines which step or which task of a step must be carried out next the first step is to define the study targets to this end we determine as precisely and as measurably as possible what the documentation goals are and how we measure the target achievement the purposes and applications of flash flood datasets are manifold ranging from modeling studies through action planning to verification of forecasts cf section 2 1 depending on the study target the requirements for the structure resolution and scope of the data set change furthermore we reflect on how to ensure the sustainability of the dataset what needs to be considered so that other researchers can understand and use the dataset subsequently what needs to be considered if the dataset should be published later data journals support the scientifically recognized publication of datasets today which not only acknowledges data collection efforts but also fosters research progress the second step is to collect and to understand the data first in order to ensure dataset consistency we must establish a flash flood definition considering the local conditions of the study region for example flash floods in the mediterranean region tend to have a greater spatial extent and a longer duration compared to the continental flash floods gaume et al 2009 thus climatic differences lead to different flash flood thresholds in studies e g gaume et al 2009 marchi et al 2010 braud et al 2014 amponsah et al 2018a in addition it should be defined how flash floods are distinguished from river floods cf section 4 1 after the definition has been set possible data sources must be identified cf section 4 2 prior to data collection however a documentation scheme must be developed cf section 4 3 a documentation scheme supports targeted data collection by listing attributes of interest and their respective units after the required data has been collected and described the data is explored the process of data exploration is crucial for scientific knowledge gain since it helps to understand content and characteristics of the dataset furthermore researcher should verify the quality of the collected data so that erroneous values or other inconsistencies can be eliminated from the dataset in addition the uncertainty of the data should be quantified e g using a range of values cf section 4 4 in the third step the collected data is prepared and the flash flood dataset is created for this purpose the data required for the documentation scheme is selected and cleaned an important task in data preparation is data supplementation cf section 4 6 since data supplementation often enables more detailed and complex analyses for instance catchment information or derived discharge parameter could be used to enrich the event dataset subsequently the selected data is transformed into the format or structure needed by the documentation scheme a dataset description ensures that other researchers who may want to use the dataset in the future can understand the data and the processes undertaken during the last of the four steps the created flash flood dataset is validated it is assessed if and to what degree the determined success criteria were achieved at the end the entire process is reviewed to check dataset quality if necessary individual steps are repeated and further data is requested and processed after completing the flash flood dataset the next steps are planned 4 exemplified recommendations for efficient flash flood documentation documentation is an important task in flash flood research since we improve our understanding by studying historical events to improve scientific knowledge gain we provide recommendations on how to document flash flood events efficiently by efficient documentation we mean the creation of a high quality dataset created in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable amount of effort that is reusable by other researchers our recommendations are based on the conducted dataset review and our experience from creating a flash flood dataset we first explain every recommendation theoretically and then exemplify a possible implementation based on our created dataset our dataset was created in the framework of the hios hinweiskarte oberflächenabfluss und sturzflut engl reference map for surface runoff and flash floods project and comprises german flash flood and surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain the primary goal of the hios dataset is the geostatistical investigation of flash flood characteristics and triggering factors in germany with a focus on bavaria we plan to publish the hios dataset at the end of the project previously however publication rights must be clarified as the hios dataset combines event information from different sources for which different legal restrictions may apply 4 1 recommendation 1 clearly state the flash flood definition applied a clear event definition is of crucial importance to enable dataset use by third parties since the event definition clarifies when a flash flood event was included or discarded from the dataset frequently used thresholds in the event definitions concern catchment size triggering rainfall duration and amount as well as time to peak however these thresholds are guiding values since the transition between flash floods and river floods is seamless in addition the strong regional dependence of flash floods makes it difficult to define thresholds that can be uniformly applied over large spatial scales investigating european flash floods for instance requires different thresholds for continental than for mediterranean flash floods cf gaume et al 2009 therefore the study objective and spatial scope are decisive for the definition of flash flood however a clear flash flood definition not only supports dataset reuse by other researchers but also ensures dataset consistency the first step in flash flood documentation is the determination of an event a critical point hereby is the decision whether a past flood event has been a flash flood or a river flood particularly since the transition is seamless nevertheless flash floods and river floods differ in their generation and spatiotemporal spread we have therefore based our distinction between a flash flood and river flood on i event trigger ii event speed and iii catchment size although the most important distinguishing feature is the event trigger i e the precipitation event here we distinguish whether a short intense or a long lasting precipitation caused a flood event since we are using the eswd dataset for germany we are applying the eswd precipitation threshold essl 2014 accordingly we consider heavy precipitation events lasting between 30 min and 24 h and apply the following as the precipitation threshold 1 p 2 5 d where p is the precipitation amount in mm and d is the duration in min since it is not always possible to classify the precipitation event by means of newspaper articles or measurements we are using two additional criteria namely event speed and catchment size therefore when flooding occurs within a few hours we consider this as an indication for a flash flood or surface runoff event triggered by heavy rain in case the flooding rise time of the event is unknown we are using little to no early warning time as a flash flood indicator in addition when the affected catchment is small the event is likely to have been a flash flood as upper threshold we are applying a catchment size of 500 km2 we are further assuming an occurrence period for flash floods in germany from april to october kaiser et al 2020 demonstrated by means of a discharge investigation that these spatiotemporal thresholds are reasonable for bavaria we are supposing that these thresholds are transferable to all of germany to summarize we are defining a flash flood as a sudden flood event triggered by heavy precipitation which lasted no longer than 24 h and exceeded a given minimum precipitation amount in a catchment up to 500 km2 within the period from april to october besides flash flood events our dataset also contains surface runoff events due to heavy precipitation which follow the thresholds defined in the previous paragraph we documented debris flows and landslides as cascading effects of a flash flood event but not as standalone events in our dataset we uniquely define a flash flood event based on event date and affected settlement area with settlement size ranging from a village through a small town to a city according to our event definition only one event per day and affected settlement area can be documented since it is highly unlikely that two flash flood events occur on the same day in the same city our definition is consistent however the event linkage to the affected settlement area results in a concentration on urban areas 4 2 recommendation 2 combine event information from different sources to obtain a comprehensive picture of past events we recommend compiling information from a variety of sources as in most countries and also in germany the documentation of flash floods is still unregulated and required event information is scattered among various sources consequently no government agencies exist that centralize and schematically document flash flood events to facilitate the search for data we listed possible starting points table 2 conceivable sources range from agencies through action force archives to insurance companies and media however the sources differ considerably in regard to accessibility preparation effort and information quality newspaper articles archives of storm spotter networks and weather services are usually readily available online to get access to event information from ministries municipalities or non public archives of action forces is typically more complicated since it requires a personal contact furthermore access to the most valuable information namely high resolution insurance data is usually denied regarding the applied preparation effort the less structured the event information is the more complex is information extraction this is especially true for continuous text like articles or surveys and interviews for generation of the hios dataset we requested various sources for flash flood information we requested information from agencies and institutions at state and federal level in germany as well as from institutions at the european level in addition we requested information from the german weather service and insurance companies in total we sent out 37 requests and obtained flash flood information in about 20 of the cases however the returned event information varied greatly in scope and quality and was therefore not uniformly useful among the obtained information the data of the eswd the bavarian environment agency the sv sparkassenversicherung and the urbas project was particularly extensive the spatiotemporal scope of the used event datasets varies widely while many flash flood events of the hios dataset are available from the 2000s the first entry of the eswd dataset for instance dates to the year 346 table 3 although our dataset comprises all of germany some datasets only cover certain federal states as a result some federal states are overrepresented in regard to the event numbers this applies for instance to the federal states covered by the sv sparkassenversicherung dataset which contains by far the most events with 16 900 entries in addition bavarian flash flood events may also be slightly overrepresented since hios is a bavarian project and we therefore collected more information on bavaria in total we generated a dataset with 23 752 german flash flood and surface runoff events triggered by heavy precipitation for 1 462 events information originates from more than one source 4 3 recommendation 3 use a sophisticated documentation scheme setting up a sophisticated documentation scheme before data collection makes dataset generation more efficient since a documentation scheme determines what information is collected what units the information has and how the information is categorized it helps to focus on the required data data collection and preparation are more targeted that way however the elaboration of a documentation scheme strongly depends on the study purpose nonetheless it is helpful to determine the required mandatory information for the documentation of an event independent of the study purpose in this regard the defined flash flood definition facilitates the decision of whether an event is included or discarded within the hios project we followed a comprehensive and flexible scheme for the documentation of an event our goal was to develop a documentation scheme that supports as many analyses as possible while minimizing the loss of event information therefore our documentation scheme must be able to handle the different accuracy of the information such as descriptions estimates and measurements in addition our scheme covers a wide range of possible event information by supporting the preprocessing of event information our documentation scheme also simplifies later analyses for each event we gathered comprehensive event information on space and time meteorology hydrology and damage table 4 by specifying the attributes to collect the scheme supported targeted data collection therefore it was already known during information retrieval that e g the start of the flooding and the type of flotsam is of interest in total we defined five mandatory attributes for an event entry date village town city zip code source and information quality for attribute description we used free text and fixed categories overall we utilized three types of fixed categories the description with i yes no or null ii default options and iii text blocks in our documentation scheme we omitted free text options whenever possible for several reasons free text information is disadvantageous in event documentation on the one hand there is the risk of information loss if the editor does not write down all of the relevant information for instance it is easy to forget to document non occurrences on the other hand it is difficult to evaluate free text information automatically since texts do not follow rules the evaluation of descriptive texts therefore often remains a time consuming human task however to document information that does not fit given categories or to have an additional option we used free text entries for the comment fields the yes no null category records the occurrence or non occurrence of attributes such as landslides hail or disaster alert by stating null we recorded that the needed information is unknown to report false alarms meaning heavy precipitation events of sufficient magnitude that did not cause surface runoff or a flash flood we documented the non occurrence by indicating no flooding in addition we described some attributes with default options this for example includes the attribute highest affected floor for which the default options are basement first floor second floor and third floor in the meteorology section of the documentation scheme we suggest a set of attributes to describe the triggering processes of a flash flood in addition to heavy rain events we document occurrences of further weather phenomena such as storm lightning and hail in summer heavy rain events are often accompanied by hail which can cause major damage to cars and buildings for damage estimation we therefore document the maximum and average hail diameter as well as the layer thickness of the hail furthermore we record precipitation information derived from weather radar and rain gauge measurements if available we recommend documenting the precipitation start and end which is valuable information combined with the flooding onset to determine the response time of the catchment the visual assessment or automated procedure applied to determine the start and end of the rain event can be described in the comment field besides total precipitation amount and duration we record precipitation sums for different time steps as well as the amount and duration of the precipitation peak for a flash flood event either an interpolated value or multiple station values can be specified in any case we recommend describing relevant information such as the interpolation method applied in the comment on precipitation furthermore the convection of the rain event and the weather condition are valuable event information that should be characterized with regard to hydrological impacts we propose to describe occurring cascade effects and technical failures as well as the flooding flash floods and cascade effects such as debris flows landslides and sediment transport often occur together further possible consequences of flash floods are sewer overflow water pollution and dike breaks we therefore recommend documenting these event impacts with regard to potential damage assessments and event classifications for hydrological investigations it is crucial to consider the initial condition of the catchment as snow cover ground frost and initial soil moisture can strongly influence flood behavior as with precipitation we also document the flooding onset and end in the affected town with regard to the response time of the catchment furthermore we recommend describing in the comment on flooding whether the event was a pluvial flood or rather a flood wave originating from the catchment besides this qualitative information we also document measurements and estimates of peak discharges and water levels at gauging stations or cross sections whereby the estimation method applied should be stated in the comment field furthermore measurements from flood marks can be reported we documented event damages using text blocks consisting of an adjective and a noun to be more precise the text block specifies the damage degree with the adjective and the damaged object with the noun fig 2 the damage degree ranges from minor over medium to severe however we consider minor damages to be temporary restrictions stated by adjectives such as flooded overloaded and blocked when medium damage occurs buildings need to be partially rebuilt or renovated which we expressed with the adjective damaged in contrast severe damage means that buildings e g were completely destroyed and need to be rebuilt following this concept possible damage descriptions are for instance flooded basements damaged stores or eroded agricultural land we documented damages in the categories of buildings forestry and agriculture infrastructure business and others damage information not fitting the text blocks is recorded in the comment column for our documentation scheme we adopted some attributes and default options from the eswd for instance we took over the attributes temporal accuracy spatial accuracy and information quality as well as their default options the attribute spatial accuracy specifies in which radius of the reported settlement area the event has occurred for example within 10 km the specification of the temporal accuracy works similarly here the indicated time states the period in which the event had likely occurred the time of one hour implies that the event has likely occurred up to 30 min earlier or later than the indicated time furthermore we inherited most of the meteorological attributes from the eswd in addition to the information contained in the scheme we recommend saving all available original and describing data of the documented flash flood events this concerns hydrological data such as measured and modeled hydrographs estimated peak discharges and water levels at gauging stations or cross sections concerning the precipitation information we recommend the storage of radar images rainfall maps and rain gauge measurements newspaper articles database extracts and reports from engineering companies and agencies should be stored as well to ensure sustainable documentation of internet sources we recommend offline storage or export as pdf photos and videos also provide valuable insights into the course and extent of the documented flash flood event videos of flash floods for example are suitable for estimating flow velocity sediment transport and flotsam pictures in turn help to document flood marks culverts and damages several papers exist that can provide guidance on post flash flood field investigations gaume and borga 2008 for example propose steps for data collation and data analysis after a flash flood event in addition there are numerous examples of photographs of i slope failures and erosion rills e g gaume and borga 2008 santo et al 2017 ii sediment transport and debris processes e g segura beltrán et al 2016 bronstert et al 2018 lucía et al 2018 iii channel bed widening e g marchi et al 2009 lucía et al 2018 and iv bridges and flood marks e g gaume and borga 2008 segura beltrán et al 2016 bačová mitková et al 2018 moreover marchi et al 2009 describe the evaluation of a flash flood video for flow velocity estimation 4 4 recommendation 4 rate information quality and data uncertainty since information quality can differ strongly depending on the source we recommend rating the reliability of the event information particularly newspaper and eyewitness reports can be subjective and exaggerated as pointed out by dotzek et al 2009 regarding later analyses it is thus advisable to assess the information quality e g similar to the qc levels of the eswd section 2 2 leaving the option to exclude uncertain information in addition event documentation separated by source prevents accuracy loss due to information aggregation since it has to be decided for instance which reported damage sum of which source is more reliable or how to summarize the different given damage information when aggregating event information in addition to the verification of the event information uncertainties especially concerning hydrometeorological data should be quantified and reported flood damage which is commonly estimated is often reported as a range of values reflecting uncertainty overall the quantification of the data uncertainty already during the documentation is beneficial for the later evaluation and use of the flash flood dataset regarding quality estimation of event information we adopted the four levels as received qc0 plausibility checked qc0 report confirmed qc1 and event fully verified qc2 presented by dotzek et al 2009 the hios dataset consists mainly of already quality controlled datasets we verified questionable events reported in the media or indicated in the archive of the federal agency for technical relief based on trusted sources when possible overall two thirds of the hios dataset 67 are fully verified and conform to the highest quality level qc2 more than a quarter of the dataset 27 is verified by a trusted source however only 6 of the dataset meets either the low quality level of qc0 as received or qc0 plausibility checked regarding data uncertainty a range of values indicates possible values for quantitative attributes such as max discharge precipitation amount or damage of buildings further information concerning data uncertainty can be specified in the comment fields 4 5 recommendation 5 report false alarms and minor events to study the rainfall runoff process in its entirety researchers should not focus only on extreme cases but document the entire event spectrum including false alarms however researchers naturally concentrate on positive events especially catastrophic flash flood events yet studies should also include negative events meaning heavy precipitation events of sufficient magnitude that did not cause surface runoff or flash floods since studying negative events will help us understand why no flash flood was caused in certain catchments or under certain conditions contrasting positive and negative events will give researchers the greatest insight into causative processes in addition to false alarms researchers should also document minor flash flood events not only disasters flash floods cover a wide range of possible magnitudes and impacts the question of when one refers to a flash flood therefore plays an important role particularly for early warning from the perspective of protection planning minor events are especially relevant since much damage can be prevented by self provision in accordance with our documentation scheme we documented false alarms by indicating no flooding however this was only the case for five heavy rain events since we did not have access to flash flood warnings finding out about heavy rain events sufficient to trigger flash flooding was virtually impossible in addition the data was often not accurate enough to determine with certainty that no flash flood had occurred since we also documented surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain our dataset contains a large number of minor events 4 6 recommendation 6 supplement the dataset data supplementation is an important step in data mining since it extends analysis options and thus increases knowledge gain several ways exist to supplement an event dataset that describes space time and impacts of past flash floods on the one hand it is possible to supplement discharge attributes of the flash flood events since the event hydrograph contains a lot of information it is crucial for flash flood investigation to include this information when available to obtain a robust flash flood classification it is advisable to derive additional descriptive parameters from the event hydrograph besides the return period for instance the time to peak and the specific peak discharge help to classify the flash flood event precipitation data also improve the information value of a flash flood dataset in addition to precipitation data such as sum and intensity the return period and the convective storm trajectory might be of interest precipitation especially in combination with discharge adds a lot of information with precipitation and discharge data it is possible to determine the runoff coefficient and to investigate the catchment response to the triggering rain flash flood classification facilitates the estimation of event magnitude and event comparison in the dataset currently there are two ways to classify flash floods the classification either uses parameters derived from event discharge and precipitation e g bhaskar et al 2000 kim and kim 2014 saharia et al 2017 or the classification categorizes flash flood impacts e g schroeder et al 2016 in addition supplementation of spatial data is crucial for flash flood investigation in particular catchment information is needed to understand the catchment response to heavy rain in this regard data describing catchment characteristics such as soil and land use distribution as well as catchment parameters such as average slope river density or basin shape are valuable we supplemented our event dataset by administrative data catchment information e g boundaries streams and gauges and catchment characteristics as well as soil and land use maps in addition we derived discharge attributes time to peak specific peak discharge volume gradient peak to volume from the event hydrographs as described by kaiser et al 2020 overall the supplementation of event information by measurement and catchment data gives us the opportunity to link different datasets and perform holistic analyses 5 the hios flash flood dataset 5 1 occurrence of flash flood events in germany from 2000 the amount of documented events increases steadily towards recent decades with most events documented from the 2000 s this is probably due to the internet which has drastically simplified the search for past flash flood events in addition there has been a marked increase in public interest in natural hazards over the past decade not least because of recurring severe events fig 3 states the flash flood and surface runoff events collected per year and by federal state however it has to be noted that bavarian events are probably slightly overrepresented in fig 3 since two datasets that we used only cover bavaria cf table 3 to obtain a reasonably comparable dataset throughout germany we excluded the insurance dataset 16 900 events from the figure which covers only 4 out of 16 federal states furthermore the size of the insurance data would skew the color bar fig 3 highlights that some federal states such as baden wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south and north rhine westphalia in the west of germany have been affected more often than others in addition eventful years like 2007 2011 2014 and 2016 are striking yet not all federal states were equally affected in those eventful years in 2007 and 2014 north rhine westphalia and hesse were hit particularly hard with more than 150 events each however in 2011 large parts of germany were affected with five federal states having experienced more than 100 events for bavaria the year 2016 for which we documented 410 flash flood and surface runoff events was particularly severe 5 2 relationship between watershed area and unit peak discharge the watershed area significantly influences the peak discharge therefore the investigation of the peak discharge watershed area relationship provides insights into the catchment behavior for reasons of comparison the unit peak discharge as the ratio of the peak discharge and the upstream catchment area and the watershed area are plotted in a log log diagram in literature the upper limit of this relationship is usually described by empirically derived envelope curves e g marchi et al 2009 borga et al 2011 amponsah et al 2018a fig 4 shows 50 measured flash flood events of bavaria which are contained in the hios database for classification into the climatic regions of europe we also plot the envelope curves for mediterranean alpine mediterranean and inland continental flash floods derived by amponsah et al 2018a we further display the envelope curve for bavarian flash floods derived from a discharge study by kaiser et al 2020 the reported flash flood events have mostly unit peak discharges 1 m3 s 1 km 2 and are thus far from the upper limit of the mediterranean and alpine mediterranean flash floods according to borga et al 2011 these differences in intensity can be explained by the different spatial and temporal resolution of the generating heavy rain events in the different climatic and orographic regions therefore it is not surprising that the upper bounds for bavarian and inland continental flash floods lie close together overall a decline in unit peak discharge with increasing watershed area is noticeable for the bavarian events 6 discussion 6 1 insights from flash flood dataset creation data request and collection proved to be more tedious and difficult than expected since flash flood documentation is not regulated in germany we requested flash flood documentation from relevant federal offices as well as from all environment ministries and agencies of the 16 german federal states however the data return was sobering only two federal states could provide a list of a few flash flood events the main reasons given for the lack of documentation were unclear responsibility and lack of funds particularly time consuming was information extraction from reports archive entries and newspaper articles in contrast data migration was less time consuming when datasets stemmed from databases and were thus preprocessed such as the eswd or the sv sparkassenversicherung dataset in addition event validation was a complex matter overall we spent more than one year on data request collection and preparation furthermore the level of detail of the event descriptions varies widely the event descriptions range from mere event naming to detailed event information on damage and hydro meteorological conditions for 6 of the collected flash flood events we do not know more than the place and date on average five describing attributes per event have been collected additionally to place and date in which damage descriptions are usually available however half of the events 53 are described with 2 to 5 additional attributes less than a third 28 with 6 to 10 attributes only 1 of the events are described with at least 11 additional attributes by documenting event information separated by information quality and source we maintain flexibility for later analyses separation by source allows us to easily remove information from the hios dataset such as the confidential insurance record furthermore we can exclude data from less trusted sources from analyses this flexibility however is no longer assured once event information is mixed the indication of information quality offers similar benefits the hios dataset contains event information of different quality levels we included uncertain event information qc0 because we believe that insecure information can also provide valuable indications on event course and magnitude since scientists have to deal with data uncertainty regularly we are convinced that scientific users can be offered uncertain event information moreover by indicating information quality scientists can decide for themselves whether they include uncertain event information or not non expert users however should only be provided with fully verified event information qc2 after completing the hios dataset we have to summarize that only scarce and vague information exists about most events while information comes from several detailed reports of water management offices and engineering companies for a few events most events are described rudimentarily in newspaper articles furthermore estimated losses given in newspaper articles are often aggregated for the entire affected county therefore loss allocation to individual cities is usually uncertain or impossible in addition the evaluation of damage descriptions causes problems when several affected cities are described together in articles frequently vague are also the documented times for precipitation and flooding onset and end we estimate that the hios dataset from the 2000s is roughly comprehensive and representative for germany still we do not consider the hios dataset to be suitable for studies or statements on climate change since comprehensive data collection has only taken place in the last two decades the collected german flash flood events show a pronounced inland continental character with most of the reported events having unit peak discharges smaller than 1 m3 s 1 km 2 german flash floods are much less intense than alpine mediterranean and mediterranean flash floods 6 2 findings from flash flood dataset review in the context of data scarcity and the simultaneously growing importance of flash flood research discussing and defining documentation standards for flash floods becomes increasingly important however as the comparison of existing datasets proves current flash flood documentation does not follow a uniform approach depending on the objective of the planned investigations flash flood datasets vary with regard to information quantity quality and resolution regarding current literature our proposed documentation scheme is more comprehensive in terms of number and variability of attributes than many existing flash flood datasets by collecting information about space and time meteorology hydrology and damage we cover the entire flash flood event from its origins to its impacts while some available flash flood datasets provide comprehensive event information e g euromedeff hydrate others only document the information required for the study objective e g vinet et al 2016 shave or give a rudimentary event overview e g sinatra storm events database in contrast our scheme specifies exactly which attributes should be reported and how despite the attribute specifications our approach can be flexibly applied to different types of reports and information in addition the documentation scheme also supports the evaluation of qualitative information by using default options and text blocks for attribute description overall we believe it is necessary to document flash floods as comprehensively as possible in terms of knowledge gain and dataset sustainability there are several potential applications and users of our proposed approach one target group are environmental agencies that want to establish a central flash flood documentation provided that the information is available the agency can use our approach to create a comprehensive dataset that is useful for various stakeholders furthermore the detailed attribute specifications make it easier for less experienced users and non experts to collect and prepare flash flood information other potential users are scientists who want to create a comprehensive dataset that can serve multiple study purposes as well as interdisciplinary investigations our documentation scheme allows for damage assessments but does not support damage modeling at house level in addition hydrological modeling of past events is only possible if measured rainfall runoff measurements are available the findings of this study however have to be seen in the light of some limitations the primary limitation of our proposed approach is the use of a documentation scheme applying fixed categorical descriptions while our documentation scheme facilitates collection and preparation of event data by its specifications it simultaneously fosters information loss although standardizing of event information is beneficial for later analyses unification reduces the information content using categorical descriptions for attributes may further lead to misclassification due to inappropriate class boundaries especially outliers and information with seamless transitions can hardly be categorized adequately consequently the inflexibility of categorical descriptions regarding complex information is disadvantageous we have therefore added comment fields in which we documented relevant information not fitting the default categories to reduce information loss to summarize the application of a documentation scheme for flash flood events implies both advantages and disadvantages however to further improve the proposed scheme the tradeoff between unifying information on the one hand and necessary complexity on the other should be investigated furthermore the proposed documentation scheme needs to be applied and adapted to different climatic conditions to reach generalizability and especially damage categorization 7 conclusion historical event documentation is the starting point of flash flood research however flash flood science still suffers from data scarcity increasing the need of researchers for structured high quality event datasets yet there are few published flash flood datasets of which only some allow reuse by other researchers furthermore the existing flash flood datasets differ significantly in flash flood definition to dataset content since a consistent documentation approach is missing to support the process of data collection and preparation we suggest a 4 step approach for flash flood documentation based on the cross industry standard process for data mining the key aspects of our approach include determination of the documentation goals definition of a flash flood event and application of a documentation scheme in this paper we demonstrated application of the proposed approach based on the generation of a german flash flood and surface runoff event dataset we developed a documentation scheme indicating the attributes to be collected in regard to space and time meteorology hydrology and damage by using yes no null categories default options and text blocks for the attribute description we simplify and structure event documentation furthermore indicating information quality and uncertainty and keeping information separated by source helps to generate a high quality dataset due to the internet and increasing interest in natural hazards it is easier to collect event information from the 2000s nonetheless the collection of flash flood information remains an arduous task that often ends with little and vague event information especially for minor events reviewing our experiences from dataset comparison and dataset generation we can make the following recommendations to improve future documentation of flash floods 1 follow a clearly defined flash flood definition 2 compose event information from different sources 3 apply a sophisticated documentation scheme 4 estimate information quality and data uncertainty 5 include false alarms and minor events in your documentation and 6 enrich your event dataset with measurement and catchment data to enhance sustainability and knowledge gain future work should focus on a unification of flash flood datasets for this purpose we need to discuss the documentation process and define standards to push the generation of event datasets we further have to simplify data collection by e g publishing peer reviewed data articles or contributing to topical open data platforms in the end flash flood science will benefit from these well organized and structured event datasets with this paper we hope to establish a discussion on data collection in flash flood science which will further clarify the

5931,flash flood research crucially relies on historical event information for hypothesis testing however flash flood science suffers from data scarcity due to the high effort for event data collection few long term and comprehensive flash flood datasets exist yet to advance flash flood research scientists should spend time on creating event datasets therefore to reduce the data collection and preparation effort this paper takes a first step towards structuring the flash flood documentation procedure in this context we first investigate the current documentation approaches by reviewing 11 published flash flood datasets we found great differences between the flash flood datasets regarding temporal and spatial scope information density flash flood definition and usability by others based on the review findings and the cross industry standard process for data mining we propose a structured 4 step approach for flash flood documentation we provide recommendations on efficient flash flood documentation and exemplify a possible implementation based on a german flash flood dataset starting from flash flood definition through the identification of sources to the schematic event documentation the key feature of our approach is a documentation scheme specifying what event information to report and how within the documentation scheme it proved particularly helpful to use fixed categories for attribute description to rate information quality and to document events separated by source following our approach we were able to create a comprehensive event dataset composed of a variety of sources in addition to flash flood events our dataset also includes surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain adding up to nearly 23 800 german events scientists can employ this approach to document flash floods more efficiently in the future keywords flash flood data collection documentation scheme database damage categorization 1 introduction flash flood research starts with a journey into the past based on historical flash flood events we aim to learn for the future however being able to learn from past events requires documentation of the generation course and impacts of flash flood events therefore event documentation marks the beginning of flash flood research and thus is of fundamental importance regardless of whether researchers want to advance flash flood understanding modeling or forecasting they rely on historical event information for their investigations recently researchers used flash flood event datasets for verification of forecasts and warnings e g creutin et al 2009 calianno et al 2013 gourley et al 2017 auer et al 2019 for investigations of flash flood characteristics e g gaume et al 2009 marchi et al 2010 tarolli et al 2012 he et al 2018 for studies on flood risk management e g einfalt et al 2009 and for identification of flood prone areas e g vinet et al 2016 saharia et al 2017 in recent years researchers have increasingly used post flood field surveys and hydrometeorological networks to collect flash flood data post flood investigations help to reproduce the mechanisms and the course of a flash flood event besides the reconstruction of the event the post flash flood surveys focus on understanding the damage processes e g laudan et al 2017 investigating the geomorphic response e g lucía et al 2018 analyzing the hydrometeorological forcing e g marchi et al 2009 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 bronstert et al 2018 and reconstructing the hydrograph e g segura beltrán et al 2016 bačová mitková et al 2018 there is also a growing number of scientific papers investigating data collected from radar rain gauge networks with regard to flash floods e g bouilloud et al 2010 boudevillain et al 2016 varlas et al 2019 in particular radar images private rain gauge networks unmanned aerial vehicles and citizen science offer new opportunities for data collation e g smith and rodriguez 2017 diakakis et al 2019 seibert et al 2019 despite the increasing number of possible data sources long term flash flood datasets are still limited braud et al 2016 therefore in the editorial of the special issue of journal of hydrology entitled flash floods hydro geomorphic response and risk management braud et al 2016 call on the community to intensify data collection efforts for advancing knowledge gain conceivable reasons for the lack of data inventories are manifold but certainly include i the high effort for data collection and preparation ii lack of data especially weather radar data iii lack of funds and iv lack of recognition one reason why flash flood documentation is time consuming is because event information is usually scattered among different sources e g agencies media and action forces furthermore no documentation guidelines exist describing the dataset generation process also the few published datasets provide little information on how to document flash floods while lack of funds and lack of recognition are difficult to solve flash flood science should try to facilitate dataset generation to tackle data scarcity in flash flood research we are convinced that it is necessary to simplify and clarify the process of flash flood documentation a structured documentation approach for instance makes data preparation more efficient ensures data quality and facilitates data use by third parties therefore we aim to streamline the process of flash flood documentation to increase the number of available flash flood datasets and thus foster flash flood research in this paper we demonstrate how to document flash flood events by following a structured approach that applies a comprehensive and flexible documentation scheme first we prove why a structured approach is needed by highlighting key differences and limitations of existing flash flood datasets and databases section 2 subsequently we propose a structured approach for flash flood documentation to make dataset generation more efficient section 3 following we give recommendations for flash flood documentation based on the conducted dataset review and our experience in flash flood dataset generation section 4 we exemplify the practical implementation of our recommendations based on a german dataset then we shortly present the created flash flood dataset section 5 finally we discuss our findings from dataset creation and review section 6 and provide concluding remarks section 7 2 current flash flood documentation a review 2 1 comparison of published flash flood datasets and databases several published datasets exist that document flash flood and surface runoff events triggered by heavy precipitation most of these flash flood datasets are results from scientific studies and projects however institutions such as the european severe storms laboratory essl the national severe storms laboratory nssl or the national weather service nws of the united states also operate topical databases according to our review only eleven published flash flood datasets exist table 1 the purposes of these eleven flash flood datasets vary greatly some datasets serve as a basis for modeling studies and advancing process understanding cf euromedeff flash other flash flood datasets are created to raise awareness and to improve preparedness and action planning cf sinatra urbas vennari et al 2016 vinet et al 2016 also researchers collect flash flood information to verify warnings and to forecast events cf eswd hydrate shave storm events database another reason to set up a flash flood dataset is the investigation of flash flood characteristics on a larger scale e g at state level or for a climate region cf flash he et al 2018 hydrate as a result of the different objectives and applications the flash flood datasets differ regarding structure accuracy and scope a flash flood dataset suitable for historical event modeling for example requires detailed and accurate spatial information on precipitation and discharge for global investigations in contrast it may be sufficient to have aggregated and less detailed space time event information hereafter we will elaborate on the dataset differences in more detail we compared the eleven flash flood datasets regarding their spatial and temporal extent content and event numbers event definitions and accessibility table 1 the flash flood datasets vary regarding to their spatial and temporal extent seven of the 11 listed datasets document flash flood events in europe three datasets concern the united states and one dataset covers china table 1 most of the european datasets cover the mediterranean region where flash floods tend to be more intense than in continental europe gaume et al 2009 furthermore the flash flood datasets comprise different periods while the shortest dataset by he et al 2018 covers 5 years the most comprehensive dataset by vennari et al 2016 starts in 1540 the datasets also differ in regard to content and number of events for instance the smallest dataset the euromedeff dataset includes 49 flash flood events whereas the larger datasets such as the shave dataset and the storms event database comprise several thousand events as a rule the fewer entries a flash flood dataset has the more detailed the event information still the content of the datasets is not completely identical since some researchers interpret the term flash flood more broadly or tackle the hazard from a different perspective the vict in dataset by vinet et al 2016 for instance reports indirectly about flash floods as it documents flash flood fatalities furthermore the datasets by archer et al 2019 and he et al 2018 comprise more than flash flood events while archer et al 2019 include additionally surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain he et al 2018 also consider landslides and debris flows caused by heavy precipitation regarding content the european severe weather database eswd is also a special case since the eswd amongst others reports heavy precipitation events having caused an extreme impact or exceeding a defined threshold amount table 1 the eswd therefore covers the entire range from surface runoff through flash flood events to landslides caused by heavy precipitation the differences among the flash flood datasets emerge when comparing the applied event definition depending on the study objective and climatic region investigated the applied flash flood definitions vary greatly most researchers define event thresholds for considered catchment size 50 to 3 000 km2 and causative rainfall duration up to 48 h conversely the flash dataset limits the flooding rise time to 6 h and the catchment size to 250 km2 whereas a flash flood must have posed a potential threat to life or property and moving and standing water must have exceeded 0 15 m and 0 91 m respectively for inclusion into the storm events database overall the hazard and damage aspect controls the flash flood definition in several datasets see storm events database eswd urbas he et al 2018 vinet et al 2016 however for some datasets it remains unclear which event definition has been applied since the definition is not stated in the dataset description cf vennari et al 2016 vinet et al 2016 archer et al 2019 with the exception of the datasets by vinet et al 2016 and he et al 2018 the presented flash flood datasets are available either through an online database or a publication for many datasets a bulk data download is possible facilitating the use by other researchers although the eswd urbas and sinatra datasets are online a download of selected entries or the entire dataset is not possible this lack of a download possibility severely complicates the dataset use researchers can get access to the events of interest only by manual extraction alternatively the eswd offers event data for sale however the ease of use pays off the hydrate flash and shave datasets which allow for easy use by third parties have already served as the basis in several studies 2 2 collected event information the investigated flash flood datasets contain differently detailed event information depending on the purpose of use while some datasets include a wide range of facts others only provide basic information about event time and location as well as an event description however the event description usually focuses on the damage aspect indicating the occurred losses and the number of injured and killed people except for the us american datasets and the dataset by vinet et al 2016 all datasets provide quantitative information about the triggering precipitation such as amount and duration however some flash flood datasets go beyond that precipitation information specifying for example the peak amount and duration 6 h 12 h and 24 h accumulated rainfall cf eswd or the number of rain gauges and the spatial extent cf hydrate if available furthermore the flash shave hydrate and euromedeff datasets report about the flooding and discharge of the event while the shave and the flash dataset provide estimated values for water depth and bank overflow the hydrate and euromedeff databases indicate mostly modeled flood hydrographs and reconstructed peak discharges as well as measurements from gauging stations moreover the flash and hydrate datasets specify catchment characteristics such as concentration time average slope or land use typically flash flood datasets are of qualitative descriptive information referring to a point namely the impacted town or city event reports therefore usually provide no information on affected areas or event extent the only exceptions to this are the storm events database which has been specifying bounding polygons of flash flood impact and the shave dataset which estimates the spatial event extent since 2008 calianno et al 2013 the hydrate and euromedeff datasets do not provide event extents but indicate peak discharge estimations for various locations in the catchment however spatially distributed precipitation and discharge information as provided by the hydrate and euromedeff datasets remain the exception the eswd dataset is distinguished from the other investigated datasets since the eswd rates the quality of the event reports each event entry submitted via the public eswd interface undergoes quality control qc by the essl according to the qc levels the essl classifies the event report as received qc0 plausibility checked qc0 report confirmed qc1 or event fully verified qc2 dotzek et al 2009 2 3 concluding remarks on the available flash flood datasets the available flash flood datasets reveal large differences regarding scope content and usability however the greatest difference is the spatiotemporal resolution of the provided precipitation and runoff information among the eleven flash flood datasets the precipitation runoff information ranges from no information through aggregated point information to spatially distributed estimates and measurements it generally applies the more detailed and higher the resolution of the hydro meteorological data the smaller the dataset flash flood records underestimate reality by nature as they only cover a subset of occurred events furthermore flash flood documentation naturally focuses on urban areas since this is where the damage occurs and where the events are witnessed as a result flash flood events outside of settlements or without damages are often less documented overall in flash flood documentation we report positive events rather than false alarms however the investigation of events where no flash flood occurred despite enough heavy precipitation could improve the process understanding of flash floods another dataset issue is the inherent uncertainty in event information due to subjectivity in reporting in particular the perception of affected persons may be distorted gourley et al 2013 calianno et al 2013 therefore gourley et al 2013 consider reports from the general public as unreliable according to dotzek et al 2009 media reports are sometimes exaggerated and should thus be treated with caution since these uncertainties can hardly be eliminated researchers have to consider them in the evaluation of the datasets in order to advance flash flood research scientists rely on using existing datasets in particular since available flash flood datasets are still rare however due to differences in event definition and collected event information investigating existing datasets or combining several datasets for further research is challenging besides data integration is hampered by the different focuses of the datasets and resolutions of the information furthermore flash floods are highly region and climate dependent which complicates the merging of datasets as temporal and spatial scales of the flash floods may vary nevertheless dataset pooling across climate regions is possible but requires documentation of the hydro meteorological differences of the flash flood events in the database using existing flash flood datasets is further complicated by the fact that simple reuse of datasets by third parties is often not foreseen by the authors following a consistent and structured approach of flash flood documentation would however facilitate dataset use by others 3 a structured approach for flash flood documentation data collection and preparation are of fundamental importance for knowledge gain before researchers gain insights from a dataset they must perform many preparatory steps however these preparatory steps such as data gathering cleaning and transformation require a considerable amount of time it is assumed that data collection and preparation take 70 to 90 of the total investigation time consequently the time scientists spend on analyses leading to findings is comparatively low scientists therefore lay the foundation for future results during the data collection and preparation process to support the entire process from data preparation to data insights we propose a structured step by step approach our approach is based on the first three steps of the cross industry standard process for data mining known as crisp dm chapman et al 2000 we adapted the approach to the processes of flash flood documentation our process model consists of four steps with no strict order of the steps fig 1 the result of each step determines which step or which task of a step must be carried out next the first step is to define the study targets to this end we determine as precisely and as measurably as possible what the documentation goals are and how we measure the target achievement the purposes and applications of flash flood datasets are manifold ranging from modeling studies through action planning to verification of forecasts cf section 2 1 depending on the study target the requirements for the structure resolution and scope of the data set change furthermore we reflect on how to ensure the sustainability of the dataset what needs to be considered so that other researchers can understand and use the dataset subsequently what needs to be considered if the dataset should be published later data journals support the scientifically recognized publication of datasets today which not only acknowledges data collection efforts but also fosters research progress the second step is to collect and to understand the data first in order to ensure dataset consistency we must establish a flash flood definition considering the local conditions of the study region for example flash floods in the mediterranean region tend to have a greater spatial extent and a longer duration compared to the continental flash floods gaume et al 2009 thus climatic differences lead to different flash flood thresholds in studies e g gaume et al 2009 marchi et al 2010 braud et al 2014 amponsah et al 2018a in addition it should be defined how flash floods are distinguished from river floods cf section 4 1 after the definition has been set possible data sources must be identified cf section 4 2 prior to data collection however a documentation scheme must be developed cf section 4 3 a documentation scheme supports targeted data collection by listing attributes of interest and their respective units after the required data has been collected and described the data is explored the process of data exploration is crucial for scientific knowledge gain since it helps to understand content and characteristics of the dataset furthermore researcher should verify the quality of the collected data so that erroneous values or other inconsistencies can be eliminated from the dataset in addition the uncertainty of the data should be quantified e g using a range of values cf section 4 4 in the third step the collected data is prepared and the flash flood dataset is created for this purpose the data required for the documentation scheme is selected and cleaned an important task in data preparation is data supplementation cf section 4 6 since data supplementation often enables more detailed and complex analyses for instance catchment information or derived discharge parameter could be used to enrich the event dataset subsequently the selected data is transformed into the format or structure needed by the documentation scheme a dataset description ensures that other researchers who may want to use the dataset in the future can understand the data and the processes undertaken during the last of the four steps the created flash flood dataset is validated it is assessed if and to what degree the determined success criteria were achieved at the end the entire process is reviewed to check dataset quality if necessary individual steps are repeated and further data is requested and processed after completing the flash flood dataset the next steps are planned 4 exemplified recommendations for efficient flash flood documentation documentation is an important task in flash flood research since we improve our understanding by studying historical events to improve scientific knowledge gain we provide recommendations on how to document flash flood events efficiently by efficient documentation we mean the creation of a high quality dataset created in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable amount of effort that is reusable by other researchers our recommendations are based on the conducted dataset review and our experience from creating a flash flood dataset we first explain every recommendation theoretically and then exemplify a possible implementation based on our created dataset our dataset was created in the framework of the hios hinweiskarte oberflächenabfluss und sturzflut engl reference map for surface runoff and flash floods project and comprises german flash flood and surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain the primary goal of the hios dataset is the geostatistical investigation of flash flood characteristics and triggering factors in germany with a focus on bavaria we plan to publish the hios dataset at the end of the project previously however publication rights must be clarified as the hios dataset combines event information from different sources for which different legal restrictions may apply 4 1 recommendation 1 clearly state the flash flood definition applied a clear event definition is of crucial importance to enable dataset use by third parties since the event definition clarifies when a flash flood event was included or discarded from the dataset frequently used thresholds in the event definitions concern catchment size triggering rainfall duration and amount as well as time to peak however these thresholds are guiding values since the transition between flash floods and river floods is seamless in addition the strong regional dependence of flash floods makes it difficult to define thresholds that can be uniformly applied over large spatial scales investigating european flash floods for instance requires different thresholds for continental than for mediterranean flash floods cf gaume et al 2009 therefore the study objective and spatial scope are decisive for the definition of flash flood however a clear flash flood definition not only supports dataset reuse by other researchers but also ensures dataset consistency the first step in flash flood documentation is the determination of an event a critical point hereby is the decision whether a past flood event has been a flash flood or a river flood particularly since the transition is seamless nevertheless flash floods and river floods differ in their generation and spatiotemporal spread we have therefore based our distinction between a flash flood and river flood on i event trigger ii event speed and iii catchment size although the most important distinguishing feature is the event trigger i e the precipitation event here we distinguish whether a short intense or a long lasting precipitation caused a flood event since we are using the eswd dataset for germany we are applying the eswd precipitation threshold essl 2014 accordingly we consider heavy precipitation events lasting between 30 min and 24 h and apply the following as the precipitation threshold 1 p 2 5 d where p is the precipitation amount in mm and d is the duration in min since it is not always possible to classify the precipitation event by means of newspaper articles or measurements we are using two additional criteria namely event speed and catchment size therefore when flooding occurs within a few hours we consider this as an indication for a flash flood or surface runoff event triggered by heavy rain in case the flooding rise time of the event is unknown we are using little to no early warning time as a flash flood indicator in addition when the affected catchment is small the event is likely to have been a flash flood as upper threshold we are applying a catchment size of 500 km2 we are further assuming an occurrence period for flash floods in germany from april to october kaiser et al 2020 demonstrated by means of a discharge investigation that these spatiotemporal thresholds are reasonable for bavaria we are supposing that these thresholds are transferable to all of germany to summarize we are defining a flash flood as a sudden flood event triggered by heavy precipitation which lasted no longer than 24 h and exceeded a given minimum precipitation amount in a catchment up to 500 km2 within the period from april to october besides flash flood events our dataset also contains surface runoff events due to heavy precipitation which follow the thresholds defined in the previous paragraph we documented debris flows and landslides as cascading effects of a flash flood event but not as standalone events in our dataset we uniquely define a flash flood event based on event date and affected settlement area with settlement size ranging from a village through a small town to a city according to our event definition only one event per day and affected settlement area can be documented since it is highly unlikely that two flash flood events occur on the same day in the same city our definition is consistent however the event linkage to the affected settlement area results in a concentration on urban areas 4 2 recommendation 2 combine event information from different sources to obtain a comprehensive picture of past events we recommend compiling information from a variety of sources as in most countries and also in germany the documentation of flash floods is still unregulated and required event information is scattered among various sources consequently no government agencies exist that centralize and schematically document flash flood events to facilitate the search for data we listed possible starting points table 2 conceivable sources range from agencies through action force archives to insurance companies and media however the sources differ considerably in regard to accessibility preparation effort and information quality newspaper articles archives of storm spotter networks and weather services are usually readily available online to get access to event information from ministries municipalities or non public archives of action forces is typically more complicated since it requires a personal contact furthermore access to the most valuable information namely high resolution insurance data is usually denied regarding the applied preparation effort the less structured the event information is the more complex is information extraction this is especially true for continuous text like articles or surveys and interviews for generation of the hios dataset we requested various sources for flash flood information we requested information from agencies and institutions at state and federal level in germany as well as from institutions at the european level in addition we requested information from the german weather service and insurance companies in total we sent out 37 requests and obtained flash flood information in about 20 of the cases however the returned event information varied greatly in scope and quality and was therefore not uniformly useful among the obtained information the data of the eswd the bavarian environment agency the sv sparkassenversicherung and the urbas project was particularly extensive the spatiotemporal scope of the used event datasets varies widely while many flash flood events of the hios dataset are available from the 2000s the first entry of the eswd dataset for instance dates to the year 346 table 3 although our dataset comprises all of germany some datasets only cover certain federal states as a result some federal states are overrepresented in regard to the event numbers this applies for instance to the federal states covered by the sv sparkassenversicherung dataset which contains by far the most events with 16 900 entries in addition bavarian flash flood events may also be slightly overrepresented since hios is a bavarian project and we therefore collected more information on bavaria in total we generated a dataset with 23 752 german flash flood and surface runoff events triggered by heavy precipitation for 1 462 events information originates from more than one source 4 3 recommendation 3 use a sophisticated documentation scheme setting up a sophisticated documentation scheme before data collection makes dataset generation more efficient since a documentation scheme determines what information is collected what units the information has and how the information is categorized it helps to focus on the required data data collection and preparation are more targeted that way however the elaboration of a documentation scheme strongly depends on the study purpose nonetheless it is helpful to determine the required mandatory information for the documentation of an event independent of the study purpose in this regard the defined flash flood definition facilitates the decision of whether an event is included or discarded within the hios project we followed a comprehensive and flexible scheme for the documentation of an event our goal was to develop a documentation scheme that supports as many analyses as possible while minimizing the loss of event information therefore our documentation scheme must be able to handle the different accuracy of the information such as descriptions estimates and measurements in addition our scheme covers a wide range of possible event information by supporting the preprocessing of event information our documentation scheme also simplifies later analyses for each event we gathered comprehensive event information on space and time meteorology hydrology and damage table 4 by specifying the attributes to collect the scheme supported targeted data collection therefore it was already known during information retrieval that e g the start of the flooding and the type of flotsam is of interest in total we defined five mandatory attributes for an event entry date village town city zip code source and information quality for attribute description we used free text and fixed categories overall we utilized three types of fixed categories the description with i yes no or null ii default options and iii text blocks in our documentation scheme we omitted free text options whenever possible for several reasons free text information is disadvantageous in event documentation on the one hand there is the risk of information loss if the editor does not write down all of the relevant information for instance it is easy to forget to document non occurrences on the other hand it is difficult to evaluate free text information automatically since texts do not follow rules the evaluation of descriptive texts therefore often remains a time consuming human task however to document information that does not fit given categories or to have an additional option we used free text entries for the comment fields the yes no null category records the occurrence or non occurrence of attributes such as landslides hail or disaster alert by stating null we recorded that the needed information is unknown to report false alarms meaning heavy precipitation events of sufficient magnitude that did not cause surface runoff or a flash flood we documented the non occurrence by indicating no flooding in addition we described some attributes with default options this for example includes the attribute highest affected floor for which the default options are basement first floor second floor and third floor in the meteorology section of the documentation scheme we suggest a set of attributes to describe the triggering processes of a flash flood in addition to heavy rain events we document occurrences of further weather phenomena such as storm lightning and hail in summer heavy rain events are often accompanied by hail which can cause major damage to cars and buildings for damage estimation we therefore document the maximum and average hail diameter as well as the layer thickness of the hail furthermore we record precipitation information derived from weather radar and rain gauge measurements if available we recommend documenting the precipitation start and end which is valuable information combined with the flooding onset to determine the response time of the catchment the visual assessment or automated procedure applied to determine the start and end of the rain event can be described in the comment field besides total precipitation amount and duration we record precipitation sums for different time steps as well as the amount and duration of the precipitation peak for a flash flood event either an interpolated value or multiple station values can be specified in any case we recommend describing relevant information such as the interpolation method applied in the comment on precipitation furthermore the convection of the rain event and the weather condition are valuable event information that should be characterized with regard to hydrological impacts we propose to describe occurring cascade effects and technical failures as well as the flooding flash floods and cascade effects such as debris flows landslides and sediment transport often occur together further possible consequences of flash floods are sewer overflow water pollution and dike breaks we therefore recommend documenting these event impacts with regard to potential damage assessments and event classifications for hydrological investigations it is crucial to consider the initial condition of the catchment as snow cover ground frost and initial soil moisture can strongly influence flood behavior as with precipitation we also document the flooding onset and end in the affected town with regard to the response time of the catchment furthermore we recommend describing in the comment on flooding whether the event was a pluvial flood or rather a flood wave originating from the catchment besides this qualitative information we also document measurements and estimates of peak discharges and water levels at gauging stations or cross sections whereby the estimation method applied should be stated in the comment field furthermore measurements from flood marks can be reported we documented event damages using text blocks consisting of an adjective and a noun to be more precise the text block specifies the damage degree with the adjective and the damaged object with the noun fig 2 the damage degree ranges from minor over medium to severe however we consider minor damages to be temporary restrictions stated by adjectives such as flooded overloaded and blocked when medium damage occurs buildings need to be partially rebuilt or renovated which we expressed with the adjective damaged in contrast severe damage means that buildings e g were completely destroyed and need to be rebuilt following this concept possible damage descriptions are for instance flooded basements damaged stores or eroded agricultural land we documented damages in the categories of buildings forestry and agriculture infrastructure business and others damage information not fitting the text blocks is recorded in the comment column for our documentation scheme we adopted some attributes and default options from the eswd for instance we took over the attributes temporal accuracy spatial accuracy and information quality as well as their default options the attribute spatial accuracy specifies in which radius of the reported settlement area the event has occurred for example within 10 km the specification of the temporal accuracy works similarly here the indicated time states the period in which the event had likely occurred the time of one hour implies that the event has likely occurred up to 30 min earlier or later than the indicated time furthermore we inherited most of the meteorological attributes from the eswd in addition to the information contained in the scheme we recommend saving all available original and describing data of the documented flash flood events this concerns hydrological data such as measured and modeled hydrographs estimated peak discharges and water levels at gauging stations or cross sections concerning the precipitation information we recommend the storage of radar images rainfall maps and rain gauge measurements newspaper articles database extracts and reports from engineering companies and agencies should be stored as well to ensure sustainable documentation of internet sources we recommend offline storage or export as pdf photos and videos also provide valuable insights into the course and extent of the documented flash flood event videos of flash floods for example are suitable for estimating flow velocity sediment transport and flotsam pictures in turn help to document flood marks culverts and damages several papers exist that can provide guidance on post flash flood field investigations gaume and borga 2008 for example propose steps for data collation and data analysis after a flash flood event in addition there are numerous examples of photographs of i slope failures and erosion rills e g gaume and borga 2008 santo et al 2017 ii sediment transport and debris processes e g segura beltrán et al 2016 bronstert et al 2018 lucía et al 2018 iii channel bed widening e g marchi et al 2009 lucía et al 2018 and iv bridges and flood marks e g gaume and borga 2008 segura beltrán et al 2016 bačová mitková et al 2018 moreover marchi et al 2009 describe the evaluation of a flash flood video for flow velocity estimation 4 4 recommendation 4 rate information quality and data uncertainty since information quality can differ strongly depending on the source we recommend rating the reliability of the event information particularly newspaper and eyewitness reports can be subjective and exaggerated as pointed out by dotzek et al 2009 regarding later analyses it is thus advisable to assess the information quality e g similar to the qc levels of the eswd section 2 2 leaving the option to exclude uncertain information in addition event documentation separated by source prevents accuracy loss due to information aggregation since it has to be decided for instance which reported damage sum of which source is more reliable or how to summarize the different given damage information when aggregating event information in addition to the verification of the event information uncertainties especially concerning hydrometeorological data should be quantified and reported flood damage which is commonly estimated is often reported as a range of values reflecting uncertainty overall the quantification of the data uncertainty already during the documentation is beneficial for the later evaluation and use of the flash flood dataset regarding quality estimation of event information we adopted the four levels as received qc0 plausibility checked qc0 report confirmed qc1 and event fully verified qc2 presented by dotzek et al 2009 the hios dataset consists mainly of already quality controlled datasets we verified questionable events reported in the media or indicated in the archive of the federal agency for technical relief based on trusted sources when possible overall two thirds of the hios dataset 67 are fully verified and conform to the highest quality level qc2 more than a quarter of the dataset 27 is verified by a trusted source however only 6 of the dataset meets either the low quality level of qc0 as received or qc0 plausibility checked regarding data uncertainty a range of values indicates possible values for quantitative attributes such as max discharge precipitation amount or damage of buildings further information concerning data uncertainty can be specified in the comment fields 4 5 recommendation 5 report false alarms and minor events to study the rainfall runoff process in its entirety researchers should not focus only on extreme cases but document the entire event spectrum including false alarms however researchers naturally concentrate on positive events especially catastrophic flash flood events yet studies should also include negative events meaning heavy precipitation events of sufficient magnitude that did not cause surface runoff or flash floods since studying negative events will help us understand why no flash flood was caused in certain catchments or under certain conditions contrasting positive and negative events will give researchers the greatest insight into causative processes in addition to false alarms researchers should also document minor flash flood events not only disasters flash floods cover a wide range of possible magnitudes and impacts the question of when one refers to a flash flood therefore plays an important role particularly for early warning from the perspective of protection planning minor events are especially relevant since much damage can be prevented by self provision in accordance with our documentation scheme we documented false alarms by indicating no flooding however this was only the case for five heavy rain events since we did not have access to flash flood warnings finding out about heavy rain events sufficient to trigger flash flooding was virtually impossible in addition the data was often not accurate enough to determine with certainty that no flash flood had occurred since we also documented surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain our dataset contains a large number of minor events 4 6 recommendation 6 supplement the dataset data supplementation is an important step in data mining since it extends analysis options and thus increases knowledge gain several ways exist to supplement an event dataset that describes space time and impacts of past flash floods on the one hand it is possible to supplement discharge attributes of the flash flood events since the event hydrograph contains a lot of information it is crucial for flash flood investigation to include this information when available to obtain a robust flash flood classification it is advisable to derive additional descriptive parameters from the event hydrograph besides the return period for instance the time to peak and the specific peak discharge help to classify the flash flood event precipitation data also improve the information value of a flash flood dataset in addition to precipitation data such as sum and intensity the return period and the convective storm trajectory might be of interest precipitation especially in combination with discharge adds a lot of information with precipitation and discharge data it is possible to determine the runoff coefficient and to investigate the catchment response to the triggering rain flash flood classification facilitates the estimation of event magnitude and event comparison in the dataset currently there are two ways to classify flash floods the classification either uses parameters derived from event discharge and precipitation e g bhaskar et al 2000 kim and kim 2014 saharia et al 2017 or the classification categorizes flash flood impacts e g schroeder et al 2016 in addition supplementation of spatial data is crucial for flash flood investigation in particular catchment information is needed to understand the catchment response to heavy rain in this regard data describing catchment characteristics such as soil and land use distribution as well as catchment parameters such as average slope river density or basin shape are valuable we supplemented our event dataset by administrative data catchment information e g boundaries streams and gauges and catchment characteristics as well as soil and land use maps in addition we derived discharge attributes time to peak specific peak discharge volume gradient peak to volume from the event hydrographs as described by kaiser et al 2020 overall the supplementation of event information by measurement and catchment data gives us the opportunity to link different datasets and perform holistic analyses 5 the hios flash flood dataset 5 1 occurrence of flash flood events in germany from 2000 the amount of documented events increases steadily towards recent decades with most events documented from the 2000 s this is probably due to the internet which has drastically simplified the search for past flash flood events in addition there has been a marked increase in public interest in natural hazards over the past decade not least because of recurring severe events fig 3 states the flash flood and surface runoff events collected per year and by federal state however it has to be noted that bavarian events are probably slightly overrepresented in fig 3 since two datasets that we used only cover bavaria cf table 3 to obtain a reasonably comparable dataset throughout germany we excluded the insurance dataset 16 900 events from the figure which covers only 4 out of 16 federal states furthermore the size of the insurance data would skew the color bar fig 3 highlights that some federal states such as baden wuerttemberg and bavaria in the south and north rhine westphalia in the west of germany have been affected more often than others in addition eventful years like 2007 2011 2014 and 2016 are striking yet not all federal states were equally affected in those eventful years in 2007 and 2014 north rhine westphalia and hesse were hit particularly hard with more than 150 events each however in 2011 large parts of germany were affected with five federal states having experienced more than 100 events for bavaria the year 2016 for which we documented 410 flash flood and surface runoff events was particularly severe 5 2 relationship between watershed area and unit peak discharge the watershed area significantly influences the peak discharge therefore the investigation of the peak discharge watershed area relationship provides insights into the catchment behavior for reasons of comparison the unit peak discharge as the ratio of the peak discharge and the upstream catchment area and the watershed area are plotted in a log log diagram in literature the upper limit of this relationship is usually described by empirically derived envelope curves e g marchi et al 2009 borga et al 2011 amponsah et al 2018a fig 4 shows 50 measured flash flood events of bavaria which are contained in the hios database for classification into the climatic regions of europe we also plot the envelope curves for mediterranean alpine mediterranean and inland continental flash floods derived by amponsah et al 2018a we further display the envelope curve for bavarian flash floods derived from a discharge study by kaiser et al 2020 the reported flash flood events have mostly unit peak discharges 1 m3 s 1 km 2 and are thus far from the upper limit of the mediterranean and alpine mediterranean flash floods according to borga et al 2011 these differences in intensity can be explained by the different spatial and temporal resolution of the generating heavy rain events in the different climatic and orographic regions therefore it is not surprising that the upper bounds for bavarian and inland continental flash floods lie close together overall a decline in unit peak discharge with increasing watershed area is noticeable for the bavarian events 6 discussion 6 1 insights from flash flood dataset creation data request and collection proved to be more tedious and difficult than expected since flash flood documentation is not regulated in germany we requested flash flood documentation from relevant federal offices as well as from all environment ministries and agencies of the 16 german federal states however the data return was sobering only two federal states could provide a list of a few flash flood events the main reasons given for the lack of documentation were unclear responsibility and lack of funds particularly time consuming was information extraction from reports archive entries and newspaper articles in contrast data migration was less time consuming when datasets stemmed from databases and were thus preprocessed such as the eswd or the sv sparkassenversicherung dataset in addition event validation was a complex matter overall we spent more than one year on data request collection and preparation furthermore the level of detail of the event descriptions varies widely the event descriptions range from mere event naming to detailed event information on damage and hydro meteorological conditions for 6 of the collected flash flood events we do not know more than the place and date on average five describing attributes per event have been collected additionally to place and date in which damage descriptions are usually available however half of the events 53 are described with 2 to 5 additional attributes less than a third 28 with 6 to 10 attributes only 1 of the events are described with at least 11 additional attributes by documenting event information separated by information quality and source we maintain flexibility for later analyses separation by source allows us to easily remove information from the hios dataset such as the confidential insurance record furthermore we can exclude data from less trusted sources from analyses this flexibility however is no longer assured once event information is mixed the indication of information quality offers similar benefits the hios dataset contains event information of different quality levels we included uncertain event information qc0 because we believe that insecure information can also provide valuable indications on event course and magnitude since scientists have to deal with data uncertainty regularly we are convinced that scientific users can be offered uncertain event information moreover by indicating information quality scientists can decide for themselves whether they include uncertain event information or not non expert users however should only be provided with fully verified event information qc2 after completing the hios dataset we have to summarize that only scarce and vague information exists about most events while information comes from several detailed reports of water management offices and engineering companies for a few events most events are described rudimentarily in newspaper articles furthermore estimated losses given in newspaper articles are often aggregated for the entire affected county therefore loss allocation to individual cities is usually uncertain or impossible in addition the evaluation of damage descriptions causes problems when several affected cities are described together in articles frequently vague are also the documented times for precipitation and flooding onset and end we estimate that the hios dataset from the 2000s is roughly comprehensive and representative for germany still we do not consider the hios dataset to be suitable for studies or statements on climate change since comprehensive data collection has only taken place in the last two decades the collected german flash flood events show a pronounced inland continental character with most of the reported events having unit peak discharges smaller than 1 m3 s 1 km 2 german flash floods are much less intense than alpine mediterranean and mediterranean flash floods 6 2 findings from flash flood dataset review in the context of data scarcity and the simultaneously growing importance of flash flood research discussing and defining documentation standards for flash floods becomes increasingly important however as the comparison of existing datasets proves current flash flood documentation does not follow a uniform approach depending on the objective of the planned investigations flash flood datasets vary with regard to information quantity quality and resolution regarding current literature our proposed documentation scheme is more comprehensive in terms of number and variability of attributes than many existing flash flood datasets by collecting information about space and time meteorology hydrology and damage we cover the entire flash flood event from its origins to its impacts while some available flash flood datasets provide comprehensive event information e g euromedeff hydrate others only document the information required for the study objective e g vinet et al 2016 shave or give a rudimentary event overview e g sinatra storm events database in contrast our scheme specifies exactly which attributes should be reported and how despite the attribute specifications our approach can be flexibly applied to different types of reports and information in addition the documentation scheme also supports the evaluation of qualitative information by using default options and text blocks for attribute description overall we believe it is necessary to document flash floods as comprehensively as possible in terms of knowledge gain and dataset sustainability there are several potential applications and users of our proposed approach one target group are environmental agencies that want to establish a central flash flood documentation provided that the information is available the agency can use our approach to create a comprehensive dataset that is useful for various stakeholders furthermore the detailed attribute specifications make it easier for less experienced users and non experts to collect and prepare flash flood information other potential users are scientists who want to create a comprehensive dataset that can serve multiple study purposes as well as interdisciplinary investigations our documentation scheme allows for damage assessments but does not support damage modeling at house level in addition hydrological modeling of past events is only possible if measured rainfall runoff measurements are available the findings of this study however have to be seen in the light of some limitations the primary limitation of our proposed approach is the use of a documentation scheme applying fixed categorical descriptions while our documentation scheme facilitates collection and preparation of event data by its specifications it simultaneously fosters information loss although standardizing of event information is beneficial for later analyses unification reduces the information content using categorical descriptions for attributes may further lead to misclassification due to inappropriate class boundaries especially outliers and information with seamless transitions can hardly be categorized adequately consequently the inflexibility of categorical descriptions regarding complex information is disadvantageous we have therefore added comment fields in which we documented relevant information not fitting the default categories to reduce information loss to summarize the application of a documentation scheme for flash flood events implies both advantages and disadvantages however to further improve the proposed scheme the tradeoff between unifying information on the one hand and necessary complexity on the other should be investigated furthermore the proposed documentation scheme needs to be applied and adapted to different climatic conditions to reach generalizability and especially damage categorization 7 conclusion historical event documentation is the starting point of flash flood research however flash flood science still suffers from data scarcity increasing the need of researchers for structured high quality event datasets yet there are few published flash flood datasets of which only some allow reuse by other researchers furthermore the existing flash flood datasets differ significantly in flash flood definition to dataset content since a consistent documentation approach is missing to support the process of data collection and preparation we suggest a 4 step approach for flash flood documentation based on the cross industry standard process for data mining the key aspects of our approach include determination of the documentation goals definition of a flash flood event and application of a documentation scheme in this paper we demonstrated application of the proposed approach based on the generation of a german flash flood and surface runoff event dataset we developed a documentation scheme indicating the attributes to be collected in regard to space and time meteorology hydrology and damage by using yes no null categories default options and text blocks for the attribute description we simplify and structure event documentation furthermore indicating information quality and uncertainty and keeping information separated by source helps to generate a high quality dataset due to the internet and increasing interest in natural hazards it is easier to collect event information from the 2000s nonetheless the collection of flash flood information remains an arduous task that often ends with little and vague event information especially for minor events reviewing our experiences from dataset comparison and dataset generation we can make the following recommendations to improve future documentation of flash floods 1 follow a clearly defined flash flood definition 2 compose event information from different sources 3 apply a sophisticated documentation scheme 4 estimate information quality and data uncertainty 5 include false alarms and minor events in your documentation and 6 enrich your event dataset with measurement and catchment data to enhance sustainability and knowledge gain future work should focus on a unification of flash flood datasets for this purpose we need to discuss the documentation process and define standards to push the generation of event datasets we further have to simplify data collection by e g publishing peer reviewed data articles or contributing to topical open data platforms in the end flash flood science will benefit from these well organized and structured event datasets with this paper we hope to establish a discussion on data collection in flash flood science which will further clarify the

results of mars to achieve more accuracy for modeling te multivariate adaptive regression splines mars was used similar to other types of soft computing models preparation of mars model is based on dataset to use the mars technique the toolbox developed by jekabsons 2011 was used to this purpose collected dataset considering eq 3 was randomly divided into two groups of training and testing eighty five percent of the total data was considered for developing mars model and the rest 15 percent for testing during mars model development in the first step 10 basic functions were considered

models in training left and testing right stages are given in fig 14 comparing the performance of mars and gep in terms of ddr index shows that mars model is more accurate reviewing the histogram of ddr of gmdh gep and mars shows that gep and gmdh have lower estimation properties but the ddr values for mars model specially in testing as shown in fig 14 are almost accumulate around zero 4

designing the structures of chromosomes initially a single gene or multiple genes with two head length were used numbers of genes and heads increased one after another during each simulation and the performance of each model is evaluated in development stages training and testing 2 2 4 choose the linking function only summation or multiplication connecting operators could be selected for linking sub trees 2 2 5 setting gep operators assign the weights to gep operators including mutation transposition and recombination this process was repeated for a pre specified number of generations or until a solution was found guven and kişi 2010 kisi and guven 2010 2 3 gamma test gt gamma test gt was developed for data analysis this method is used for modeling dataset in other words this model is

in the self organizing methods gmdh were developed by ivakhnenko 1971 in this model complex network are gradually developed with regard the performance of combination of pairs of inputs and desired output each pairs of inputs are introduced to a neuron in gmdh network in the first hidden layer all combination of inputs pairs are evaluated number of neurons in the first hidden layer are calculated as below 15 n inp n inp 1 2 as stated in the first hidden layer each pairs of inputs are introduced to a neuron that a quadratic polynomial function is governing equation on it in other words each pairs of inputs are passed through a quadratic polynomial function as below 16 y g x i x j w 0 w 1 x i w 2 x j w 3 x i 2 w 4 x j 2 w 5 x i x j where y is the output of each neuron x i and x

selected karbasi and azamathulla 2016 najafzadeh 2015 najafzadeh and lim 2015 najafzadeh and sattar 2015 3 results 3 1 experimental results results of experiments considering dimensionless parameters are given in table 1 data collected in this study are analyzed to prepare an empirical formula for trap efficiency of detention dams the empirical formula was developed based on nonlinear regression technique the original form of empirical formula is shown in eq 18 and using least square technique the practical form of empirical formula is derived as eq 19 18 t e a a 1 s b a 2 d 50 v f 3 c a 3 γ s γ w d a 4 v f v s e 19 t e 17 64 12 92 s 0 002 0 001 d 50 v f 3 9 52 0 99 γ s γ w 0 89 19 79 v f v s 0 001 the accuracy of empirical formula during development stage is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse for calculating te are 0 65 and 15 17 respectively considering eq 19 it was found that γ s γ w and d 50 v f 3 have more weight compared to others this means that these parameters play a more important role in trap efficiency of detention dams 3 2 results of gamma test to analyze the obtained results from regression operation gamma test technique is used to define the most effective parameters gt parameters such as gamma gradient standard error and v ratio were chosen as criteria to define the most important parameters during gt analysis different scenarios were considered the results of which are given in table 2 in the first scenario all input parameters regarding eq 3 were considered and parameters of gt were calculated and presented in the first row of table 2 then in the next scenario one of the input parameters was removed and again gt parameters were calculated and presented in the next rows of table 2 as presented in table 2 minimum value for gt parameters is related to the first row containing all input parameters table 2 shows that removing d 50 v f 3 causes a sudden increase in the value of parameters of gt this change means that this parameter has a significant effect on te and in the second priority v f v s is effective comparing results of gt and nonlinear regression shows that both methods upheld that d 50 v f 3 is one of the most effective parameters on te gt showed that v f v s are more effective whereas nonlinear regression emphasized γ s γ w during experiments authors realized that v f v s is more effective 3 3 results of gep to achieve the relation between independent parameters and depended parameter using evolutionary algorithms gep was used results of gep are shown in fig 5 weights of each gene derived from the gep model are given in fig 6 mathematical forms of genes are given in eqs 20 22 and final form of derived formula is given in eq 23 gene 1 and bias

and testing eighty five percent of the dataset was used for preparation and the rest was used for testing the model parameters used in the development stage of gep are given in table 3 choosing these values for gep model was derived based on trial and error and recommendations of guven and aytek 2009 performances of gep model during preparation and testing stages are shown in figs 7 and 8 3 4 results of mars to achieve more accuracy for modeling te multivariate adaptive regression splines mars was used similar to other types of soft computing models preparation of mars model is based on dataset to use the mars technique the toolbox developed by jekabsons 2011 was used to this purpose collected dataset considering eq 3 was randomly divided into two groups of training and testing eighty five percent of the total data was considered for developing mars model and the rest 15 percent for testing during mars model development in the first step 10 basic functions were considered and in the second step pruning step one basic function was pruned at the end optimal mars model with 9 basic functions was derived the general form of obtained mars model is given in eq 24 the extended form of mars model is given in table 4 24 t e 113 459 m 1 9 β m h m x eq 24 can be used for predicting te as seen in table 4 d 50 v f 3 and γ s γ w have been appeared in most basic functions it means that these three parameters are more effective on te compared to other parameters this result from mars model upholds the results of gt moreover performances of mars model during development process training and testing stages are given in figs 9 and 10 figs 9 and 10 plotted mars model along and versus the observed data moreover results of error indices calculation are appeared in these figures these figures show that performance of mars model for prediction of te is so suitable especially compared to empirical formula comparing the performance of mars and gep shows that mars model is more accurate than gep 3 5 results of gmdh in this section the performance of gmdh model to model the involved parameters on te was investigated to develop the gmdh model dataset which had been used for preparation of previous models mars and gep were utilized results of derived gmdh model are presented in table 5 and structure of derived gmdh model is shown in fig 11 as shown in this figure proposed model contained three hidden layers attention to this figure shows that most influenced parameters on te are g s and d 50 v f 3 this point derived from the structure of gmdh model upheld the results of gep and mars models in term of most effective parameters results of justified constants and coefficients of transfer functions during the training the gmdh model is presented in table 5 performance of gmdh in training stage is shown in figs 11 and 12 as presented in these figures results of proposed gmdh are presented along the measured data and to provide more information outcome of gmdh model were plotted versus the measured data reviewing these figures shows that proposed gmdh model has suitable performance for modeling and predicting the te see fig 13 3 6 developed discrepancy ratio statistics comparing the performance of mars gep and mars shows that mars model is more accurate than others this evaluation was based on the obtained standard error indices such as coefficient of determination and mean square of errors standard error indices provide an average value for errors whereas they do not present detailed information on distribution of errors therefore it is necessary to assess the performance of model during the development stages through the dataset to this purpose another evaluation criterion is applied in this paper the developed discrepancy ratio ddr introduced by noori et al 2010c was applied the ddr index also analyses the model properties in term of over estimation or lower estimation in both stages of model preparation this index has also been used in several studies namely noori and hooshyaripor 2014 as well as dehghani et al 2014 the ddr is calculated as follows 25 ddr predicted value observed value 1 results of ddr calculation for three models in training left and testing right stages are given in fig 14 comparing the performance of mars and gep in terms of ddr index shows that mars model is more accurate reviewing the histogram of ddr of gmdh gep and mars shows that gep and gmdh have lower estimation properties but the ddr values for mars model specially in testing as shown in fig 14 are almost accumulate around zero 4 conclusion in this study trap efficiency te of detention dams was measured in a laboratory study and then to define the mathematical relation between parameters affecting te four approaches including nonlinear regression gene expression programming gep multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and group method of data handling were used to define the most effective parameters on te gamma test gt was used and developed discrepancy ratio ddr statistics was calculated results of gt indicated that the size of sediments d 50 v f 3 and ratio of volume of flood to volume of sediments v f v s are the most effective parameters on te evaluating the performance of all applied soft computing techniques showed that all of them have suitable performance but comparing them in terms of ddr index showed that mars model is more accurate reviewing the structure of proposed model based on gmdh mars and gep shows that g s d 50 v f 3 and v f v s are the most effective parameters that upheld the results of gt results show that soft computing approaches which clearly define the relation between influenced parameters can be used instead of conventional mathematical approaches including nonlinear regression method these soft computing techniques could model the desired phenomena more accurately especially compared to the conventional methods conflict of interest no conflict of interest 
5933,approach methods and results from a comprehensive integrated water resources modeling framework for the lower mekong basin lmb are presented in this paper the modeling suite was specifically tailored to the known conditions and data availability at key locations within the lmb and more particularly within the floodplains of cambodia and the mekong river delta of vietnam model simulation output was used to project cumulative changes to hydraulic sediment and water quality parameters likely to occur in this relatively unique system under multiple scenarios of hydropower development in the lmb while substantial changes in river flow regimes are predicted as a result of hydropeaking operations especially when combined with dry season drawdowns to maximize power production the multiple scenario analysis indicated that overall the largest changes are expected to be in loss of sediment and nutrient transport and reduction of water quality due to increased salinity intrusion into areas of the mekong delta keywords mekong vietnam hydropower modeling nutrient transport 1 introduction and background twelve hydropower projects 11 dams and 1 large water diversion project have been proposed for the mekong river mainstream in lao pdr and cambodia to increase power generation capacity fig 1 construction and operation of any or all of these projects could have substantial environmental and socio economic effects in all four lower mekong basin lmb countries in particular the downstream floodplains of cambodia and viet nam along with the mekong river delta could experience the greatest impacts as a first step in evaluating the potential effects of hydropower development on these countries an integrated modeling framework was developed to provide best available data on cumulative changes to hydrological sediment and water quality parameters due to multiple scenarios of hydropower development several prior studies have reported on potential effects of tributary and mainstream hydropower development in the lmb including the strategic environmental assessment sea of hydropower on the mekong mainstream icem 2010 and the lower mekong basin development plan 2 bdp2 mrc 2011 another recent relevant report is a working paper on economic environmental and social impacts of hydropower development in the lmb intralawan et al 2015 which updates prior analyses reported by costanza et al 2011 the sea took a higher level strategic perspective that was focused on providing policy options for mainstream hydropower development and it provided input to the mekong river commission s mrc procedures for notification prior consultation and agreement process the bdp2 evaluated costs and benefits of different basin wide hydropower development scenarios across all four countries including full mainstream 11 proposed dams and tributary development 30 planned tributary dams through 2030 these studies also evaluated the cumulative effects of mainstream hydropower development on people and resources throughout the lmb including the mekong delta the sea and other prior studies concluded that while collectively the proposed lmb dams would produce almost 15 000 megawatts of power and boost regional energy production by almost 25 development of mainstream hydropower projects would have significant effects on the movement of water and sediment in the lmb including changes to the timing and magnitude of seasonal flows additional studies such as those by wild and loucks 2015 and mrc 2016 show that projected impacts to sediment transport and seasonal flows could potentially be exacerbated by developments on tributaries to the mekong these cumulative impacts could devastate fisheries and riverside gardens which in turn would affect food security of a large majority of the 60 million people that inhabit the lmb and rely upon river resources for much of their food supply a world wildlife fund study wwf 2013 reported that downstream sediment loads which have already been impacted by existing dams and sand mining could be reduced further by the proposed lmb dams causing further loss of agricultural lands in the delta lands which are already impacted by subsidence due to groundwater abstraction changes in river flood pulses could also lead to increased salt water intrusion which could become more severe with the changing climate and rapid land development in the delta the studies also identified substantial data uncertainty and limitations to the assessment process such as uncertainty about future development scenarios social data and the response of fisheries to changes in aquatic systems the models and data used to characterize hydropower development impacts by prior studies for the entire lmb have substantial limitations for the evaluation of impacts in the mekong river floodplains and the mekong delta this is because the environment in the delta differs considerably from the rest of the lmb in many ways for example river flows in the vietnamese portions of the mekong delta are highly controlled by a series of canals dikes and related infrastructures these water management structures must be accounted for in delta specific analyses and hydrological models models of the mekong delta in particular must also consider tidal fluctuations salinity intrusion and other influences of the marine and coastal environment in addition the delta differs from the rest of the lmb because it is highly developed more urbanized and densely populated and land use is dominated by extensive agricultural production also much of the available historical data is not most suitable for environmental impact analyses other studies have evaluated impacts associated with individual tributary dams in the lmb hecht and lacombe 2014 lacombe et al 2014 piman et al 2012 reis et al 2014 and warren 1999 the results from analyses of smaller tributary dams cannot be extrapolated to the entire basin therefore the government of viet nam in close cooperation with the governments of lao pdr and cambodia conducted an independent assessment to study the overall impact of the proposed lmb mainstream hydropower cascade on the natural social and economic systems of cambodian and vietnamese floodplains the primary objectives of this study were to evaluate changes projected to occur in the hydrological processes of the lmb resulting from construction and operation of the proposed mainstream hydropower cascade and assess how these changes could potentially impact the human and natural environment in the cambodian and vietnamese floodplains this objective supports the overall goal of safeguarding the mekong delta and its resources economies and natural systems and ensuring the continued well being of communities and their livelihoods in the delta region through informed and scientifically supported decision making on the use and exploitation of the river s water and related resources the study was completed in a phased manner and during each phase robust consultation workshops were organized at the national and regional levels to describe progress and results and seek consensus from key stakeholders in member countries non governmental organizations and residents in lao pdr cambodia and viet nam the approach methods and results from a comprehensive integrated water resources modeling framework for the lower mekong basin lmb are presented in this paper 2 the lower mekong basin the mekong river originates in tibet and flows for almost 4800 km km through china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and viet nam before discharging to the east sea the river drainage basin covers approximately 795 000 square kilometers km2 and it can be broadly divided into an upper mekong basin umb and a lower mekong basin lmb the umb includes riparian areas in china and myanmar whereas the lmb encompasses territories of lao pdr thailand cambodia and viet nam the basin includes the tonle sap river great lake gl system which is a defining feature of the cambodian floodplains the 130 km long tonle sap river connects the gl with the mekong river and it is characterized by low channel slope and an extensive floodplain the low channel slope and the high variation of flow in the mekong river induce a seasonal change in the direction of flow in the river the reversal of flow produces two distinct seasons based on the direction of the flow during the dry season water flows out of the lake towards the mekong river and it remains confined to the low slope channel during the wet season the flow reverses direction and inundates a vast floodplain area the great lake is the largest wetland in southeast asia kummu et al 2008 and the catchment of the lake basin covers an area of around 67 000 km2 during the dry season the lake covers approximately 2500 3000 km2 during peak flood events this area expands up to five times to almost 15 000 km2 kummu et al 2008 the lmb is currently undergoing rapid development twenty six hydropower projects of 10 megawatts are under construction on various tributaries future country basin development plans also include proposals to increase dry season irrigation by 50 percent from 1 2 to 1 8 million hectares major irrigation expansion projects are currently being evaluated in all riparian countries the lmb countries also plan to further develop aquaculture and improve fisheries management navigation flood and drought management and tourism development 2 1 the proposed lmb hydropower cascade locations and preliminary design specifications of existing and proposed dam projects are shown in table 1 in general the storage capacity of these dams is relatively small compared to the actual flow of the mekong river with a mean annual flow of approximately 460 km3 on average the reservoirs can only store the average flow in the mekong for 1 2 days consequently those dams cannot be operated to store water seasonally or to create large seasonal changes in the water flow in the mekong river 3 the cumulative change assessment modeling setup 3 1 impact drivers the four physical characteristics of the river system that would primarily be changed due to the construction and operation of the cascade namely hydrology sediment water quality and connectivity dams acting as physical barriers were included in the integrated model setup since hydropower dams are designed to store and manage water releases they influence key hydrological characteristics of the river system the lmb cascade change assessment hydrological modeling was focused on simulating and quantifying changes in downstream flows water levels water volume and extent and timing of inundation hydropower dams reduce sediment flow by physically blocking trapping the movement of riverbed material and increase the settling rate of suspended particles a decrease in sediment transport directly leads to a reduction in deposition of sediment onto downstream floodplains which in turn decreases soil buildup to quantify changes in sediment transport and deposition likely to be caused by the proposed lmb cascade changes in sediment concentrations sediment deposition rates riverbank erosion and deposition rates and coastal erosion and deposition rates were modeled and evaluated a decrease in sediment transport would also cause a reduction in the transport and deposition of nutrients attached to the sediment the floodplains of the mekong river receive large annual influxes of nutrients during floods which influences agricultural production and the primary productivity of all downstream biological systems also by reducing freshwater river flows and volumes the proposed dams could increase salinity intrusion in coastal areas resulting in changes in salinity concentrations that could impact agricultural production and availability of fresh water during the dry season in parts of the vietnamese delta water quality modeling was included in the model setup to quantify changes in nutrient transport and deposition and changes in salinity concentrations and intrusion 3 2 the modeling framework a customized and integrated modeling framework fig 2 consisting of the following models was set up and calibrated as appropriate a mekong mainstream model a one dimensional hydrodynamic river model mike11 simulating the hydraulics and morphology of the mekong mainstream from the chinese border down to kratie for simulation of flow transport of sediment and nutrients and river morphology along the main river b china model a coarse schematic river and reservoir hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool of the part of the umb that is affected by the chinese reservoir cascade for simulation of the impacts of the chinese cascade and provision of boundary conditions for model a mekong mainstream model c time series of observed or assumed flow rainfall water levels and sediment loads and or concentrations providing the necessary boundary conditions for the models d the hydrological swat soil and water assessment tool models previously developed calibrated and validated by rossi et al 2009 for the lmb were used to provide inflows to mike hydrobasin hereafter simply mike basin describing the flow in the river networks in the catchments of the lmb e mike basin receiving run off from the swat models to simulate the regulation and water use in the main tributaries and delivering the outflows from the catchments to the mekong mainstream model taking into consideration water demands and reservoirs in the catchments f reservoir models detailed two dimensional hydrodynamic and morphological models established in the mike 21c software package of the proposed mainstream reservoirs and of the dams these models simulate the sedimentation and operations of the reservoirs these models intersect the mekong mainstream model model a in fig 2 from where they receive their upstream boundary conditions likewise they export their simulated reservoir impacts back to the mekong mainstream model downstream the reservoir models were used to study in detail mitigation measures such as sediment flushing etc a combined two dimensional hydraulic and sediment model for the great lake tonle sap region is also included g delta model the detailed quasi two dimensional flood cell model of the rivers and canals in the mekong delta this is a mike 11 model of the complex river and canal network and the flood cells in the delta this model simulates the impacts on the delta from the changed flow and sediment regimes received from the mekong mainstream model the delta model simulates salinity and nutrients in the rivers along with the flooding pattern sediment concentrations and nutrient contribution to the flood cells flood plain sedimentation in the various parts of the delta h coastal and estuary model mike 21 is used to assess the impact on the sediment transport and deposition patterns affecting the morphological developments in the lower part of the delta including the coastline as a consequence of the simulated changes in river inflows and sediment concentrations i the ecolab model was set up to simulate the nutrients such as phosphorus p and nitrogen n the ecolab model was combined with the mekong mainstream model and its sediment transport components the results from these models are used to assess the impacts on nutrient transport and nutrient deposition in the floodplains of the delta the models pass results in the form of time series of water levels discharge flow velocities and sediment concentrations to calculations of indicators used to link the differences in the results of the river models to the consequent impacts on biodiversity livelihood and agriculture 3 3 model simulation input data input data on precipitation evaporation water levels discharges salinity and nutrients for hydrology and hydraulics model setups were obtained from multiple sources including the mrc database input data for both sediment models and nutrient and salinity modeling were sourced from the mrc s information and knowledge management programme discharge and sediment measuring program ikmp dsmp and mrc water quality monitoring programs mrc wq site specific sediment and nutrient quality data were also collected in 2014 as part of the study reported here the modeling had to rely upon less reliable data from digital elevation models of the deltaic floodplains especially in cambodia and information on operation of the chinese reservoirs was also not readily available detailed topographic information of the areas to be inundated by the proposed lmb hydropower schemes was only available for xayaburi and luang prabang projects while data for some aspects of the study such as sediments were limited relative to their importance in the overall basin system this is a common occurrence in large systems such as the lmb wild and loucks 2015 acknowledged similar constraints particularly relative to rates of sediment production trapping and transport for the mekong basin the mrc has subsequently conducted modeling and assessment of cumulative sediment trapping in the tributaries as well as mainstream of the mekong as part of the council study under mrc however those data were not developed or available at the time of this study the modeling input dataset used for the study reported here represented the most updated compilation of relevant hydro meteorological sediment and water quality data available in 2014 3 4 model calibration to ensure confidence in the model results each individual model was calibrated and validated using the most relevant available data models of the individual reservoirs were not calibrated because the reservoirs had not yet been constructed at the time of the study and planned versus as built specifications could deviate substantially the swat model parameters for the gauged stream flows along the tributaries of the mekong river except for areas around the great lake were calibrated and validated by mrcs for periods of 1985 2000 and 2001 2008 respectively for the model area around the great lake the model calibration and validation periods were 1994 2003 and 2004 2008 due to limited data available monitored flow data obtained from 84 stations were used as calibration points of which 11 stations are on mekong mainstream 64 stations on tributaries and 9 locations used as inflow to reservoirs the statistical evaluation results for model calibration and validation show that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse monthly and daily values generally range between 0 8 and 1 0 for all of the mainstream monitoring stations rossi et al 2009 for the mike basin model statistics of simulated and observed flows at all gauging stations on the mainstream of the lower mekong river for the calibration period from 1985 to 2000 showed good correspondence between the simulated and observed values with deviations generally below 10 the mekong mainstream model was calibrated for the period from 1985 to 2000 and validated against measured data from 2001 to 2008 a statistical comparison of the goodness of the calibration was conducted focusing on high and low flows at kratie generally calibration and validation for the low and high flow seasons was very good correlation coefficient of 0 97 especially for estimates of high and low flows the delta model was calibrated against measurements of flow and water levels based on available data from 21 hydrometeorological stations across the delta of cambodia and vietnam calibration results were consistently good as demonstrated by a the representative set of results presented in fig 3 the coastal and estuary model used a version of mike21 that incorporated local and regional hydrodynamic and wave model components developed and calibrated for the east and west seas by dhi singapore the coastal and estuary model was validated against water levels predicted by the fes2012 global tide model latest version of the finite element solution tide model a global hydrodynamic tide solutions model developed implemented and validated by the legos noveltis and cls within a project funded by cnes national centre for space studies france at calibration points the simulated and corresponding predicted water levels at selected calibration points showed high correlation with correlation coefficients for comparisons between mike21 simulation results and fes2012 predicted water level at positions north east of the mekong delta immediately off shore the mekong delta in the east sea and in the west sea ranging from 0 91 to 0 98 simulated water levels were also compared to those observed along the coast at qui nhon phu qui vung tau con dao stations with similar results for the wave modeling component of the coastal and estuary model simulated wave heights and directions were compared to wave heights and directions observed from the ho bach oil platform located approximately 95 km from the coast and 160 km from the mouth of co chien comparisons yielded a correlation coefficient of 0 87 the delta sediment model was calibrated against a combination of ikmp dsmp and mrc data for 2009 and validated for 2011 data the 2 years with the best data coverage from the ikmp dsmp surveys a comparison of simulated and measured silt concentrations at tan chau and chau doc for calibration year 2009 and validation year 2011 showed very good agreement between model results and measurements for silt fig 4 the calibration and validation results for clay were also very good for chau doc however for tan chau the measured levels are higher than the model results fig 5 this difference was most likely caused by high clay concentration locally at tan chau longitudinal distribution salinity profiles from the mekong ham luong and bassac rivers were used to calibrate and validate the salinity component of the delta model for the ecolab model which was used to simulate nutrients phosphorus p and nitrogen n calibration and validation was focused on achieving good calibration for the river stretch downstream of kratie and creating sound boundary conditions for the delta model calibration was conducted using mrc data for 2007 and validation for 2008 correlation coefficients for both p and n were 0 73 which taking into account the uncertainty on the p load to the river and the uncertainty introduced from the transformation of the mrc data was accepted as sufficient calibration of the model 3 5 model simulation scenarios baseline a hydrological baseline was selected by analyzing mekong river flows at kratie and flooding characteristics during hydrological years 1 the hydrological year was defined as the 12 month period from 1 december of previous calendar year to 30 november of the following calendar year for example the 2007 hydrological year was from 1 december 2006 to 31 november 2007 1 using data from 1985 to 2013 fig 6 using peak flow and duration of flow measured as total flood volume as the benchmark parameters the year 2007 was determined to be representative of average hydrological conditions in the lmb thirty existing lmb tributary hydropower schemes and all umb mainstream hydropower projects in operation by 2008 were included in the baseline the following three scenarios were simulated and the outputs were compared to 2007 baseline conditions to assess cumulative impacts these scenarios consider the mainstream dams tributary dams and other important hydropower projects planned for implementation through 2030 scenario 1 lmb mainstream hydropower development this scenario included 11 mainstream dams and the thakho water run off scheme construction had substantially progressed on two of the 11 dams don sahong and xayaburi dams in lao pdr the other nine dams were at different stages of planning and development scenario 2 lmb mainstream dams plus planned tributaries the tributaries in the lmb offer substantial hydropower potential up to 30 000 megawatts of which only approximately 10 percent hadbeen developed to date scenario 2 represented the mainstream dams operating in conjunction with 72 tributary dams planned for implementation through 2030 scenario 3 lmb mainstream dams plus planned water diversions in thailand and cambodia thailand is considering a plan to transfer approximately 290 350 cubic meters per second m3 s per month out of the lmb into the ing and kok basins to supplement existing irrigation schemes similarly in cambodia there are plans to divert approximately 12 100 m3 s of flow per month from the lmb into adjacent basins for expanding irrigation the three selected scenarios were intended to cover the full range of potential effects in order to demonstrate the maximal need to ensure sound planning design and operation of the proposed mainstream hydropower projects for all scenarios individual dams were modeled as being operated to meet peak daily demand for power hydropeaking a typical hydropeaking operating schedule would be to release water to generate electricity for 8 h e g 0900 1700 to meet high demands during the day and reduce flows for 16 h to refill the reservoir hydropeaking operational mode results in diurnal fluctuations in water releases from the dam which causes daily variations in downstream flow velocities and water levels the magnitude and frequency of these variations can impact human safety navigation and aquatic biodiversity in addition two sensitivity analyses were also conducted using selected indicators for different combinations of alternative baseline years and dam operating conditions to analyze effects of varying climatic conditions and different dam operation modes dry season drawdown simultaneous temporary drawdown at all mainstream dams occurring during peak dry conditions march for maximizing power production hydrological conditions in 1998 were selected as being representative of dry year conditions in the lmb this analysis was conducted using selected hydrology flooding and salinity indicators only wet year with high sediment transport after chinese dams became operational 2008 hydrological conditions represented a wet year with very high sediment transport due to high precipitation and sediment trapping due to the chinese dams becoming operational the year before only sediment and nutrient transport and related indicators were evaluated under this analysis finally cumulative impacts associated with four dam development alternatives alternatives were also evaluated to provide information on possible relief from impacts that could be obtained by constructing and operating only selected projects table 2 the alternatives were selected to evaluate the effects of dams under construction at the time of the analysis alternative 4 the southernmost dam alternatives 5 versus 6 and the addition of three selected dams in lao pdr alternative 7 to include the full suite of dams likely to be constructed based on existing economic and geopolitical drivers and constraints at the time of the study 3 6 change indicators cumulative changes likely to occur under each scenario and alternative were determined by comparing respective scenario model simulation outputs to baseline conditions for indicators listed in table 3 4 model simulation summary results 4 1 hydrological and hydraulic modeling the aforementioned models were used to simulate changes in water levels and flows likely to occur under the three scenarios and four alternatives as compared to baseline conditions analyses of model output data indicated that under scenario 1 during the wet season the lmb cascade could influence onset of high flows by a few days due to increase in propagation of the flood wave that is caused by increased water depths due to the presence of the dams in different parts of the river the greatest changes are predicted to occur during the dry season when daily hydropeaking operations could generate high fluctuations in water flows and water levels immediately downstream of each dam fluctuations in flow rates and water levels at kratie situated 31 km km downstream of sambor dam the last dam in the lmb cascade are approximately 16 000 m3 s and 2 m m respectively which could cause severe erosion and other adverse effects downstream of sambor dam at least to kratie although this impact continues downstream past kratie it gradually subsides the flow rate at phnom penh is approximately 2000 m3 s and fluctuations in water levels are around 0 3 m water level and flow rate fluctuations were shown to dissipate rapidly with distance downstream of phnom penh dry year dry season drawdowns and subsequent filling of the reservoirs under scenario 1 could have short term weeks high impacts on flow rates and water levels in the mekong delta fig 7 dry year indicators for water flows and water levels for lao pdr cambodia and viet nam under the three scenarios and four alternatives are presented in tables 4 6 respectively as examples of the potential magnitude of changes under scenario 2 changes in water flows and water levels during normal year and dry year dry season drawdowns are of the same order of magnitude as reported for scenario 1 under scenario 3 changes in water flows and water levels during dry year dry season drawdowns are aggravated due to the inclusion of water diversions in thailand among the four dam development alternatives alternative 6 is expected to have slightly lower impacts than scenario 1 and other alternatives 4 5 and 7 are likely to cause lower impacts than scenario 1 overall low to moderate changes are expected for an average hydrological year for example the average flow at tan chau during the dry season was predicted to differ by less than 1 5 percent under baseline conditions 5561 m3 s and during operation of all dams 5483 m3 s this is mainly because the storage capacity of the dams is relatively small compared to the actual flow of the mekong river such that they cannot be operated to store water seasonally or to create large seasonal changes in the water flow in the mekong river substantial changes to river flow regimes would occur as a result of dam hydropeaking operations and dry season drawdowns although low to moderate changes are expected for an average hydrological year substantial changes in river flow regimes would occur as a result of dam hydropeaking operations and dry season drawdowns for maximizing power production potential loss of 10 day water volume at kratie would be 60 percent and at tan chau and chau doc the potential loss is 40 percent the river segment in cambodia immediately downstream of the cascade will suffer the highest impacts from high fluctuating flows and water level amongst the three assessed scenarios and four development alternatives impacts on flow regimes under scenario 3 are the worst 4 2 changes in sediment transport changes in sediment transport and deposition in the cambodian and vietnamese floodplains under the three scenarios and four alternatives were estimated relative to baseline conditions using the sediment transport components of the mekong mainstream and delta models changes in sediment transport were characterized by changes in bed and wash load i e silt and clay transport and the consequential changes in river bank and bed erosion as well as changes to coastal erosion and accretion 4 2 1 bed load impacts sediment modeling results indicate that the mainstream reservoirs retain nearly all the bed material load causing a loss of bed material load downstream of the reservoirs in lao pdr and cambodia estimated deposition rates are 18 million tons mt year at pakbeng 5 mt year at xayabury 22 mt year at bankum and 12 mt year at sambor under all scenarios transport of bed load material downstream of sambor would decrease from about 35 mt year under baseline conditions to almost no transport of upstream bed material load following construction of dams bed scour would take place downstream of sambor and eroded material would partially replace the bed load trapped by upstream dams at tan chau and chau doc the bed material transport will be the same in scenarios 1 and 2 and alternatives 4 through 7 approximately 3 7 mt year 11 of baseline at chau doc and 9 1 mt year 26 of baseline at tan chau in scenario 3 the bed load transport would decrease to 3 6 mt year 10 of baseline at chau doc and 8 8 mt year 25 of baseline at tan chau because of the reduction of water flow due to water diversions in thailand 4 2 2 wash load impacts in a year with high sediment transport such as 2008 and in a normal year mainstream hydropower dams would cause a reduction of over 55 percent in the transport of silt and clay at kratie tan chau and chau duc table 7 under all three scenarios the change in wash load transport at kratie tan chau and chau doc under alternative 6 are similar to scenario 1 while much lower impacts are expected in alternatives 4 5 and 7 compared to scenario 1 4 2 3 changes in river bank and river bed erosion trapping of sediments in the upstream dams will cause downstream scouring of the river bed bed transport simulations for scenario 1 indicate that downstream of kratie up to 5 m deep scour could occur and the river bed degradation will progressively move approximately 50 km downstream over a 23 year period this is equivalent to a downstream propagation rate of 1 5 2 km yr in scenarios 2 and 3 as well as in alternative 6 the bed erosion depth and propagation rates are considered to be the same as in scenario 1 under alternatives 4 and 5 the bed erosion is considered to be nearly similar to the baseline meaning a small change in alternative 7 the bed transport simulations indicate that downstream of kratie up to 3 m deep scour could occur with the same downstream movement rate of 1 5 2 km yr as for scenarios 1 through 3 river bed degradation may lead to river bank failures and could cause changes in discharge distribution between river branches e g towards tonle sap 4 2 4 impacts on coastal erosion and accretion the high capture of silt which settles out in the reservoirs and low capture of clay which becomes resuspended during higher flows and washed out of the reservoirs by the cascade would result in substantial reductions in silt concentrations and silt deposition rates in the downstream floodplains and the delta a reduction in sediment loads would result in reduction of the accretion and increase of erosion at and near the river mouths with an estimated increase in the rate of erosion of 4 12 m per year m y in comparison with the present erosion rates fig 8 causing the loss of land under all three scenarios in the southwest region impacts on erosion accretion rates are less than 0 5 m y and the growth rate of the ca mau tip is expected to be reduced by approximately 1 m y under all three scenarios it should be noted that accretion and erosion rates are continuously affected not only by changes in sediment transport to the delta coastline but also by emerging sea level rise and subsidence caused by groundwater abstraction in the delta 4 3 water quality modeling water quality modeling was focused on projecting changes in nutrient transport and salinity intrusion the ecolab model was integrated into the sediment transport component of the mekong mainstream model to simulate nutrient transport changes in salinity distribution were projected using data from the salinity component of the delta model 4 3 1 changes in nutrient transport as a result of decline in sediment transport and deposition nutrient transport was also projected to show substantial decline under all three scenarios relative to baseline conditions table 8 under scenario 1 very high changes due to substantial reduction in sediment deposition rates are projected to occur in an giang kien giang and dong thap provinces in viet nam under both 2007 average year and 2008 wet year conditions fig 9 scenario 2 and 3 impacts are comparable to scenario 1 the changes to total transport of nutrients for alternative 6 are similar to those for scenario 1 while lesser changes are expected in alternatives 4 5 and 7 compared to scenario 1 4 3 2 changes in salinity intrusion changes in river water flow regimes will directly influence the extent of salinity intrusion in the mekong delta especially during dry years these changes will be exacerbated by dry season hydropeaking operations fig 10 results indicate that under scenarios 1 and 3 medium to high changes in salinity intrusion may occur short term localized very high changes on the order of weeks in salinity intrusion may occur due to dry season drawdowns conducted in dry years salinity intrusions may increase further into the delta by 12 0 and 10 0 km on the mekong and bassac branches respectively under scenario 2 there is a decrease in salinity intrusion even during dry years because inclusion of the tributary dams confers some transfer of water from the wet season to the dry season under scenario 3 diversion of water in thailand causes increased salinity intrusion in the south central part of the delta while salinity intrusion is reduced in the north east due to the diversion of water from the mekong mainstream to the south eastern part of the cambodian delta the changes in water discharges would result in medium to high changes in the salinity distribution in the vietnamese delta the impacts on salinity for both normal year and dry year of development alternatives 4 through 7 follow the pattern similar to the changes in flows to the mekong delta meaning that alternative 6 would have slightly lesser changes than scenario 1 and the other development alternatives 4 5 and 7 are likely to cause lesser impacts than scenario 1 4 4 summary results model simulation output indicates that construction and operation of the entire lmb cascade scenario 1 would cause high to very high adverse effects on some of the key sectors and environmental resources in cambodia and viet nam if the individual dam projects were to be implemented without adequate mitigations cumulative adverse effects of the planned cascade and tributary dams scenario 2 and the planned cascade and proposed water diversion schemes in thailand and cambodia scenario 3 would pose even greater impacts to the mekong delta in comparison to scenario 1 effects under all three scenarios the most severe adverse impacts are anticipated to result from a combination of the reservoir sediment trapping effects and the consequent reduction in sediment associated nutrient loading sediment deposition in the delta would decrease as much as 65 percent at kratie and tan chau chau doc and by smaller amounts off the mainstream potentially causing a substantial increase in erosion and a decrease in the rate of buildup of riparian and coastal sites scenario 2 poses the most severe impacts on sedimentation and nutrients in comparison to the other scenarios and development alternatives note that only preliminarily analyses of the risk of bank erosion deposition was possible under this study a detailed analysis of bank erosion deposition should be conducted in the future salinity intrusion would be expected to increase in the delta under scenarios 1 and 3 with the potential for short term high impacts particularly in the southern and central portions of the vietnamese delta when dry years are combined with dry season drawdowns 5 discussion the results of this analysis are similar to results of past studies e g icem 2010 mrc 2011 and provide detailed insights into how dam operations could affect resources in the mekong river floodplains and delta for example icem 2010 predicted that the supply of fine sediments and nutrient in the region would be halved this study concludes that there would be complete retention of bed load material by mainstream dams erosion within the downstream floodplain and delta to replace that load and a 57 decrease in wash load downstream of all planned dams model simulation results were generally consistent with findings from similar modeling efforts for other large river basins in the world such as the nile river basin block 2007 melesse 2011 indus river basin khan et al 2000 and the ganges basin world bank 2014 the actual changes in hydrology sediment and nutrient transport and salinity intrusion may well be greater than projected because of the cumulative effects of other natural phenomena climate change sea level rise on going developments in the lmb urbanization deforestation sand mining etc and the uncertainty related to how the natural systems associated with the river system will respond to the major disruption in the lmb system while climate change was not included in the modeling efforts for this study the anticipated impacts of climate change have been addressed in other studies according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 deltas particularly so called mega deltas are vulnerable to climate change due to increased susceptibility to floods sea level rise saltwater intrusion and storm surges vietnam s ministry of natural resources and environment monre released a climate change and sea level rise report monre 2009 revised 2011 predicting higher rainfall in the wet season and lower rainfall in the dry season for the vietnamese mekong delta ifad 2013 predicted similar changes in rainfall for cambodia but also projected an increase of up to 14 in the proportion of total annual rainfall that falls in heavy rainfall events as well as increases in maximum one and five day rainfalls an analysis conducted by siwrp 2011 based on climate change studies by mrc 2009 and hoanh et al 2010 predicted mekong river flow increases for both the high flow and low flow seasons due to climate change however those increases were not sufficient to offset the decreases predicted due to upstream development hydropower and irrigation while the combination of these reports suggests the potential for a renewal of sediments in the downstream portions of the mekong river that remediation of sediment trapping by upstream dams would come at the cost of productive lands downstream in cambodia and vietnam as they erode into the river due to increased flows and heavy rainfall events in monre s 2009 monre 2011 analysis sea level rise was reported to vary along the vietnamese coast but average 75 cm under the medium emissions b2 scenario by the end of the 21st century sea level rise as a consequence of climate change could be anticipated to exacerbate salinity intrusion into the mekong delta particularly during the dry season this study has created a suite of customized and validated lmb specific water resources modeling tools and established a scientific basis for further use by the four lmb countries thailand lao pdr cambodia and viet nam for guiding hydropower development on the mekong river including consideration of siting scale and design of proposed mainstem hydropower projects to avoid or minimize significant changes downstream evaluation of mitigation measures such as sediment flushing sluicing and consideration of other development activities the study assessed overall collective impacts of the entire cascade taken together and collective effects of various subsets of those projects evaluation of potential impacts of individual mainstream hydropower projects was beyond the scope of this study as the focus was on basin wide impacts acknowledgments the mekong delta study was conducted by a joint team of modeling and environmental impact assessment specialists from dhi of vietnam and denmark and hdr of usa with valuable support from a large contingent of vietnamese experts the study was completed under the supervision of and with substantial technical assistance from the viet nam mekong committee funding this study was funded by the government of viet nam with

5933,approach methods and results from a comprehensive integrated water resources modeling framework for the lower mekong basin lmb are presented in this paper the modeling suite was specifically tailored to the known conditions and data availability at key locations within the lmb and more particularly within the floodplains of cambodia and the mekong river delta of vietnam model simulation output was used to project cumulative changes to hydraulic sediment and water quality parameters likely to occur in this relatively unique system under multiple scenarios of hydropower development in the lmb while substantial changes in river flow regimes are predicted as a result of hydropeaking operations especially when combined with dry season drawdowns to maximize power production the multiple scenario analysis indicated that overall the largest changes are expected to be in loss of sediment and nutrient transport and reduction of water quality due to increased salinity intrusion into areas of the mekong delta keywords mekong vietnam hydropower modeling nutrient transport 1 introduction and background twelve hydropower projects 11 dams and 1 large water diversion project have been proposed for the mekong river mainstream in lao pdr and cambodia to increase power generation capacity fig 1 construction and operation of any or all of these projects could have substantial environmental and socio economic effects in all four lower mekong basin lmb countries in particular the downstream floodplains of cambodia and viet nam along with the mekong river delta could experience the greatest impacts as a first step in evaluating the potential effects of hydropower development on these countries an integrated modeling framework was developed to provide best available data on cumulative changes to hydrological sediment and water quality parameters due to multiple scenarios of hydropower development several prior studies have reported on potential effects of tributary and mainstream hydropower development in the lmb including the strategic environmental assessment sea of hydropower on the mekong mainstream icem 2010 and the lower mekong basin development plan 2 bdp2 mrc 2011 another recent relevant report is a working paper on economic environmental and social impacts of hydropower development in the lmb intralawan et al 2015 which updates prior analyses reported by costanza et al 2011 the sea took a higher level strategic perspective that was focused on providing policy options for mainstream hydropower development and it provided input to the mekong river commission s mrc procedures for notification prior consultation and agreement process the bdp2 evaluated costs and benefits of different basin wide hydropower development scenarios across all four countries including full mainstream 11 proposed dams and tributary development 30 planned tributary dams through 2030 these studies also evaluated the cumulative effects of mainstream hydropower development on people and resources throughout the lmb including the mekong delta the sea and other prior studies concluded that while collectively the proposed lmb dams would produce almost 15 000 megawatts of power and boost regional energy production by almost 25 development of mainstream hydropower projects would have significant effects on the movement of water and sediment in the lmb including changes to the timing and magnitude of seasonal flows additional studies such as those by wild and loucks 2015 and mrc 2016 show that projected impacts to sediment transport and seasonal flows could potentially be exacerbated by developments on tributaries to the mekong these cumulative impacts could devastate fisheries and riverside gardens which in turn would affect food security of a large majority of the 60 million people that inhabit the lmb and rely upon river resources for much of their food supply a world wildlife fund study wwf 2013 reported that downstream sediment loads which have already been impacted by existing dams and sand mining could be reduced further by the proposed lmb dams causing further loss of agricultural lands in the delta lands which are already impacted by subsidence due to groundwater abstraction changes in river flood pulses could also lead to increased salt water intrusion which could become more severe with the changing climate and rapid land development in the delta the studies also identified substantial data uncertainty and limitations to the assessment process such as uncertainty about future development scenarios social data and the response of fisheries to changes in aquatic systems the models and data used to characterize hydropower development impacts by prior studies for the entire lmb have substantial limitations for the evaluation of impacts in the mekong river floodplains and the mekong delta this is because the environment in the delta differs considerably from the rest of the lmb in many ways for example river flows in the vietnamese portions of the mekong delta are highly controlled by a series of canals dikes and related infrastructures these water management structures must be accounted for in delta specific analyses and hydrological models models of the mekong delta in particular must also consider tidal fluctuations salinity intrusion and other influences of the marine and coastal environment in addition the delta differs from the rest of the lmb because it is highly developed more urbanized and densely populated and land use is dominated by extensive agricultural production also much of the available historical data is not most suitable for environmental impact analyses other studies have evaluated impacts associated with individual tributary dams in the lmb hecht and lacombe 2014 lacombe et al 2014 piman et al 2012 reis et al 2014 and warren 1999 the results from analyses of smaller tributary dams cannot be extrapolated to the entire basin therefore the government of viet nam in close cooperation with the governments of lao pdr and cambodia conducted an independent assessment to study the overall impact of the proposed lmb mainstream hydropower cascade on the natural social and economic systems of cambodian and vietnamese floodplains the primary objectives of this study were to evaluate changes projected to occur in the hydrological processes of the lmb resulting from construction and operation of the proposed mainstream hydropower cascade and assess how these changes could potentially impact the human and natural environment in the cambodian and vietnamese floodplains this objective supports the overall goal of safeguarding the mekong delta and its resources economies and natural systems and ensuring the continued well being of communities and their livelihoods in the delta region through informed and scientifically supported decision making on the use and exploitation of the river s water and related resources the study was completed in a phased manner and during each phase robust consultation workshops were organized at the national and regional levels to describe progress and results and seek consensus from key stakeholders in member countries non governmental organizations and residents in lao pdr cambodia and viet nam the approach methods and results from a comprehensive integrated water resources modeling framework for the lower mekong basin lmb are presented in this paper 2 the lower mekong basin the mekong river originates in tibet and flows for almost 4800 km km through china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and viet nam before discharging to the east sea the river drainage basin covers approximately 795 000 square kilometers km2 and it can be broadly divided into an upper mekong basin umb and a lower mekong basin lmb the umb includes riparian areas in china and myanmar whereas the lmb encompasses territories of lao pdr thailand cambodia and viet nam the basin includes the tonle sap river great lake gl system which is a defining feature of the cambodian floodplains the 130 km long tonle sap river connects the gl with the mekong river and it is characterized by low channel slope and an extensive floodplain the low channel slope and the high variation of flow in the mekong river induce a seasonal change in the direction of flow in the river the reversal of flow produces two distinct seasons based on the direction of the flow during the dry season water flows out of the lake towards the mekong river and it remains confined to the low slope channel during the wet season the flow reverses direction and inundates a vast floodplain area the great lake is the largest wetland in southeast asia kummu et al 2008 and the catchment of the lake basin covers an area of around 67 000 km2 during the dry season the lake covers approximately 2500 3000 km2 during peak flood events this area expands up to five times to almost 15 000 km2 kummu et al 2008 the lmb is currently undergoing rapid development twenty six hydropower projects of 10 megawatts are under construction on various tributaries future country basin development plans also include proposals to increase dry season irrigation by 50 percent from 1 2 to 1 8 million hectares major irrigation expansion projects are currently being evaluated in all riparian countries the lmb countries also plan to further develop aquaculture and improve fisheries management navigation flood and drought management and tourism development 2 1 the proposed lmb hydropower cascade locations and preliminary design specifications of existing and proposed dam projects are shown in table 1 in general the storage capacity of these dams is relatively small compared to the actual flow of the mekong river with a mean annual flow of approximately 460 km3 on average the reservoirs can only store the average flow in the mekong for 1 2 days consequently those dams cannot be operated to store water seasonally or to create large seasonal changes in the water flow in the mekong river 3 the cumulative change assessment modeling setup 3 1 impact drivers the four physical characteristics of the river system that would primarily be changed due to the construction and operation of the cascade namely hydrology sediment water quality and connectivity dams acting as physical barriers were included in the integrated model setup since hydropower dams are designed to store and manage water releases they influence key hydrological characteristics of the river system the lmb cascade change assessment hydrological modeling was focused on simulating and quantifying changes in downstream flows water levels water volume and extent and timing of inundation hydropower dams reduce sediment flow by physically blocking trapping the movement of riverbed material and increase the settling rate of suspended particles a decrease in sediment transport directly leads to a reduction in deposition of sediment onto downstream floodplains which in turn decreases soil buildup to quantify changes in sediment transport and deposition likely to be caused by the proposed lmb cascade changes in sediment concentrations sediment deposition rates riverbank erosion and deposition rates and coastal erosion and deposition rates were modeled and evaluated a decrease in sediment transport would also cause a reduction in the transport and deposition of nutrients attached to the sediment the floodplains of the mekong river receive large annual influxes of nutrients during floods which influences agricultural production and the primary productivity of all downstream biological systems also by reducing freshwater river flows and volumes the proposed dams could increase salinity intrusion in coastal areas resulting in changes in salinity concentrations that could impact agricultural production and availability of fresh water during the dry season in parts of the vietnamese delta water quality modeling was included in the model setup to quantify changes in nutrient transport and deposition and changes in salinity concentrations and intrusion 3 2 the modeling framework a customized and integrated modeling framework fig 2 consisting of the following models was set up and calibrated as appropriate a mekong mainstream model a one dimensional hydrodynamic river model mike11

loads and or concentrations providing the necessary boundary conditions for the models d the hydrological swat soil and water assessment tool models previously developed calibrated and validated by rossi et al 2009 for the lmb were used to provide inflows to mike hydrobasin hereafter simply mike basin describing the flow in the river networks in the catchments of the lmb e mike basin receiving run off from the swat models to simulate the regulation and water use in the main tributaries and delivering the outflows from the catchments to the mekong mainstream model taking into consideration water demands and reservoirs in the catchments f reservoir models detailed two dimensional hydrodynamic and morphological models established in the mike 21c software package of the proposed mainstream reservoirs and of the dams these models simulate the sedimentation and operations of the reservoirs these models intersect the mekong mainstream model model a in fig 2 from where they receive their upstream boundary conditions likewise they export their simulated reservoir impacts back to the mekong mainstream model downstream the reservoir models were used to study in detail mitigation measures such as sediment flushing etc a combined two dimensional hydraulic and sediment model for the great lake tonle sap region is also included g delta model the detailed quasi two dimensional flood cell model of the rivers and canals in the mekong delta this is a mike 11 model of the complex river and canal network and the flood cells in the delta this model simulates the impacts on the delta from the changed flow and sediment regimes received from the mekong mainstream model the delta model simulates salinity and nutrients in the rivers along with the flooding pattern sediment concentrations and nutrient contribution to the flood cells flood plain sedimentation in the various parts of the delta h coastal and estuary model mike 21 is used to assess the impact on the sediment transport and deposition patterns affecting the morphological developments in the lower part of the delta including the coastline as a consequence of the simulated changes in river inflows and sediment concentrations i the ecolab model was set up to simulate the nutrients such as phosphorus p and nitrogen n the ecolab model was combined with the mekong mainstream model and its sediment transport components the results from these models are used to assess the impacts on nutrient transport and nutrient deposition in the floodplains of the delta the models pass results in the form of time series of water levels discharge flow velocities and sediment concentrations to calculations of indicators used to link the differences in the results of the river models to the consequent impacts on biodiversity livelihood and agriculture 3 3 model simulation input data input data on precipitation evaporation water levels discharges salinity and nutrients for hydrology and hydraulics model setups were obtained from multiple sources including the mrc database input data for both sediment models and nutrient and salinity modeling were sourced from the mrc s information and knowledge management programme discharge and sediment measuring program ikmp dsmp and mrc water quality monitoring programs mrc wq site specific sediment and nutrient quality data were also collected in 2014 as part of the study reported here the modeling had to rely upon less reliable data from digital elevation models of the deltaic floodplains especially in cambodia and information on operation of the chinese reservoirs was also not readily available detailed topographic information of the areas to be inundated by the proposed lmb hydropower schemes was only available for xayaburi and luang prabang projects while data for some aspects of the study such as sediments were limited relative to their importance in the overall basin system this is a common occurrence in large systems such as the lmb wild and loucks 2015 acknowledged similar constraints particularly relative to rates of sediment production trapping and transport for the mekong basin the mrc has subsequently conducted modeling and assessment of cumulative sediment trapping in the tributaries as well as mainstream of the mekong as part of the council study under mrc however those data were not developed or available at the time of this study the modeling input dataset used for the study reported here represented the most updated compilation of relevant hydro meteorological sediment and water quality data available in 2014 3 4 model calibration to ensure confidence in the model results each individual model was calibrated and validated using the most relevant available data models of the individual reservoirs were not calibrated because the reservoirs had not yet been constructed at the time of the study and planned versus as built specifications could deviate substantially the swat model parameters for the gauged stream flows along the tributaries of the mekong river except for areas around the great lake were calibrated and validated by mrcs for periods of 1985 2000 and 2001 2008 respectively for the model area around the great lake the model calibration and validation periods were 1994 2003 and 2004 2008 due to limited data available monitored flow data obtained from 84 stations were used as calibration points of which 11 stations are on mekong mainstream 64 stations on tributaries and 9 locations used as inflow to reservoirs the statistical evaluation results for model calibration and validation show that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse monthly and daily values generally range between 0 8 and 1 0 for all of the mainstream monitoring stations rossi et al 2009 for the mike basin model statistics of simulated and observed flows at all gauging stations on the mainstream of the lower mekong river for the calibration period from 1985 to 2000 showed good correspondence between the simulated and observed values with deviations generally below 10 the mekong mainstream model was calibrated for the period from 1985 to 2000 and validated against measured data from 2001 to 2008 a statistical comparison of the goodness of the calibration was conducted focusing on high and low flows at kratie generally calibration and validation for the low and high flow seasons was very good correlation coefficient of 0 97 especially for estimates of high and low flows the delta model was calibrated against measurements of flow and water levels based on available data from 21 hydrometeorological stations across the delta of cambodia and vietnam calibration results were consistently good as demonstrated by a the representative set of results presented in fig 3 the coastal and estuary model used a version of mike21 that incorporated local and regional hydrodynamic and wave model components developed and calibrated for the east and west seas by dhi singapore the coastal and estuary model was validated against water levels predicted by the fes2012 global tide model latest version of the finite element solution tide model a global hydrodynamic tide solutions model developed implemented and validated by the legos noveltis and cls within a project funded by cnes national centre for space studies france at calibration points the simulated and corresponding predicted water levels at selected calibration points showed high correlation with correlation coefficients for comparisons between mike21 simulation results and fes2012 predicted water level at positions north east of the mekong delta immediately off shore the mekong delta in the east sea and in the west sea ranging from 0 91 to 0 98 simulated water levels were also compared to those observed along the coast at qui nhon phu qui vung tau con dao stations with similar results for the wave modeling component of the coastal and estuary model simulated wave heights and directions were compared to wave heights and directions observed from the ho bach oil platform located approximately 95 km from the coast and 160 km from the mouth of co chien comparisons yielded a correlation coefficient of 0 87 the delta sediment model was calibrated against a combination of ikmp dsmp and mrc data for 2009 and validated for 2011 data the 2 years with the best data coverage from the ikmp dsmp surveys a comparison of simulated and measured silt concentrations at tan chau and chau doc for calibration year 2009 and validation year 2011 showed very good agreement between model results and measurements for silt fig 4 the calibration and validation results for clay were also very good for chau doc however for tan chau the measured levels are higher than the model results fig 5 this difference was most likely caused by high clay concentration locally at tan chau longitudinal distribution salinity profiles from the mekong ham luong and bassac rivers were used to calibrate and validate the salinity component of the delta model for the ecolab model which was used to simulate nutrients phosphorus p and nitrogen n calibration and validation was focused on achieving good calibration for the river stretch downstream of kratie and creating sound boundary conditions for the delta model calibration was conducted using mrc data for 2007 and validation for 2008 correlation coefficients for both p and n were 0 73 which taking into account the uncertainty on the p load to the river and the uncertainty introduced from the transformation of the mrc data was accepted as sufficient calibration of the model 3 5 model simulation scenarios baseline a hydrological baseline was selected by analyzing mekong river flows at kratie and flooding characteristics during hydrological years 1 the hydrological year was defined as the 12 month period from 1 december of previous calendar year to 30 november of the following calendar year for example the 2007 hydrological year was from 1 december 2006 to 31 november 2007 1 using data from 1985 to 2013 fig 6 using peak flow and duration of flow measured as total flood volume as the benchmark parameters the year 2007 was determined to be representative of average hydrological conditions in the lmb thirty existing lmb tributary hydropower schemes and all umb mainstream hydropower projects in operation by 2008 were included in the baseline the following three scenarios were simulated and the outputs were compared to 2007 baseline conditions to assess cumulative impacts these scenarios consider the mainstream dams tributary dams and other important hydropower projects planned for implementation through 2030 scenario 1 lmb mainstream hydropower development this scenario included 11 mainstream dams and the thakho water run off scheme construction had substantially progressed on two of the 11 dams don sahong and xayaburi dams in lao pdr the other nine dams were at different stages of planning and development scenario 2 lmb mainstream dams plus planned tributaries the tributaries in the lmb offer substantial hydropower potential up to 30 000 megawatts of which only approximately 10 percent hadbeen developed to date scenario 2 represented the mainstream dams operating in conjunction with 72 tributary dams planned for implementation through 2030 scenario 3 lmb mainstream dams plus planned water diversions in thailand and cambodia thailand is considering a plan to transfer approximately 290 350 cubic meters per second m3 s per month out of the lmb into the ing and kok basins to supplement existing irrigation schemes similarly in cambodia there are plans to divert approximately 12 100 m3 s of flow per month from the lmb into adjacent basins for expanding irrigation the three selected scenarios were intended to cover the full range of potential effects in order to demonstrate the maximal need to ensure sound planning design and operation of the proposed mainstream hydropower projects for all scenarios individual dams were modeled as being operated to meet peak daily demand for power hydropeaking a typical hydropeaking operating schedule would be to release water to generate electricity for 8 h e g 0900 1700 to meet high demands during the day and reduce flows for 16 h to refill the reservoir hydropeaking operational mode results in diurnal fluctuations in water releases from the dam which causes daily variations in downstream flow velocities and water levels the magnitude and frequency of these variations can impact human safety navigation and aquatic biodiversity in addition two sensitivity analyses were also conducted using selected indicators for different combinations of alternative baseline years and dam operating conditions to analyze effects of varying climatic conditions and different dam operation modes dry season drawdown simultaneous temporary drawdown at all mainstream dams occurring during peak dry conditions march for maximizing power production hydrological conditions in 1998 were selected as being representative of dry year conditions in the lmb this analysis was conducted using selected hydrology flooding and salinity indicators only wet year with high sediment transport after chinese dams became operational 2008 hydrological conditions represented a wet year with very high sediment transport due to high precipitation and sediment trapping due to the chinese dams becoming operational the year before only sediment and nutrient transport and related indicators were evaluated under this analysis finally cumulative impacts associated with four dam development alternatives alternatives were also evaluated to provide information on possible relief from impacts that could be obtained by constructing and operating only selected projects table 2 the alternatives were selected to evaluate the effects of dams under construction at the time of the analysis alternative 4 the southernmost dam alternatives 5 versus 6 and the addition of three selected dams in lao pdr alternative 7 to include the full suite of dams likely to be constructed based on existing economic and geopolitical drivers and constraints at the time of the study 3 6 change indicators cumulative changes likely to occur under each scenario and alternative were determined by comparing respective scenario model simulation outputs to baseline conditions for indicators listed in table 3 4 model simulation summary results 4 1 hydrological and hydraulic modeling the aforementioned models were used to simulate changes in water levels and flows likely to occur under the three scenarios and four alternatives as compared to baseline conditions analyses of model output data indicated that under scenario 1 during the wet season the lmb cascade could influence onset of high flows by a few days due to increase in propagation of the flood wave that is caused by increased water depths due to the presence of the dams in different parts of the river the greatest changes are predicted to occur during the dry season when daily hydropeaking operations could generate high fluctuations in water flows and water levels immediately downstream of each dam fluctuations in flow rates and water levels at kratie situated 31 km km downstream of sambor dam the last dam in the lmb cascade are approximately 16 000 m3 s and 2 m m respectively which could cause severe erosion and other adverse effects downstream of sambor dam at least to kratie although this impact continues downstream past kratie it gradually subsides the flow rate at phnom penh is approximately 2000 m3 s and fluctuations in water levels are around 0 3 m water level and flow rate fluctuations were shown to dissipate rapidly with distance downstream of phnom penh dry year dry season drawdowns and subsequent filling of the reservoirs under scenario 1 could have short term weeks high impacts on flow rates and water levels in the mekong delta fig 7 dry year indicators for water flows and water levels for lao pdr cambodia and viet nam under the three scenarios and four alternatives are presented in tables 4 6 respectively as examples of the potential magnitude of changes under scenario 2 changes in water flows and water levels during normal year and dry year dry season drawdowns are of the same order of magnitude as reported for scenario 1 under scenario 3 changes in water flows and water levels during dry year dry season drawdowns are aggravated due to the inclusion of water diversions in thailand among the four dam development alternatives alternative 6 is expected to have slightly lower impacts than scenario 1 and other alternatives 4 5 and 7 are likely to cause lower impacts than scenario 1 overall low to moderate changes are expected for an average hydrological year for example the average flow at tan chau during the dry season was predicted to differ by less than 1 5 percent under baseline conditions 5561 m3 s and during operation of all dams 5483 m3 s this is mainly because the storage capacity of the dams is relatively small compared to the actual flow of the mekong river such that they cannot be operated to store water seasonally or to create large seasonal changes in the water flow in the mekong river substantial changes to river flow regimes would occur as a result of dam hydropeaking operations and dry season drawdowns although low to moderate changes are expected for an average hydrological year substantial changes in river flow regimes would occur as a result of dam hydropeaking operations and dry season drawdowns for maximizing power production potential loss of 10 day water volume at kratie would be 60 percent and at tan chau and chau doc the potential loss is 40 percent the river segment in cambodia immediately downstream of the cascade will suffer the highest impacts from high fluctuating flows and water level amongst the three assessed scenarios and four development alternatives impacts on flow regimes under scenario 3 are the worst 4 2 changes in sediment transport changes in sediment transport and deposition in the cambodian and vietnamese floodplains under the three scenarios and four alternatives were estimated relative to baseline conditions using the sediment transport components of the mekong mainstream and delta models changes in sediment transport were characterized by changes in bed and wash load i e silt and clay transport and the consequential changes in river bank and bed erosion as well as changes to coastal erosion and accretion 4 2 1 bed load impacts sediment modeling results indicate that the mainstream reservoirs retain nearly all the bed material load causing a loss of bed material load downstream of the reservoirs in lao pdr and cambodia estimated deposition rates are 18 million tons mt year at pakbeng 5 mt year at xayabury 22 mt year at bankum and 12 mt year at sambor under all scenarios transport of bed load material downstream of sambor would decrease from about 35 mt year under baseline conditions to almost no transport of upstream bed material load following construction of dams bed scour would take place downstream of sambor and eroded material would partially replace the bed load trapped by upstream dams at tan chau and chau doc the bed material transport will be the same in scenarios 1 and 2 and alternatives 4 through 7 approximately 3 7 mt year 11 of baseline at chau doc and 9 1 mt year 26 of baseline at tan chau in scenario 3 the bed load transport would decrease to 3 6 mt year 10 of baseline at chau doc and 8 8 mt year 25 of baseline at tan chau because of the reduction of water flow due to water diversions in thailand 4 2 2 wash load impacts in a year with high sediment transport such as 2008 and in a normal year mainstream hydropower dams would cause a reduction of over 55 percent in the transport of silt and clay at kratie tan chau and chau duc table 7 under all three scenarios the change in wash load transport at kratie tan chau and chau doc under alternative 6 are similar to scenario 1 while much lower impacts are expected in alternatives 4 5 and 7 compared to scenario 1 4 2 3 changes in river bank and river bed erosion trapping of sediments in the upstream dams will cause downstream scouring of the river bed bed transport simulations for scenario 1 indicate that downstream of kratie up to 5 m deep scour could occur and the river bed degradation will progressively move approximately 50 km downstream over a 23 year period this is equivalent to a downstream propagation rate of 1 5 2 km yr in scenarios 2 and 3 as well as in alternative 6 the bed erosion depth and propagation rates are considered to be the same as in scenario 1 under alternatives 4 and 5 the bed erosion is considered to be nearly similar to the baseline meaning a small change in alternative 7 the bed transport simulations indicate that downstream of kratie up to 3 m deep scour could occur with the same downstream movement rate of 1 5 2 km yr as for scenarios 1 through 3 river bed degradation may lead to river bank failures and could cause changes in discharge distribution between river branches e g towards tonle sap 4 2 4 impacts on coastal erosion and accretion the high capture of silt which settles out in the reservoirs and low capture of clay which becomes resuspended during higher flows and washed out of the reservoirs by the cascade would result in substantial reductions in silt concentrations and silt deposition rates in the downstream floodplains and the delta a reduction in sediment loads would result in reduction of the accretion and increase of erosion at and near the river mouths with an estimated increase in the rate of erosion of 4 12 m per year m y in comparison with the present erosion rates fig 8 causing the loss of land under all three scenarios in the southwest region impacts on erosion accretion rates are less than 0 5 m y and the growth rate of the ca mau tip is expected to be reduced by approximately 1 m y under all three scenarios it should be noted that accretion and erosion rates are continuously affected not only by changes in sediment transport to the delta coastline but also by emerging sea level rise and subsidence caused by groundwater abstraction in the delta 4 3 water quality modeling water quality modeling was focused on projecting changes in nutrient transport and salinity intrusion the ecolab model was integrated into the sediment transport component of the mekong mainstream model to simulate nutrient transport changes in salinity distribution were projected using data from the salinity component of the delta model 4 3 1 changes in nutrient transport as a result of decline in sediment transport and deposition nutrient transport was also projected to show substantial decline under all three scenarios relative to baseline conditions table 8 under scenario 1 very high changes due to substantial reduction in sediment deposition rates are projected to occur in an giang kien giang and dong thap provinces in viet nam under both 2007 average year and 2008 wet year conditions fig 9 scenario 2 and 3 impacts are comparable to scenario 1 the changes to total transport of nutrients for alternative 6 are similar to those for scenario 1 while lesser changes are expected in alternatives 4 5 and 7 compared to scenario 1 4 3 2 changes in salinity intrusion changes in river water flow regimes will directly influence the extent of salinity intrusion in the mekong delta especially during dry years these changes will be exacerbated by dry season hydropeaking operations fig 10 results indicate that under scenarios 1 and 3 medium to high changes in salinity intrusion may occur short term localized very high changes on the order of weeks in salinity intrusion may occur due to dry season drawdowns conducted in dry years salinity intrusions may increase further into the delta by 12 0 and 10 0 km on the mekong and bassac branches respectively under scenario 2 there is a decrease in salinity intrusion even during dry years because inclusion of the tributary dams confers some transfer of water from the wet season to the dry season under scenario 3 diversion of water in thailand causes increased salinity intrusion in the south central part of the delta while salinity intrusion is reduced in the north east due to the diversion of water from the mekong mainstream to the south eastern part of the cambodian delta the changes in water discharges would result in medium to high changes in the salinity distribution in the vietnamese delta the impacts on salinity for both normal year and dry year of development alternatives 4 through 7 follow the pattern similar to the changes in flows to the mekong delta meaning that alternative 6 would have slightly lesser changes than scenario 1 and the other development alternatives 4 5 and 7 are likely to cause lesser impacts than scenario 1 4 4 summary results model simulation output indicates that construction and operation of the entire lmb cascade scenario 1 would cause high to very high adverse effects on some of the key sectors and environmental resources in cambodia and viet nam if the individual dam projects were to be implemented without adequate mitigations cumulative adverse effects of the planned cascade and tributary dams scenario 2 and the planned cascade and proposed water diversion schemes in thailand and cambodia scenario 3 would pose even greater impacts to the mekong delta in comparison to scenario 1 effects under all three scenarios the most severe adverse impacts are anticipated to result from a combination of the reservoir sediment trapping effects and the consequent reduction in sediment associated nutrient loading sediment deposition in the delta would decrease as much as 65 percent at kratie and tan chau chau doc and by smaller amounts off the mainstream potentially causing a substantial increase in erosion and a decrease in the rate of buildup of riparian and coastal sites scenario 2 poses the most severe impacts on sedimentation and nutrients in comparison to the other scenarios and development alternatives note that only preliminarily analyses of the risk of bank erosion deposition was possible under this study a detailed analysis of bank erosion deposition should be conducted in the future salinity intrusion would be expected to increase in the delta under scenarios 1 and 3 with the potential for short term high impacts particularly in the southern and central portions of the vietnamese delta when dry years are combined with dry season drawdowns 5 discussion the results of this analysis are similar to results of past studies e g icem 2010 mrc 2011 and provide detailed insights into how dam operations could affect resources in the mekong river floodplains and delta for example icem 2010 predicted that the supply of fine sediments and nutrient in the region would be halved this study concludes that there would be complete retention of bed load material by mainstream dams erosion within the downstream floodplain and delta to replace that load and a 57 decrease in wash load downstream of all planned dams model simulation results were generally consistent with findings from similar modeling efforts for other large river basins in the world such as the nile river basin block 2007 melesse 2011 indus river basin khan et al 2000 and the ganges basin world bank 2014 the actual changes in hydrology sediment and nutrient transport and salinity intrusion may well be greater than projected because of the cumulative effects of other natural phenomena climate change sea level rise on going developments in the lmb urbanization deforestation sand mining etc and the uncertainty related to how the natural systems associated with the river system will respond to the major disruption in the lmb system while climate change was not included in the modeling efforts for this study the anticipated impacts of climate change have been addressed in other studies according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 deltas particularly so called mega deltas are vulnerable to climate change due to increased susceptibility to floods sea level rise saltwater intrusion and storm surges vietnam s ministry of natural resources and environment monre released a climate change and sea level rise report monre 2009 revised 2011 predicting higher rainfall in the wet season and lower rainfall in the dry season for the vietnamese mekong delta ifad 2013 predicted similar changes in rainfall for cambodia but also projected an increase of up to 14 in the proportion of total annual rainfall that falls in heavy rainfall events as well as increases in maximum one and five day rainfalls an analysis conducted by siwrp 2011 based on climate change studies by mrc 2009 and hoanh et al 2010 predicted mekong river flow increases for both the high flow and low flow seasons due to climate change however those increases were not sufficient to offset the decreases predicted due to upstream development hydropower and irrigation while the combination of these reports suggests the potential for a renewal of sediments in the downstream portions of the mekong river that remediation of sediment trapping by upstream dams would come at the cost of productive lands downstream in cambodia and vietnam as they erode into the river due to increased flows and heavy rainfall events in monre s 2009 monre 2011 analysis sea level rise was reported to vary along the vietnamese coast but average 75 cm under the medium emissions b2 scenario by the end of the 21st century sea level rise as a consequence of climate change could be anticipated to exacerbate salinity intrusion into the mekong delta particularly during the dry season this study has created a suite of customized and validated lmb specific water resources modeling tools and established a scientific basis for further use by the four lmb countries thailand lao pdr cambodia and viet nam for guiding hydropower development on the mekong river including consideration of siting scale and design of proposed mainstem hydropower projects to avoid or minimize significant changes downstream evaluation of mitigation measures such as sediment flushing sluicing and consideration of other development activities the study assessed overall collective impacts of the entire cascade taken together and collective effects of various subsets of those projects evaluation of potential impacts of individual mainstream hydropower projects was beyond the scope of this study as the focus was on basin wide impacts acknowledgments the mekong delta study was conducted by a joint team of modeling and environmental impact assessment specialists from dhi of vietnam and denmark and hdr of usa with valuable support from a large contingent of vietnamese experts the study was completed under the supervision of and with substantial technical assistance from the viet nam mekong committee funding this study was funded by the government of viet nam with

5934,transformation plays a significant role in solving hydrological problems in response to the comment on singh and das 2015 by deng et al 2015 regarding the transformation boundary conditions and subsequent analytical solution of advection dispersion equation in semi infinite heterogeneous porous media it is argued that the transformation used by singh and das 2015 for finding the analytical solution is correct and mathematically valid also the different expression of f mt used to obtain the solution are explained with their physical relevance in the field keywords mathematical transformation boundary conditions 1 introduction deng et al 2015 described that the transformation used to obtain analytical solution by singh and das 2015 was wrong in response we describe and explain the procedure to obtain the analytical solution using the novel transformation singh and das 2015 used the chain rule of differentiation as deng et al 2015 has claimed however under the specific assumption considered by singh and das 2015 i e the ratio of f 1 mt f mt 1 d 0 u 0 f mt f mt in eq 12 singh and das 2015 was treated as constant due to small values of d 0 u 0 m and for small values of t i e at most 10 years so in the case of chain rule of differentiation singh and das 2015 assumed that the differential of z with respect to time is zero singh and das 2015 used the bounded range of time and into that range the function f mt is bounded and uniformly continuous since function is bounded and uniformly continuous and therefore maximum and minimum values of function exist on that interval due to presence of maximum and minimum value of the function transformation is valid and meaningful the mathematical proof of aforesaid statement is as follows the function f mt is said to be bounded function if there exist a real number r in such a way that f mt r where t n 1 n 10 since function f mt is bounded then f mt is uniformly continuous that is 0 there exist δ 0 such that t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 δ f mt 1 f mt 2 so the maximum and minimum values of function exist let p min 1 k n f mt k and q max 1 k n f mt k then t r we can find t ϕ where 1 ϕ n such that t b t ϕ δ for value of t k so t t k δ and that f mt f mt k for δ 0 now f mt k p and therefore f mt p similarly f mt k q and therefore f mt q thus t r f mt p q for example we can state that in the himalayan region the velocity pattern of groundwater follows the exponentially decreasing nature so in due course of time i e after some years velocity of the groundwater becomes zero but that is not happening in the reality and therefore there must exists upper and lower bounds for f mt as well as velocity we can obtain similar result for exponentially increasing velocity pattern also so it is possible to use the maximum or minimum value during the transformation procedure the direct use of maximum or minimum value of f mt can lead us to the situation z t 0 so the uses of maximum and minimum value support singh and das 2015 and the transformation mentioned in it was mathematically valid and physically correct basically deng et al 2015 completely misunderstood the transformation and underlying mathematics in singh and das 2015 hence deng et al 2015 claim is invalid in this context in case of boundary conditions singh and das 2015 considered as 1 t 1 m e mt 1 forf mt exp mt 2 then mt log 1 mt then eq 4a singh and das 2015 considered as follows 3 c 0 t c i c 0 exp log 1 mt λ m 4 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m now the expression t considered as follows 5 t 0 t f 1 2 mt f mt dt 6 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 e mt 2 e mt dt where the limit t was treated as a dummy variable and then for the evaluation of t singh and das 2015 considered as follows 7 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 1 mt 2 1 mt dt 8 t 0 t 1 1 mt 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2

das 2015 used the approximation theory bugeaud 2004 and accordingly approximated the expression 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 for d 0 is smaller than u 0 according to bugeaud 2004 the real number ψ is said to be badly approximable if there exist a positive real number 12 j ψ suchthat ψ p q j ψ q 2 for any rational numbers p q distinct from ψ according to eq 12 singh and das 2015 the numerical value of the expressions 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 i e 0 735 and 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 i e 1 306 given by deng et al 2015 in their discussions are badly approximated to 1 singh and das 2015 used the approximation theory bugeaud 2004 and then the value of t taken as follows 13 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 and 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 and therefore 14 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 15 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 singh and das 2015 considered the boundary condition in terms of t and given as follows 16 c 0 t c i c 0 1 m t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 λ m 17 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt d 0 2 2 u 0 2 λ m 18 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m singh and das 2015 considered 1 d 0 2 2 u 0 2 1 19 c 0 t c i c 0 1 λ t neglecting the higher order terms 20 similarly for f mt exp mt t 1 m 1 e mt the eq 4 a singh and das 2015 considered as follows 21 c 0 t c

c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt d 0 2 2 u 0 2 λ m 26 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m singh and das 2015 considered 1 d 0 2 2 u 0 2 1 27 c 0 t c i c 0 1 λ t neglecting the higher order terms so deng et al 2015 provided wrong expression of the boundary conditions in their discussions deng et al 2015 assumption was not appropriate in the context of singh and das 2015 now for the evaluation of t singh and das 2015 used the dummy variable t as follows 28 t 0 t f 1 2 mt f mt dt 29 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 e mt 2 e mt dt 30 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 e mt 2 e mt e mt dt 31 t 0 t 1 2 d 0 u 0 e mt d 0 2 u 0 2 e 2 mt dt 32 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2

singh and das 2015 was used due to second order differential equation singh and das 2015 obtained two arbitrary constants using the boundary conditions given in eqs 22a and 22b respectively singh and das 2015 finally singh and das 2015 obtained the solution of the original system i e eq 1 4b given in eq 24 singh and das 2015 singh and das 2015 model equation can be solved for various form of f mt such as sinusoidal exponential and power function with small value of m and neglecting higher order terms of f mt we have already mentioned that the limit t was treated as dummy variable which allows to used more compact notation in mathematics regarding evaluation of t and possibly deng et al 2015 has overlooked this point also one can find the result of t given by singh and das 2015 by using mathematica software wolfram 1991 in the context of boundary condition deng et al 2015 claim is also not valid since analytical solution is an exact solution which is errorless whereas in numerical solution forward time central space ftcs scheme incorporates large error in the system due to large value of δ z so discrimination was found in figs 10 14 in singh and das 2015 2 conclusion in view of above discussion we find that deng et al 2015 claim about the transformation used by singh and das 2015 is invalid thus the transformation boundary conditions and subsequent analytical solution of advection dispersion equation given by singh and das 2015 was mathematically correct and physically meaningful

mt then eq 4a singh and das 2015 considered as follows 3 c 0 t c i c 0 exp log 1 mt λ m 4 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m now the expression t considered as follows 5 t 0 t f 1 2 mt f mt dt 6 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 e mt 2 e mt dt where the limit t was treated as a dummy variable and then for the evaluation of t singh and das 2015 considered as follows 7 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 1 mt 2 1 mt dt 8 t 0 t 1 1 mt 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 mt dt 9 t 1 m log 1 mt 2 d 0 u 0 t d 0 2 mu 0 2 1 mt 2 2 10 t t 2 d 0 u 0 t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 1 2 mt asneglecting the higherorder terms 11 t 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 as singh and das 2015 used the approximation theory bugeaud 2004 and accordingly approximated the expression 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 for d 0 is smaller than u 0 according to bugeaud 2004 the real number ψ is said to be badly approximable if there exist a positive real number 12 j ψ suchthat ψ p q j ψ q 2 for any rational numbers p q distinct from ψ according to eq 12 singh and das 2015 the numerical value of the expressions 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 i e 0 735 and 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 i e 1 306 given by deng et al 2015 in their discussions are badly approximated to 1 singh and das 2015 used the approximation theory bugeaud 2004 and then the value of t taken as follows 13 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 and 1 2 d 0 u 0 d 0 2 u 0 2 1 and therefore 14 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 15 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 singh and das 2015 considered the boundary condition in terms of t and given as follows 16 c 0 t c i c 0 1 m t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 λ m 17 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt d 0 2 2 u 0 2 λ m 18 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m singh and das 2015 considered 1 d 0 2 2 u 0 2 1 19 c 0 t c i c 0 1 λ t neglecting the higher order terms 20 similarly for f mt exp mt t 1 m 1 e mt the eq 4 a singh and das 2015 considered as follows 21 c 0 t c i c 0 exp log 1 1 mt λ m 22 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m and 23 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 singh and das 2015 considered the boundary condition in terms of t as follows 24 c 0 t c i c 0 1 m t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 λ m 25 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt d 0 2 2 u 0 2 λ m 26 c 0 t c i c 0 1 mt λ m singh and das 2015 considered 1 d 0 2 2 u 0 2 1 27 c 0 t c i c 0 1 λ t neglecting the higher order terms so deng et al 2015 provided wrong expression of the boundary conditions in their discussions deng et al 2015 assumption was not appropriate in the context of singh and das 2015 now for the evaluation of t singh and das 2015 used the dummy variable t as follows 28 t 0 t f 1 2 mt f mt dt 29 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 e mt 2 e mt dt 30 t 0 t 1 d 0 u 0 e mt 2 e mt e mt dt 31 t 0 t 1 2 d 0 u 0 e mt d 0 2 u 0 2 e 2 mt dt 32 t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 1 e 2 mt 2 d 0 mu 0 1 e mt 33 similarly forf mt exp mt t t d 0 2 2 mu 0 2 1 e 2 mt 2 d 0 mu 0 1 e mt in order to find the solution as per singh and das 2015 the laplace transform technique over eq 20 singh and das 2015 was used due to second order differential equation singh and das 2015 obtained two arbitrary constants using the boundary conditions given in eqs 22a and 22b respectively singh and das 2015 finally singh and das 2015 obtained the solution of the original system i e eq 1 4b given in eq 24 singh and das 2015 singh and das 2015 model equation can be solved for various form of f mt such as sinusoidal exponential and power function with small value of m and neglecting higher order terms of f mt we have already mentioned that the limit t was treated as dummy variable which allows to used more compact notation in mathematics regarding evaluation of t and possibly deng et al 2015 has overlooked this point also one can find the result of t given by singh and das 2015 by using mathematica software wolfram 1991 in the context of boundary condition deng et al 2015 claim is also not valid since analytical solution is an exact solution which is errorless whereas in numerical solution forward time central space ftcs scheme incorporates large error in the system due to large value of δ z so discrimination was found in figs 10 14 in singh and das 2015 2 conclusion in view of above discussion we find that deng et al 2015 claim about the transformation used by singh and das 2015 is invalid thus the transformation boundary conditions and subsequent analytical solution of advection dispersion equation given by singh and das 2015 was mathematically correct and physically meaningful
