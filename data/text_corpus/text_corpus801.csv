4005,estimating extreme precipitation return levels at ungauged locations is key for hydrological applications and risk management and demands improved techniques to decrease the large uncertainty of traditional methods here we leverage the perks of the simplified metastatistical extreme value smev approach with a twofold aim we show how it can be effectively used in situations in which the ordinary daily precipitation events cannot be fully described using a two parameter distribution and we examine the performance of different interpolation techniques for the estimation of return levels in ungauged locations smev proved adequate at representing at site extremes for a set of 4000 stations in germany with a general tendency to underestimate the probability of the largest annual maxima at the same time smev tends to overestimate with respect to the design return levels currently adopted in the country suggesting that these might actually underestimate the distribution tail among the investigated methods the inverse distance weighted interpolation of smev parameters provides the most accurate estimates of extreme return levels for ungauged locations with typical standard errors of 0 79 0 83 for rain gauge densities of 1 500 km 2 1 1000 km 2 albeit only less than 10 of the variance in estimation errors is explained by elevation the correlation between smev parameters and orography up to 43 explained variance suggests that future applications should test the inclusion of such information in spatial estimates keywords simplified metastatistical extreme value approach precipitation extremes at site and ungauged locations heavy tails 1 introduction accurate estimates of extreme daily precipitation amounts associated to rare yearly exceedance probabilities generally termed return levels constitute the basis for hydraulic design risk assessment and mitigation environmental policies and insurance reinsurance business katz et al 2002 groenemeijer et al 2015 hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 deriving such quantities requires observational records and statistical models able to reproduce the upper tail of the intensity distributions the extreme value theorem shows that under some general hypotheses extremes i e the maximum values recorded in each year or all the values exceeding a high threshold may only converge to known classes of three parameter distributions independent of the distribution class describing the underlying ordinary events fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 three parameter distributions are thus traditionally fitted to the observed extremes and used to extrapolate the information for low yearly exceedance probabilities jenkinson 1955 coles 2001 doing so the large stochastic uncertainties characterizing the sampled extremes are inherited by the parameters in particular by the shape parameter lu and stedinger 1992 morrison and smith 2002 this is highly undesirable because the estimated return levels are highly sensitive to it specific techniques are used to reduce this uncertainty and generally entail the a priori choice of a shape parameter of which the use of two parameter distributions such as the gumbel distribution is a particular case papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the use of a regionally derived shape parameter hosking and wallis 1997 or of prior distributions to restrict its value martins and stedinger 2000 as they are based on strong homogeneity assumptions these methods do not permit to adequately capture small scale variations a problem which could become important in presence of local climatological gradients e g orographic effects avanzi et al 2015 the global need for local information collides with the sparseness of rain gauge networks worldwide kidd et al 2017 a problem which is exacerbated by the need for long data records considering the direct hydrological implications of extreme precipitation improving our ability to estimate extreme return levels at ungauged locations could contribute to addressing important open questions in the hydrological community especially for what concerns our understanding of the variability of extremes blöschl et al 2019 however the procedures currently available to estimate extreme return levels at ungauged locations are based on regionalization approaches or on the geospatial modeling of the distribution parameters hosking and wallis 1997 wallis et al 2007 blanchet and lehning 2010 ceresetti et al 2012 das 2019 being based on the spatial representation of traditional estimates they suffer from the uncertainties characterizing these quantities remotely sensed precipitation products are getting more and more attention as alternative to observations from rain gauges on the one hand they can provide valuable information in ungauged regions with a quasi global coverage but some important issues remain still open especially for what concerns the propagation of estimation errors to the estimated return levels the availability of short time series and the lack of suitable validation methods marra nikolopoulos et al 2019 here we address the problem of estimating extreme return levels in ungauged locations by evaluating the spatial representativeness of a novel statistical approach based on the distribution of the ordinary as opposed to extreme events marani and ignaccolo 2015 differently from traditional methods this metastatistical extreme value mev approach assumes that the distribution class describing the ordinary events tail is known and derives an extreme value distribution explicitly considering the occurrence frequency of ordinary events thanks to the use of a much larger amount of information ordinary events versus extremes only this approach proved to be highly accurate in representing rare return levels this is the case of probabilities corresponding to return periods much longer than the record length zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 clearly the reasoning is valid whenever the basic assumption about the ordinary events distribution is met when this does not hold the method leads to biased estimates in particular it is worth recalling that the theoretical results by wilson and toumi 2005 only hold for the tail of the ordinary events distribution in a preliminary study over germany wang et al 2020 showed that the two parameter weibull distribution typically used to describe precipitation ordinary events in mev approaches e g zorzetto et al 2016 is not adequate to represent the full distribution of the ordinary events and thus extremes in the country conversely they showed that thanks to the different handling of the available information the simplified mev framework smev marra et al 2019a b could better isolate independent events and through left censoring reproduce extremes we hence use here smev which allows to i represent the tail of the ordinary events distribution under more general conditions see details in marra et al 2020 thus extending the validity of the assumption and limiting the impact of the above issue and to ii examine fine scale variations of the distribution parameters by fully leveraging the at site information marra et al 2021 we refer to marra et al 2020 and serinaldi et al 2020 for a discussion of the differences between mev smev and traditional approaches based on extremes the method was previously tested in the context of spatial modeling schellander et al 2019 here we extend upon schellander et al 2019 and marra et al 2019a b by a demonstrating the use of smev in regions where the ordinary daily precipitation events are not well described by a two parameter weibull distribution and b examining the performance of different interpolation techniques for the estimation of smev parameters in ungauged locations under varying densities of available observations in a controlled monte carlo experiment after a brief introduction about the data used and the theoretical framework we explain the procedures developed for the evaluation of the suitability of smev for german daily precipitation extremes and for the spatial estimation of extreme return levels in ungauged locations results for both the at site and spatial estimations are then presented and discussed a final section provides a short summary and the main conclusions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area and data we focus on the whole of germany a study area chosen for its dense daily rainfall station network average density 1 60 km 2 along with the presence of diverse precipitation patterns and generating mechanisms precipitation in germany mostly occurs due to westerly circulation patterns whose influence decreases moving towards the east topography significantly affects precipitation spatial patterns fig 1 a extratropical cyclones of type vb first defined by van bebber 1891 nissen et al 2014 grams et al 2014 are a peculiar atmospheric phenomenon linked to extreme precipitation and flash floods in central eastern europe the characteristic pathway of the vb cyclones originates in the bay of biscay the balearic sea or the ligurian sea and then moves north eastward around the alps into eastern europe and the baltic sea these cyclones sometimes around 2 3 events year messmer et al 2015 trigger heavy precipitation over the northern alpine region and central and eastern europe affecting the distribution of extremes in fact about 40 of the vb cyclones are associated with precipitation exceeding the 95th percentile of daily precipitation over central europe nissen et al 2013 considering the reference period 1961 1990 the lowest annual precipitation amounts occur in north east germany 577 mm year and the highest in the alps 1935 mm year deutscher wetterdienst 2017 we collected daily precipitation data from the deutsche wetter dienst dwd which provides a network of about 6000 daily stations covering the whole germany from the year 1781 a first screening consists in the control of missing values we retain only series with more than 10 complete years i e including at least 330 days of observations resulting in 5019 available stations density of approximately 1 71 km 2 these are then further skimmed on the basis of the performance of the smev model see section 2 3 2 2 the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution and its simplified form smev the mev distribution originally introduced by marani and ignaccolo 2015 builds the distribution of the extremes considering all the so called ordinary events i e the all independent realizations of the variable of interest the cumulative distribution of maxima emerges from the full distribution of the ordinary events which is sampled a variable number of times namely the number of occurrences of the events themselves the discrete expression of the mev cumulative distribution function ζ x reads as follows 1 ζ x 1 m j 1 m f x θ j n j where m is the length of the available time series f x θ j the yearly distributions of the ordinary events and n j their yearly number in this formulation the inter annual variability is taken into account as indicated by the subscript j it is thus straightforward to notice that one of the greatest perks of the approach is the fact that it effectively uses most of the available data and does not limit the estimation to a small subset of it such as the annual maxima or the exceedances of a high threshold marra et al 2019 proposed a simplified version of the mev smev which neglects inter annual variability dependence of the parameters and events occurrences on j in eq 1 in favor of parameter estimation accuracy an approach that was also adopted by schellander et al 2019 and discussed in miniussi and marani 2020 given the preliminary results obtained over germany using mev and smev wang et al 2020 this is deemed as a crucial advantage as it allows to accurately estimate parameters describing only the portion of ordinary events which are well approximated by the chosen model details in marra et al 2020 here we will use smev considering one rainfall type in these conditions the cumulative distribution function describing yearly exceedance probabilities can be written as 2 ζ x f x θ n where f x θ is the distribution describing the portion of ordinary events of interest see definition in section 2 3 θ is a set of two parameters describing the distribution and n is their average yearly number 2 3 identification of wet periods and parameter estimation many precipitation records in germany are characterized by snow events but to avoid dealing with two potentially different populations of events a problem which could affect the quality of the estimates marra et al 2018 we discard snow days i e values flagged with 7 in the dwd archive while mixed precipitation flag 8 is here considered as liquid precipitation as they do not significantly contribute to annual maxima following the unified approach presented in marra et al 2020 we define as storms the sequences of consecutive wet days i e any day with a precipitation value greater than or equal to 0 1 mm marra et al 2019a b separated by at least one dry day ordinary events are then defined as the maximum values observed within each storm the same methodology was used by miniussi et al 2020 to identify cyclone generated rainfall following theoretical reasoning wilson and toumi 2005 and previous mev works on daily precipitation e g marani and ignaccolo 2015 we assume the high intensity portion of the ordinary events is described by a two parameter weibull distribution in the form 3 f x c w 1 e x p x c w where c is the scale parameter and w the shape parameter distributions with larger shape parameter are characterized by lighter tails and vice versa we estimate the parameters by left censoring the portion of ordinary events which is not well described by our two parameter model and using a least squares regression in weibull transformed coordinates on the remaining data points marani and ignaccolo 2015 this means that the weight in the probability of the left censored events is retained the need of censoring the upper part of the distributions was also highlighted by wang et al 2020 when analyzing sub daily precipitation in germany following the procedure described in marra et al 2019 and marra et al 2020 which permits to maximize the ability of ordinary events to represent extremes in the area we optimized the threshold for left censoring to 90 although locally different thresholds may define the tail of the ordinary events distribution we expect this to be a climatological characteristic of a region in particular we find that left censoring 90 of the ordinary events allows for an accurate identification of the tail throughout the study region to avoid stochastic uncertainties that would affect our results we use this threshold for our parameter estimation procedure meaning that at each station the largest 10 of the ordinary events are used to estimate the parameters given the typical number of ordinary events in the region the two parameters of the weibull distributions are estimated using a number of points between 44 and 1086 median value 211 which is 3 6 times larger than the number of points used by traditional approaches to estimate three parameters in order to evaluate the suitability of smev on the german dataset we proceed by using the test presented in marra et al 2020 1 we estimate the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution on the ordinary events identified as explained above while n is directly computed as the mean of the wet days in the series 2 given the parameters of smev weibull scale and shape and n we generate 1000 series of weibull distributed synthetic precipitation values m years long with m indicating the original length of the time series and with a number of rainy days equal to n 3 if 90 of the original maxima is within the 90 confidence interval of the maxima from the synthetic generated time series we consider smev a robust model for the station otherwise we discard it this procedure is performed by both retaining and explicitly censoring annual maxima for the estimation of the weibull parameters in order to provide also a complete independent validation of the hypothesis it is worth here to point out that synthetic experiments conducted using typical ordinary events tails stretched exponential such as weibull and power type show that the test is rather strict and applied to the generalized extreme value distribution as a model for annual maxima rejects about 20 40 of the samples 2 4 parameter estimation at the ungauged locations the algorithm for estimating parameters and consequently quantiles associated to specific return periods at ungauged locations consists in the following steps 1 we select a target station i e the station that is considered as ungauged 2 we randomly select a subset of gauges modifying the station density δ between 1 200 and 1 100000 km 2 to avoid the creation of clusters we impose a minimum inter distance between stations set equal to d m i n 0 5 δ 0 5 following nikolopoulos et al 2015 which used a network characterized by inter gauge distances similar to ours with δ 200 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 20 000 and 100000 km2 3 we estimate the smev parameters of the ungauged station using three widely used interpolation methods namely two deterministic interpolation methods nearest neighbor nn and inverse distance weighting idw and one geostatistical method ordinary kriging ok with a spherical variogram details in webster and oliver 2007 finally we compute the smev quantiles for the ungauged station we iterate the procedure outlined above 100 times for each ungauged station in order to have a full statistical description of the errors at each location we chose these interpolation methods as they have been extensively applied in interpolation studies and have been shown to provide different performances according to the objectives of the investigations the nn method despite being extremely simple has been proved to be affected by smaller biases than more sophisticated methods in some applications e g nikolopoulos et al 2015 idw is an efficient methodology that allows to include information from many stations without a significant increase in the computation time ok is a more sophisticated geostatistical method but presents drawbacks like the higher computational time along with the higher sensitivity to the station network density for example webster and oliver 2007 indicate the need of availability of at least 100 measurement locations ideally 150 to adequately estimate the variogram we focus on target return periods where the return period t r is defined as the inverse of the yearly exceedance probability which we estimate using the weibull plotting position p i 1 i m 1 with i 1 2 m being the rank of the value and m the length of the times series to compare the new estimations with the ones estimated in the at site approach 2 5 evaluation metrics we evaluate the accuracy of the estimations for each interpolation method m and station density d computing the relative error on the parameters weibull shape and scale parameters and average number of rainy days as 4 ε θ m d θ i n t m d θ e s t θ e s t where θ i n t m d is the parameter estimated in the location considered as ungauged using the interpolation method m and with a station density d and θ e s t is the at site estimated parameter here used as a reference to summarize with one single number the relative errors on the 100 iterations with respect to the reference return periods we finally computed the fraction standard error fse as 5 ε fs m d 1 x t r j 1 n r x i n t m d t r j x t r 2 0 5 where x i n t m d t r j is the j th quantile corresponding to the return period t r computed for the ungauged location with the interpolation method m and a density d and x t r is the at site estimated quantile for the same t r 2 6 assessment of tail heaviness we use here the obesity index introduced by cooke and nieboer 2011 to evaluate the heaviness of the tail of the distributions it is a non parametric measure based on order statistics and is defined as the probability that the sum of the smallest and largest value of a four values random sample is higher than the sum of the other two being a probability it ranges between 0 and 1 and its formulation reads as follows 6 o b x p x 4 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 where x k are independent and identically distributed values randomly extracted 1000 times from the original sample here the series of ordinary events cooke and nieboer 2014 showed that the obesity index for an exponential distribution is equal to 0 75 and that obesity index greater than 0 75 represent tails decreasing slower than the exponential ones 2 7 benchmarking with the state of the art finally in order to provide a benchmark with previous research we compare our results with the ones by schellander et al 2019 who implemented the smooth modeling method by blanchet and lehning 2010 originally devised for the generalized extreme value distribution parameters in the smev framework but could not show significant improvements over the original approach mirroring the analysis presented in fig 9 in schellander et al 2019 we focus on the relative error ε x i n t x o b s x o b s between the interpolated and the observed 50 year quantile 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of smev model and comparison with official design precipitation first to evaluate the suitability and robustness of smev as an extreme value approach for precipitation in germany we perform the experiment described in section 2 2 for which the left censoring threshold was optimized in order to maximize the number of long stations with time series longer than 60 years to be retained in the analysis the final number of stations irrespective of their length for which at least 90 of the annual maxima is within the 90 confidence intervals is 4015 out of 5019 the median length of the time series is 37 years resulting in an average density of approximately 1 90 km 2 fig 1b this result is corroborated by a similar analysis in which the annual maxima were explicitly censored from the estimation of the weibull parameters red and yellow dots in fig 1b represent stations in which less than 90 of these maxima lie within the 90 confidence interval despite the fact that some stations could fail the test due to stochastic uncertainty this choice allows us to be on the safe side especially when evaluating the spatial approaches it would be extremely complicated to disentangle potential uncertainties related to sub optimal choices of the left censoring from errors due to the interpolation methods thus decreasing the robustness of our results among the 1004 stations that we discarded in the majority of the cases smev was underestimating the large annual maxima when considering the upper tail of the distribution of the maxima from 90th to 99th percentile in about 50 of the stations at least one annual maxima was above the 95th percentile of the samples while the opposite maxima below the 5th percentile occurred in a very small portion 1 8 of the cases fig s1 in the supporting information shows results of the test run either using all the here defined ordinary events for estimating the distribution parameters fig s1a or using the traditional mev approach i e defining ordinary events as independent daily amounts greater or equal to 1 mm and allowing inter annual variability of the distribution parameters as in zorzetto and marani 2019 fig s1b results of the test show that a when all ordinary events are used i e smev without left censoring the test is successful in only 27 of the stations green filled circles in fig s1 b this percentage drops to 0 5 when inter annual variability of the parameters is allowed as in the standard mev this confirms what found by wang et al 2020 when analyzing sub daily rainfall in the same region fig 2 shows the distribution of the ordinary events in a weibull plot for four example stations characterized by contrasting topographic and precipitation features in eastern germany northern german plains central uplands and in the bavarian alps note that in these coordinates weibull distributions become linear we can clearly see how the lower portion of the ordinary events detaches more or less markedly from the linear behavior which seems to characterize the high intensity portion the dashed lines whose color matches the stations location in the map in the inset show the weibull distributions describing the largest 10 of the events as done in this study supporting the findings by wang et al 2020 in sub hourly rainfall in germany in all but the station in the east purple color highest values tend to align with the regression line while in the latter case the less frequent rainfall depths tends to stay over it in such situations the slope of the regression line whose inverse is the estimated weibull shape parameter should be higher or in other words the distribution should be characterized by a heavier tail with the aim of quantifying the error emerging from a wrong estimate of the weibull shape parameter in fig s2 we compare the rainfall frequency curves i e daily rainfall maxima as a function of the logarithm of the return period black filled circles for the four exemplary cases in fig 2 obtained by smev without left censoring red shaded area the standard mev green shaded area and the smev with left censoring that we found to be the best choice for german daily precipitation blue shaded area the most relevant case is surely the one presented in panel a of fig s2 namely the daily precipitation maxima for the berlin dahlem berlin id 00403 station in eastern germany which we noted as an area where heavy tails emerge and the risk of underestimating extremes is therefore particularly critical in general fig s2 allows for a straightforward evaluation of the error that can be caused if wrong assumptions in this case the whole distribution of ordinary events following the weibull model are taken we now extend the analysis of the weibull parameters over the whole country the spatial patterns that arise when estimating the parameters of the weibull distribution visibly resemble the german landscape characteristics fig 3 compared to fig 1a higher values of the scale parameter c along with higher values of the shape parameter w can be noticed in correspondence of higher elevated areas in the central west part of the country central uplands in the centre harz centre east thuringian forest and in the south west low elevation mountains as the black forest are impacted by frequent precipitation the southwestern swabian jura lee side is instead characterized by low precipitation rates sasse et al 2013 and does not indeed display higher values of c or w the same behavior is highly marked in the south bavarian alps and south east in correspondence of the bavarian forest this implies that these areas are generally characterized by larger typical wet days and lighter than exponential tails lower values of c and values of w significantly lower than 1 indicating the emergence of heavier tails characterize eastern germany coherently with studies focusing on the evaluation of heavy tails behaviors e g the recent global analysis by means of the mean excess function by nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 as mentioned in section 2 6 we employ the obesity index cooke and nieboer 2011 for assessing tail heaviness which confirms the pattern shown in nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 fig 4 red dots in fig 4 indicate stations for which a heavy tail behavior is expected an obesity index equal to 0 75 white dots in fig 4 indicates the tail of an exponential while an obesity index greater than 0 75 represents tails that are decreasing slower than the exponential ones cooke and nieboer 2014 which are mainly concentrated in eastern germany this area is characterized by lower precipitation rates and magnitudes in comparison to other german regions but precipitation triggered by vb cyclones contributes to events with large magnitudes which tend to make the tail of the distribution of daily rainfall become heavier fig 3b and fig 4 both highlight an extensive presence of heavy tails in germany red dots in the two figures indicate shape parameter values lower than 1 and obesity index values greater than 0 75 respectively therefore distributions with exponential or lighter tails such as the gumbel distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 should be used carefully also smev despite being able to better describe the tail of the distribution when heavy tails emerge generally underestimates the largest extremes the behavior highlighted in the example station for eastern germany in fig 2 purple is common in stations whose distribution of daily precipitation values has a heavy tail among the stations with an obesity index greater than 0 75 2642 red points in fig 4 in 544 the highest maxima are underestimated while in only 45 cases the tail of the distributions was overestimated regarding the parameter n fig 3c it is important to remind that it represents the average yearly number of storms i e consecutive wet days as defined above in areas characterized by longer storms for example where the elevation is higher with an average storm length of about 4 days this number is thus considerably lower than the typical number of wet days which can exceed 150 wet days per year on the other hand regions characterized by shorter storms are likely to display higher values of n notably eastern germany interestingly elevation explains about 43 of the variance in the scale parameter positive relation 11 for the shape positive and 8 for the average number of yearly ordinary events negative insets in fig 3 to quantitatively evaluate smev estimates we compared them with the design precipitation gridded values provided by the dwd climate data center dwd climate data center cdc 2010 which is in charge of providing official design values for germany the grid cell size is approximately 8 km the temporal coverage from 1951 and 2010 see details in malitz and ertel 2015 and the tolerance range is 15 for return periods between 5 and 50 years and 20 for return periods greater than 50 years see panels a and d in fig 5 for the 50 and 100 years return values of design precipitation estimates the guidelines given by the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa 2012 for the estimation of return levels of daily precipitation consist in fitting an exponential distribution on the partial duration series including the heaviest rainfall events whose length is at least twice the length of the available time series thus the derived extreme value distribution is characterized by an exponential tail we estimated precipitation from smev for a return period of 50 and 100 years at each station for which at least 10 complete years in the 1951 2010 range 1046 stations were available and linearly interpolated them to match the grid provided by dwd cdc fig 5b and e panels c and f in fig 5 show the relative error between smev gridded values and the grid from dwd cdc error values between 0 15 and 0 20 for 50 and 100 years return periods fig 5c and f indicate that smev estimates are within the uncertainty range provided smev tends to overestimate the 50 years design precipitation in some high elevated areas mainly in the alps slightly in the black forest and in the bavarian forest more saturated red values in fig 5c but otherwise its estimations are between the lower and upper limits from dwd cdc things change when focusing on the 100 return period quantiles in addition to the alpine region smev overestimates systematically see the marked red pattern in eastern germany fig 5f with respect to dwd cdc especially where the emergence of heavy tails was indicated by the heavy tail indicator and by the weibull shape parameter the spearman correlation coefficient computed between the relative error and the shape parameter is 0 4 hinting to the fact that the higher differences between dwd cdc and smev based estimated are at least partially explained by the presence of heavier tails this relative over estimation from smev is likely due to the approach used in the official german product that being characterized by an exponential tail might be locally too light remarkably smev estimates accurately resemble the orographic patterns highlighting the fact that the model is be able to capture small scale variations e g orographic effects marra et al 2021 a feature of primary importance when estimating precipitation extremes so far we found that the main drawback with the use of smev in germany is a tendency towards underestimating the distribution tail heaviness at the same time we show that the design values currently in use in germany seem to be even more affected by this issue as they rely on lighter tailed distributions the analyses presented up to now thus indicate smev as a more than adequate model for extreme daily precipitation in germany in the following we evaluate the effect of the reduction of station density on high return period quantiles in ungauged locations 3 2 smev for ungauged locations we now proceed with the smev estimates for ungauged locations implemented as described in section 2 4 we will focus on errors on parameters and quantiles associated to target return periods when stations are considered as ungauged we present results for three representative densities 1 500 km 2 1 1000 km 2 and 1 10000 km 2 to evaluate to what extent the performance is degrading when the network becomes significantly sparser which is an information of primary importance for real world applications in these cases the number of stations used for estimating values in the ungauged station is respectively 714 357 and 35 errors are computed as explained in eq 4 for what concerns parameters and following eq 5 to quantify the error on the estimation of high return period quantiles we present here results for t r 100 years but errors on other return periods show the same overall patterns and can be found in the supporting information see figs s3 and s4 for t r 50 and t r 500 years respectively boxplots in fig 6 indicate the number of ordinary events as the parameter more accurately estimated by all three interpolation methods its errors tend to remain fairly limited also when the density is significantly reduced most of the density of the relative error distribution on the number of rainy days lies in the range 0 2 0 2 as it can be seen in the third group of box plots in the first row of fig 6 this indicates that as expected local conditions tend to affect precipitation intensity distributions more than storms occurrence the distribution of the relative error on the shape parameter w shows fewer outliers than the one on n but it is more likely to have higher errors range 0 4 0 4 second group of boxplots in the first row of fig 6 moreover differences between the three methods can be highlighted nn displays a larger range of outliers with respect to the other two which are instead comparable the largest errors occur for the scale parameter c see first group of boxplots in fig 6 with their uncertainty being minimized by the inverse distance weighting method errors in the parameters affect the estimation accuracy in fig 7 we present the map of the fractional standard error fse computed for each station on the 100 random extraction of the gauges used for parameter interpolation for all the interpolation methods a return period of 100 years and three different densities 1 500 1 1000 and 1 10000 km 2 fig 7 is complemented by fig 8 which shows the histograms of the frequency in of stations displaying a fse within specific ranges remarkably the interpolation method displaying the lowest fse is idw panels b e h in fig 7 and fig 8 also when the station density is reduced almost 50 of the stations shows fse lower than 1 when the density is 1 10000 km 2 panel h in fig 8 the fse computed on 100 years return values estimated via nn manifests the highest values also for the higher station densities panels a and d in figs 7 and 8 where about 80 of the stations have fse greater than 1 and panel g with fse always greater than 1 finally the fse from the ok is in between those from the other two interpolation methods c f i and corresponding panels in fig 8 the determination coefficients of the regression line between fse and elevation are low r2 less than 0 1 for all the cases implying that little of the variability of the fse can be explained by the variability of the elevation the results described above indicate the idw as the most stable interpolation method at least for our study case even if geostatistical methods were often been proved to be superior to idw depending on the application of interest other studies found similar performances between idw and ok mainly in dependence to the network density and the geographic region for example wagner et al 2012 highlighted comparable performances between idw and ok methods and in ly et al 2011 neither ok nor kriging with external drift were able to improve the idw interpolation accuracy as indicated in section 2 7 as a last step we benchmark our approach with previous research schellander et al 2019 namely by comparing the relative error between the interpolated and the observed 50 year quantile as in fig 9 in schellander et al 2019 we consider as target stations those with a time series at least 50 100 years long whose spatial distribution is shown in the first second row in fig 9 the stations selected for this analysis are 1515 and 102 respectively and we consider only our higher station densities 1 200 km 2 and 1 500 km 2 as they are the closest albeit much sparser to the 1 67 km 2 density of the calibration stations in schellander et al 2019 notably the most significant underestimation issues appear in eastern germany where tails tend to be heavier than those of our model this is true despite the fact that our estimates are higher than the operational design values for germany in terms of comparison with schellander et al 2019 the range of the median relative error that we get is 0 6 0 4 when considering the stations with the shorter records and 0 4 0 2 in the case of the longer in contrast with their range which reaches 0 95 the fraction of stations with small relative error range 0 05 0 05 is 24 and 33 in our cases as opposed to their 21 these represent solid results also in consideration of the denser calibration network used in schellander et al 2019 4 summary and conclusions we presented an at site and spatial analysis of extreme daily precipitation return levels over germany by means of the simplified metatastatistical extreme value smev approach an emergent methodology for the estimation of extremes from ordinary events here we leverage the enhanced flexibility of smev in the definition of the ordinary events to i avoid time dependence issues and ii properly model ordinary events by left censoring values which are not described by the same two parameter distribution describing extremes we found that smev with left censoring 90 of the values is a robust extreme value method for germany strict tests evaluating whether observed annual maxima are likely sampled from this model showed that this is the case for more than 80 of the examined stations even when annual maxima are explicitly censored from the parameter estimation procedure in general our approach tends to underestimate the tail heaviness in some areas but remarkably showed higher estimates of 50 year and 100 year quantiles than the german official design precipitation values dwd climate data center cdc 2010 meaning that these values could be subject to even larger underestimation the emergence of heavy tails in several regions of the country mainly but not limited to the eastern part hints to the fact that the use of the approach recommended by the official german guidelines whose tail is equivalent to exponential should be revised in some areas notably the regions in which the smev and dwd underestimation is more marked are also characterized by a peculiar climatology in which specific relatively rare events the vb cyclones contribute to an important portion of the extremes the presence of multiple types of ordinary events characterized by different distributions could easily explain the underestimation for these models based on one type of ordinary events only e g berg et al 2013 marra et al 2018 marra et al 2019 interestingly at site weibull parameters show spatial patterns which closely resemble the german orography notwithstanding the orographic enhancement of precipitation observed in many mountainous regions being a widely studied process the orographic impact on the statistical properties of the distributions used to describe extremes has been studied less e g grieser et al 2007 allamano et al 2009 blanchet et al 2009 avanzi et al 2015 ragulina and reitan 2017 here we highlight a positive correlation between the scale and to a lesser extent the shape parameters of the weibull distribution with the elevation which aligns with recent results in 6 hour precipitation intensities on different climates marra et al 2021 in the spatial approach the inverse distance weighting method is the most robust showing lower fse values than those obtained with the other two methods only when the density decreases significantly 1 10000 km 2 i e the parameter at each station in the country are estimated using only 35 other stations high elevated stations are affected by the highest fse for example in correspondence of the bavarian alps and the harz mountains comparison of our results with the pioneer investigations on the spatial use of smev by schellander et al 2019 showed that despite the availability of a sparser calibration network our methodology showed a smaller range of the errors as well as a larger fraction of stations with very small error around 0 these promising results indicate that the approach here proposed is both flexible and robust it might hence be used for estimation of extremes in ungauged locations albeit a small fraction of the variance in estimation errors is explained by elevation the correlation between smev parameters and orography up to 43 explained variance suggests that future applications should test the inclusion of such information in spatial estimates similarly future applications should consider the use of multiple types of ordinary events to explain the underestimated extreme quantiles in regions where rare type events dominate the distribution of extremes 5 data statement and acknowledgements daily rainfall time series are available at https opendata dwd de climate environment cdc

4005,estimating extreme precipitation return levels at ungauged locations is key for hydrological applications and risk management and demands improved techniques to decrease the large uncertainty of traditional methods here we leverage the perks of the simplified metastatistical extreme value smev approach with a twofold aim we show how it can be effectively used in situations in which the ordinary daily precipitation events cannot be fully described using a two parameter distribution and we examine the performance of different interpolation techniques for the estimation of return levels in ungauged locations smev proved adequate at representing at site extremes for a set of 4000 stations in germany with a general tendency to underestimate the probability of the largest annual maxima at the same time smev tends to overestimate with respect to the design return levels currently adopted in the country suggesting that these might actually underestimate the distribution tail among the investigated methods the inverse distance weighted interpolation of smev parameters provides the most accurate estimates of extreme return levels for ungauged locations with typical standard errors of 0 79 0 83 for rain gauge densities of 1 500 km 2 1 1000 km 2 albeit only less than 10 of the variance in estimation errors is explained by elevation the correlation between smev parameters and orography up to 43 explained variance suggests that future applications should test the inclusion of such information in spatial estimates keywords simplified metastatistical extreme value approach precipitation extremes at site and ungauged locations heavy tails 1 introduction accurate estimates of extreme daily precipitation amounts associated to rare yearly exceedance probabilities generally termed return levels constitute the basis for hydraulic design risk assessment and mitigation environmental policies and insurance reinsurance business katz et al 2002 groenemeijer et al 2015 hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 deriving such quantities requires observational records and statistical models able to reproduce the upper tail of the intensity distributions the extreme value theorem shows that under some general hypotheses extremes i e the maximum values recorded in each year or all the values exceeding a high threshold may only converge to known classes of three parameter distributions independent of the distribution class describing the underlying ordinary events fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 three parameter distributions are thus traditionally fitted to the observed extremes and used to extrapolate the information for low yearly exceedance probabilities jenkinson 1955 coles 2001 doing so the large stochastic uncertainties characterizing the sampled extremes are inherited by the parameters in particular by the shape parameter lu and stedinger 1992 morrison and smith 2002 this is highly undesirable because the estimated return levels are highly sensitive to it specific techniques are used to reduce this uncertainty and generally entail the a priori choice of a shape parameter of which the use of two parameter distributions such as the gumbel distribution is a particular case papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the use of a regionally derived shape parameter hosking and wallis 1997 or of prior distributions to restrict its value martins and stedinger 2000 as they are based on strong homogeneity assumptions these methods do not permit to adequately capture small scale variations a problem which could become important in presence of local climatological gradients e g orographic effects avanzi et al 2015 the global need for local information collides with the sparseness of rain gauge networks worldwide kidd et al 2017 a problem which is exacerbated by the need for long data records considering the direct hydrological implications of extreme precipitation improving our ability to estimate extreme return levels at ungauged locations could contribute to addressing important open questions in the hydrological community especially for what concerns our understanding of the variability of extremes blöschl et al 2019 however the procedures currently available to estimate extreme return levels at ungauged locations are based on regionalization approaches or on the geospatial modeling of the distribution parameters hosking and wallis 1997 wallis et al 2007 blanchet and lehning 2010 ceresetti et al 2012 das 2019 being based on the spatial representation of traditional estimates they suffer from the uncertainties characterizing these quantities remotely sensed precipitation products are getting more and more attention as alternative to observations from rain gauges on the one hand they can provide valuable information in ungauged regions with a quasi global coverage but some important issues remain still open especially for what concerns the propagation of estimation errors to the estimated return levels the availability of short time series and the lack of suitable validation methods marra nikolopoulos et al 2019 here we address the problem of estimating extreme return levels in ungauged locations by evaluating the spatial representativeness of a novel statistical approach based on the distribution of the ordinary as opposed to extreme events marani and ignaccolo 2015 differently from traditional methods this metastatistical extreme value mev approach assumes that the distribution class describing the ordinary events tail is known and derives an extreme value distribution explicitly considering the occurrence frequency of ordinary events thanks to the use of a much larger amount of information ordinary events versus extremes only this approach proved to be highly accurate in representing rare return levels this is the case of probabilities corresponding to return periods much longer than the record length zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 clearly the reasoning is valid whenever the basic assumption about the ordinary events distribution is met when this does not hold the method leads to biased estimates in particular it is worth recalling that the theoretical results by wilson and toumi 2005 only hold for the tail of the ordinary events distribution in a preliminary study over germany wang et al 2020 showed that the two parameter weibull distribution typically used to describe precipitation ordinary events in mev approaches e g zorzetto et al 2016 is not adequate to represent the full distribution of the ordinary events and thus extremes in the country conversely they showed that thanks to the different handling of the available information the simplified mev framework smev marra et al 2019a b could better isolate independent events and through left censoring reproduce extremes we hence use here smev which allows to i represent the tail of the ordinary events distribution under more general conditions see details in marra et al 2020 thus extending the validity of the assumption and limiting the impact of the above issue and to ii examine fine scale variations of the distribution parameters by fully leveraging the at site information marra et al 2021 we refer to marra et al 2020 and serinaldi et al 2020 for a discussion of the differences between mev smev and traditional approaches based on extremes the method was previously tested in the context of spatial modeling schellander et al 2019 here we extend upon schellander et al 2019 and marra et al 2019a b by a demonstrating the use of smev in regions where the ordinary daily precipitation events are not well described by a two parameter weibull distribution and b examining the performance of different interpolation techniques for the estimation of smev parameters in ungauged locations under varying densities of available observations in a controlled monte carlo experiment after a brief introduction about the data used and the theoretical framework we explain the procedures developed for the evaluation of the suitability of smev for german daily precipitation extremes and for the spatial estimation of extreme return levels in ungauged locations results for both the at site and spatial estimations are then presented and discussed a final section provides a short summary and the main conclusions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area and data we focus on the whole of germany a study area chosen for its dense daily rainfall station network average density 1 60 km 2 along with the presence of diverse precipitation patterns and generating mechanisms precipitation in germany mostly occurs due to westerly circulation patterns whose influence decreases moving towards the east topography significantly affects precipitation spatial patterns fig 1 a extratropical cyclones of type vb first defined by van bebber 1891 nissen et al 2014 grams et al 2014 are a peculiar atmospheric phenomenon linked to extreme precipitation and flash floods in central eastern europe the characteristic pathway of the vb cyclones originates in the bay of biscay the balearic sea or the ligurian sea and then moves north eastward around the alps into eastern europe and the baltic sea these cyclones sometimes around 2 3 events year messmer et al 2015 trigger heavy precipitation over the northern alpine region and central and eastern europe affecting the distribution of extremes in fact about 40 of the vb cyclones are associated with precipitation exceeding the 95th percentile of daily precipitation over central europe nissen et al 2013 considering the reference period 1961 1990 the lowest annual precipitation amounts occur in north east germany 577 mm year and the highest in the alps 1935 mm year deutscher wetterdienst 2017 we collected daily precipitation data from the deutsche wetter dienst dwd which provides a network of about 6000 daily stations covering the whole germany from the year 1781 a first screening consists in the control of missing values we retain only series with more than 10 complete years i e including at least 330 days of observations resulting in 5019 available stations density of approximately 1 71 km 2 these are then further skimmed on the basis of the performance of the smev model see section 2 3 2 2 the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution and its simplified form smev the mev distribution originally introduced by marani and ignaccolo 2015 builds the distribution of the extremes considering all the so called ordinary events i e the all independent realizations of the variable of interest the cumulative distribution of maxima emerges from the full distribution of the ordinary events which is sampled a variable number of times namely the number of occurrences of the events themselves the discrete expression of the mev cumulative distribution function ζ x reads as follows 1 ζ x 1 m j 1 m f x θ j n j where m is the length of the available time series f x θ j the yearly distributions of the ordinary events and n j their yearly number in this formulation the inter annual variability is taken into account as indicated by the subscript j it is thus straightforward to notice that one of the greatest perks of the approach is the fact that it effectively uses most of the available data and does not limit the estimation to a small subset of it such as the annual maxima or the exceedances of a high threshold marra et al 2019 proposed a simplified version of the mev smev which neglects inter annual variability dependence of the parameters and events occurrences on j in eq 1 in favor of parameter estimation accuracy an approach that was also adopted by schellander et al 2019 and discussed in miniussi and marani 2020 given the preliminary results obtained over germany using mev and smev wang et al 2020 this is deemed as a crucial advantage as it allows to accurately estimate parameters describing only the portion of ordinary events which are well approximated by the chosen model details in marra et al 2020 here we will use smev considering one rainfall type in these conditions the cumulative distribution function describing yearly exceedance probabilities can be written as 2 ζ x f x θ n where f x θ is the distribution describing the portion of ordinary events of interest see definition in section 2 3 θ is a set of two parameters describing the distribution and n is their average yearly number 2 3 identification of wet periods and parameter estimation many precipitation records in germany are characterized by snow events but to avoid dealing with two potentially different populations of events a problem which could affect the quality of the estimates marra et al 2018 we discard snow days i e values flagged with 7 in the dwd archive while mixed precipitation flag 8 is here considered as liquid precipitation as they do not significantly contribute to annual maxima following the unified approach presented in marra et al 2020 we define as storms the sequences of consecutive wet days i e any day with a precipitation value greater than or equal to 0 1 mm marra et al 2019a b separated by at least one dry day ordinary events are then defined as the maximum values observed within each storm the same methodology was used by miniussi et al 2020 to identify cyclone generated rainfall following theoretical reasoning wilson and toumi 2005 and previous mev works on daily precipitation e g marani and ignaccolo 2015 we assume the high intensity portion of the ordinary events is described by a two parameter weibull distribution in the form 3 f x c w 1 e x p x c w where c is the scale parameter and w the shape parameter distributions with larger shape parameter are characterized by lighter tails and vice versa we estimate the parameters by left censoring the portion of ordinary events which is not well described by our two parameter model and using a least squares regression in weibull transformed coordinates on the remaining data points marani and ignaccolo 2015 this means that the weight in the probability of the left censored events is retained the need of censoring the upper part of the distributions was also highlighted by wang et al 2020 when analyzing sub daily precipitation in germany following the procedure described in marra et al 2019 and marra et al 2020 which permits to maximize the ability of ordinary events to represent extremes in the area we optimized the threshold for left censoring to 90 although locally different thresholds may define the tail of the ordinary events distribution we expect this to be a climatological characteristic of a region in particular we find that left censoring 90 of the ordinary events allows for an accurate identification of the tail throughout the study region to avoid stochastic uncertainties that would affect our results we use this threshold for our parameter estimation procedure meaning that at each station the largest 10 of the ordinary events are used to estimate the parameters given the typical number of ordinary events in the region the two parameters of the weibull distributions are estimated using a number of points between 44 and 1086 median value 211 which is 3 6 times larger than the number of points used by traditional approaches to estimate three parameters in order to evaluate the suitability of smev on the german dataset we proceed by using the test presented in marra et al 2020 1 we estimate the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution on the ordinary events identified as explained above while n is directly computed as the mean of the wet days in the series 2 given the parameters of smev weibull scale and shape and n we generate 1000 series of weibull distributed synthetic precipitation values m years long with m indicating the original length of the time series and with a number of rainy days equal to n 3 if 90 of the original maxima is within the 90 confidence interval of the maxima from the synthetic generated time series we consider smev a robust model for the station otherwise we discard it this procedure is performed by both retaining and explicitly censoring annual maxima for the estimation of the weibull parameters in order to provide also a complete independent validation of the hypothesis it is worth here to point out that synthetic experiments conducted using typical ordinary events tails stretched exponential such as weibull and power type show that the test is rather strict and applied to the generalized extreme value distribution as a model for annual maxima rejects about 20 40 of the samples 2 4 parameter estimation at the ungauged locations the algorithm for estimating parameters and consequently quantiles associated to specific return periods at ungauged locations consists in the following steps 1 we select a target station i e the station that is considered as ungauged 2 we randomly select a subset of gauges modifying the station density δ between 1 200 and 1 100000 km 2 to avoid the creation of clusters we impose a minimum inter distance between stations set equal to d m i n 0 5 δ 0 5 following nikolopoulos et al 2015 which used a network characterized by inter gauge distances similar to ours with δ 200 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 20 000 and 100000 km2 3 we estimate the smev parameters of the ungauged station using three widely used interpolation methods namely two deterministic interpolation methods nearest neighbor nn and inverse distance weighting idw and one geostatistical method ordinary kriging ok with a spherical variogram details in webster and oliver 2007 finally we compute the smev quantiles for the ungauged station we iterate the procedure outlined above 100 times for each ungauged station in order to have a full statistical description of the errors at each location we chose these interpolation methods as they have been extensively applied in interpolation studies and have been shown to provide different performances according to the objectives of the investigations the nn method despite being extremely simple has been proved to be affected by smaller biases than more sophisticated methods in some applications e g nikolopoulos et al 2015 idw is an efficient methodology that allows to include information from many stations without a significant increase in the computation time ok is a more sophisticated geostatistical method but presents drawbacks like the higher computational time along with the higher sensitivity to the station network density for example webster and oliver 2007 indicate the need of availability of at least 100 measurement locations ideally 150 to adequately estimate the variogram we focus on target return periods where the return period t r is defined as the inverse of the yearly exceedance probability which we estimate using the weibull plotting position p i 1 i m 1 with i 1 2 m being the rank of the value and m the length of the times series to compare the new estimations with the ones estimated in the at site approach 2 5 evaluation metrics we evaluate the accuracy of the estimations for each interpolation method m and station density d computing the relative error on the parameters weibull shape and scale parameters and average number of rainy days as 4 ε θ m d θ i n t m d θ e s t θ e s t where θ i n t m d is the parameter estimated in the location considered as ungauged using the interpolation method m and with a station density d and θ e s t is the at site estimated parameter here used as a reference to summarize with one single number the relative errors on the 100 iterations with respect to the reference return periods we finally computed the fraction standard error fse as 5 ε fs m d 1 x t r j 1 n r x i n t m d t r j x t r 2 0 5 where x i n t m d t r j is the j th quantile corresponding to the return period t r computed for the ungauged location with the interpolation method m and a density d and x t r is the at site estimated quantile for the same t r 2 6 assessment of tail heaviness we use here the obesity index introduced by cooke and nieboer 2011 to evaluate the heaviness of the tail of the distributions it is a non parametric measure based on order statistics and is defined as the probability that the sum of the smallest and largest value of a four values random sample is higher than the sum of the other two being a probability it ranges between 0 and 1 and its formulation reads as follows 6 o b x p x 4 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 where x k are independent and identically distributed values randomly extracted 1000 times from the original sample here the series of ordinary events cooke and nieboer 2014 showed that the obesity index for an exponential distribution is equal to 0 75 and that obesity index greater than 0 75 represent tails decreasing slower than the exponential ones 2 7 benchmarking with the state of the art finally in order to provide a benchmark with previous research we compare our results with the ones by schellander et al 2019 who implemented the smooth modeling method by blanchet and lehning 2010 originally devised for the generalized extreme value distribution parameters in the smev framework but could not show significant improvements over the original approach mirroring the analysis presented in fig 9 in schellander et al 2019 we focus on the relative error ε x i n t x o b s x o b s between the interpolated and the observed 50 year quantile 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of smev model and comparison with official design precipitation first to evaluate the suitability and robustness of smev as an extreme value approach for precipitation in germany we perform the experiment described in section 2 2 for which the left censoring threshold was optimized in order to maximize the number of long stations with time series longer than 60 years to be retained in the analysis the final number of stations irrespective of their length for which at least 90 of the annual maxima is within the 90 confidence intervals is 4015 out of 5019 the median length of the time series is 37 years resulting in an average density of approximately 1 90 km 2 fig 1b this result is corroborated by a similar analysis in which the annual maxima were explicitly censored from the estimation of the weibull parameters red and yellow dots in fig 1b represent stations in which less than 90 of these maxima lie within the 90 confidence interval despite the fact that some stations could fail the test due to stochastic uncertainty this choice allows us to be on the safe side especially when evaluating the spatial approaches it would be extremely complicated to disentangle potential uncertainties related to sub optimal choices of the left censoring from errors due to the interpolation methods thus decreasing the robustness of our results among the 1004 stations that we discarded in the majority of the cases smev was underestimating the large annual maxima when considering the upper tail of the distribution of the maxima from 90th to 99th percentile in about 50 of the stations at least one annual maxima was above the 95th percentile of the samples while the opposite maxima below the 5th percentile occurred in a very small portion 1 8 of the cases fig s1 in the supporting information shows results of the test run either using all the here defined ordinary events for estimating the distribution parameters fig s1a or using the traditional mev approach i e defining ordinary events as independent daily amounts greater or equal to 1 mm and allowing inter annual variability of the distribution parameters as in zorzetto and marani 2019 fig s1b results of the test show that a when all ordinary events are used i e smev without left censoring the test is successful in only 27 of the stations green filled circles in fig s1 b this percentage drops to 0 5 when inter annual variability of the parameters is allowed as in the standard mev this confirms what found by wang et al 2020 when analyzing sub daily rainfall in the same region fig 2 shows the distribution of the ordinary events in a weibull plot for four example stations characterized by contrasting topographic and precipitation features in eastern germany northern german plains central uplands and in the bavarian alps note that in these coordinates weibull distributions become linear we can clearly see how the lower portion of the ordinary events detaches more or less markedly from the linear behavior which seems to characterize the high intensity portion the dashed lines whose color matches the stations location in the map in the inset show the weibull distributions describing the largest 10 of the events as done in this study supporting the findings by wang et al 2020 in sub hourly rainfall in germany in all but the station in the east purple color highest values tend to align with the regression line while in the latter case the less frequent rainfall depths tends to stay over it in such situations the slope of the regression line whose inverse is the estimated weibull shape parameter should be higher or in other words the distribution should be characterized by a heavier tail with the aim of quantifying the error emerging from a wrong estimate of the weibull shape parameter in fig s2 we compare the rainfall frequency curves i e daily rainfall maxima as a function of the logarithm of the return period black filled circles for the four exemplary cases in fig 2 obtained by smev without left censoring red shaded area the standard mev green shaded area and the smev with left censoring that we found to be the best choice for german daily precipitation blue shaded area the most relevant case is surely the one presented in panel a of fig s2 namely the daily precipitation maxima for the berlin dahlem berlin id 00403 station in eastern germany which we noted as an area where heavy tails emerge and the risk of underestimating extremes is therefore particularly critical in general fig s2 allows for a straightforward evaluation of the error that can be caused if wrong assumptions in this case the whole distribution of ordinary events following the weibull model are taken we now extend the analysis of the weibull parameters over the whole country the spatial patterns that arise when estimating the parameters of the weibull distribution visibly resemble the german landscape characteristics fig 3 compared to fig 1a higher values of the scale parameter c along with higher values of the shape parameter w can be noticed in correspondence of higher elevated areas in the central west part of the country central uplands in the centre harz centre east thuringian forest and in the south west low elevation mountains as the black forest are impacted by frequent precipitation the southwestern swabian jura lee side is instead characterized by low precipitation rates sasse et al 2013 and does not indeed display higher values of c or w the same behavior is highly marked in the south bavarian alps and south east in correspondence of the bavarian forest this implies that these areas are generally characterized by larger typical wet days and lighter than exponential tails lower values of c and values of w significantly lower than 1 indicating the emergence of heavier tails characterize eastern germany coherently with studies focusing on the evaluation of heavy tails behaviors e g the recent global analysis by means of the mean excess function by nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 as mentioned in section 2 6 we employ the obesity index cooke and nieboer 2011 for assessing tail heaviness which confirms the pattern shown in nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 fig 4 red dots in fig 4 indicate stations for which a heavy tail behavior is expected an obesity index equal to 0 75 white dots in fig 4 indicates the tail of an exponential while an obesity index greater than 0 75 represents tails that are decreasing slower than the exponential ones cooke and nieboer 2014 which are mainly concentrated in eastern germany this area is characterized by lower precipitation rates and magnitudes in comparison to other german regions but precipitation triggered by vb cyclones contributes to events with large magnitudes which tend to make the tail of the distribution of daily rainfall become heavier fig 3b and fig 4 both highlight an extensive presence of heavy tails in germany red dots in the two figures indicate shape parameter values lower than 1 and obesity index values greater than 0 75 respectively therefore distributions with exponential or lighter tails such as the gumbel distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 should be used carefully also smev despite being able to better describe the tail of the distribution when heavy tails emerge generally underestimates the largest extremes the behavior highlighted in the example station for eastern germany in fig 2 purple is common in stations whose distribution of daily precipitation values has a heavy tail among the stations with an obesity index greater than 0 75 2642 red points in fig 4 in 544 the highest maxima are underestimated while in only 45 cases the tail of the distributions was overestimated regarding the parameter n fig 3c it is important to remind that it represents the average yearly number of storms i e consecutive wet days as defined above in areas characterized by longer storms for example where the elevation is higher with an average storm length of about 4 days this number is thus considerably lower than the typical number of wet days which can exceed 150 wet days per year on the other hand regions characterized by shorter storms are likely to display higher values of n notably eastern germany interestingly elevation explains about 43 of the variance in the scale parameter positive relation 11 for the shape positive and 8 for the average number of yearly ordinary events negative insets in fig 3 to quantitatively evaluate smev estimates we compared them with the design precipitation gridded values provided by the dwd climate data center dwd climate data center cdc 2010 which is in charge of providing official design values for germany the grid cell size is approximately 8 km the temporal coverage from 1951 and 2010 see details in malitz and ertel 2015 and the tolerance range is 15 for return periods between 5 and 50 years and 20 for return periods greater than 50 years see panels a and d in fig 5 for the 50 and 100 years return values of design precipitation estimates the guidelines given by the german association for water wastewater and waste dwa 2012 for the estimation of return levels of daily precipitation consist in fitting an exponential distribution on the partial duration series including the heaviest rainfall events whose length is at least twice the length of the available time series thus the derived extreme value distribution is characterized by an exponential tail we estimated precipitation from smev for a return period of 50 and 100 years at each station for which at least 10 complete years in the 1951 2010 range 1046 stations were available and linearly interpolated them to match the grid provided by dwd cdc fig 5b and e panels c and f in fig 5 show the relative error between smev gridded values and the grid from dwd cdc error values between 0 15 and 0 20 for 50 and 100 years return periods fig 5c and f indicate that smev estimates are within the uncertainty range provided smev tends to overestimate the 50 years design precipitation in some high elevated areas mainly in the alps slightly in the black forest and in the bavarian forest more saturated red values in fig 5c but otherwise its estimations are between the lower and upper limits from dwd cdc things change when focusing on the 100 return period quantiles in addition to the alpine region smev overestimates systematically see the marked red pattern in eastern germany fig 5f with respect to dwd cdc especially where the emergence of heavy tails was indicated by the heavy tail indicator and by the weibull shape parameter the spearman correlation coefficient computed between the relative error and the shape parameter is 0 4 hinting to the fact that the higher differences between dwd cdc and smev based estimated are at least partially explained by the presence of heavier tails this relative over estimation from smev is likely due to the approach used in the official german product that being characterized by an exponential tail might be locally too light remarkably smev estimates accurately resemble the orographic patterns highlighting the fact that the model is be able to capture small scale variations e g orographic effects marra et al 2021 a feature of primary importance when estimating precipitation extremes so far we found that the main drawback with the use of smev in germany is a tendency towards underestimating the distribution tail heaviness at the same time we show that the design values currently in use in germany seem to be even more affected by this issue as they rely on lighter tailed distributions the analyses presented up to now thus indicate smev as a more than adequate model for extreme daily precipitation in germany in the following we evaluate the effect of the reduction of station density on high return period quantiles in ungauged locations 3 2 smev for ungauged locations we now proceed with the smev estimates for ungauged locations implemented as described in section 2 4 we will focus on errors on parameters and quantiles associated to target return periods when stations are considered as ungauged we present results for three representative densities 1 500 km 2 1 1000 km 2 and 1 10000 km 2 to evaluate to what extent the performance is degrading when the network becomes significantly sparser which is an information of primary importance for real world applications in these cases the number of stations used for estimating values in the ungauged station is respectively 714 357 and 35 errors are computed as explained in eq 4 for what concerns parameters and following eq 5 to quantify the error on the estimation of high return period quantiles we present here results for t r 100 years but errors on other return periods show the same overall patterns and can be found in the supporting information see figs s3 and s4 for t r 50 and t r 500 years respectively boxplots in fig 6 indicate the number of ordinary events as the parameter more accurately estimated by all three interpolation methods its errors tend to remain fairly limited also when the density is significantly reduced most of the density of the relative error distribution on the number of rainy days lies in the range 0 2 0 2 as it can be seen in the third group of box plots in the first row of fig 6 this indicates that as expected local conditions tend to affect precipitation intensity distributions more than storms occurrence the distribution of the relative error on the shape parameter w shows fewer outliers than the one on n but it is more likely to have higher errors range 0 4 0 4 second group of boxplots in the first row of fig 6 moreover differences between the three methods can be highlighted nn displays a larger range of outliers with respect to the other two which are instead comparable the largest errors occur for the scale parameter c see first group of boxplots in fig 6 with their uncertainty being minimized by the inverse distance weighting method errors in the parameters affect the estimation accuracy in fig 7 we present the map of the fractional standard error fse computed for each station on the 100 random extraction of the gauges used for parameter interpolation for all the interpolation methods a return period of 100 years and three different densities 1 500 1 1000 and 1 10000 km 2 fig 7 is complemented by fig 8 which shows the histograms of the frequency in of stations displaying a fse within specific ranges remarkably the interpolation method displaying the lowest fse is idw panels b e h in fig 7 and fig 8 also when the station density is reduced almost 50 of the stations shows fse lower than 1 when the density is 1 10000 km 2 panel h in fig 8 the fse computed on 100 years return values estimated via nn manifests the highest values also for the higher station densities panels a and d in figs 7 and 8 where about 80 of the stations have fse greater than 1 and panel g with fse always greater than 1 finally the fse from the ok is in between those from the other two interpolation methods c f i and corresponding panels in fig 8 the determination coefficients of the regression line between fse and elevation are low r2 less than 0 1 for all the cases implying that little of the variability of the fse can be explained by the variability of the elevation the results described above indicate the idw as the most stable interpolation method at least for our study case even if geostatistical methods were often been proved to be superior to idw depending on the application of interest other studies found similar performances between idw and ok mainly in dependence to the network density and the geographic region for example wagner et al 2012 highlighted comparable performances between idw and ok methods and in ly et al 2011 neither ok nor kriging with external drift were able to improve the idw interpolation accuracy as indicated in section 2 7 as a last step we benchmark our approach with previous research schellander et al 2019 namely by comparing the relative error between the interpolated and the observed 50 year quantile as in fig 9 in schellander et al 2019 we consider as target stations those with a time series at least 50 100 years long whose spatial distribution is shown in the first second row in fig 9 the stations selected for this analysis are 1515 and 102 respectively and we consider only our higher station densities 1 200 km 2 and 1 500 km 2 as they are the closest albeit much sparser to the 1 67 km 2 density of the calibration stations in schellander et al 2019 notably the most significant underestimation issues appear in eastern germany where tails tend to be heavier than those of our model this is true despite the fact that our estimates are higher than the operational design values for germany in terms of comparison with schellander et al 2019 the range of the median relative error that we get is 0 6 0 4 when considering the stations with the shorter records and 0 4 0 2 in the case of the longer in contrast with their range which reaches 0 95 the fraction of stations with small relative error range 0 05 0 05 is 24 and 33 in our cases as opposed to their 21 these represent solid results also in consideration of the denser calibration network used in schellander et al 2019 4 summary and conclusions we presented an at site and spatial analysis of extreme daily precipitation return levels over germany by means of the simplified metatastatistical extreme value smev approach an emergent methodology for the estimation of extremes from ordinary events here we leverage the enhanced flexibility of smev in the definition of the ordinary events to i avoid time dependence issues and ii properly model ordinary events by left censoring values which are not described by the same two parameter distribution describing extremes we found that smev with left censoring 90 of the values is a robust extreme value method for germany strict tests evaluating whether observed annual maxima are likely sampled from this model showed that this is the case for more than 80 of the examined stations even when annual maxima are explicitly censored from the parameter estimation procedure in general our approach tends to underestimate the tail heaviness in some areas but remarkably showed higher estimates of 50 year and 100 year quantiles than the german official design precipitation values dwd climate data center cdc 2010 meaning that these values could be subject to even larger underestimation the emergence of heavy tails in several regions of the country mainly but not limited to the eastern part hints to the fact that the use of the approach recommended by the official german guidelines whose tail is equivalent to exponential should be revised in some areas notably the regions in which the smev and dwd underestimation is more marked are also characterized by a peculiar climatology in which specific relatively rare events the vb cyclones contribute to an important portion of the extremes the presence of multiple types of ordinary events characterized by different distributions could easily explain the underestimation for these models based on one type of ordinary events only e g berg et al 2013 marra et al 2018 marra et al 2019 interestingly at site weibull parameters show spatial patterns which closely resemble the german orography notwithstanding the orographic enhancement of precipitation observed in many mountainous regions being a widely studied process the orographic impact on the statistical properties of the distributions used to describe extremes has been studied less e g grieser et al 2007 allamano et al 2009 blanchet et al 2009 avanzi et al 2015 ragulina and reitan 2017 here we highlight a positive correlation between the scale and to a lesser extent the shape parameters of the weibull distribution with the elevation which aligns with recent results in 6 hour precipitation intensities on different climates marra et al 2021 in the spatial approach the inverse distance weighting method is the most robust showing lower fse values than those obtained with the other two methods only when the density decreases significantly 1 10000 km 2 i e the parameter at each station in the country are estimated using only 35 other stations high elevated stations are affected by the highest fse for example in correspondence of the bavarian alps and the harz mountains comparison of our results with the pioneer investigations on the spatial use of smev by schellander et al 2019 showed that despite the availability of a sparser calibration network our methodology showed a smaller range of the errors as well as a larger fraction of stations with very small error around 0 these promising results indicate that the approach here proposed is both flexible and robust it might hence be used for estimation of extremes in ungauged locations albeit a small fraction of the variance in estimation errors is explained by elevation the correlation between smev parameters and orography up to 43 explained variance suggests that future applications should test the inclusion of such information in spatial estimates similarly future applications should consider the use of multiple types of ordinary events to explain the underestimated extreme quantiles in regions where rare type events dominate the distribution of extremes 5 data statement and acknowledgements daily rainfall time series are available at https opendata dwd de climate environment cdc

4006,as the largest tributary of the yellow river the wei river drains a basin mainly comprising two different geological settings i e the chinese loess plateau clp in the north covered by quaternary loess and the qinling mountains area in the south exploring the influence of natural weathering processes and human activities on river chemistry has high significance in understanding chemical transport from the wei river to the yellow river the geochemical characteristics of the wei river mainstream and its tributaries as well as chemical weathering were determined using a geochemistry and isotope dataset of high spatial resolution the mainstream clearly exhibited a mixture of major elements and stable isotopes from tributaries on both the north and south banks with values within the range of those of the tributaries north bank tributaries draining thick loess deposits showed higher contents of major elements and the enrichment of stable isotopes reflecting the influence of geological setting on river chemistry the dominant processes accounting for the water chemistry of the mainstream are evaporite 39 75 and carbonate weathering 21 54 within the watershed evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering are higher in the northern clp area whereas carbonate weathering is higher in the southern qinling mountain area the co2 consumption by the wei river is 19 9 109 mol yr accounting for 32 5 of the total co2 consumption by the middle reaches of the yellow river during the high flow period the chemical weathering flux of the wei river was found to be within the range of northern rivers in china while the chemical weathering rate was relatively high in the semi arid region this suggests that chemical denudation is a significant factor for the river chemistry of the clp at least in the high flow period keywords chemical weathering stable isotope co2 consumption qinling mountains chinese loess plateau 1 introduction rivers are one of the driving forces of the transport of continental crustal materials to the ocean lerman and meybeck 1988 gaillardet et al 1999 accordingly geochemical research on river water can provide information on the pathways and flows of chemical elements in the terrestrial surface ocean system over the past decades the chemistry of large river systems has been extensively studied meybeck 1987 zhang et al 1995 roy et al 1999 chen et al 2002 chetelat et al 2008 gupta et al 2011 fan et al 2014 existing literature suggests that chemical elements in rivers are controlled by diverse processes such as physical and tectonic forces controlling landforms and geological setting horton et al 1999 torres et al 2015 chemical weathering processes that result in the dissolution of rock minerals climatic conditions that influence the chemical weathering rate smolders et al 2004 jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and human perturbations connor et al 2014 elumalai et al 2017a grosbois et al 2000 liu and han 2020 roy et al 1999 among which the lithology is commonly the dominant factor schopka et al 2011 however most related studies focused on silicate and carbonate weathering in large river basins and chemical weathering in loess areas has rarely been investigated fan et al 2014 ran et al 2015 xiao et al 2016 the chinese loess plateau clp is one of the most distinctive geomorphic units in the world with a total area of 640 000 km2 and is an important birthplace of chinese civilization li et al 2016 wang and yang 2018 the loess deposits in the clp is up to 250 m thick jin et al 2018 this area is also characterized by diverse landscapes including loess hills gullies tablelands and severe soil erosion 3180 t km2 yr of 2000 2008 reported by fu et al 2011 the climate of clp is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon with more than 70 of the annual precipitation concentrated during the summer monsoons between june to september liu et al 2017 coupled with long term human disturbances and its proneness to loess erosion the ecological environment of the clp is extremely fragile chen et al 2003 the yellow river is the crucial source of fresh water for all inhabitants of this area strongly affected by weathering and erosion the yellow river system has a very high dissolved load compared with those of other major world rivers zhang et al 1995 chen et al 2005 the tds of yellow river was 452 mg l reported by chen et al 2005 which was nearly four times the changjiang of 121 mg l chen et al 2002 ten times the amazon of 44 mg l more than four times the global discharge weighted average of 99 mg l gaillardet et al 1999 most studies on rivers focus on trace and pollutant elements which are very sensitive to anthropogenic activities and administration management especially in urbanized regions li et al 2013 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in contrast the composition of major elements is more closely related to the lithology and natural erosion over the drainage basin over the decades several studies have explored the chemistry of major elements in the yellow river and they suggest that the major process controlling the geochemistry of the mainstream yellow river and its major tributaries is chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks especially loess which is rich in carbonate minerals and evaporites chen et al 2005 ran et al 2015 these studies at the watershed scale provided a quantitative estimate of loess and granite weathering for example zhang et al 2015 reported that the average contribution of evaporite dissolution for the cations in high flow period was 50 4 20 9 21 0 for the yellow river middle reaches this value is consistent with the result of fan et al 2014 50 in principle hydrochemistry and isotope methods should be applicable for determining variations in river chemistry liu et al 2019 however this approach is limited by the temporal and spatial resolution of sampling for large river catchments variations in lithology climate and land use will lead to discrepancies in the understanding of the chemical weathering of specific local rivers zhang et al 2015 sampled the yellow river water at midstream weekly for a whole year and concluded that the averaging silicate weathering rate 351 6 157 9 353 1 mol km2 day and carbonate weathering rate 363 0 354 1 327 3 mol km2 day during storm events were higher than that of other period ran et al 2015 selected three hydrological stations located on different reaches of the yellow river with variations in lithology and water discharge and concluded that the weathering flux followed the order middle reaches carbonate weathering 4 66 mt yr silicate weathering 1 62 mt yr lower reaches carbonate weathering 4 63 mt yr silicate weathering 1 5 mt yr upper reaches carbonate weathering 2 24 mt yr silicate weathering 0 79 mt yr the drainage area of the wei river accounts for a majority of the clp as the largest tributary of the yellow river the wei river is expected to have a significant influence on the chemistry of the yellow river with different geological backgrounds on two banks i e the qinling mountain area in the south and the clp in the north the climate lithology and geography of the two areas are also quite different he et al 2009 wang et al 2013 considering this unique geological background the mechanism and extent of control of chemical weathering human perturbations and other potential factors on major ions in river water still need to be identified and explored this study conducted hydrochemistry and stable isotope measurements of the wei river and its tributaries with a high spatial resolution sampling interval 5 10 km oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were used to examine the relationship between atmospheric precipitation and river water aiming at exploring the origin of river water we present a complete record regarding the mainstream and its tributaries on both banks within the discharge basin i e guanzhong basin this approach provides an opportunity for understanding the perturbations of lithology geography and human activities on river chemistry with precise measurements and calculating weathering flux and co2 consumption in a typical discharge basin under semi arid climate conditions 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the wei river originates from niaoshushan mountain in the west flows a distance of 818 km eastward and drains into the yellow river at tongguan fig 1 this watershed lies between 103 5 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n covering a 13 48 104 km2 watershed zhang et al 2016 this catchment spans over 2500 m in elevation the development of the wei river system is affected by qinling latitudinal tectonic system in the south and qilv helan tectonic system in the north resulting in the asymmetric distribution of tributaries on both sides south bank tributaries originating from the qinling mountains are featured by short and rapid flow with low sand content north bank tributaries commonly flow a long distance through the loess plateau area chang et al 2016 with high sand content the loess plateau serves as the major sand source of the wei river the jinghe jh is the major tributary of the wei river and drains an area of 45421 km2 which accounts for 34 of the total area of the wei river watershed gao et al 2020a information on the major tributaries is displayed in table 1 the mainstream of the wei river is located towards the southern part of the watershed along the north slope of the qinling mountains this area has a semi arid continental monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of 12 14 c wu 2018 the mean annual precipitation is 505 718 mm increasing from northwest to south wu 2018 the wet season is usually from june to september with most rainfall events occurring simultaneously with high air temperature wang et al 2013 for the study year january 1 to december 31 2018 precipitation in the guanzhong basin was 548 9 mm with the highest value observed in july china meteorological administration http data cma cn affected by the seasonal distribution of precipitation runoff of the wei river exhibits a similar distribution fig 2 the high flow season commonly occurs from july to october with the highest runoff in july and low flow season occurs from january to march during the study year the wei river 68 59 109 m3 contributed 16 5 to the runoff of the yellow river at tongguan station 414 18 109 m3 according to the data provided by yellow river conservancy commission 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the headwater area of the wei river is mainly hilly terrain with an altitude of 1200 2500 m cenozoic mesozoic and paleozoic strata are well developed including pre sinian sinian cambrian ordovician silurian system devonian and cretaceous this area presents a diverse lithology including conglomerate feldspathic quartz sandstone mudstone schist gneiss and granite fig 3 from linjiacun to the confluence with the yellow river the wei river drains the loess plateau in the north altitude 900 2000 m alluvial and pluvial plain in the central area altitude 800 m and the qinling mountains areas in the south altitude 2000 m the loess plateau is mainly covered by quaternary loess cenozoic and mesozoic clastic rocks are distributed along river valleys with the lithology of conglomerate sandstone marlstone and shale a set of paleozoic cambrian and ordovician strata dominated by dolomite and limestone is distributed along the south edge of the loess plateau in this research the alluvial and pluvial plain of the middle and lower reaches of wei river known as the guanzhong basin was taken as the primary study area this basin is the socioeconomic center of the wei river watershed chen et al 2021 geologically the guanzhong basin is a cenozoic fault depression basin covered by thick quaternary sediments gao et al 2020b the wei river and its tributaries have shaped multistage terraces composed of sand and gravel the terrace of the wei river is narrow in the upstream and gradually widens from the midstream the lithology of the alluvial plain comprises interbedded layers of alluvial sand sand gravel and silty clay from the middle pleistocene to holocene and the upper part of the high terrace is covered by aeolian loess in the northeast of the basin the alluvial plain is underlain by lacustrine strata which are rich in gypsum and mirabilite producing a brackish paleogeographic environment the southern qinling mountains area is dominated by granite gneiss and schist 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources the

collection and analysis to investigate spatial changes in river water chemistry during the high flow period water samples were collected in august 2018 during which no rainfall event was encountered the mainstream was sampled every 5 10 km the mainstream was sampled every 5 10 km tributary samples were collected at the mouth of tributary and guaranteed not to be affected by backwater of the mainstream all the river water samples were sampled at a depth of 0 5 m below the surface ec ph and temperature were measured using a portable meter aquaread ap 700 in situ the location of each sampling site was recorded with a portable gps suspended particulate matter were removed using 0 45 µm filters the samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 then transferred to 500 ml pre cleaned polyethylene bottles samples for anion analysis were transferred to 500 ml pre cleaned polyethylene bottles without acidification samples for isotope analysis were transferred into 50 ml glass bottles laboratory analysis was conducted at the water and soil testing center of the shaanxi institute of engineering prospecting siep using approved standard testing methods gb t 5750 2006 within 3 days chemical analysis of major ions ca2 mg2 and so4 2 were carried out via edta 2na titration with a detection limit of 1 0 mg l k and na were analyzed via flame atomic absorption spectrometry with detection limits of 0 05 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively hco3 was measured using the titrimetric method with a detection limit of 1 0 mg l cl was measured via silver nitrate titration with a detection limit of 1 0 mg l no3 concentrations were measured using the thymol spectrophotometry method with a detection limit of 2 5 mg l the normalized inorganic charge balance nicb tz tz tz of all the water samples were 5 indicating the reliability of the water quality analysis results hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in h2o were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer iwa 35 ep with analytical precision values of 0 6 and 0 2 for δ 2h and δ 18o respectively 3 3 statistics analysis the spearman correlation coefficient is a widely used non parametric measure to explore the relationship between variables wunderlin et al 2001 elumalai et al 2017b this method is applicable for data with non normal distribution bouza deaño et al 2008 the significance level of 0 05 is the commonly used criterion for interpreting the statistical significance of the computed correlation coefficient popugaeva et al 2019 in this study the spearman correlation coefficient was computed using spss ibm spss statistics 25 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical signatures 4 1 1 mainstream table 2 presents the chemical compositions of river water samples for the total mainstream samples the ph values ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 with a mean of 8 2 the total dissolved solids tds of the wei river mainstream ranged from 316 to 780 mg l with a mean value of 494 mg l which was close to that of the yellow river 557 mg l but much higher those of the yangtze river 268 68 mg l as reported by luo 2015 and world rivers gaillardet et al 1999 the lowest value 316 mg l was observed at the site after the confluence with the shitouhe sth as shown in fig 4 according to the spatial variations in chemistry the mainstream was divided into four sections i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 fig 4 in general the tds and major ion concentrations of the mainstream decreased slightly along the m1 and m2 the section m1 from linjiacun to xianyang is the major headwater area where the load on water quality posed by human activities is relatively weak the section m2 is the most populated region of the wei river watershed it is noticeable that the main urban area did not significantly affect the mainstream water chemistry in section m3 the tds increased markedly with a range of 508 780 mg l simultaneously with na cl and so4 2 suggesting possible contributions from evaporite weathering and human inputs in section m4 the tds values slightly decreased due to self purification among the solutes ca2 showed the least pronounced changes which can be attributed to the regulation of carbonate dissolution or precipitation chen et al 2020 the dominant cations in most river water samples were ca2 and na and the primary anions were hco3 and so4 2 cation abundance followed the order ca na mg k in section m1 and na ca mg k in section m2 from section m3 na and mg2 began to increase in the mainstream the abundance of anion followed the order hco3 so4 cl no3 the hydrochemical types of the mainstream water did not present major variation as shown in the piper diagram fig 5 the major ions in the mainstream water samples are concentrated in a narrow area 4 1 2 tributaries there are several tributaries drain into the wei river controlled by hydrological and geographical setting tributaries on the two sides show different hydrochemical features in general the tds values increase towards downstream and are higher in north bank tributaries the maximum tds value was observed in jinghe jh 1056 0 mg l which was six times the minimum tds 176 0 mg l measured at heihe hh in the south bank in the north bank tributaries na was the dominant cation and hco3 and so4 2 were the dominant anions representing hco3 na and hco3 so4 na types as the largest tributary the chemical facies of jh was so4 cl na type suggesting that it may contribute abundant na cl and so4 2 to the wei river the south bank tributaries sth tangyuhe tyh and hh in the upper reaches were hco3 ca type tributaries flowing through sections m2 and m3 were significantly enriched in na so4 2 and cl resulting in complex chemical facies including the hco3 so4 ca na hco3 cl na ca and so4 hco3 mg ca types 4 1 3 groundwater the analysis and interpretation of hydrochemical features of groundwater samples which are adjacent 5 km to the mainstream would provide useful information for identifying potential relationships between groundwater and river water the groundwater data were cited from gao 2020 comparing the samples dissolved salts in groundwater exhibited higher spatial variability throughout the watershed the mean tds values of groundwater corresponding to four sections of the mainstream along the north bank were 704 3 831 5 835 0 and 1016 7 mg l respectively while those along the south bank were 473 7 587 9 721 0 and 773 0 mg l the concentration of major ions in groundwater along the north bank were generally higher than that along the south bank which is consistent with the variations in tributaries in general the hydrochemical signatures of groundwater and river water chemistry show a clear response to the regional geological and hydrogeological setting 4 1 4 precipitation chemical data of precipitation shown in table 3 were compiled from the literature xu et al 2009 wang et al 2019 most previous research on the chinese loess plateau focused on the relationship of precipitation with runoff soil water and vegetation research on precipitation chemistry mainly considered urban areas in the guanzhong basin table 3 presents the chemical compositions of precipitation at lanzhou located west of the wei river watershed and xi an station which is located in the central area of the guanzhong basin compared with river water the concentrations of chemical elements in precipitation were much lower accordingly it can be hypothesized that atmospheric source salts are not a major contributor to major ions in the wei river 4 2 multivariate statistics as shown in the spearman correlation matrix fig 6 tds has strong positive correlations with na r 0 9 p 0 001 cl r 0 86 p 0 001 and so4 2 r 0 83 p 0 001 and moderate correlation with mg2 r 0 69 p 0 001 indicating that these ions are the primary contributors to the total dissolved salts of the wei river the correlation coefficients were 0 92 for na and cl and 0 87 for na and so4 2 na was also significantly correlated with sio2 r 0 39 p 0 001 the relationship between na and these ions indicates multiple sources of sodium such as evaporite weathering halite and sulfate and silicate weathering cl also showed strong correlation with so4 2 r 0 81 p 0 001 ca2 exhibited negative correlations with other major ions including na r 0 43 p 0 001 mg2 r 0 41 p 0 001 cl r 0 39 p 0 001 and so4 2 r 0 48 p 0 001 but a positive correlation with hco3 r 0 38 p 0 001 indicating that ca2 is mainly attributable to carbonate dissolution and is insensitive to pollution due to low variability within the watershed the correlations of no3 with other ions were insignificant positive correlations were found among sio2 and na k and hco3 which imply silicate weathering source for the river chemistry 4 3 dual stable isotope signatures fig 7a presents dual stable isotope signatures showing the δd and δ 18o values of the wei river precipitation and the local meteoric water line lmwl the δd and δ 18o values of the mainstream water fluctuated from 64 3 to 57 9 mean 60 9 and from 9 4 to 8 4 mean 8 7 respectively most of the mainstream samples scatter to the right of the lmwl with a slope of 3 0 δd 3 0 δ 18o 34 6 r 0 53 indicating evaporation during the transit from precipitation to river flow pang et al 2017 qian et al 2014 in the wet season the slope of the regression line of the mainstream of the wei river was lower than that of the yellow river δd 4 71 δ 18o 22 64 reported by su et al 2003 indicating more intensive evaporation in the study area compared with the δd and δ 18o values of mainstream 60 9 8 7 the north bank tributaries exhibited slightly enriched values 59 1 8 3 whereas the major south bank tributaries showed depleted values 64 4 and 9 4 variations in stable isotopes appear to be more distinct in tributaries which is highly correlated with geographical features in general the enriched δd and δ 18o values were observed in tributaries with larger catchment area gentler slope and longer flow path along the mainstream δd and δ 18o values showed no significant enrichment in the high flow period it can be speculated that δd and δ 18o values of the mainstream water are mainly impacted by the mixing of multiple water sources including input from headwater area tributaries and other surface runoffs within the watershed the possible origin of river water can be explored by comparing the δd and δ 18o values of river water and precipitation based on the data from the iaea network http isohis iaea org and other monitoring studies chen et al 2016 the annual mean δd and δ 18o of precipitation in different stations within the wei river watershed are shown in table 4 xi an station is located in the central part of the guanzhong basin representing the local precipitation features of the mainstream of the wei river changwu station located in the loess plateau exhibited relatively enriched isotope values indicating the influence of secondary evaporation which is a specific phenomenon in the yellow river watershed sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 che et al 2019 huashan station located in the southern mountain area exhibited relatively depleted values indicating the elevation effect on precipitation the mean δd and δ 18o values of the mainstream were lower than those of the local precipitation in xi an station which can also be attributed to the elevation effect and amount effect the niaoshu mountain which is the source of the wei river is located west of the guanzhong basin and is the western part of the qinling mountains the altitude of the guanzhong basin is mainly below 500 m while the altitude of the niaoshu mountain area is above 2000 m as this survey was conducted in the wet season the depleted river water may be the result of heavy rainfall which is the major water source for the river vrzel et al 2018 have also reported similar findings on the isotopic relationship between river water and precipitation 5 discussion 5 1 sources of major ions from the hydrochemical perspective 5 1 1 human perturbations on river chemistry as guanzhong basin is dominated by agricultural land and is the economic center of the region the major human activities in this semi arid basin are agriculture and urbanization the no3 concentrations of the mainstream ranged from 219 to 1806 μmol l with a mean value of 400 μmol l which is much higher than that of other river systems upper reaches of the yellow river 54 μmol l yangtze river 4 95 μmol l and local rainwater 25 3 μmol l therefore in this study no3 in river water were considered to be originated from agricultural activities urban systems are commonly characterized by elevated tds and modified ionic compositions connor et al 2014 leaching of alkali from concrete drainage systems and other infrastructure would increase the na k cl contents in water rose 2007 for instance the ca2 mg2 na and so4 2 contents in water samples from urban areas were higher in the chattahoochee river by 3 4 times rose 2007 in this study the xp outlet zh and caoyun canal which are municipal wastewater draining channels presented high tds na cl and so4 2 concentrations the ratios of mg na ca na cl na so4 na and no3 na in the municipal wastewater samples were 0 12 0 18 0 12 0 41 0 61 0 66 0 1 0 23 and 0 05 0 14 respectively these ratios are consistent with the typical signature of municipal sewage components connor et al 2014 grosbois et al 2000 however the concentration of major ions in the mainstream in section m2 area did not present significant changes after the inputs of municipal wastewater for instance the tds of the xp outlet was 1088 mg l while 10 km downstream the tds of mainstream had recovered to 416 mg l the possible explanation of this is dilution effect of the mainstream as the amount of discharged wastewater was much smaller than that of the wei river the water quality in section m3 was markedly degraded with the mean tds increasing from 408 in section m2 to 625 mg l this discrepancy is likely to be attributed to human perturbations on the water quality to satisfy administrative demands such as ecological water supplement or artificial regulation with dam or sluice operation therefore human perturbations on mainstream water are overwhelmed by rock weathering and mixing processes during the high flow period furthermore previous studies zhang et al 2015 reported that the contribution of human activities in the yellow river watershed was extremely low 5 1 thus the influence of human activities on major ions was ignored in the following forward model calculation 5 1 2 influence of groundwater on river chemistry groundwater is a possible source of chemical elements in river water as shown in fig 2 the annual distribution of the wei river runoff is heavily dependent on precipitation as most of its flow is concentrated during the flood season from july to november this suggests that groundwater may not be a major contributor to river water at least in the high flow period on the other hand the concentrations of elements in groundwater were much higher than those of river water especially in the lower reaches if the groundwater with high solute concentration is a significant contribution of river water the river water chemistry would be altered substantially gupta et al 2011 however the variations of groundwater tds showed no coherence with that of river water this suggest that groundwater contribution to river water chemistry may not be large 5 1 3 chemical weathering sources as shown in the gibbs diagram fig 8 the key hydrochemical process controlling the chemistry of the wei river water is water rock interaction rock dominance the weight ratios of na na ca and cl cl hco3 ranged from 0 31 to 0 76 and from 0 07 to 0 41 respectively along with the enrichment of na and cl salinity slightly increased suggesting that river water is first influenced by ca rich water near the rock source towards na rich high salinity water low na na ca ratios commonly indicate the dominance of carbonates whereas high ratios suggest the dominance of evaporites or silicates marandi and shand 2018 the wei river water exhibited a wide range of na na ca at mid range tds levels most mainstream samples showed higher na na ca values than south bank tributaries in the upper reaches indicating the discrepancy of geological setting within the wei river watershed according to the geological setting and the gibbs diagram the weathering of evaporites carbonates and silicates may be speculated to be the main natural sources for the chemical constituents of the wei river the na cl ratio can be used to explore the source of sodium and chloride a value of unity suggests these ions originate from halite dissolution jia et al 2020 mthembu et al 2020 mthembu et al 2021 the na so4 ratio of mirabilite dissolution is 1 0 all the mainstream samples exhibited na cl ratio and na so4 ratios greater than 1 indicating that na originated not only from halite dissolution but also from silicates in addition the correlation coefficient between na and cl was high r 0 92 suggesting that halite dissolution may be the primary process evidence of evaporite weathering became more prominent in the middle and lower reaches where the major drainage area in the north bank is the clp cl is an inert and conservative tracer and can provide information on the hydrological cycle apart from mineral weathering chloride can also be enriched by evaporation the combination of hydrochemistry with isotope analysis can provide more precise information on chloride sources as show in fig 7b with the increase of chloride the δ 18o value of the mainstream samples did not show significant enrichment which further suggests that mineral dissolution is associated with the increase of chloride gypsum dissolution is a common source of so4 2 and would produce equivalent ca2 and so4 2 however the ca so4 plot fig 9c shows that ca2 and so4 2 did not exhibit a good correlation suggesting gypsum dissolution may not act as a controlling factor of ca2 and so4 2 the good correlation between so4 2 and na and cl suggests that mirabilite na2so4 10h2o may be an additional sulfate source ca2 mg2 and hco3 in water are commonly derived from the chemical weathering of carbonate minerals e g calcite and dolomite stoichiometric relations among these ions are used to reveal the possible reaction of minerals the possible governing weathering processes are as follows congruent calcite dissolution caco3 h2co3 ca2 2hco3 congruent dolomite dissolution camg co3 2h2co3 ca2 mg2 4hco3 incongruent dolomite dissolution camg co3 h2co3 caco3 mg2 2hco3 if all the ca2 originated from calcite dissolution the ratio of ca hco3 would be 1 1 if all the ca2 originated from congruent dolomite dissolution the ratio would be 1 2 in fig 9d most of the river water samples are located between the lines of 1 1 and 1 2 indicating integrated contribution of calcite and dolomite to river water the ratio of mg ca can be applied to further explore the relative contribution of calcite and dolomite the ratio of mg ca is 1 2 when equivalent molar masses of calcite and dolomite are dissolved congruently and it is 1 when only dolomite is dissolved congruently in fig 9e most samples are located between the lines of 1 1 and 1 2 indicating combined effect of dolomite and calcite as dolomite is mainly exposed along the north bank of the wei river this relation of major ions suggests that runoff from the north bank is likely the major contributor to the wei river water the mg hco3 ratio would be 1 2 if all the mg2 is derived from dolomite dissolution and 1 3 if it is derived from both calcite and dolomite dissolution as shown in fig 9f the mg hco3 ratio of most samples was greater than 1 2 according to the results of the correlation analysis mg2 did not show any significant correlation with hco3 but it was negatively correlated with ca2 r 0 41 p 0 001 the relationship between mg2 and so4 2 was the most significant r 0 78 p 0 001 this result is not consistent with other reports on the chemistry of the yellow river hua et al 2020 this can be attributed to incongruent dolomite and gypsum dissolution accompanied by calcite precipitation the mg hco3 ratios of north bank tributaries such as the jh and sch were higher than 1 2 reflecting the weathering characteristics of the north bank to some extent which is the possible source of mg2 in the mainstream of the wei river 5 2 contributions of various chemical weathering processes the foregoing discussion suggests that evaporite dissolution and carbonate weathering have significant influence on the chemistry of the mainstream the forward model was used to calculate the contribution of different sources for each element the following mass balance equations are assumed 1 cl river cl evap 2 k river k sili k agr 3 na river na evap na sili 4 ca river ca carb ca sili ca evap 5 mg river mg carb mg evap mg sili 6 s o 4 river s o 4 evap where x means concentration of major ions in mmol l evap refers to evaporite dissolution sili refers to silicate weathering carb refers to carbonate weathering agr refers to agriculture inputs 5 2 1 evaporite dissolution sea salt deposition is the main atmospheric source of dissolved substances in river water and the most affected element is cl the cl concentration of the wei river water ranged from 500 to 3900 μmol l and that of rainwater ranged from 7 2 to 27 9 μmol l wang et al 2019 xu et al 2009 revealing the negligible effect of rainwater therefore the atmospheric inputs of cl to river water were ignored in this research all the cl in river water was regarded to originate from halite dissolution most of the wei river watershed is covered by loess which contained varying evaporite minerals such as halite gypsum anhydrite and thenardite yokoo et al 2004 in the calculation cl was assumed to be derived from halite previous research suggested that na was from both halite and mirabilite xiao et al 2016 yokoo et al 2004 which was further supported by the stoichiometric relation among na cl and so4 2 in this study therefore na was assumed to be originated from halite and mirabilite dissolution so4 2 in river water was mainly from sulfate which would be slightly overestimated due to the ignorance of oxidation of pyrite xiao et al 2016 sulfate dissolution also provided ca2 and mg2 for the cations in river water wang 2014 the calculated results indicated that the proportion of cations derived from evaporite dissolution varied from 39 to 75 with a mean value of 57 for the mainstream spatially contributions from evaporite dissolution for the mainstream increased after the join of jh for tributaries the proportion of evaporite dissolution largely ranked in the order of north bank tributaries south bank tributaries the north bank tributaries were largely dominated by evaporite dissolution with the jh was the most influenced 5 2 2 silicate weathering silicate weathering can supply k na ca2 mg2 to river water for the basins where halite is the major contribution of evaporite nasilicate can be deduced by subtracting nahalite from nariver however in river basins such as yellow river watershed na is originated from not only halite but also soluble sulfate xiao et al 2016 it is hard to determine the contribution of na from sulfate therefore in this study the na from silicate weathering was firstly determined by the ksili nasili ratio of 0 515 wu et al 2008 k in river water mainly originated from silicate weathering with a small contribution from human activities k is generally less than 1 5 mg l in pristine waters but it ranged from 3 0 to 8 7 mg l in the wei river high k concentrations can be attributed to intensive agricultural cropland in the study area the typical signature of k from agricultural inputs is ana no3 k value of 5 zhang and wen 2009 casili and mgsili were determined by ca na sili and mg k sili ratios in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river the chemical composition of ca na sili and mg k sili in riverbed sediments were 0 31 and 0 73 respectively wu et al 2008 therefore ksili nasili casili mgsili can be determined by eq 7 10 7 k sili k river 1 5 n o 3 8 na sili k n a sili k sili 9 ca sili ca n a sili na sili 10 mg sili mg k sili k sili the calculated contribution of cations from silicate weathering was minor in the wei river watershed with the range of 0 4 9 for mainstream this is in agreement with the conclusions of gaillardet et al 1999 that the large rivers draining sedimentary basins are least influenced by silicate weathering such as the seine rhine n dvina and pechora rivers on the other hand contributions from silicate weathering was at a low level in high flow period of the yellow river according to the conclusion of zhang et al 2015 the contribution from silicate weathering ranged from 3 to 14 in north bank tributaries and 3 28 in south bank tributaries 5 2 3 carbonate weathering carbonate weathering is generally the major source of ca2 and mg2 in the river water zhang et al 1995 after the evaporite and silicate correction the rest of ca2 and mg2 were attributed to carbonate weathering the calculated contributions of cations from carbonate weathering ranged from 21 to 54 mean 37 for the mainstream water decreasing from upstream to downstream for tributaries this value varied from 18 to 66 for the yellow river watershed scale evaporite dissolution is the primary contribution of cations in the midstream region where the study area is located fan et al 2014 as shown in fig 10 chemical weathering in the wei river watershed is dominated by evaporite dissolution which is consistent with previous researches in the meanwhile difference among the three endmembers of evaporite silicate and carbonate still can be detected among different lithology units at the wei river scale in general variations of chemical weathering in tributaries are substantially consistent with geomorphic and hydrological controls north bank tributaries run through the extensive clp where loess and sedimentary rocks are exposed are mainly corresponded to the hco3 na type which is consistent with the dominant process of evaporite dissolution the south bank tributaries were hco3 ca type and largely affected by carbonate weathering although the south bank tributaries fh bh yh originated from the qinling mountains loess is the main lithology in the middle and lower reaches of these tributaries fig 3 thus the three south bank tributaries were most affected by evaporite dissolution and corresponded to hco3 na type 5 3 chemical weathering rate and co2 consumption atmospheric co2 consumption through silicate and carbonate weathering has an important effect on the global carbon cycle as huaxian station lies 40 km to the confluence with the yellow river and is free of backwater influences measurements at huaxian station represent the chemical weathering rate of the entire watershed the wei river accounts for about 16 6 huaxian station 68 6 108 m3 of the annual runoff of the yellow river tongguan station 414 2 108 m3 the silicate weathering rate swr and carbonate weathering rate cwr are calculated as follows swr k sili na sili ca sili mg sili q a cwr ca carb mg carb q a co2 consumed via chemical weathering can be calculated as follows ø c o 2 s i l i k sili na sili 2 ca sili 2 mg sili q a ø c o 2 c a r b ca carb mg carb q a where q is the runoff of the wei river at huaxian station m3 s a is the area of the entire wei river watershed km2 according to the calculated results the atmospheric co2 consumption attributable to silicate weathering and carbonate weathering were approximately 5 2 109 mol yr and 14 7 109 mol yr respectively carbonate weathering accounted for higher co2 consumption by approximately 3 times more than that by silicate weathering which is consistent with the extensive loess sediments within the watershed on a global scale carbonate weathering accounts for 12300 109 mol yr of atmospheric co2 consumption whereas silicate weathering accounts for 8700 109 mol yr from the global perspective the wei river has a very small contribution nevertheless the wei river 19 9 109 mol yr accounts for 32 5 of the total flux in the yellow river at tongguan 58 7 109 mol yr ran et al 2015 indicating its significance as a contributor to co2 consumption in the yellow river although the co2 consumption of the wei river is lower than that of the mainstream yellow river the wei river has a much higher co2 consumption rate normalized by discharge area which is consistent with the finding of zhang et al 1995 as shown in table 5 the co2 consumption rate attributable to silicate weathering is 0 49 105 mol km2 yr which is higher than that of the yellow river at tongguan 0 18 105 mol km2 yr reported by ran et al 2015 but similar to that reported by wang 2014 0 4 105 mol km2 yr the co2 consumption rate attributable to carbonate weathering is 1 38 105 mol km2 yr which is also higher than that of the mainstream yellow river reported by ran et al 2015 0 52 105 mol km2 yr and wang 2014 0 49 105 mol km2 yr in general the co2 consumption rate of the wei river was within the range of the yellow river basin co2 sili 0 21 0 9 105 mol km2 yr co2 carb 0 49 2 3 105 mol km2 yr this can be attributed to the discrepancy in the local lithology and climate and reflect the key effect of the loess plateau on a global scale limited by the climate and lithology the co2 consumption rate of the wei river is generally lower than that of major rivers in southern humid areas such as the yangtze river xijiang river and mekong river fig 11 5 4 uncertainty many factors such as lithology climate water discharge and physical erosion are likely to play a role in controlling chemical weathering and co2 consumption therefore there are considerable uncertainties in the calculation of chemical weathering rate and co2 consumption lithology is the first dominant factor affecting chemical denudation it is important to keep in mind that the chemical weathering rates of silicate or carbonate normalized by the total catchment area are underestimated because the actual surface area of any mineral is lower than the total catchment area a classical view is that runoff has a strong control on chemical weathering rate as loess is unconsolidated calcareous silt øco2carb and øco2sili have good linear correlation with water discharge in the semi arid loess plateau region zhang et al 2015 in general although ion concentrations would be diluted during the high flow period øco2carb and øco2sili present an increase with increased water discharge therefore the calculated chemical weathering and co2 consumption based on measurements during the high flow period are speculated to be a relative high level of the wei river apart from chemical denudation physical erosion is a predominant process within the wei river watershed ran et al 2015 the clp is characterized by strong physical erosion the ratio of physical erosion to chemical erosion is about 75 for the yellow river 2 5 for the yangtze river and 2 10 for other large world rivers chemical denudation and physical erosion are closely interrelated gu et al 2020 as chemical weathering is limited by the kinetics of chemical reactions intensive physical erosion may have negative effects on chemical weathering via the transport of the fresh materials and denudation of the regolith ran et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the relative contribution of the wei river to chemical weathering and co2 consumption and its significance for larger regions are substantially sensitive to the climatic conditions of the loess area zhang et al 2015 in this study the influence of groundwater and urbanization were ignored for the mainstream wei river the resultant uncertainty may be insignificant during the high flow period however in the low flow period during which runoff decreases sharply the influence of groundwater recharge and municipal wastewater release on river water chemistry may vary 6 conclusions in this study we present a new dataset of hydrochemistry and stable isotopes records of the wei river and its tributaries located in the middle reaches of the yellow river the newly calculated data complements existing records of chemical weathering in sedimentary basins in temperate and semiarid climate region distinct differences of hydrochemical features and isotope compositions were observed between north bank tributaries draining the clp and south bank tributaries draining the qinling mountains area indicating the control of geological setting on water chemistry element concentrations and stable isotopes were more enriched for the north bank tributaries compared with that of the south bank tributaries the contribution of precipitation to the river chemistry was limited while the rock weathering is the dominant process affecting major ions in the wei river the forward model is effective to estimate the contributions of different endmembers in this sub basin of the yellow river generally the dominant processes controlling river chemistry in the wei river watershed are evaporite dissolution and carbonate weathering which is consistent with previous reports carbonate weathering contributed more to co2 consumption by approximately 3 times that by silicate weathering on a large scale the wei river accounts for 32 7 of co2 consumption in the yellow river at tongguan indicating the significant contribution of the wei river for co2 consumption in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the wei river accounts for 32 4 of the total dissolved solids of the yellow river at tongguan station while the water discharge of the latter is about 6 times former the high concentrations of dissolved load relative to the limited water discharge of wei river imply intense chemical denudation in this area this may indicate that water management in the wei river watershed is not only focus on pollution control but also the soil erosion in the loess plateau considering the temporal variations in water discharge and chemistry further research with densely sampling in different climate conditions may effective to diminish discrepancies and uncertainties credit authorship contribution statement

4006,as the largest tributary of the yellow river the wei river drains a basin mainly comprising two different geological settings i e the chinese loess plateau clp in the north covered by quaternary loess and the qinling mountains area in the south exploring the influence of natural weathering processes and human activities on river chemistry has high significance in understanding chemical transport from the wei river to the yellow river the geochemical characteristics of the wei river mainstream and its tributaries as well as chemical weathering were determined using a geochemistry and isotope dataset of high spatial resolution the mainstream clearly exhibited a mixture of major elements and stable isotopes from tributaries on both the north and south banks with values within the range of those of the tributaries north bank tributaries draining thick loess deposits showed higher contents of major elements and the enrichment of stable isotopes reflecting the influence of geological setting on river chemistry the dominant processes accounting for the water chemistry of the mainstream are evaporite 39 75 and carbonate weathering 21 54 within the watershed evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering are higher in the northern clp area whereas carbonate weathering is higher in the southern qinling mountain area the co2 consumption by the wei river is 19 9 109 mol yr accounting for 32 5 of the total co2 consumption by the middle reaches of the yellow river during the high flow period the chemical weathering flux of the wei river was found to be within the range of northern rivers in china while the chemical weathering rate was relatively high in the semi arid region this suggests that chemical denudation is a significant factor for the river chemistry of the clp at least in the high flow period keywords chemical weathering stable isotope co2 consumption qinling mountains chinese loess plateau 1 introduction rivers are one of the driving forces of the transport of continental crustal materials to the ocean lerman and meybeck 1988 gaillardet et al 1999 accordingly geochemical research on river water can provide information on the pathways and flows of chemical elements in the terrestrial surface ocean system over the past decades the chemistry of large river systems has been extensively studied meybeck 1987 zhang et al 1995 roy et al 1999 chen et al 2002 chetelat et al 2008 gupta et al 2011 fan et al 2014 existing literature suggests that chemical elements in rivers are controlled by diverse processes such as physical and tectonic forces controlling landforms and geological setting horton et al 1999 torres et al 2015 chemical weathering processes that result in the dissolution of rock minerals climatic conditions that influence the chemical weathering rate smolders et al 2004 jin et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and human perturbations connor et al 2014 elumalai et al 2017a grosbois et al 2000 liu and han 2020 roy et al 1999 among which the lithology is commonly the dominant factor schopka et al 2011 however most related studies focused on silicate and carbonate weathering in large river basins and chemical weathering in loess areas has rarely been investigated fan et al 2014 ran et al 2015 xiao et al 2016 the chinese loess plateau clp is one of the most distinctive geomorphic units in the world with a total area of 640 000 km2 and is an important birthplace of chinese civilization li et al 2016 wang and yang 2018 the loess deposits in the clp is up to 250 m thick jin et al 2018 this area is also characterized by diverse landscapes including loess hills gullies tablelands and severe soil erosion 3180 t km2 yr of 2000 2008 reported by fu et al 2011 the climate of clp is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon with more than 70 of the annual precipitation concentrated during the summer monsoons between june to september liu et al 2017 coupled with long term human disturbances and its proneness to loess erosion the ecological environment of the clp is extremely fragile chen et al 2003 the yellow river is the crucial source of fresh water for all inhabitants of this area strongly affected by weathering and erosion the yellow river system has a very high dissolved load compared with those of other major world rivers zhang et al 1995 chen et al 2005 the tds of yellow river was 452 mg l reported by chen et al 2005 which was nearly four times the changjiang of 121 mg l chen et al 2002 ten times the amazon of 44 mg l more than four times the global discharge weighted average of 99 mg l gaillardet et al 1999 most studies on rivers focus on trace and pollutant elements which are very sensitive to anthropogenic activities and administration management especially in urbanized regions li et al 2013 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in contrast the composition of major elements is more closely related to the lithology and natural erosion over the drainage basin over the decades several studies have explored the chemistry of major elements in the yellow river and they suggest that the major process controlling the geochemistry of the mainstream yellow river and its major tributaries is chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks especially loess which is rich in carbonate minerals and evaporites chen et al 2005 ran et al 2015 these studies at the watershed scale provided a quantitative estimate of loess and granite weathering for example zhang et al 2015 reported that the average contribution of evaporite dissolution for the cations in high flow period was 50 4 20 9 21 0 for the yellow river middle reaches this value is consistent with the result of fan et al 2014 50 in principle hydrochemistry and isotope methods should be applicable for determining variations in river chemistry liu et al 2019 however this approach is limited by the temporal and spatial resolution of sampling for large river catchments variations in lithology climate and land use will lead to discrepancies in the understanding of the chemical weathering of specific local rivers zhang et al 2015 sampled the yellow river water at midstream weekly for a whole year and concluded that the averaging silicate weathering rate 351 6 157 9 353 1 mol km2 day and carbonate weathering rate 363 0 354 1 327 3 mol km2 day during storm events were higher than that of other period ran et al 2015 selected three hydrological stations located on different reaches of the yellow river with variations in lithology and water discharge and concluded that the weathering flux followed the order middle reaches carbonate weathering 4 66 mt yr silicate weathering 1 62 mt yr lower reaches carbonate weathering 4 63 mt yr silicate weathering 1 5 mt yr upper reaches carbonate weathering 2 24 mt yr silicate weathering 0 79 mt yr the drainage area of the wei river accounts for a majority of the clp as the largest tributary of the yellow river the wei river is expected to have a significant influence on the chemistry of the yellow river with different geological backgrounds on two banks i e the qinling mountain area in the south and the clp in the north the climate lithology and geography of the two areas are also quite different he et al 2009 wang et al 2013 considering this unique geological background the mechanism and extent of control of chemical weathering human perturbations and other potential factors on major ions in river water still need to be identified and explored this study conducted hydrochemistry and stable isotope measurements of the wei river and its tributaries with a high spatial resolution sampling interval 5 10 km oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were used to examine the relationship between atmospheric precipitation and river water aiming at exploring the origin of river water we present a complete record regarding the mainstream and its tributaries on both banks within the discharge basin i e guanzhong basin this approach provides an opportunity for understanding the perturbations of lithology geography and human activities on river chemistry with precise measurements and calculating weathering flux and co2 consumption in a typical discharge basin under semi arid climate conditions 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the wei river originates from niaoshushan mountain in the west flows a distance of 818 km eastward and drains into the yellow river at tongguan fig 1 this watershed lies between 103 5 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n covering a 13 48 104 km2 watershed zhang et al 2016 this catchment spans over 2500 m in elevation the development of the wei river system is affected by qinling latitudinal tectonic system in the south and qilv helan tectonic system in the north resulting in the asymmetric distribution of tributaries on both sides south bank tributaries originating from the qinling mountains are featured by short and rapid flow with low sand content north bank tributaries commonly flow a long distance through the loess plateau area chang et al 2016 with high sand content the loess plateau serves as the major sand source of the wei river the jinghe jh is the major tributary of the wei river and drains an area of 45421 km2 which accounts for 34 of the total area of the wei river watershed gao et al 2020a information on the major tributaries is displayed in table 1 the mainstream of the wei river is located towards the southern part of the watershed along the north slope of the qinling mountains this area has a semi arid continental monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of 12 14 c wu 2018 the mean annual precipitation is 505 718 mm increasing from northwest to south wu 2018 the wet season is usually from june to september with most rainfall events occurring simultaneously with high air temperature wang et al 2013 for the study year january 1 to december 31 2018 precipitation in the guanzhong basin was 548 9 mm with the highest value observed in july china meteorological administration http data cma cn affected by the seasonal distribution of precipitation runoff of the wei river exhibits a similar distribution fig 2 the high flow season commonly occurs from july to october with the highest runoff in july and low flow season occurs from january to march during the study year the wei river 68 59 109 m3 contributed 16 5 to the runoff of the yellow river at tongguan station 414 18 109 m3 according to the data provided by yellow river conservancy commission 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the headwater area of the wei river is mainly hilly terrain with an altitude of 1200 2500 m cenozoic mesozoic and paleozoic strata are well developed including pre sinian sinian cambrian ordovician silurian system devonian and cretaceous this area presents a diverse lithology including conglomerate feldspathic quartz sandstone mudstone schist gneiss and granite fig 3 from linjiacun to the confluence with the yellow river the wei river drains the loess plateau in the north altitude 900 2000 m alluvial and pluvial plain in the central area altitude 800 m and the qinling mountains areas in the south altitude 2000 m the loess plateau is mainly covered by quaternary loess cenozoic and mesozoic clastic rocks are distributed along river valleys with the lithology of conglomerate sandstone marlstone and shale a set of paleozoic cambrian and ordovician strata dominated by dolomite and limestone is distributed along the south edge of the loess plateau in this research the alluvial and pluvial plain of the middle and lower reaches of wei river known as the guanzhong basin was taken as the primary study area this basin is the socioeconomic center of the wei river watershed chen et al 2021 geologically the guanzhong basin is a cenozoic fault depression basin covered by thick quaternary sediments gao et al 2020b the wei river and its tributaries have shaped multistage terraces composed of sand and gravel the terrace of the wei river is narrow in the upstream and gradually widens from the midstream the lithology of the alluvial plain comprises interbedded layers of alluvial sand sand gravel and silty clay from the middle pleistocene to holocene and the upper part of the high terrace is covered by aeolian loess in the northeast of the basin the alluvial plain is underlain by lacustrine strata which are rich in gypsum and mirabilite producing a brackish paleogeographic environment the southern qinling mountains area is dominated by granite gneiss and schist 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources the

collection and analysis to investigate spatial changes in river water chemistry during the high flow period water samples were collected in august 2018 during which no rainfall event was encountered the mainstream was sampled every 5 10 km the mainstream was sampled every 5 10 km tributary samples were collected at the mouth of tributary and guaranteed not to be affected by backwater of the mainstream all the river water samples were sampled at a depth of 0 5 m below the surface ec ph and temperature were measured using a portable meter aquaread ap 700 in situ the location of each sampling site was recorded with a portable gps suspended particulate matter were removed using 0 45 µm filters the samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 then transferred to 500 ml pre cleaned polyethylene bottles samples for anion analysis were transferred to 500 ml pre cleaned polyethylene bottles without acidification samples for isotope analysis were transferred into 50 ml glass bottles laboratory analysis was conducted at the water and soil testing center of the shaanxi institute of engineering prospecting siep using approved standard testing methods gb t 5750 2006 within 3 days chemical analysis of major ions ca2 mg2 and so4 2 were carried out via edta 2na titration with a detection limit of 1 0 mg l k and na were analyzed via flame atomic absorption spectrometry with detection limits of 0 05 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively hco3 was measured using the titrimetric method with a detection limit of 1 0 mg l cl was measured via silver nitrate titration with a detection

samples were 5 indicating the reliability of the water quality analysis results hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in h2o were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer iwa 35 ep with analytical precision values of 0 6 and 0 2 for δ 2h and δ 18o respectively 3 3 statistics analysis the spearman correlation coefficient is a widely used non parametric measure to explore the relationship between variables wunderlin et al 2001 elumalai et al 2017b this method is applicable for data with non normal distribution bouza deaño et al 2008 the significance level of 0 05 is the commonly used criterion for interpreting the statistical significance of the computed correlation coefficient popugaeva et al 2019 in this study the spearman correlation coefficient was computed using spss ibm spss statistics 25 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical signatures 4 1 1 mainstream table 2 presents the chemical compositions of river water samples for the total mainstream samples the ph values ranged from 7 8 to 8 5 with a mean of 8 2 the total dissolved solids tds of the wei river mainstream ranged from 316 to 780 mg l with a mean value of 494 mg l which was close to that of the yellow river 557 mg l but much higher those of the yangtze river 268 68 mg l as reported by luo 2015 and world rivers gaillardet et al 1999 the lowest value 316 mg l was observed at the site after the confluence with the shitouhe sth as shown in fig 4 according to the spatial variations in chemistry the mainstream was divided into four sections i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 fig 4 in general the tds and major ion concentrations of the mainstream decreased slightly along the m1 and m2 the section m1 from linjiacun to xianyang is the major headwater area where the load on water quality posed by human activities is relatively weak the section m2 is the most populated region of the wei river watershed it is noticeable that the main urban area did not significantly affect the mainstream water chemistry in section m3 the tds increased markedly with a range of 508 780 mg l simultaneously with na cl and so4 2 suggesting possible contributions from evaporite weathering and human inputs in section m4 the tds values slightly decreased due to self purification among the solutes ca2 showed the least pronounced changes which can be attributed to the regulation of carbonate dissolution or precipitation chen et al 2020 the dominant cations in most river water samples were ca2 and na and the primary anions were hco3 and so4 2 cation abundance followed the order ca na mg k in section m1 and na ca mg k in section m2 from section m3 na and mg2 began to increase in the mainstream the abundance of anion followed the order hco3 so4 cl no3 the hydrochemical types of the mainstream water did not present major variation as shown in the piper diagram fig 5 the major ions in the mainstream water samples are concentrated in a narrow area 4 1 2 tributaries there are several tributaries drain into the wei river controlled by hydrological and geographical setting tributaries on the two sides show different hydrochemical features in general the tds values increase towards downstream and are higher in north bank tributaries the maximum tds value was observed in jinghe jh 1056 0 mg l which was six times the minimum tds 176 0 mg l measured at heihe hh in the south bank in the north bank tributaries na was the dominant cation and hco3 and so4 2 were the dominant anions representing hco3 na and hco3 so4 na types as the largest tributary the chemical facies of jh was so4 cl na type suggesting that it may contribute abundant na cl and so4 2 to the wei river the south bank tributaries sth tangyuhe tyh and hh in the upper reaches were hco3 ca type tributaries flowing through sections m2 and m3 were significantly enriched in na so4 2 and cl resulting in complex chemical facies including the hco3 so4 ca na hco3 cl na ca and so4 hco3 mg ca types 4 1 3 groundwater the analysis and interpretation of hydrochemical features of groundwater samples which are adjacent 5 km to the mainstream would provide useful information for identifying potential relationships between groundwater and river water the groundwater data were cited from gao 2020 comparing the samples dissolved salts in groundwater exhibited higher spatial variability throughout the watershed the mean tds values of groundwater corresponding to four sections of the mainstream along the north bank were 704 3 831 5 835 0 and 1016 7 mg l respectively while those along the south bank were 473 7 587 9 721 0 and 773 0 mg l the concentration of major ions in groundwater along the north bank were generally higher than that along the south bank which is consistent with the variations in tributaries in general the hydrochemical signatures of groundwater and river water chemistry show a clear response to the regional geological and hydrogeological setting 4 1 4 precipitation chemical data of precipitation shown in table 3 were compiled from the literature xu et al 2009 wang et al 2019 most previous research on the chinese loess plateau focused on the relationship of precipitation with runoff soil water and vegetation research on precipitation chemistry mainly considered urban areas in the guanzhong basin table 3 presents the chemical compositions of precipitation at lanzhou located west of the wei river watershed and xi an station which is located in the central area of the guanzhong basin compared with river water the concentrations of chemical elements in precipitation were much lower accordingly it can be hypothesized that atmospheric source salts are not a major contributor to major ions in the wei river 4 2 multivariate statistics as shown in the spearman correlation matrix fig 6 tds has strong positive correlations with na r 0 9 p 0 001 cl r 0 86 p 0 001 and so4 2 r 0 83 p 0 001 and moderate correlation with mg2 r 0 69 p 0 001 indicating that these ions are the primary contributors to the total dissolved salts of the wei river the correlation coefficients were 0 92 for na and cl and 0 87 for na and so4 2 na was also significantly correlated with sio2 r 0 39 p 0 001 the relationship between na and these ions indicates multiple sources of sodium such as evaporite weathering halite and sulfate and silicate weathering cl also showed strong correlation with so4 2 r 0 81 p 0 001 ca2 exhibited negative correlations with other major ions including na r 0 43 p 0 001 mg2 r 0 41 p 0 001 cl r 0 39 p 0 001 and so4 2 r 0 48 p 0 001 but a positive correlation with hco3 r 0 38 p 0 001 indicating that ca2 is mainly attributable to carbonate dissolution and is insensitive to pollution due to low variability within the watershed the correlations of no3 with other ions were insignificant positive correlations were found among sio2 and na k and hco3 which imply silicate weathering source for the river chemistry 4 3 dual stable isotope signatures fig 7a presents dual stable isotope signatures showing the δd and δ 18o values of the wei river precipitation and the local meteoric water line lmwl the δd and δ 18o values of the mainstream water fluctuated from 64 3 to 57 9 mean 60 9 and from 9 4 to 8 4 mean 8 7 respectively most of the mainstream samples scatter to the right of the lmwl with a slope of 3 0 δd 3 0 δ 18o 34 6 r 0 53 indicating evaporation during the transit from precipitation to river flow pang et al 2017 qian et al 2014 in the wet season the slope of the regression line of the mainstream of the wei river was lower than that of the yellow river δd 4 71 δ 18o 22 64 reported by su et al 2003 indicating more intensive evaporation in the study area compared with the δd and δ 18o values of mainstream 60 9 8 7 the north bank tributaries exhibited slightly enriched values 59 1 8 3 whereas the major south bank tributaries showed depleted values 64 4 and 9 4 variations in stable isotopes appear to be more distinct in tributaries which is highly correlated with geographical features in general the enriched δd and δ 18o values were observed in tributaries with larger catchment area gentler slope and longer flow path along the mainstream δd and δ 18o values showed no significant enrichment in the high flow period it can be speculated that δd and δ 18o values of the mainstream water are mainly impacted by the mixing of multiple water sources including input from headwater area tributaries and other surface runoffs within the watershed the possible origin of river water can be explored by comparing the δd and δ 18o values of river water and precipitation based on the data from the iaea network http isohis iaea org and other monitoring studies chen et al 2016 the annual mean δd and δ 18o of precipitation in different stations within the wei river watershed are shown in table 4 xi an station is located in the central part of the guanzhong basin representing the local precipitation features of the mainstream of the wei river changwu station located in the loess plateau exhibited relatively enriched isotope values indicating the influence of secondary evaporation which is a specific phenomenon in the yellow river watershed sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 che et al 2019 huashan station located in the southern mountain area exhibited relatively depleted values indicating the elevation effect on precipitation the mean δd and δ 18o values of the mainstream were lower than those of the local precipitation in xi an station which can also be attributed to the elevation effect and amount effect the niaoshu mountain which is the source of the wei river is located west of the guanzhong basin and is the western part of the qinling mountains the altitude of the guanzhong basin is mainly below 500 m while the altitude of the niaoshu mountain area is above 2000 m as this survey was conducted in the wet season the depleted river water may be the result of heavy rainfall which is the major water source for the river vrzel et al 2018 have also reported similar findings on the isotopic relationship between river water and precipitation 5 discussion 5 1 sources of major ions from the hydrochemical perspective 5 1 1 human perturbations on river chemistry as guanzhong basin is dominated by agricultural land and is the economic center of the region the major human activities in this semi arid basin are agriculture and urbanization the no3 concentrations of the mainstream ranged from 219 to 1806 μmol l with a mean value of 400 μmol l which is much higher than that of other river systems upper reaches of the yellow river 54 μmol l yangtze river 4 95 μmol l and local rainwater 25 3 μmol l therefore in this study no3 in river water were considered to be originated from agricultural activities urban systems are commonly characterized by elevated tds and modified ionic compositions connor et al 2014 leaching of alkali from concrete drainage systems and other infrastructure would increase the na k cl contents in water rose 2007 for instance the ca2 mg2 na and so4 2 contents in water samples from urban areas were higher in the chattahoochee river by 3 4 times rose 2007 in this study the xp outlet zh and caoyun canal which are municipal wastewater draining channels presented high tds na cl and so4 2 concentrations the ratios of mg na ca na cl na so4 na and no3 na in the municipal wastewater samples were 0 12 0 18 0 12 0 41 0 61 0 66 0 1 0 23 and 0 05 0 14 respectively these ratios are consistent with the typical signature of municipal sewage components connor et al 2014 grosbois et al 2000 however the concentration of major ions in the mainstream in section m2 area did not present significant changes after the inputs of municipal wastewater for instance the tds of the xp outlet was 1088 mg l while 10 km downstream the tds of mainstream had recovered to 416 mg l the possible explanation of this is dilution effect of the mainstream as the amount of discharged wastewater was much smaller than that of the wei river the water quality in section m3 was markedly degraded with the mean tds increasing from 408 in section m2 to 625 mg l this discrepancy is likely to be attributed to human perturbations on the water quality to satisfy administrative demands such as ecological water supplement or artificial regulation with dam or sluice operation therefore human perturbations on mainstream water are overwhelmed by rock weathering and mixing processes during the high flow period furthermore previous studies zhang et al 2015 reported that the contribution of human activities in the yellow river watershed was extremely low 5 1 thus the influence of human activities on major ions was ignored in the following forward model calculation 5 1 2 influence of groundwater on river chemistry groundwater is a possible source of chemical elements in river water as shown in fig 2 the annual distribution of the wei river runoff is heavily dependent on precipitation as most of its flow is concentrated during the flood season from july to november this suggests that groundwater may not be a major contributor to river water at least in the high flow period on the other hand the concentrations of elements in groundwater were much higher than those of river water especially in the lower reaches if the groundwater with high solute concentration is a significant contribution of river water the river water chemistry would be altered substantially gupta et al 2011 however the variations of groundwater tds showed no coherence with that of river water this suggest that groundwater contribution to river water chemistry may not be large 5 1 3 chemical weathering sources as shown in the gibbs diagram fig 8 the key hydrochemical process controlling the chemistry of the wei river water is water rock interaction rock dominance the weight ratios of na na ca and cl cl hco3 ranged from 0 31 to 0 76 and from 0 07 to 0 41 respectively along with the enrichment of na and cl salinity slightly increased suggesting that river water is first influenced by ca rich water near the rock source towards na rich high salinity water low na na ca ratios commonly indicate the dominance of carbonates whereas high ratios suggest the dominance of evaporites or silicates marandi and shand 2018 the wei river water exhibited a wide range of na na ca at mid range tds levels most mainstream samples showed higher na na ca values than south bank tributaries in the upper reaches indicating the discrepancy of geological setting within the wei river watershed according to the geological setting and the gibbs diagram the weathering of evaporites carbonates and silicates may be speculated to be the main natural sources for the chemical constituents of the wei river the na cl ratio can be used to explore the source of sodium and chloride a value of unity suggests these ions originate from halite dissolution jia et al 2020 mthembu et al 2020 mthembu et al 2021 the na so4 ratio of mirabilite dissolution is 1 0 all the mainstream samples exhibited na cl ratio and na so4 ratios greater than 1 indicating that na originated not only from halite dissolution but also from silicates in addition the correlation coefficient between na and cl was high r 0 92 suggesting that halite dissolution may be the primary process evidence of evaporite weathering became more prominent in the middle and lower reaches where the major drainage area in the north bank is the clp cl is an inert and conservative tracer and can provide information on the hydrological cycle apart from mineral weathering chloride can also be enriched by evaporation the combination of hydrochemistry with isotope analysis can provide more precise information on chloride sources as show in fig 7b with the increase of chloride the δ 18o value of the mainstream samples did not show significant enrichment which further suggests that mineral dissolution is associated with the increase of chloride gypsum dissolution is a common source of so4 2 and would produce equivalent ca2 and so4 2 however the ca so4 plot fig 9c shows that ca2 and so4 2 did not exhibit a good correlation suggesting gypsum dissolution may not act as a controlling factor of ca2 and so4 2 the good correlation between so4 2 and na and cl suggests that mirabilite na2so4 10h2o may be an additional sulfate source ca2 mg2 and hco3 in water are commonly derived from the chemical weathering of carbonate minerals e g calcite and dolomite stoichiometric relations among these ions are used to reveal the possible reaction of minerals the possible governing weathering processes are as follows congruent calcite dissolution caco3 h2co3 ca2 2hco3 congruent dolomite dissolution camg co3 2h2co3 ca2 mg2 4hco3 incongruent dolomite dissolution camg co3 h2co3 caco3 mg2 2hco3 if all the ca2 originated from calcite dissolution the ratio of ca hco3 would be 1 1 if all the ca2 originated from congruent dolomite dissolution the ratio would be 1 2 in fig 9d most of the river water samples are located between the lines of 1 1 and 1 2 indicating integrated contribution of calcite and dolomite to river water the ratio of mg ca can be applied to further explore the relative contribution of calcite and dolomite the ratio of mg ca is 1 2 when equivalent molar masses of calcite and dolomite are dissolved congruently and it is 1 when only dolomite is dissolved congruently in fig 9e most samples are located between the lines of 1 1 and 1 2 indicating combined effect of dolomite and calcite as dolomite is mainly exposed along the north bank of the wei river this relation of major ions suggests that runoff from the north bank is likely the major contributor to the wei river water the mg hco3 ratio would be 1 2 if all the mg2 is derived from dolomite dissolution and 1 3 if it is derived from both calcite and dolomite dissolution as shown in fig 9f the mg hco3 ratio of most samples was greater than 1 2 according to the results of the correlation analysis mg2 did not show any significant correlation with hco3 but it was negatively correlated with ca2 r 0 41 p 0 001 the relationship between mg2 and so4 2 was the most significant r 0 78 p 0 001 this result is not consistent with other reports on the chemistry of the yellow river hua et al 2020 this can be attributed to incongruent dolomite and gypsum dissolution accompanied by calcite precipitation the mg hco3 ratios of north bank tributaries such as the jh and sch were higher than 1 2 reflecting the weathering characteristics of the north bank to some extent which is the possible source of mg2 in the mainstream of the wei river 5 2 contributions of various chemical weathering processes the foregoing discussion suggests that evaporite dissolution and carbonate weathering have significant influence on the chemistry of the mainstream the forward model was used to calculate the contribution of different sources for each element the following mass balance equations are assumed 1 cl river cl evap 2 k river k sili k agr 3 na river na evap na sili 4 ca river ca carb ca sili ca evap 5 mg river mg carb mg evap mg sili 6 s o 4 river s o 4 evap where x means concentration of major ions in mmol l evap refers to evaporite dissolution sili refers to silicate weathering carb refers to carbonate weathering agr refers to agriculture inputs 5 2 1 evaporite dissolution sea salt deposition is the main atmospheric source of dissolved substances in river water and the most affected element is cl the cl concentration of the wei river water ranged from 500 to 3900 μmol l and that of rainwater ranged from 7 2 to 27 9 μmol l wang et al 2019 xu et al 2009 revealing the negligible effect of rainwater therefore the atmospheric inputs of cl to river water were ignored in this research all the cl in river water was regarded to originate from halite dissolution most of the wei river watershed is covered by loess which contained varying evaporite minerals such as halite gypsum anhydrite and thenardite yokoo et al 2004 in the calculation cl was assumed to be derived from halite previous research suggested that na was from both halite and mirabilite xiao et al 2016 yokoo et al 2004 which was further supported by the stoichiometric relation among na cl and so4 2 in this study therefore na was assumed to be originated from halite and mirabilite dissolution so4 2 in river water was mainly from sulfate which would be slightly overestimated due to the ignorance of oxidation of pyrite xiao et al 2016 sulfate dissolution also provided ca2 and mg2 for the cations in river water wang 2014 the calculated results indicated that the proportion of cations derived from evaporite dissolution varied from 39 to 75 with a mean value of 57 for the mainstream spatially contributions from evaporite dissolution for the mainstream increased after the join of jh for tributaries the proportion of evaporite dissolution largely ranked in the order of north bank tributaries south bank tributaries the north bank tributaries were largely dominated by evaporite dissolution with the jh was the most influenced 5 2 2 silicate weathering silicate weathering can supply k na ca2 mg2 to river water for the basins where halite is the major contribution of evaporite nasilicate can be deduced by subtracting nahalite from nariver however in river basins such as yellow river watershed na is originated from not only halite but also soluble sulfate xiao et al 2016 it is hard to determine the contribution of na from sulfate therefore in this study the na from silicate weathering was firstly determined by the ksili nasili ratio of 0 515 wu et al 2008 k in river water mainly originated from silicate weathering with a small contribution from human activities k is generally less than 1 5 mg l in pristine waters but it ranged from 3 0 to 8 7 mg l in the wei river high k concentrations can be attributed to intensive agricultural cropland in the study area the typical signature of k from agricultural inputs is ana no3 k value of 5 zhang and wen 2009 casili and mgsili were determined by ca na sili and mg k sili ratios in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river the chemical composition of ca na sili and mg k sili in riverbed sediments were 0 31 and 0 73 respectively wu et al 2008 therefore ksili nasili casili mgsili can be determined by eq 7 10 7 k sili k river 1 5 n o 3 8 na sili k n a sili k sili 9 ca sili ca n a sili na sili 10 mg sili mg k sili k sili the calculated contribution of cations from silicate weathering was minor in the wei river watershed with the range of 0 4 9 for mainstream this is in agreement with the conclusions of gaillardet et al 1999 that the large rivers draining sedimentary basins are least influenced by silicate weathering such as the seine rhine n dvina and pechora rivers on the other hand contributions from silicate weathering was at a low level in high flow period of the yellow river according to the conclusion of zhang et al 2015 the contribution from silicate weathering ranged from 3 to 14 in north bank tributaries and 3 28 in south bank tributaries 5 2 3 carbonate weathering carbonate weathering is generally the major source of ca2 and mg2 in the river water zhang et al 1995 after the evaporite and silicate correction the rest of ca2 and mg2 were attributed to carbonate weathering the calculated contributions of cations from carbonate weathering ranged from 21 to 54 mean 37 for the mainstream water decreasing from upstream to downstream for tributaries this value varied from 18 to 66 for the yellow river watershed scale evaporite dissolution is the primary contribution of cations in the midstream region where the study area is located fan et al 2014 as shown in fig 10 chemical weathering in the wei river watershed is dominated by evaporite dissolution which is consistent with previous researches in the meanwhile difference among the three endmembers of evaporite silicate and carbonate still can be detected among different lithology units at the wei river scale in general variations of chemical weathering in tributaries are substantially consistent with geomorphic and hydrological controls north bank tributaries run through the extensive clp where loess and sedimentary rocks are exposed are mainly corresponded to the hco3 na type which is consistent with the dominant process of evaporite dissolution the south bank tributaries were hco3 ca type and largely affected by carbonate weathering although the south bank tributaries fh bh yh originated from the qinling mountains loess is the main lithology in the middle and lower reaches of these tributaries fig 3 thus the three south bank tributaries were most affected by evaporite dissolution and corresponded to hco3 na type 5 3 chemical weathering rate and co2 consumption atmospheric co2 consumption through silicate and carbonate weathering has an important effect on the global carbon cycle as huaxian station lies 40 km to the confluence with the yellow river and is free of backwater influences measurements at huaxian station represent the chemical weathering rate of the entire watershed the wei river accounts for about 16 6 huaxian station 68 6 108 m3 of the annual runoff of the yellow river tongguan station 414 2 108 m3 the silicate weathering rate swr and carbonate weathering rate cwr are calculated as follows swr k sili na sili ca sili mg sili q a cwr ca carb mg carb q a co2 consumed via chemical weathering can be calculated as follows ø c o 2 s i l i k sili na sili 2 ca sili 2 mg sili q a ø c o 2 c a r b ca carb mg carb q a where q is the runoff of the wei river at huaxian station m3 s a is the area of the entire wei river watershed km2 according to the calculated results the atmospheric co2 consumption attributable to silicate weathering and carbonate weathering were approximately 5 2 109 mol yr and 14 7 109 mol yr respectively carbonate weathering accounted for higher co2 consumption by approximately 3 times more than that by silicate weathering which is consistent with the extensive loess sediments within the watershed on a global scale carbonate weathering accounts for 12300 109 mol yr of atmospheric co2 consumption whereas silicate weathering accounts for 8700 109 mol yr from the global perspective the wei river has a very small contribution nevertheless the wei river 19 9 109 mol yr accounts for 32 5 of the total flux in the yellow river at tongguan 58 7 109 mol yr ran et al 2015 indicating its significance as a contributor to co2 consumption in the yellow river although the co2 consumption of the wei river is lower than that of the mainstream yellow river the wei river has a much higher co2 consumption rate normalized by discharge area which is consistent with the finding of zhang et al 1995 as shown in table 5 the co2 consumption rate attributable to silicate weathering is 0 49 105 mol km2 yr which is higher than that of the yellow river at tongguan 0 18 105 mol km2 yr reported by ran et al 2015 but similar to that reported by wang 2014 0 4 105 mol km2 yr the co2 consumption rate attributable to carbonate weathering is 1 38 105 mol km2 yr which is also higher than that of the mainstream yellow river reported by ran et al 2015 0 52 105 mol km2 yr and wang 2014 0 49 105 mol km2 yr in general the co2 consumption rate of the wei river was within the range of the yellow river basin co2 sili 0 21 0 9 105 mol km2 yr co2 carb 0 49 2 3 105 mol km2 yr this can be attributed to the discrepancy in the local lithology and climate and reflect the key effect of the loess plateau on a global scale limited by the climate and lithology the co2 consumption rate of the wei river is generally lower than that of major rivers in southern humid areas such as the yangtze river xijiang river and mekong river fig 11 5 4 uncertainty many factors such as lithology climate water discharge and physical erosion are likely to play a role in controlling chemical weathering and co2 consumption therefore there are considerable uncertainties in the calculation of chemical weathering rate and co2 consumption lithology is the first dominant factor affecting chemical denudation it is important to keep in mind that the chemical weathering rates of silicate or carbonate normalized by the total catchment area are underestimated because the actual surface area of any mineral is lower than the total catchment area a classical view is that runoff has a strong control on chemical weathering rate as loess is unconsolidated calcareous silt øco2carb and øco2sili have good linear correlation with water discharge in the semi arid loess plateau region zhang et al 2015 in general although ion concentrations would be diluted during the high flow period øco2carb and øco2sili present an increase with increased water discharge therefore the calculated chemical weathering and co2 consumption based on measurements during the high flow period are speculated to be a relative high level of the wei river apart from chemical denudation physical erosion is a predominant process within the wei river watershed ran et al 2015 the clp is characterized by strong physical erosion the ratio of physical erosion to chemical erosion is about 75 for the yellow river 2 5 for the yangtze river and 2 10 for other large world rivers chemical denudation and physical erosion are closely interrelated gu et al 2020 as chemical weathering is limited by the kinetics of chemical reactions intensive physical erosion may have negative effects on chemical weathering via the transport of the fresh materials and denudation of the regolith ran et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the relative contribution of the wei river to chemical weathering and co2 consumption and its significance for larger regions are substantially sensitive to the climatic conditions of the loess area zhang et al 2015 in this study the influence of groundwater and urbanization were ignored for the mainstream wei river the resultant uncertainty may be insignificant during the high flow period however in the low flow period during which runoff decreases sharply the influence of groundwater recharge and municipal wastewater release on river water chemistry may vary 6 conclusions in this study we present a new dataset of hydrochemistry and stable isotopes records of the wei river and its tributaries located in the middle reaches of the yellow river the newly calculated data complements existing records of chemical weathering in sedimentary basins in temperate and semiarid climate region distinct differences of hydrochemical features and isotope compositions were observed between north bank tributaries draining the clp and south bank tributaries draining the qinling mountains area indicating the control of geological setting on water chemistry element concentrations and stable isotopes were more enriched for the north bank tributaries compared with that of the south bank tributaries the contribution of precipitation to the river chemistry was limited while the rock weathering is the dominant process affecting major ions in the wei river the forward model is effective to estimate the contributions of different endmembers in this sub basin of the yellow river generally the dominant processes controlling river chemistry in the wei river watershed are evaporite dissolution and carbonate weathering which is consistent with previous reports carbonate weathering contributed more to co2 consumption by approximately 3 times that by silicate weathering on a large scale the wei river accounts for 32 7 of co2 consumption in the yellow river at tongguan indicating the significant contribution of the wei river for co2 consumption in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the wei river accounts for 32 4 of the total dissolved solids of the yellow river at tongguan station while the water discharge of the latter is about 6 times former the high concentrations of dissolved load relative to the limited water discharge of wei river imply intense chemical denudation in this

4007,modeling the washoff of pollutants from urban catchments is a difficult task although the exponential washoff model has been in use for decades there is a general lack of data on model parameters and much less is known about how the model parameters are influenced by storm and climate characteristics this study was done to understand how model parameters vary between different catchments having vastly different rainfall characteristics such a study will elucidate model response to rainfall which in turn provides better knowledge on model function high quality rainfall runoff and water quality data for a total of 117 storm events were sourced from the literature which included 48 storm events from temperate bellevue washington us dublin ireland and 69 storm events from tropical skudai malaysia singapore pampano beach florida us catchments respectively all the data were sourced from catchments with residential land use this dataset was supplemented by additional measurements done in two residential catchments in geelong temperate where a total of 16 storm events were monitored monte carlo analysis was used to obtain the best fit values of the washoff model parameters consisting the washoff coefficient c3 washoff exponent c4 and the initial mass on surface bin it was found that the spread of these parameter values was greater for the dissolved pollutants ortho phosphate op and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n than for total suspended solids tss there are strong suggestions that bin represents the mass available on the surface at the start of a washoff event as evidenced by observations that bin is significantly higher for the tropical dataset a reflection of the greater storm energy associated with tropical rainfall the small variation in c4 across all temperate and tropical sites is related to its dependence on local flow conditions linked with the friction velocity and critical shear stress conditions the parameters c3 and bin on the other hand are correlated with rainfall with c3 having a larger uncertainty of all the rainfall characteristics investigated the rainfall depth for the current event d was found to be the single parameter that correlated well with bin and c3 for tss the strength of this dependence diminished for pollutants in mixed and dissolved forms in temperate regions bin correlates strongly with both the average and maximum intensities whereas in tropical catchments maximum intensity and depth were found to be significant this correlation for the temperate catchments can be understood by the dependence of rainfall energy on intensity rainfall energy ceases to increase once intensity exceeds 3 in hr 76 2 mm hr which is uncommon in temperate catchments but is common in the tropics keywords washoff parameters rainfall characteristics parameter sensitivity correlation pollutant types 1 introduction urban runoff has been identified as the largest non point source for contaminants entering waterways the increased impact of urban runoff on surface water quality has necessitated improved modeling of stormwater pollution stormwater runoff models for flow prediction have been well researched and are supported by a large amount of field data resulting in a high benchmark for accuracy in urban runoff prediction imteaz et al 2013 the modeling of stormwater quality is relatively less well understood with a vast number of complex interrelated processes influencing urban stormwater quality may and sivakumar 2009 besides the complexity of these models the accuracy of model predictions depends on other factors such as the amount of data available proper selection of input parameters associated with the model and their related uncertainties and the quality of the data used most stormwater quality models for urban catchments in existence today depend upon two key processes i e buildup and washoff in the traditional application of buildup and washoff models the initial mass on the surface is taken to be the sum of pollutant buildup and the remaining mass from the previous event charbeneau and barrett 1998 however this approach may be too simplistic and alternative interpretations have been proposed recently it has been suggested that buildup reflects the limiting value of the observed mass that can be washed off during an event gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 some studies even questioned the need for buildup modeling in the simulation of washoff load shaw et al 2010 showed that the washoff model gave the same result whether using a constant mass available or a buildup model a similar conclusion was reached by egodawatta et al 2007 in their study washoff removed only a portion of the total mass on a surface and even when the washoff load approached a maximum this maximum was smaller than the total loading that was present before the rainfall event this ambiguity with buildup modeling indicates that washoff may not be significantly influenced by the total mass on surface but rather depends on the potential or the available mass for washoff which comprises only a portion of the total mass on the surface pitt et al 2005 since the 1980s studies on urban stormwater quality modeling have applied washoff functions to predict stormwater pollutant loads most of the work has focused on determining appropriate values of model parameters jewell and adrian 1982 ball et al 1998 deletic and maksimovic 1998 tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 kim et al 2006 part of the difficulty in identifying a correct model parameter value has to do with the fact that there is little understanding of what the model parameters represent physically as such the models behave very much as a black box with little physical interpretation attached to the model parameters therefore not only is the accurate quantification of model parameter values necessary but also having an understanding of the physical meaning of each of the model parameters model parameter values are usually estimated from field sampling studies often done for a pre defined land use sartor and boyd 1972 egodawatta et al 2007 or catchment alley and smith 1981 chow et al 2012 le et al 2017 gaut et al 2019 several studies baffaut and delleur 1990 chen and adams 2006 have found that the model parameters vary not only from catchment to catchment but also between rainfall events hence attention has been given to characteristic features governing the washoff process including rainfall rate sartor boyd 1972 brodie 2007 rainfall depth chiew mcmahon 1999 runoff rate huber et al 1988 runoff volume characklis et al 1979 barbé et al 1996 shear stress nakamura 1984 akan 1987 deletic 2001 raindrop energy sartor et al 1974 price mance 1978 moss et al 1979 coleman 1993 and other factors such as available mass on the surface and street surface and particulate characteristics sartor et al 1974 pitt et al 2005 the breadth of studies conducted gives an indication of the difficulties related to washoff modeling which is a complicated function of a number of factors including antecedent dry period and particle and rainfall characteristics clearly the relative importance of independent factors will be different between different climatic regions in the tropics for example rainfall characteristics may possess a higher influence on washoff behaviour due to the intense rains compared to antecedent dry periods which do not vary significantly le et al 2017 the importance of rainfall characteristics is evidenced from studies done by chow et al 2012 and alias et al 2014 who found that though the erosive energy of rainfall can play a significant role in washoff it is unknown to what extent the washoff model parameters are related to the rainfall and runoff conditions and how such a dependency if it exists would vary as a function of the form dissolved or particulate of pollutants given the foregoing discussion there is an urgent need for a better understanding not only of the parameter values but how these parameters are influenced by environmental conditions this will allow a more judicious application of washoff models and therefore provide increased confidence in the application of these models thus the aim of the current study was to understand the influence of climatic conditions on washoff modeling the rainfall characteristics in different climatic zones vary significantly and this would imply that washoff response from catchments in different climatic zones may differ this knowledge will help researchers and engineers in understanding the underlying physical drivers behind stormwater washoff modeling the objectives of the study were 1 synthesize washoff data from different climatic zones 2 calibrate washoff model and obtain a dataset of model parameters for individual storm events and 3 understand the dependence of washoff parameters on rainfall characteristics peculiar to different climatic conditions although the current study focuses on data obtained from residential catchments the results obtained are expected to be applicable to other urban land use types and will provide greater understanding of the underlying physical process behind washoff behavior 2 study sites and data used 2 1 climate classification and erosivity rainfall in different climatic zones has distinct patterns of behavior and studies have revealed the link between rainfall erosivity and soil erosion in agricultural applications wischmeir and smith 1978 a similar approach is applied in assessing the principal factors governing washoff parameter dependence on rainfall via an assessment of washoff behavior on datasets from sites with different climatic conditions the world s climate is categorised according to the classification suggested by köppen peel et al 2007 where climate is divided into five major climatic types i a tropical moist climate ii b dry or arid climate iii c temperate climate iv d continental climate and v e polar climate the köppen climate classification is primarily guided by vegetation mapping and temperature and to a lesser extent rainfall which make its link to washoff tenuous however panagos et al 2017 compared the worldwide distribution of rainfall erosivity with the köppen classification system and found that the maps were similar providing a strong link between climate classification and erosivity it is therefore reasonable to assume that variations in washoff behaviour can be distinguished by climatic zones and by extension a dependence of the washoff model parameter values as a function of climatic classification can be expected the universal soil loss equation usle is used to estimate soil erosion on denuded surfaces and was originally developed for agricultural applications wischmeier and smith 1978 the usle represents rainfall erosivity by the r factor which quantifies the kinetic energy of raindrops at the ground surface the r factor was originally characterized for a 30 min rainfall intensity in the same way the mechanism of pollutant transport in a washoff model is produced either by or a combination of i kinetic energy from rainfall impact and ii shear stress applied by the flow to particulates on the surface 2 2 data collection rainfall runoff and water quality data from residential catchments were collected from various locations the climate in johore bahru malaysia chow et al 2012 singapore le et al 2017 and parts of florida usa mattraw and sherwood 1977 are classified as tropical and bellevue usa ebbert et al 1985 dublin ireland morgan et al 2020 and geelong australia this study are classified as temperate according to the köppen classification a summary of the critical parameters for the dataset used is listed in table 1 the tropical datasets especially those of malaysia and singapore have r factors and rainfall depths that are 20 and 2 times respectively to those of the temperate sites it would be reasonable to assume that this disparity in rainfall characteristics would be manifest by differences in washoff behavior between the sites in different climatic zones indeed the contradictory results mentioned in several studies le et al 2017 chow et al 2012 conducted in the tropics in relation to the importance of buildup and the significance of first flush have been observed moreover the antecedent dry period adp is limited due to frequent rainfalls reduce and therefore the influence of the adp on the buildup washoff process is doubtful these variabilities in washoff behavior highlight the importance of understanding the underlying drivers including the rainfall characteristics in explaining washoff model results when applied to catchments with vastly different rainfall patterns chow et al 2012 carried out their study in skudai johor peninsular malaysia skudai rainfall was measured with a 0 2 mm hobo tipping bucket rain guage installed close to the catchment a stage discharge rating curve was used to convert the water level measurements into discharge stormwater samples were collected manually at the outlet from start of runoff and sample collection ceased when the water level receded to the pre storm level a total 17 storm events were monitored and approximately 170 samples were analyzed le et al 2017 collected data from 4 residential catchments ccka cckn cckc and verde in singapore the study sites were equipped with rimco 8020 tipping bucket rain gauges to collect rainfall data at 1 min intervals along with an isco 2150 flow area velocity sensor to collect flow data every 2 min runoff was sampled using an automated sampler which was triggered when the water level in the channel reached a pre set value a total of 50 rainfall events was monitored and about 550 samples were analysed in the study by mattraw and sherwood 1977 the authors collected runoff data from a single residential area near pompano beach pampano b in broward county florida rainfall was measured using a 0 01 in 1 in 25 4 mm tipping bucket rain gauge located in the catchment whereas discharge was monitored from stage measurements upstream of a u shaped venturi flume water samples were collected by an automatic sampler in 2 liter polypropylene bottles a total of 33 events were sampled and around 330 samples were analyzed the nurp ebbert et al 1985 dataset forms part of the nationwide urban runoff program nurp conducted in the 1980s in the united states included in the program were sampling in two residential catchments located in bellevue washington usa discharge was measured by converting observations of stage to the closest 0 01 ft 3 mm in a v notch weir and converting the stage to discharge calibrated from flow measurements using a current meter rainfall data were recorded at 5 min intervals using tipping bucket rain guages with 0 01 in resolution three rain gauges were installed one in surrey down surrey d and two in lake hills lake h automated samplers were used to collect runoff samples at the outlet of the catchment the total number of events monitored across surrey d and lake h were 38 and 39 respectively and approximately 700 samples were analyzed in total morgan et al 2020 conducted their studies in kimmage kim dublin ireland runoff was monitored for an 18 month period from march 2011 to august 2012 during which 18 rain events were sampled and tested for total suspended solids tss discharge was monitored at 2 min intervals using an isco 2150 area velocity sensor and rainfall totals were monitored at 2 min intervals using a tipping bucket rain gauge located on site samples were collected using an automated sampler the total number of events monitored was 18 and around 162 samples were analyzed studies in the geelong catchment were initiated in july 2017 resulting in the collection of a total of 160 discrete stormwater samples from 16 rain events between july 2017 and march 2020 across 3 residential sites bellarine and rita court in geelong australia a map showing the sampling locations is given in fig 1 the site selection criteria used in this study were i catchment size between 4 and 50 ha to avoid runoff that is too flashy small catchment size or unrepresentative too large a catchment ii catchments were to be predominantly residential and iii sampling locations are easily accessible for installation of sampling equipment within the drainage network runoff in the studied catchments is conveyed by a storm drainage network which is separate from the sanitary sewer system at least six samples were collected per event and at least eight events were monitored at each site all samples were tested for total suspended solid tss total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp ortho phosphate op and total dissolved nitrogen tdn rainfall was recorded every 1 min using an 674 isco rain gauge recorded as multiples of 0 1 mm rainfall depths an isco 2150 area velocity flow module and sensor was used to measure velocity water depth and temperature the sensor was mounted on a metal plate which was fastened to the bottom of the drainage pipe samples were collected using an isco avalanche portable refrigerated sampler equipped with 14 950 ml bottles to obtain discrete stormwater samples from the runoff event the sampler is 2 phase programmable allowing for different time intervals that can be specified between sample collections at two sections of the hydrograph samples collected were stored under refrigerated conditions before analysis and transported to the lab usually within 24 hr of collection for analysis in the laboratory the samples were preserved according to standard methods and thereafter tested for the following five parameters total nitrogen tn hach method 10071 total phosphorus tp hach method 8190 total dissolved nitrogen tdn hach method 10072 ortho phosphate op hach method 8180 and total suspended solids tss apha 2540d the sampler was triggered once the water level reached a pre determined value an isco 2105 interface module was used to integrate different components of the monitoring system and manage data storage and was fitted with a sim card to allow remote access via the local 3g network all equipment were housed in an enclosure that was mounted on top of a trailer for ease of movement and transportation the data for rita court a and b were analyzed together since the 2 sub catchments form part of a bigger residential area with similar characteristics quality check of the data used in this study were based on three criteria i qualitative assessment hydrographs and hyetographs were examined for consistency and proper coincidence between the measured hydrograph and hyetograph ii runoff coefficient estimated for each event and varied approximately between 0 3 and 0 5 which is consistent for residential areas dhakal et al 2010 and iii load capture pollutographs were examined to ensure that over 70 of the total runoff volume was sampled and ensuring that samples were collected during both the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph the number of events that was analyzed for this study are listed in column 6 of table 1 2 3 statistical analyses where appropriate the shapiro wilk and lilliefors ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 tests for normality were used to understand the distribution of the dataset these tests assess the central tendency to enable the choice between parametric or non parametric statistical tests to be made a one way analysis of variance anova kaufmann and schering 2014 or the kruskal wallis test ostertagová et al 2014 was applied based on the distribution of the data to understand if there were differences in rainfall and flow characteristics and calibrated parameters from different sites having the same climatic classification the mann whitney test nachar 2008 was applied on paired data to analyze if the rainfall and flow characteristics and calibrated parameters were derived from the same population lastly pearson s rank correlation schober et al 2018 was used to examine the association between the washoff model parameters and rainfall and flow characteristics all statistics analyzed were computed using the statistical package for the social sciences or spss ibm corp released 2020 statistical software package 3 methodology 3 1 washoff modeling washoff is defined as the process of erosion and or solution of constituents from a sub catchment surface during a period of runoff huber 1986 the initial stage of washoff has a shallow surface water depth at this stage rainfall energy detaches particulate matter and initiates their motion the effect of rainfall energy is dominant in erosion from pervious areas and can be applied for impervious areas but the effect of limited supply buildup of erodible materials should also be considered at a later stage especially in street gutters and larger channels runoff increases resulting in erosion erosion may be described by the theory of sediment transport in which the mass flow rate of sediment is proportional to flow and bottom shear stress huber 1986 when rainfall depth is small washoff is limited to impervious areas and when rainfall depth increases flow from upstream areas is generated which contributes to the total pollutant load the empirical washoff model was suggested by sartor et al 1974 which is based on experimental observations where washoff is modeled as a function of runoff rate and mass remaining on the surface the data showed an agreement with the first order decay process which implies that concentration decreases with time during the storm event as available mass on the surface continuously decreases however contradictory results have been observed from many studies where data revealed increases in the concentration during the initial stage as the runoff rate increases huber 1986 this problem is resolved by making the washoff rate w mg hr directly proportional to a power function of runoff rate as in eq 1 rossman 2010 1 w c 3 q c 4 b where q is the runoff rate mm hr b is the mass of pollutant on the surface mg and c3 and c4 are the washoff coefficient and exponent respectively when the value of c4 is unity c3 has the same units as coefficient k per mm as proposed by sartor et al 1974 at time t 0 b bin initial mass is either calculated from a separate buildup model or estimated the entire loadagraph for any given event can be constructed by successive application of eq 1 by using time stepping 2 w i c 3 q i c 4 b i 1 w i 1 δ t where δt is the time interval and i refers to the current time step 3 2 monte carlo analysis and calibration of parameters a monte carlo approach where parameters sets are chosen randomly from a predefined parameter space and the model run over multiple realizations to determine the model response was applied this approach is useful particularly when outputs of the model depend nonlinearly on the inputs and parameter values beven 2009 monte carlo analysis was done by repetitive sampling of the three washoff parameters c3 c4 and bin assuming these parameters to be uniformly distributed over pre defined upper and lower limits a uniform distribution was assumed since there is a general lack of knowledge of how the parameter may be distributed beven 2009 the results from the monte carlo analysis were ranked by the sum of squared errors sse for a given event 10 000 parameter sets were generated randomly and applied in the model and the parameter sets c3 c4 and bin that gave the lowest sse value were selected for a given event this process of random sampling and identifying the best 10 sets of parameter values was repeated 10 times for all events once this was completed a final selection of the parameter set for an individual event was determined based on secondary evaluation of model performance by evaluating the nash sutcliffe ns mass error me index of agreement d and root mean square error rmse goodness of fit and mass error statistics moriasi et al 2015 3 ns 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x obs i x mean 2 4 d 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x sim i x mean x obs i x mean 2 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 where xobs i is the observed value at time step i xsim i is the simulated value xmean is the observed mean value and n is the total number of observations 6 me m sim m obs m obs 100 where msim and mobs are the simulated and observed mass for an event ns provides a measure of how well the predicted time series fits with the observations me provides a measure of the bulk mass balance rmse is an absolute error goodness of fit indicator that describes differences in observed and predicted values in the appropriate units and d measures the degree to which a model s predictions are error free all the methods used in conjunction assess the accuracy of model predictions within event behavior having independent error measures calculated after and outside the calibration process which was instead based on sse provides a second reference and assessment of model performance the final acceptance of a parameter set is based on satisfying me 20 ns 0 7 and d 0 7 gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 and the lowest value of rmse otherwise that parameter set is rejected and the monte carlo procedure is repeated 4 results and discussion 4 1 monitoring data from geelong and comparison of datasets a typical storm event recorded on 12 dec 2018 at rita court is shown in fig 2 showing good consistency between the rainfall and runoff data the total rainfall for this event was 13 mm and the runoff volume was 292 2 m3 the runoff coefficient was estimated to be 0 45 which is considered reasonable for an urban catchment a total of 7 samples indicated by red circles were collected at different sampling intervals throughout the event covering both the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph capturing about 80 of the entire runoff volume sampled figure 3 presents box and whisker plots of the rainfall and flow characteristics of all the events that were selected for use in the current study the box plots show the median 25 and 75 quartiles and the length of whiskers represent 1 5 times the inter quartile range of the dataset data points that lie beyond 1 5 times the inter quantile range are considered outliers and these are denoted as symbols in general the initiation of motion and surficial transport of particulates depend on rainfall intensity iav imax specific energy ek and flow rate qp while dilution depends on rainfall depth d and runoff volume v the values of ek were determined based on formulations provided in the literature wischmeier and smith 1978 renard 1997 brown and foster 1987 the rainfall and flow characteristics shown in the figure therefore represent the independent factors that influence washoff response to a storm event a comparison of the datasets shows that the magnitude of the rainfall and flow variables are significantly higher in the tropics as compared to temperate sites the consistency between the flow and rainfall variables from the same climate conditions is to be expected since the sites surveyed are residential sites with roughly similar percentages of pervious and impervious areas the specific energy which has been linked to soil loss also is noticeably higher in the tropics due to the higher rainfall intensities the rainfall characteristics of the tropical and temperate sites were assessed independently to test if the data are from the same distribution the kruskal wallis test was chosen since shapiro wilk tests for normality revealed that the rainfall variables do not follow the normal distribution p 05 the kruskal wallis test results indicated that d p 052 and 050 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively and imax p 172 and 309 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively from datasets with the same climatic classification were not significantly different iav on the other hand was statistically different p 05 between the datasets having the same climatic conditions mann whitney tests were applied to compare the difference in iav between pairs of datasets from sites with the same climatic classification for the tropical dataset three group were formed singapore with malaysia malaysia with florida and florida with singapore for tropical climate and bellevue with geelong geelong with dublin and dublin with bellevue for temperate datasets the test results indicate that iav was not significantly different when florida and singapore datasets were compared p 072 and when the bellevue with geelong datasets were compared p 393 inclusion of the malaysia and dublin datasets however resulted in p 05 indicating that iav in these datasets may behave differently despite coming from same climatic category nevertheless the above analysis shows that there is sufficient similarity in rainfall characteristics for sites having the same climatic classification as expected mann whitney tests on rainfall data that were grouped by combining sites according to climate classification revealed that all rainfall characteristics between the temperate and tropical datasets were statistically different p 05 similar statistical tests were carried out for the discharge data kruskal wallis test results indicate that qp and v for sites with the same climatic classification were in general significantly different p 05 although rainfall may be expected to exhibit similar characteristics flow even for catchments within the same climatic zones may show differences since runoff is also influenced by the physical attributes of the catchment the event mean concentrations emc for the different water quality variables were flow weighted dividing the total load by the total volume for the time period and are compared in fig 4 the results show that suspended solids are similar at almost all sites with the 25 to 75 quartile values ranging over an order of magnitude from 10 to 100 mg l within the temperate regions there is variability in the values of tp and tn between the australian and us datasets where the australian data bel rita c is about an order of magnitude higher the tn tp ratio however is approximately 10 a characteristic of urban runoff the lower emc values reported for the lake h and surrey d data is attributed to street sweeping ebbert et al 1985 however this emcs are in the range reported in the literature duncan 1999 and are thus considered representative of conditions elsewhere lower levels of emc however are observed for the singapore and malaysia datasets compared to global data reported by duncan 1999 this is attributed to dilution caused by larger runoff volumes observed in tropical climates lim 2003 nazahiyah et al 2007 the emc values of different sites under tropical and temperate datasets were assessed independently to test if data obtained from site with the same climatic classification were from the same distribution the kruskal wallis test was used since the data are not normality distributed p 05 for the shapiro wilk test for tss independent tropical and temperate datasets were not significantly different p 674 and 875 for the tropical and temperate datasets respectively presumably since the sites had a similar land use however the emc for tn and tp were significantly different for both climatic regions further statistical tests on the grouped combining data according to climate classification emc data showed that tss is significantly different p 05 between the temperate and tropical datasets implying that climatic variations may be significant in explaining differences in emc for particulate pollutants although the grouped tn and tp emc data were found to be significantly different the same conclusion cannot be reached as the emc for the independent tn and tp datasets were significantly different to begin with 4 2 model carlo analysis monte carlo analysis included calibration of the washoff model eq 1 for each of the five parameters across 133 rainfall events this resulted in a total of 665 independently calibrated parameters sets for c3 c4 and bin the results of the analysis for tss tp and op are shown in fig 5 to represent particulate mixed and dissolved constituents respectively the spread for the tss data is considerably less than dissolved form of pollutants op indicating that the monte carlo calibration was able to identify a more definite combination of c3 c4 and bin values for particulates than op total phosphorous which contains both particulate and dissolved forms appears to fall in between these two extremes similar results for tn and nh4 were observed this finding is consistent with previous studies jewell and adrian 1982 gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 and showed that event based values for c3 and bin varied greatly sometimes over three orders of magnitude for the same parameter at the same site the parameter c4 varied between 0 5 and 2 for all pollutants with no clear differences between the particulate and dissolved forms and in some instances exhibiting a larger scatter for tss nevertheless the values of c4 are in a narrow range compared to the other parameters for both the tropical and temperate datasets in agreement with other studies bonhomme and petrucci 2017 chow et al 2012 crobeddu and bennis 2011 the small variation in c4 across all sites is not surprising since c4 is an exponent to the unit area discharge q and can be considered to be related to the friction velocity u f in open channel flow u f is approximately ten times the free stream velocity which is event dependent and represents the fluid friction acting on the material deposited on the surface fredsøe and deigaard 1995 this implies that c4 is constrained explicitly by physical principles governing flow transport processes rather than characterizations of rainfall characteristics the threshold for particulate motion is defined by the critical shields parameter θ u f 2 s 1 g d where g is acceleration due to gravity d is the size of sediment and s is density ratio of sediment to fluid a semi empirical formula linking the dimensionless bed load φ b q b s 1 g d 3 where qb is the is the volume of material per unit time and width transported as a function of the shield s parameter was proposed by meyer peter müller 1948 7 φ b 8 θ θ c 3 2 θc is the dimensionless critical shear stress defined as θ c u fc 2 s 1 g d where ufc is the critical friction velocity and the condition for sediment motion to occur is when u f u fc although other formulations for bedload transport exist suffice it is to say that the observation that c4 should vary within a narrow range and q c 4 is thus analogous with a friction velocity is supported by classical sediment transport theory the concept of a limiting condition beyond which motion is initiated strictly applies to particulates with some uncertainty in the choice for c4 varying from 0 5 to 2 for particulate and mixed forms the results of this analysis suggest that c4 1 would be a reasonable estimate for dissolved pollutants the average value 1 s d of c4 1 7 0 7 1 1 0 3 1 0 0 3 for temperate catchments are significantly higher p 05 than that for tropical catchments 0 9 0 3 0 9 0 4 1 0 0 3 for tss tp and op respectively although first flush can be related to a variety of independent factors mamun et al 2020 stenstrom and kayhanian 2005 in general a higher c4 suggests a faster washoff rate and a more significant first flush effect reduction in first flush effects in the tropics have been attributed to the higher rainfall depths and runoff volumes li et al 2007 kim et al 2005 bin represents the mass on the surface at the start of a washoff event as expected higher bin are observed for tss and is the smallest for the dissolved phase although variations in bin across sites are evident however the variation within any given sampling site exist by up to 2 orders of magnitude when the mann whitney test was applied on pooled dataset for bin it showed that for all pollutants bin between the temperate and tropical datasets were significantly p 05 different this suggests that variations in bin may also be influenced by variation in storm characteristics in addition to differences in site characteristics in addition the singapore and malaysia datasets have the highest bin values which supports the observation that high rainfall rates may be a significant factor and that bin represents the mass that is available for washoff rather than the total mass on the surface this has also been observed in past studies pitt et al 2005 shaw et al 2010 egodawatta et al 2007 the datasets for malaysia and singapore are unique given that they have the highest rainfall intensities and depths and a higher bin may indicate that a larger portion of the total mass may be made available for washoff due to higher storm energy of tropical rainfall although pampano beach is classified as tropical the intensities and depths are significantly lower than that in singapore and malaysia if bin is understood to be the initial mass expressed either as mass per unit area or length and for eq 1 to be dimensionally consistent then the units for c3 will vary depending on the value of c4 the inconsistency in the units for c3 is problematic and contributes to the difficulty in gaining a proper understanding of the parameter a further comparison of the washoff model parameters reported in the literature gaumeet al 1998 barco et al 2004 tempranoet al 2006 hood et al 2007 hossain et al 2010 crobeddu and bennis 2011 chow et al 2012 hossain et al 2012 wickeet al 2012 bonhomme and petrucci 2017 rezaei et al 2019 for residential urban land use was done the values reported in the literature show that while there is general agreement that the bulk of the reported values of c4 varies between 0 5 and 2 0 for all pollutant types the range for c3 is wide and has the largest uncertainty studies done by alley 1981 and berretta et al 2007 have shown that c3 varied for every event at the same site sutherland and jelen 2003 have also discouraged the use of a constant value of c3 other studies have suggested that c3 cannot be treated as constant but depends on the runoff rate and volume nakamura 1984 richardson and tripp 2006 rainfall intensity and catchment area sonnen 1980 rainfall volume and duration and mass of pollutants accumulated on the catchment surface osuch pajdzinska 1987 when the mann whitney test was applied to the pooled dataset for c3 it showed that for all pollutants the difference in c3 between the temperate and tropical datasets was significant p 05 hence it is suggested that because of the difference in rainfall and runoff behavior it will be erroneous to use similar values for the c3 washoff coefficient for catchments in temperate and tropical climates 4 3 model parameter dependence on rainfall factors further insights into the dependence of washoff response to different rainfall and runoff conditions were obtained from correlation analysis done on the pooled tropical and temperate datasets this will elucidate the dependence of model parameters on climatic classification as any difference in behavior found may provide clarity on the physical significance of the model parameters prior to correlation analysis the lilliefors test ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 was first conducted on the pooled datasets to understand how the model parameters rainfall and flow variables are distributed testing against the normal lognormal and exponential distributions the test results indicated that for the temperate dataset c3 bin d imax and iav are log normally distributed whereas c4 is normally distributed similar results were obtained for the tropical dataset with the exception of imax which was also found to be normally distributed the pearson correlation analysis was therefore used to investigate correlations between the washoff model parameters with rainfall variables the results of this analysis are shown in fig 6 which includes the pearson correlation coefficient r and p values in general the number of significant α 0 05 0 01 correlations between the rainfall variables with model parameters which are observed for both tropical and temperate datasets is higher for tss and reduces to at most two significant correlations for mixed tp and dissolved op forms this is expected since the washoff model is better suited for particulates gaut et al 2019 as understood by a particulate transport process governed by critical stress criteria it is also observed that the spread for the tss data is considerably lesser than for the tp and op indicating that any attribution of parameter dependence on rainfall characteristics will be more applicable to pollutants in particulate form comparing between the temperate and tropics datasets for tss the tropical dataset has a larger number of significant correlations between the model parameters and rainfall variables the variable c4 was least correlated with rainfall characteristics this observation provides further confirmation that c4 is more closely related to transport behavior and therefore cannot be distinguished by rainfall characteristics this is in contrast to c3 and bin which are more correlated to the rainfall variables indicating that these parameters have a closer correspondence with rainfall the variable c3 is negatively correlated with rainfall variables interestingly le et al 2017 observed that for tss c3 was correlated with d only when d 5 mm a similar observation appears in the temperate dataset as well where it is noticed in fig 6a that c3 is almost constant when d 5 mm and begins to decrease with increasing d for d 5 mm bin is generally positively correlated with the rainfall variables this is consistent with the availability concept in washoff modeling egodawatta et al 2007 shaw et al 2010 pitt et al 2005 the greater dependence of bin on the available mass for washoff which is characterized by rainfall characteristics as compared to factors such as the antecedent dry period which is popular in buildup models has also been discussed by gaut et al 2019 shaw et al 2010 le et al 2017 duncan 1995a duncan 1995b vaze and chiew 2003 and borris et al 2014 given the correspondence of c3 and bin with rainfall it is also observed that correlations of bin for tss differ between climatic conditions in temperate regions bin correlates strongly with both the average and maximum intensities whereas in tropical catchments maximum intensity and depth were found to be significant the strong dependence with intensity in the temperate catchments can be understood by the dependence of rainfall energy on raindrop size which is inked to intensity early studies hudson 1963 wischmeier and smith 1978 have shown that the rainfall energy increases with increase in rainfall intensity up to a maximum value of 3 in hr 76 2 mm hr beyond this value of rainfall intensity raindrop size ceases to increase and kinetic energy attains a peak value as this limit is reached more often in the tropics than in temperate regions washoff can be expected to be more sensitive to variations in rainfall intensities in temperate catchments in the tropics however d is significant presumably relating to dilution dilution has been identified as a significant process and has been used to explain lower observed values of emc is tropical catchments chow et al 2013 lim 2003 and chua et al 2009 5 conclusions the washoff model approach is conceptually easy to understand and popular with practitioners our approach has been to provide a better understanding to what is already a widely accepted model though popular ambiguities around the use of washoff modelling approach exist this paper attempted to address some of these uncertainties by moving away from a black box approach in providing an understanding of model parameter dependence to physical factors to our knowledge this is the first study looking at such processes across climatic zones and further studies of this nature are needed to gain better insights on how the washoff model functions the following are conclusions from this study calibrated values for the exponential washoff model parameters c3 and bin were found to be log normally distributed and varied by up to 2 orders of magnitude for the same pollutant at the same site for both temperate and tropical datasets parameter c4 however was found to be normally distributed with a value 0 5 2 0 for all pollutants for both the tropical and temperate datasets quartile ranges or the spread of parameter values were typically greater for dissolved pollutants such as nh4 and op than particulates the accuracy of the washoff model was clearly best for particulate pollutant tss and worst for dissolved pollutants with mixed pollutants tp and tn falling in between these two extremes bin represents the available mass on the surface at the start of a washoff event this is evidenced by observations that a significantly higher value of bin is observed for tss in the tropical dataset indicating that a larger portion of the total mass may be made available for washoff because of the greater storm energy associated with tropical rainfall the small variation in c4 across all sites is due to its dependence on local flow conditions linked to the friction velocity this is evidenced by the observation that c4 varies over a narrow range for all datasets the parameters c3 and bin are correlated with rainfall the range for c3 is wide and has the larger uncertainty hence it is suggested that because of the difference in rainfall and runoff behavior it will be erroneous to use similar values for the c3 washoff coefficient for temperate and tropical catchments of all the rainfall characteristics investigated the rainfall depth for the current event was found to be the single parameter that correlated well with bin and c3 for tss the strength of this dependence diminishes for pollutants in mixed and dissolved forms it is observed for both the temperate and tropical datasets that for tss c3 is significantly correlated with d if d 5 mm this is likely due to the rainfall being non uniform when d 5 mm moreover in temperate regions bin correlates strongly with both the average and maximum intensities whereas in tropical catchments maximum intensity and depth were found to be significant the more obvious dependence with intensity in temperate catchments can be understood by the dependence of rainfall energy on raindrop size which is dependent on intensity the number of significant p 05 01 correlations between the rainfall variables with model parameters is highest for particulates and lower for mixed tn tp and lowest for dissolved pollutants this is expected since the washoff model is better suited for particulates as understood by a particulate transport process c4 had the least number of correlations with the rainfall variables providing further evidence that c4 is not directly dependent on rainfall the datasets used in this paper are from residential catchments in tropical and temperate climates the focus on residential catchments was largely driven by the lack of good quality continuous rainfall and flow data and accompanying storm water quality data for other land uses while we do not expect the overall conclusions to deviate significantly for other tropical and temperate catchments results for dry arid catchments are unknown driver and tasker 1990 observed that runoff load estimates were more accurate in areas with lesser rainfall and vice versa this was attributed to the longer antecedent dry periods in dry arid climates it can be argued that buildup and washoff models may be more suitable for dry arid climates as a result compared to the tropics for example where the antecedent period is limited and is primarily driven by rainfall energy hence the response of the model parameters for catchments in dry arid climate may differ from results obtained in this study further comparative studies are therefore needed credit authorship contribution statement shagun conceptualization data curation formal analysis

4007,modeling the washoff of pollutants from urban catchments is a difficult task although the exponential washoff model has been in use for decades there is a general lack of data on model parameters and much less is known about how the model parameters are influenced by storm and climate characteristics this study was done to understand how model parameters vary between different catchments having vastly different rainfall characteristics such a study will elucidate model response to rainfall which in turn provides better knowledge on model function high quality rainfall runoff and water quality data for a total of 117 storm events were sourced from the literature which included 48 storm events from temperate bellevue washington us dublin ireland and 69 storm events from tropical skudai malaysia singapore pampano beach florida us catchments respectively all the data were sourced from catchments with residential land use this dataset was supplemented by additional measurements done in two residential catchments in geelong temperate where a total of 16 storm events were monitored monte carlo analysis was used to obtain the best fit values of the washoff model parameters consisting the washoff coefficient c3 washoff exponent c4 and the initial mass on surface bin it was found that the spread of these parameter values was greater for the dissolved pollutants ortho phosphate op and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n than for total suspended solids tss there are strong suggestions that bin represents the mass available on the surface at the start of a washoff event as evidenced by observations that bin is significantly higher for the tropical dataset a reflection of the greater storm energy associated with tropical rainfall the small variation in c4 across all temperate and tropical sites is related to its dependence on local flow conditions linked with the friction velocity and critical shear stress conditions the parameters c3 and bin on the other hand are correlated with rainfall with c3 having a larger uncertainty of all the rainfall characteristics investigated the rainfall depth for the current event d was found to be the single parameter that correlated well with bin and c3 for tss the strength of this dependence diminished for pollutants in mixed and dissolved forms in temperate regions bin correlates strongly with both the average and maximum intensities whereas in tropical catchments maximum intensity and depth were found to be significant this correlation for the temperate catchments can be understood by the dependence of rainfall energy on intensity rainfall energy ceases to increase once intensity exceeds 3 in hr 76 2 mm hr which is uncommon in temperate catchments but is common in the tropics keywords washoff parameters rainfall characteristics parameter sensitivity correlation pollutant types 1 introduction urban runoff has been identified as the largest non point source for contaminants entering waterways the increased impact of urban runoff on surface water quality has necessitated improved modeling of stormwater pollution stormwater runoff models for flow prediction have been well researched and are supported by a large amount of field data resulting in a high benchmark for accuracy in urban runoff prediction imteaz et al 2013 the modeling of stormwater quality is relatively less well understood with a vast number of complex interrelated processes influencing urban stormwater quality may and sivakumar 2009 besides the complexity of these models the accuracy of model predictions depends on other factors such as the amount of data available proper selection of input parameters associated with the model and their related uncertainties and the quality of the data used most stormwater quality models for urban catchments in existence today depend upon two key processes i e buildup and washoff in the traditional application of buildup and washoff models the initial mass on the surface is taken to be the sum of pollutant buildup and the remaining mass from the previous event charbeneau and barrett 1998 however this approach may be too simplistic and alternative interpretations have been proposed recently it has been suggested that buildup reflects the limiting value of the observed mass that can be washed off during an event gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 some studies even questioned the need for buildup modeling in the simulation of washoff load shaw et al 2010 showed that the washoff model gave the same result whether using a constant mass available or a buildup model a similar conclusion was reached by egodawatta et al 2007 in their study washoff removed only a portion of the total mass on a surface and even when the washoff load approached a maximum this maximum was smaller than the total loading that was present before the rainfall event this ambiguity with buildup modeling indicates that washoff may not be significantly influenced by the total mass on surface but rather depends on the potential or the available mass for washoff which comprises only a portion of the total mass on the surface pitt et al 2005 since the 1980s studies on urban stormwater quality modeling have applied washoff functions to predict stormwater pollutant loads most of the work has focused on determining appropriate values of model parameters jewell and adrian 1982 ball et al 1998 deletic and maksimovic 1998 tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 kim et al 2006 part of the difficulty in identifying a correct model parameter value has to do with the fact that there is little understanding of what the model parameters represent physically as such the models behave very much as a black box with little physical interpretation attached to the model parameters therefore not only is the accurate quantification of model parameter values necessary but also having an understanding of the physical meaning of each of the model parameters model parameter values are usually estimated from field sampling studies often done for a pre defined land use sartor and boyd 1972 egodawatta et al 2007 or catchment alley and smith 1981 chow et al 2012 le et al 2017 gaut et al 2019 several studies baffaut and delleur 1990 chen and adams 2006 have found that the model parameters vary not only from catchment to catchment but also between rainfall events hence attention has been given to characteristic features governing the washoff process including rainfall rate sartor boyd 1972 brodie 2007 rainfall depth chiew mcmahon 1999 runoff rate huber et al 1988 runoff volume characklis et al 1979 barbé et al 1996 shear stress nakamura 1984 akan 1987 deletic 2001 raindrop energy sartor et al 1974 price mance 1978 moss et al 1979 coleman 1993 and other factors such as available mass on the surface and street surface and particulate characteristics sartor et al 1974 pitt et al 2005 the breadth of studies conducted gives an indication of the difficulties related to washoff modeling which is a complicated function of a number of factors including antecedent dry period and particle and rainfall characteristics clearly the relative importance of independent factors will be different between different climatic regions in the tropics for example rainfall characteristics may possess a higher influence on washoff behaviour due to the intense rains compared to antecedent dry periods which do not vary significantly le et al 2017 the importance of rainfall characteristics is evidenced from studies done by chow et al 2012 and alias et al 2014 who found that though the erosive energy of rainfall can play a significant role in washoff it is unknown to what extent the washoff model parameters are related to the rainfall and runoff conditions and how such a dependency if it exists would vary as a function of the form dissolved or particulate of pollutants given the foregoing discussion there is an urgent need for a better understanding not only of the parameter values but how these parameters are influenced by environmental conditions this will allow a more judicious application of washoff models and therefore provide increased confidence in the application of these models thus the aim of the current study was to understand the influence of climatic conditions on washoff modeling the rainfall characteristics in different climatic zones vary significantly and this would imply that washoff response from catchments in different climatic zones may differ this knowledge will help researchers and engineers in understanding the underlying physical drivers behind stormwater washoff modeling the objectives of the study were 1 synthesize washoff data from different climatic zones 2 calibrate washoff model and obtain a dataset of model parameters for individual storm events and 3 understand the dependence of washoff parameters on rainfall characteristics peculiar to different climatic conditions although the current study focuses on data obtained from residential catchments the results obtained are expected to be applicable to other urban land use types and will provide greater understanding of the underlying physical process behind washoff behavior 2 study sites and data used 2 1 climate classification and erosivity rainfall in different climatic zones has distinct patterns of behavior and studies have revealed the link between rainfall erosivity and soil erosion in agricultural applications wischmeir and smith 1978 a similar approach is applied in assessing the principal factors governing washoff parameter dependence on rainfall via an assessment of washoff behavior on datasets from sites with different climatic conditions the world s climate is categorised according to the classification suggested by köppen peel et al 2007 where climate is divided into five major climatic types i a tropical moist climate ii b dry or arid climate iii c temperate climate iv d continental climate and v e polar climate the köppen climate classification is primarily guided by vegetation mapping and temperature and to a lesser extent rainfall which make its link to washoff tenuous however panagos et al 2017 compared the worldwide distribution of rainfall erosivity with the köppen classification system and found that the maps were similar providing a strong link between climate classification and erosivity it is therefore reasonable to assume that variations in washoff behaviour can be distinguished by climatic zones and by extension a dependence of the washoff model parameter values as a function of climatic classification can be expected the universal soil loss equation usle is used to estimate soil erosion on denuded surfaces and was originally developed for agricultural applications wischmeier and smith 1978 the usle represents rainfall erosivity by the r factor which quantifies the kinetic energy of raindrops at the ground surface the r factor was originally characterized for a 30 min rainfall intensity in the same way the mechanism of pollutant transport in a washoff model is produced either by or a combination of i kinetic energy from rainfall impact and ii shear stress applied by the flow to particulates on the surface 2 2 data collection rainfall runoff and water quality data from residential catchments were collected from various locations the climate in johore bahru malaysia chow et al 2012 singapore le et al 2017 and parts of florida usa mattraw and sherwood 1977 are classified as tropical and bellevue usa ebbert et al 1985 dublin ireland morgan et al 2020 and geelong australia this study are classified as temperate according to the köppen classification a summary of the critical parameters for the dataset used is listed in table 1 the tropical datasets especially those of malaysia and singapore have r factors and rainfall depths that are 20 and 2 times respectively to those of the temperate sites it would be reasonable to assume that this disparity in rainfall characteristics would be manifest by differences in washoff behavior between the sites in different climatic zones indeed the contradictory results mentioned in several studies le et al 2017 chow et al 2012 conducted in the tropics in relation to the importance of buildup and the significance of first flush have been observed moreover the antecedent dry period adp is limited due to frequent rainfalls reduce and therefore the influence of the adp on the buildup washoff process is doubtful these variabilities in washoff behavior highlight the importance of understanding the underlying drivers including the rainfall characteristics in explaining washoff model results when applied to catchments with vastly different rainfall patterns chow et al 2012 carried out their study in skudai johor peninsular malaysia skudai rainfall was measured with a 0 2 mm hobo tipping bucket rain guage installed close to the catchment a stage discharge rating curve was used to convert the water level measurements into discharge stormwater samples were collected manually at the outlet from start of runoff and sample collection ceased when the water level receded to the pre storm level a total 17 storm events were monitored and approximately 170 samples were analyzed le et al 2017 collected data from 4 residential catchments ccka cckn cckc and verde in singapore the study sites were equipped with rimco 8020 tipping bucket rain gauges to collect rainfall data at 1 min intervals along with an isco 2150 flow area velocity sensor to collect flow data every 2 min runoff was sampled using an automated sampler which was triggered when the water level in the channel reached a pre set value a total of 50 rainfall events was monitored and about 550 samples were analysed in the study by mattraw and sherwood 1977 the authors collected runoff data from a single residential area near pompano beach pampano b in broward county florida rainfall was measured using a 0 01 in 1 in 25 4 mm tipping bucket rain gauge located in the catchment whereas discharge was monitored from stage measurements upstream of a u shaped venturi flume water samples were collected by an automatic sampler in 2 liter polypropylene bottles a total of 33 events were sampled and around 330 samples were analyzed the nurp ebbert et al 1985 dataset forms part of the nationwide urban runoff program nurp conducted in the 1980s in the united states included in the program were sampling in two residential catchments located in bellevue washington usa discharge was measured by converting observations of stage to the closest 0 01 ft 3 mm in a v notch weir and converting the stage to discharge calibrated from flow measurements using a current meter rainfall data were recorded at 5 min intervals using tipping bucket rain guages with 0 01 in resolution three rain gauges were installed one in surrey down surrey d and two in lake hills lake h automated samplers were used to collect runoff samples at the outlet of the catchment the total number of events monitored across surrey d and lake h were 38 and 39 respectively and approximately 700 samples were analyzed in total morgan et al 2020 conducted their studies in kimmage kim dublin ireland runoff was monitored for an 18 month period from march 2011 to august 2012 during which 18 rain events were sampled and tested for total suspended solids tss discharge was monitored at 2 min intervals using an isco 2150 area velocity sensor and rainfall totals were monitored at 2 min intervals using a tipping bucket rain gauge located on site samples were collected using an automated sampler the total number of events monitored was 18 and around 162 samples were analyzed studies in the geelong catchment were initiated in july 2017 resulting in the collection of a total of 160 discrete stormwater samples from 16 rain events between july 2017 and march 2020 across 3 residential sites bellarine and rita court in geelong australia a map showing the sampling locations is given in fig 1 the site selection criteria used in this study were i catchment size between 4 and 50 ha to avoid runoff that is too flashy small catchment size or unrepresentative too large a catchment ii catchments were to be predominantly residential and iii sampling locations are easily accessible for installation of sampling equipment within the drainage network runoff in the studied catchments is conveyed by a storm drainage network which is separate from the sanitary sewer system at least six samples were collected per event and at least eight events were monitored at each site all samples were tested for total suspended solid tss total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp ortho phosphate op and total dissolved nitrogen tdn rainfall was recorded every 1 min using an 674 isco rain gauge recorded as multiples of 0 1 mm rainfall depths an isco 2150 area velocity flow module and sensor was used to measure velocity water depth and temperature the sensor was mounted on a metal plate which was fastened to the bottom of the drainage pipe samples were collected using an isco avalanche portable refrigerated sampler equipped with 14 950 ml bottles to obtain discrete stormwater samples from the runoff event the sampler is 2 phase programmable allowing for different time intervals that can be specified between sample collections at two sections of the hydrograph samples collected were stored under refrigerated conditions before analysis and transported to the lab usually within 24 hr of collection for analysis in the laboratory the samples were preserved according to standard methods and thereafter tested for the following five parameters total nitrogen tn hach method 10071 total phosphorus tp hach method 8190 total dissolved nitrogen tdn hach method 10072 ortho phosphate op hach method 8180 and total suspended solids tss apha 2540d the sampler was triggered once the water level reached a pre determined value an isco 2105 interface module was used to integrate different components of the monitoring system and manage data storage and was fitted with a sim card to allow remote access via the local 3g network all equipment were housed in an enclosure that was mounted on top of a trailer for ease of movement and transportation the data for rita court a and b were analyzed together since the 2 sub catchments form part of a bigger residential area with similar characteristics quality check of the data used in this study were based on three criteria i qualitative assessment hydrographs and hyetographs were examined for consistency and proper coincidence between the measured hydrograph and hyetograph ii runoff coefficient estimated for each event and varied approximately between 0 3 and 0 5 which is consistent for residential areas dhakal et al 2010 and iii load capture pollutographs were examined to ensure that over 70 of the total runoff volume was sampled and ensuring that samples were collected during both the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph the number of events that was analyzed for this study are listed in column 6 of table 1 2 3 statistical analyses where appropriate the shapiro wilk and lilliefors ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 tests for normality were used to understand the distribution of the dataset these tests assess the central tendency to enable the choice between parametric or non parametric statistical tests to be made a one way analysis of variance anova kaufmann and schering 2014 or the kruskal wallis test ostertagová et al 2014 was applied based on the distribution of the data to understand if there were differences in rainfall and flow characteristics and calibrated parameters from different sites having the same climatic classification the mann whitney test nachar 2008 was applied on paired data to analyze if the rainfall and flow characteristics and calibrated parameters were derived from the same population lastly pearson s rank correlation schober et al 2018 was used to examine the association between the washoff model parameters and rainfall and flow characteristics all statistics analyzed were computed using the statistical package for the social sciences or spss ibm corp released 2020 statistical software package 3 methodology 3 1 washoff modeling washoff is defined as the process of erosion and or solution of constituents from a sub catchment surface during a period of runoff huber 1986 the initial stage of washoff has a shallow surface water depth at this stage rainfall energy detaches particulate matter and initiates their motion the effect of rainfall energy is dominant in erosion from pervious areas and can be applied for impervious areas but the effect of limited supply buildup of erodible materials should also be considered at a later stage especially in street gutters and larger channels runoff increases resulting in erosion erosion may be described by the theory of sediment transport in which the mass flow rate of sediment is proportional to flow and bottom shear stress huber 1986 when rainfall depth is small washoff is limited to impervious areas and when rainfall depth increases flow from upstream areas is generated which contributes to the total pollutant load the empirical washoff model was suggested by sartor et al 1974 which is based on experimental observations where washoff is modeled as a function of runoff rate and mass remaining on the surface the data showed an agreement with the first order decay process which implies that concentration decreases with time during the storm event as available mass on the surface continuously decreases however contradictory results have been observed from many studies where data revealed increases in the concentration during the initial stage as the runoff rate increases huber 1986 this problem is resolved by making the washoff rate w mg hr directly proportional to a power function of runoff rate as in eq 1 rossman 2010 1 w c 3 q c 4 b where q is the runoff rate mm hr b is the mass of pollutant on the surface mg and c3 and c4 are the washoff coefficient and exponent respectively when the value of c4 is unity c3 has the same units as coefficient k per mm as proposed by sartor et al 1974 at time t 0 b bin initial mass is either calculated from a separate buildup model or estimated the entire loadagraph for any given event can be constructed by successive application of eq 1 by using time stepping 2 w i c 3 q i c 4 b i 1 w i 1 δ t where δt is the time interval and i refers to the current time step 3 2 monte carlo analysis and calibration of parameters a monte carlo approach where parameters sets are chosen randomly from a predefined parameter space and the model run over multiple realizations to determine the model response was applied this approach is useful particularly when outputs of the model depend nonlinearly on the inputs and parameter values beven 2009 monte carlo analysis was done by repetitive sampling of the three washoff parameters c3 c4 and bin assuming these parameters to be uniformly distributed over pre defined upper and lower limits a uniform distribution was assumed since there is a general lack of knowledge of how the parameter may be distributed beven 2009 the results from the monte carlo analysis were ranked by the sum of squared errors sse for a given event 10 000 parameter sets were generated randomly and applied in the model and the parameter sets c3 c4 and bin that gave the lowest sse value were selected for a given event this process of random sampling and identifying the best 10 sets of parameter values was repeated 10 times for all events once this was completed a final selection of the parameter set for an individual event was determined based on secondary evaluation of model performance by evaluating the nash sutcliffe ns mass error me index of agreement d and root mean square error rmse goodness of fit and mass error statistics moriasi et al 2015 3 ns 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x obs i x mean 2 4 d 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x sim i x mean x obs i x mean 2 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n

where msim and mobs are the simulated and observed mass for an event ns provides a measure of how well the predicted time series fits with the observations me provides a measure of the bulk mass balance rmse is an absolute error goodness of fit indicator that describes differences in observed and predicted values in the appropriate units and d measures the degree to which a model s predictions are error free all the methods used in conjunction assess the accuracy of model predictions within event behavior having independent error measures calculated after and outside the calibration process which was instead based on sse provides a second reference and assessment of model performance the final acceptance of a parameter set is based on satisfying me 20 ns 0 7 and d 0 7 gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 and the lowest value of rmse otherwise that parameter set is rejected and the monte carlo procedure is repeated 4 results and discussion 4 1 monitoring data from geelong and comparison of datasets a typical storm event recorded on 12 dec 2018 at rita court is shown in fig 2 showing good consistency between the rainfall and runoff data the total rainfall for this event was 13 mm and the runoff volume was 292 2 m3 the runoff coefficient was estimated to be 0 45 which is considered reasonable for an urban catchment a total of 7 samples indicated by red circles were collected at different sampling intervals throughout the event covering both the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph capturing about 80 of the entire runoff volume sampled figure 3 presents box and whisker plots of the rainfall and flow characteristics of all the events that were selected for use in the current study the box plots show the median 25 and 75 quartiles and the length of whiskers represent 1 5 times the inter quartile range of the dataset data points that lie beyond 1 5 times the inter quantile range are considered outliers and these are denoted as symbols in general the initiation of motion and surficial transport of particulates depend on rainfall intensity iav imax specific energy ek and flow rate qp while dilution depends on rainfall depth d and runoff volume v the values of ek were determined based on formulations provided in the literature wischmeier and smith 1978 renard 1997 brown and foster 1987 the rainfall and flow characteristics shown in the figure therefore represent the independent factors that influence washoff response to a storm event a comparison of the datasets shows that the magnitude of the rainfall and flow variables are significantly higher in the tropics as compared to temperate sites the consistency between the flow and rainfall variables from the same climate conditions is to be expected since the sites surveyed are residential sites with roughly similar percentages of pervious and impervious areas the specific energy which has been linked to soil loss also is noticeably higher in the tropics due to the higher rainfall intensities the rainfall characteristics of the tropical and temperate sites were assessed independently to test if the data are from the same distribution the kruskal wallis test was chosen since shapiro wilk tests for normality revealed that the rainfall variables do not follow the normal distribution p 05 the kruskal wallis test results indicated that d p 052 and 050 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively and imax p 172 and 309 for tropical and temperate datasets respectively from datasets with the same climatic classification were not significantly different iav on the other hand was statistically different p 05 between the datasets having the same climatic conditions mann whitney tests were applied to compare the difference in iav between pairs of datasets from sites with the same climatic classification for the tropical dataset three group were formed singapore with malaysia malaysia with florida and florida with singapore for tropical climate and bellevue with geelong geelong with dublin and dublin with bellevue for temperate datasets the test results indicate that iav was not significantly different when florida and singapore datasets were compared p 072 and when the bellevue with geelong datasets were compared p 393 inclusion of the malaysia and dublin datasets however resulted in p 05 indicating that iav in these datasets may behave differently despite coming from same climatic category nevertheless the above analysis shows that there is sufficient similarity in rainfall characteristics for sites having the same climatic classification as expected mann whitney tests on rainfall data that were grouped by combining sites according to climate classification revealed that all rainfall characteristics between the temperate and tropical datasets were statistically different p 05 similar statistical tests were carried out for the discharge data kruskal wallis test results indicate that qp and v for sites with the same climatic classification were in general significantly different p 05 although rainfall may be expected to exhibit similar characteristics flow even for catchments within the same climatic zones may show differences since runoff is also influenced by the physical attributes of the catchment the event mean concentrations emc for the different water quality variables were flow weighted dividing the total load by the total volume for the time period and are compared in fig 4 the results show that suspended solids are similar at almost all sites with the 25 to 75 quartile values ranging over an order of magnitude from 10 to 100 mg l within the temperate regions there is variability in the values of tp and tn between the australian and us datasets where the australian data bel rita c is about an order of magnitude higher the tn tp ratio however is approximately 10 a characteristic of urban runoff the lower emc values reported for the lake h and surrey d data is attributed to street sweeping ebbert et al 1985 however this emcs are in the range reported in the literature duncan 1999 and are thus considered representative of conditions elsewhere lower levels of emc however are observed for the singapore and malaysia datasets compared to global data reported by duncan 1999 this is attributed to dilution caused by larger runoff volumes observed in tropical climates lim 2003 nazahiyah et al 2007 the emc values of different sites under tropical and temperate datasets were assessed independently to test if data obtained from site with the same climatic classification were from the same distribution the kruskal wallis test was used since the data are not normality distributed p 05 for the shapiro wilk test for tss independent tropical and temperate datasets were not significantly different p 674 and 875 for the tropical and temperate datasets respectively presumably since the sites had a similar land use however the emc for tn and tp were significantly different for both climatic regions further statistical tests on the grouped combining data according to climate classification emc data showed that tss is significantly different p 05 between the temperate and tropical datasets implying that climatic variations may be significant in explaining differences in emc for particulate pollutants although the grouped tn and tp emc data were found to be significantly different the same conclusion cannot be reached as the emc for the independent tn and tp datasets were significantly different to begin with 4 2 model carlo analysis monte carlo analysis included calibration of the washoff model eq 1 for each of the five parameters across 133 rainfall events this resulted in a total of 665 independently calibrated parameters sets for c3 c4 and bin the results of the analysis for tss tp and op are shown in fig 5 to represent particulate mixed and dissolved constituents respectively the spread for the tss data is considerably less than dissolved form of pollutants op indicating that the monte carlo calibration was able to identify a more definite combination of c3 c4 and bin values for particulates than op total phosphorous which contains both particulate and dissolved forms appears to fall in between these two extremes similar results for tn and nh4 were observed this finding is consistent with previous studies jewell and adrian 1982 gaut et al 2019 le et al 2017 and showed that event based values for c3 and bin varied greatly sometimes over three orders of magnitude for the same parameter at the same site the parameter c4 varied between 0 5 and 2 for all pollutants with no clear differences between the particulate and dissolved forms and in some instances exhibiting a larger scatter for tss nevertheless the values of c4 are in a narrow range compared to the other parameters for both the tropical and temperate datasets in agreement with other studies bonhomme and petrucci 2017 chow et al 2012 crobeddu and bennis 2011 the small variation in c4 across all sites is not surprising since c4 is an exponent to the unit area discharge q and can be considered to be related to the friction velocity u f in open channel flow u f is approximately ten times the free stream velocity which is event dependent and represents the fluid friction acting on the material deposited on the surface fredsøe and deigaard 1995 this implies that c4 is constrained explicitly by physical principles governing flow transport processes rather than characterizations of rainfall characteristics the threshold for particulate motion is defined by the critical shields parameter θ u f 2 s 1 g d where g is acceleration due to gravity d is the size of sediment and s is density ratio of sediment to fluid a semi empirical formula linking the dimensionless bed load φ b q b s 1 g d 3 where qb is the is the volume of material per unit time and width transported as a function of the shield s parameter was proposed by meyer peter müller 1948 7 φ b 8 θ θ c 3 2 θc is the dimensionless critical shear stress defined as θ c u fc 2 s 1 g d where ufc is the critical friction velocity and the condition for sediment motion to occur is when u f u fc although other formulations for bedload transport exist suffice it is to say that the observation that c4 should vary within a narrow range and q c 4 is thus analogous with a friction velocity is supported by classical sediment transport theory the concept of a limiting condition beyond which motion is initiated strictly applies to particulates with some uncertainty in the choice for c4 varying from 0 5 to 2 for particulate and mixed forms the results of this analysis suggest that c4 1 would be a reasonable estimate for dissolved pollutants the average value 1 s d of c4 1 7 0 7 1 1 0 3 1 0 0 3 for temperate catchments are significantly higher p 05 than that for tropical catchments 0 9 0 3 0 9 0 4 1 0 0 3 for tss tp and op respectively although first flush can be related to a variety of independent factors mamun et al 2020 stenstrom and kayhanian 2005 in general a higher c4 suggests a faster washoff rate and a more significant first flush effect reduction in first flush effects in the tropics have been attributed to the higher rainfall depths and runoff volumes li et al 2007 kim et al 2005 bin represents the mass on the surface at the start of a washoff event as expected higher bin are observed for tss and is the smallest for the dissolved phase although variations in bin across sites are evident however the variation within any given sampling site exist by up to 2 orders of magnitude when the mann whitney test was applied on pooled dataset for bin it showed that for all pollutants bin between the temperate and tropical datasets were significantly p 05 different this suggests that variations in bin may also be influenced by variation in storm characteristics in addition to differences in site characteristics in addition the singapore and malaysia datasets have the highest bin values which supports the observation that high rainfall rates may be a significant factor and that bin represents the mass that is available for washoff rather than the total mass on the surface this has also been observed in past studies pitt et al 2005 shaw et al 2010 egodawatta et al 2007 the datasets for malaysia and singapore are unique given that they have the highest rainfall intensities and depths and a higher bin may indicate that a larger portion of the total mass may be made available for washoff due to higher storm energy of tropical rainfall although pampano beach is classified as tropical the intensities and depths are significantly lower than that in singapore and malaysia if bin is understood to be the initial mass expressed either as mass per unit area or length and for eq 1 to be dimensionally consistent then the units for c3 will vary depending on the value of c4 the inconsistency in the units for c3 is problematic and contributes to the difficulty in gaining a proper understanding of the parameter a further comparison of the washoff model parameters reported in the literature gaumeet al 1998 barco et al 2004 tempranoet al 2006 hood et al 2007 hossain et al 2010 crobeddu and bennis 2011 chow et al 2012 hossain et al 2012 wickeet al 2012 bonhomme and petrucci 2017 rezaei et al 2019 for residential urban land use was done the values reported in the literature show that while there is general agreement that the bulk of the reported values of c4 varies between 0 5 and 2 0 for all pollutant types the range for c3 is wide and has the largest uncertainty studies done by alley 1981 and berretta et al 2007 have shown that c3 varied for every event at the same site sutherland and jelen 2003 have also discouraged the use of a constant value of c3 other studies have suggested that c3 cannot be treated as constant but depends on the runoff rate and volume nakamura 1984 richardson and tripp 2006 rainfall intensity and catchment area sonnen 1980 rainfall volume and duration and mass of pollutants accumulated on the catchment surface osuch pajdzinska 1987 when the mann whitney test was applied to the pooled dataset for c3 it showed that for all pollutants the difference in c3 between the temperate and tropical datasets was significant p 05 hence it is suggested that because of the difference in rainfall and runoff behavior it will be erroneous to use similar values for the c3 washoff coefficient for catchments in temperate and tropical climates 4 3 model parameter dependence on rainfall factors further insights into the dependence of washoff response to different rainfall and runoff conditions were obtained from correlation analysis done on the pooled tropical and temperate datasets this will elucidate the dependence of model parameters on climatic classification as any difference in behavior found may provide clarity on the physical significance of the model parameters prior to correlation analysis the lilliefors test ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 was first conducted on the pooled datasets to understand how the model parameters rainfall and flow variables are distributed testing against the normal lognormal and exponential distributions the test results indicated that for the temperate dataset c3 bin d imax and iav are log normally distributed whereas c4 is normally distributed similar results were obtained for the tropical dataset with the exception of imax which was also found to be normally distributed the pearson correlation analysis was therefore used to investigate correlations between the washoff model parameters with rainfall variables the results of this analysis are shown in fig 6 which includes the pearson correlation coefficient r and p values in general the number of significant α 0 05 0 01 correlations between the rainfall variables with model parameters which are observed for both tropical and temperate datasets is higher for tss and reduces to at most two significant correlations for mixed tp and dissolved op forms this is expected since the washoff model is better suited for particulates gaut et al 2019 as understood by a particulate transport process governed by critical stress criteria it is also observed that the spread for the tss data is considerably lesser than for the tp and op indicating that any attribution of parameter dependence on rainfall characteristics will be more applicable to pollutants in particulate form comparing between the temperate and tropics datasets for tss the tropical dataset has a larger number of significant correlations between the model parameters and rainfall variables the variable c4 was least correlated with rainfall characteristics this observation provides further confirmation that c4 is more closely related to transport behavior and therefore cannot be distinguished by rainfall characteristics this is in contrast to c3 and bin which are more correlated to the rainfall variables indicating that these parameters have a closer correspondence with rainfall the variable c3 is negatively correlated with rainfall variables interestingly le et al 2017 observed that for tss c3 was correlated with d only when d 5 mm a similar observation appears in the temperate dataset as well where it is noticed in fig 6a that c3 is almost constant when d 5 mm and begins to decrease with increasing d for d 5 mm bin is generally positively correlated with the rainfall variables this is consistent with the availability concept in washoff modeling egodawatta et al 2007 shaw et al 2010 pitt et al 2005 the greater dependence of bin on the available mass for washoff which is characterized by rainfall characteristics as compared to factors such as the antecedent dry period which is popular in buildup models has also been discussed by gaut et al 2019 shaw et al 2010 le et al 2017 duncan 1995a duncan 1995b vaze and chiew 2003 and borris et al 2014 given the correspondence of c3 and bin with rainfall it is also observed that correlations of bin for tss differ between climatic conditions in temperate regions bin correlates strongly with both the average and maximum intensities whereas in tropical catchments maximum intensity and depth were found to be significant the strong dependence with intensity in the temperate catchments can be understood by the dependence of rainfall energy on raindrop size which is inked to intensity early studies hudson 1963 wischmeier and smith 1978 have shown that the rainfall energy increases with increase in rainfall intensity up to a maximum value of 3 in hr 76 2 mm hr beyond this value of rainfall intensity raindrop size ceases to increase and kinetic energy attains a peak value as this limit is reached more often in the tropics than in temperate regions washoff can be expected to be more sensitive to variations in rainfall intensities in temperate catchments in the tropics however d is significant presumably relating to dilution dilution has been identified as a significant process and has been used to explain lower observed values of emc is tropical catchments chow et al 2013 lim 2003 and chua et al 2009 5 conclusions the washoff model approach is conceptually easy to understand and popular with practitioners our approach has been to provide a better understanding to what is already a widely accepted model though popular ambiguities around the use of washoff modelling approach exist this paper attempted to address some of these uncertainties by moving away from a black box approach in providing an understanding of model parameter dependence to physical factors to our knowledge this is the first study looking at such processes across climatic zones and further studies of this nature are needed to gain better insights on how the washoff model functions the following are conclusions from this study calibrated values for the exponential washoff model parameters c3 and bin were found to be log normally distributed and varied by up to 2 orders of magnitude for the same pollutant at the same site for both temperate and tropical datasets parameter c4 however was found to be normally distributed with a value 0 5 2 0 for all pollutants for both the tropical and temperate datasets quartile ranges or the spread of parameter values were typically greater for dissolved pollutants such as nh4 and op than particulates the accuracy of the washoff model was clearly best for particulate pollutant tss and worst for dissolved pollutants with mixed pollutants tp and tn falling in between these two extremes bin represents the available mass on the surface at the start of a washoff event this is evidenced by observations that a significantly higher value of bin is observed for tss in the tropical dataset indicating that a larger portion of the total mass may be made available for washoff because of the greater storm energy associated with tropical rainfall the small variation in c4 across all sites is due to its dependence on local flow conditions linked to the friction velocity this is evidenced by the observation that c4 varies over a narrow range for all datasets the parameters c3 and bin are correlated with rainfall the range for c3 is wide and has the larger uncertainty hence it is suggested that because of the difference in rainfall and runoff behavior it will be erroneous to use similar values for the c3 washoff coefficient for temperate and tropical catchments of all the rainfall characteristics investigated the rainfall depth for the current event was found to be the single parameter that correlated well with bin and c3 for tss the strength of this dependence diminishes for pollutants in mixed and dissolved forms it is observed for both the temperate and tropical datasets that for tss c3 is significantly correlated with d if d 5 mm this is likely due to the rainfall being non uniform when d 5 mm moreover in temperate regions bin correlates strongly with both the average and maximum intensities whereas in tropical catchments maximum intensity and depth were found to be significant the more obvious dependence with intensity in temperate catchments can be understood by the dependence of rainfall energy on raindrop size which is dependent on intensity the number of significant p 05 01 correlations between the rainfall variables with model parameters is highest for particulates and lower for mixed tn tp and lowest for dissolved pollutants this is expected since the washoff model is better suited for particulates as understood by a particulate transport process c4 had the least number of correlations with the rainfall variables providing further evidence that c4 is not directly dependent on rainfall the datasets used in this paper are from residential catchments in tropical and temperate climates the focus on residential catchments was largely driven by the lack of good quality continuous rainfall and flow data and accompanying storm water quality data for other land uses while we do not expect the overall conclusions to deviate significantly for other tropical and temperate catchments results for dry arid catchments are unknown driver and tasker 1990 observed that runoff load estimates were more accurate in areas with lesser rainfall and vice versa this was attributed to the longer antecedent dry periods in dry arid climates it can be argued that buildup and washoff models may be more suitable for dry arid climates as a result compared to the tropics for example where the antecedent period is limited and is primarily driven by rainfall energy hence the response of the model parameters for catchments in dry arid climate may differ from results obtained in this study further comparative studies are therefore needed credit authorship contribution statement shagun conceptualization data curation formal analysis

4008,the deterioration of water quality in shallow groundwater systems over the past decades has attracted increased amounts of attention from hydrogeologists groundwater vulnerability and its changes are the factors that cause groundwater deterioration combining of the mean residence times mrts with chemical characteristics of groundwater can be applied to understand groundwater vulnerability and its changes the groundwater mrts ranged from 6 to 180 years with mrts of 6 to 77 years in the shallow aquifer spatial distribution of groundwater mrts suggested that young groundwater trended to extend relatively uniform mrts and concentrations of ions were found above the main pumped well depth high concentrations of ions k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were mainly distributed in the western piedmont plain areas with short turnover time but with low productivity meaning that the aquifer is susceptible to human activities and hardly migrate out elevated concentrations of nitrate and others ions such as k ca2 cl and so4 2 also were observed in moderately old groundwater 20 mrts 80 years indicating that some mixing with recent water within mrts 20 years likely occurs through vertical drainage from the upper to deeper in the single aquifer and that lateral flow occurs along flow paths towards the piezometric depressions caused by the pumping in urban areas slightly elevated hco3 and k were found at east of the areas with long residence times suggested that water salt equilibrium had also been disrupted therefore the anthropogenic influence exceeded the natural attenuation in the current groundwater environment on the piedmont plain and the shijiazhuang groundwater system was identified to be tending more vulnerable under anthropogenic influence some measures must be taken to significantly reduce groundwater withdrawal and pollutant discharge keywords tritium time series data mean residence time hydrochemistry vulnerability north china plain 1 introduction groundwater vulnerability is the sensitivity of groundwater quality affected by anthropogenic activities groundwater age which is a key indicator of vulnerability represents the time since groundwater recharged and is often the moment when pollutants enter the water cycle visser et al 2013 intense pumping can alter natural flow regimes leading to vertical migration of contaminants to deeper water bodies lapworth et al 2018 macdonald et al 2016 hoque et al 2014 declines in the quantity and quality of groundwater induced by overexploitation have been found by some previous studies cheng et al 2017 niu et al 2017 khan et al 2016 zurek et al 2015 moreover groundwater vulnerability and its changes under the pressure of overexploitation are the factors that causer groundwater to deteriorate generally groundwater with young apparent age i e that is frequently recharged from surface flow exhibits rapid respond to pollutants while old groundwater with slow movement and long pathways has greater potentialduration for the attenuation of contaminants and water rock interactions than that of young water pisinaras et al 2016 gurdak and qi 2012 mendizabal and stuyfzand 2011 thus high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants usually were found in the young groundwater whereas high levels of hydrochemical ions derived from natural geogenic sources can be found in the old water santoni et al 2016 visser 2009 these different trends of hadrochemical concentrations with water age can allow us to distinguish the impacts on groundwater quality caused by human activities from those caused by groundwater evolution morgenstern and daughney 2012 therefore considering groundwater residence time and hydrochemistry in combination can significantly improve our understanding of anthropogenic impacts on groundwater quality and provide insight into the vulnerability of aquifers radiogenic tritium 3h has been shown to be a useful tool for determining groundwater residence times chen et al 2003a b lapworth et al 2012 liu et al 2014 su et al 2019 which also can better understanding of the groundwater vulnerability duda and kowalczyk 2019 tritium is the only straightforward and valid age tracer for part of a water molecule and is not affected by any hydrochemical or biological reactions clark and fritz 1997 since the bomb peak of tritium occurred several decades ago and 3h activities decayed a single measurement of tritium concentration is often consistent with several possible groundwater ages this ambiguity can be overcome with tritium time series data using a time series method the unique solution of the convolution integral with age distribution parameters can be established to facilitate more accurate interpretations of groundwater residence time morgenstern et al 2015 the groundwater system located in the area of shijiazhuang sjz in the piedmont region of the north china plain ncp has experienced deterioration in groundwater quality numerous studies had been conducted in the sjz area to address groundwater residence time chen et al 2003a b kreuzer et al 2009 these studies revealed the conditions of groundwater flow and renewability of the groundwater system however due to the differences of research objectives and the inadequate data few studies had focused on the relationships between groundwater residence time and the ions in groundwater e g hydrochemistry and contaminants furthermore the presence of nitrate in groundwater is related to recharge resources and flow patterns which can be determined from the residence time su et al 2019 alikhani et al 2016 the combination of tritium data from past decades with the new data allows us to obtain more accurate groundwater ages the main purposes of this study are to 1 obtain comprehensive insight into residence time and the flow patterns of the shijiazhuang area north china plain 2 identify the evolution mechanisms of groundwater residence time and hydrochemistry and 3 characterize groundwater vulnerability under the condition of exploitation the results may be used to control groundwater contamination 2 hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the ncp which is one of the largest alluvial plains the ncp consists of the piedmont fluvial plain the central alluvial and flood plain and the littoral delta plain chen et al 2003a b this study mainly focuses on the single unconfined aquifer in the piedmont area of the taihang mountains fig 1 around the sjz city which is a major recharge area of groundwater in npc the study area has a continental semiarid temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 c and a mean annual rainfall of approximately 540 mm approximately 70 of the total rainfall occurs from june to august the hutuo river is an ephemeral river in which water flow occurs only during the rainy season and the huangbizhuang reservoir hbz res is located in its upstream stretch groundwater is the major source of water for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes in sjz the main pumping target is the quaternary aquifer system the aquifer is composed of a single layer with gravel and sand the thickness is up to approximately 160 m in the piedmont plain it extends to the east of sjz city near site 24 to site 22 fig 1 chen et al 2001 where is the boundary of single unconfined aquifer the deposits is characterized by a thick layer of sand and gravel with wrapped clay due to the discontinuous clay or aquitard layer the aquifer hydraulic connection is generally high the sediments of all layers become increasingly fine along the flow direction typically changing from sandy gravel in the piedmont plain to medium to fine sand in the central plain archean gneiss and proterozoic carbonates underlie the unconsolidated quaternary sediments chen et al 2005 groundwater flows from west to east with a withdrawal related central cone of depression in the urban sjz area fig 1 in the hutuo river valley plain the aquifer mainly consists of coarse grained sandy gravel and the hydraulic conductivity ks and specific yield sy are good table 1 and fig 1 in contrast in the western part of the piedmont plain some slit and clay are inserted in the gravelly sediments resulting in a poor water conductivity and water yield fig 1 the unconfined piedmont plain is one of the main recharge areas of the ncp groundwater system foster et al 2004 the groundwater in the piedmont region is primarily recharged by precipitation river infiltration of irrigation returns flow and lateral inflow from the taihang mountains fig 1 yang et al 2002 it is noted that the irrigation return flow has become a substantial component of areal recharge kendy et al 2004 however the dynamics of groundwater system had been altered by the overpumping in recent decades consequently a groundwater cone of depression has been developing since 1961 fig 1 the groundwater flow directions have been reshaped to flow to the cone of depression currently the depth to the water table in this area is approximately 10 40 m meanwhile it can reach 50 m below ground surface in the groundwater depression area cheng et al 2017 von rohden et al 2010 currently the main land use types in the region are cultivated land wasteland including mountains and barren land urban land surface water and rural land zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 except for six sample sites from urban land sites 13 14 18 23 42 and 43 the sample sites were mainly located in areas of cultivated land and rural residential land nutrients in the groundwater mainly originated from fertilizers associated to high intensity farming nitrate contamination is an important indicator of groundwater deterioration which is caused by the usage of manure and discharge of untreated urban and industrial wastewater in the area zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2015 chen et al 2006 3 methods and data sources 3 1 sampling and data sources samples were mainly taken from the municipal or agricultural wells which are usually equipped with submersible pumps groundwater was sampled from the wells after pumping for approximately half an hour a totalof 141 samples for tritium analysis were collected at 44 sites fig 1 table 2 repeatedly during the period from 1982 to 2018 a few original sampled wells were not available or accessible therefore in later periods samples were collected from the nearby wells with the same depths additionally 29 hydrochemical samples were collected in the study area fig 1 major anions with the exception of hco3 were analyzed by a thermo scientific dionex ics 4000 system precision 1 the hco3 concentration was titrated by phenolphthalein titration cations were analyzed by an optima 8300 perkinelmer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes precision 1 at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology iheg chinese academy of geological sciences tritium analyses were performed at the iheg by low level counting after conversion of water into h2 gas with a detection limit and precision of approximately 0 1 tu the time series data for tritium were reconstructed from previous studies conducted in 1982 2010 von rohden et al 2010 kreuzer et al 2009 chen et al 2005 wan et al 2003 zhang et al 1987 and the samples were collected in 2010 2018 for this study it is noted that the analysis methods of 3h for the previous studies were same and the detection limited improved from 1tu to 0 1tu these data were also had been verified by cheng 2015 and cheng et al 2017 therefore the data validation was cross checked to ensure that the data were adequate for this study 3 2 groundwater transit times based on the repeated tritium dating the transit time of groundwater represents the time elapsed since the recharge of the tracer from precipitation this term is equivalent to turnover time mean residence time mrt and transit time age the continued decrease in values of 3h in rainfall limits the use of the 3h method for groundwater age dating however using time series tritium data the range and precision of dating can be enhanced cartwright et al 2017 the mean age can be calculated by using lumped parameter models maloszewski and zuber 1996 by using time series 3h lumped parameter models have been used effectively for more than four decades to interpret groundwater age data based on 3h and other tracers rodriguez et al 2021 su et al 2019 liu et al 2014 cook and herczeg 1999 aquifers are recharged through many kinds of processes in the study area thus the dispersion model dm was chosen to characterize the groundwater system the relation among input tracer concentration cin t ie the tracer concentration in recharge water precipitation and the concentration in the sampled water from wells cout t is generally given by the following convolution integral maloszewski and zuber 1996 1 c out t t c in τ g t τ e λ t τ d τ 2 g τ 1 τ 1 4 π τ p d t t e 1 τ t t 2 4 p d τ t t where τ is the time of water entry into the system g t τ is the weighting function defined as the transit time distribution function of conservative particles that entered the system at time τ λ is the radioactive decay constant for 3h 12 34 years t is the time of water exit from the system t τ is the transit time of water parcel and tt is the mean transit time of the tracer 3h in this paper of the sample the parameter pd represents the apparent dispersivity of the system practically pd depends on the distribution of travel times the value of sigma ʃ represents the mrts error range the parameters pd and sigma ʃ together with the mrts obtained by fitting observed tritium time series data to match model outputs were calculated by the computer program flowpc maloszewski and zuber 1996 although the 3h 3he method is equal to the piston flow model and could be disturbed by some processes such as gas exchange excess air and chemical degradation morgenstern and daughney 2012 the 3h 3he age dating method is still accurate because 3he is the daughter product of 3h decay and the input function of 3h does not need be known to calculate a residence time cartwright et al 2017 this approach was used in this study to validate the results of the tritium time series data method at 14 of 44 sites the results had been determined by the 3h 3he method kreuzer et al 2009 the results of the two methods are plotted and close to the line 1 1 in fig 2 a therefore the mrts of groundwater calculated by the tritium time series data are suitable and accurate moreover this method can be extended to model mrts exceeding 60 years which is the upper limit of the 3h 3he age dating method 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean residence times calculated from tritium time series data matched results of the optimal mrts are listed in table 2 along with the goodness of fit parameters pd and ʃ and 6 of 44 sites were plotted in fig 2b as example to shown the samples of the 6 sites with the best fit curves the mrts ranged from 6 to 77 years within well depths 100 m and reached 180 years for depths 100 m table 2 the sites with mrts 100 years were distributed on the edge of the piedmont plain fig 3a they recharged early in the last century when the surface and subsurface environments had undergone little anthropogenic alteration thus they appeared to reflect the natural baseline conditions of the groundwater system the groundwater sites with mrts 20 years were mainly in the western and central parts of the piedmont plain fig 3a the areas mainly recharged from rain and irrigation return water rapid vertical inflow and rapid turnover of groundwater occurred in these areas due to with high vertical permeability of unsaturated zone von rohden et al 2010 liu et al 2009 however in some part of western piedmont plain region from shangzhuang to tongye the thinness of the aquifer resulted in a limited amount of aquifer storage and the aquifer contains multiple thin layers of clay fig 3b section b b the water flow in this region was relatively slow and anisotropic the mrts ranged from 10 years to 40 years the range of mrts was larger in the western than in the northwestern part of the piedmont plain groundwater samples with ages 40 years were mainly distributed in the east south part of the study area where ks and sy are relatively low fig 1 l4 the vertical inflow recharge from rain and irrigation returns decreased while the lateral inflow recharge increased fig 3b the flow and renewability were low especially where old water was distributed mrts 80 years the mrts of groundwater in the cone of depression ranged from 6 years site 25 to 52 years site 43 the range of groundwater age in this region 45 years is large for such a small region this large range can be explained by old water via lateral flow along flow paths towards the piezometric depressions created by pumping where it mixed with recent water from vertical flow but due to differing conductivities ks the mixture ratios varied spatially the main mixture model of pumped groundwater in the cone was demonstrated by cheng 2015 and the pumped water age ranged from 20 years to 80 years as shown in fig 3a the cone of depression was divided into four parts based on the mrts of the groundwater young water was found in areas i1 and i2 with mrts 20 years intermediate age water was found in the area ii with mrts from 20 a to 40 years and relatively old water was found in area iii with mrts 40 a in area i coefficients of ks and sy are high in zone l1 near the tai hang mts so the aquifer is recharged adequately and renewed actively the area iii ks and sy are relatively low in zone l2 leading to a relatively slow recharge and poor renewal rate a vertical recharge component was demonstrated by the isoline of water mrts in fig 3b the flow direction was oriented toward the cone of depression the mrts of all sites with depths in the cone 60 m were younger than 20 years these findings suggested that intense exploitation of groundwater enhanced the vertical inflow and shortened the turnover time the young water body had also extended downward as the water table declined the mrt of site 23 was only 9 years although a thin layer of clay was located above the aquifer fig 3a site 23 this site in the area was most affected by overpumping for irrigation and industrial water in contrast the deep groundwater mrt reached 77 years which was observed at site 18 a narrow clay lying above the aquifer may result in recharge primarily occurring from lateral flow mixing with little recharge from vertical inflow the age of the groundwater is probably older than 80 years in the natural state therefore an enhanced vertical inflow may have occurred under the intense exploitation 4 2 spatial characteristics of hydrochemistry the spatial variability of hydrochemistry no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 are presented in fig 4 a d see table s1 for details of the hydrochemical parameters overall there is not significant spatial correlation for these hydrochemical parameters in the study area fig 4 the high concentrations of ions were distributed in the western parts of the study area characterized by young groundwater with mrts 20 years but some of the sampled sites in close proximity to one another in the young water area had significantly different signatures of concentrations in fig 4 high spatial scattering of the concentrations of k na cl no3 and so4 2 was demonstrated this pattern is probably the result of anthropogenic activity min et al 2018 morgrnstern et al 2012 rather than geogenic sources the permeability of deposit sediments ks fig 1 is relatively high and the turnover time is short in the area hence contaminants can rapidly migrate into aquifers the highest concentrations of ions occurred mainly in the western part of the study area due to the high renewability and low water yields in this region the highest values of k mg 2 hco3 no3 total dissolved solids tds and hardness were found at site 9 and the highest of so4 2 value was occurred at site 1 which are both dominated by agricultural land use however the highest concentration of na was found at site 15 and the highest concentration of ca2 and cl were observed at site 44 these sites are in urban areas zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2017 the areas were formerly irrigated by wastewater wang et al 2016 consequently they exhibited a relatively high vulnerability to low water quality high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 were mainly distributed in the western piedmont plain while high concentrations of mg2 were found mostly in the northwestern part of the piedmont plain tds and total hardness are comprehensive features of water quality and exhibited similar patterns the groundwater with high tds and total hardness values was mainly observed in the western part of the piedmont plain although ca2 mg2 and hco3 are derived not only from artificial contaminants but also from water rock reactions geogenic sources they originate mainly from artificial contaminants in the young groundwater group the quality of groundwater was better in the northern portion than in the western portion of the cone of depression in the northern portion of the cone contaminants easily infiltrate into the aquifer and quickly flow out because of the short residence time with high ks and sy values zone l1 in fig 1 and area i in fig 4 in the western portion of the cone contaminants easily infiltrate into the aquifer but slowly flow out because of the relatively long residence time with low ks and sy values zone l2 in fig 1 and area ii in fig 4 furthermore a few layers of silt and clay were present there fig 3b which can adsorb contaminants and reduce migration capabilities borisover and davis 2015 4 3 changes in hydrochemistry with mean residence times the changes in hydrochemistry with mrts can indicate natural geogenic element compositions and anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater in the natural state ions in groundwater are mainly derived from precipitation and dissolution of surrounding rocks and minerals and the chemical content of groundwater increases with retention time in the piedmont plain morgrnstern et al 2015 visser 2009 if aquifers are affected by human activities the trends of increasing concentrations with water age are reversed for example high concentrations of ions especially no3 appear in younger groundwater martínez salvador et al 2019 alikhani et al 2016 the concentrations of ions tds and total hardness varied among the groundwater samples with mrts younger than 20 years 20 80 years and older than 80 years fig 5 significantly higher concentrations of ions no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were found in the young groundwater with mrts 20 years and no clear trends with mrts were observed among the samples of young groundwater the elevated ion concentrations in the young water were probably not derived from geogenic sources rather they were likely anthropogenic contaminants from human land use activities and sewage which usually obtain high salinity pant et al 2020 mahlknecht et al 2017 the ion concentrations increased with groundwater age for the samples with mrts of 20 to 80 years this increase was in accordance with changes in geogenic resources the concentrations in these samples appeared to be dominated by water rock interactions however the concentrations were still higher than those of groundwater with mrts 80 years these concentrations were also affected by groundwater exploitation and anthropogenic contamination in addition the main pumped water body were in the range of 20 years to 80 years cheng 2015 which reflected its mixing with recently recharged groundwater with high concentrations of ions groundwater with mrts 80 years were little impacted by anthropogenic activities for relatively low ion concentrations in this groundwater group a significantly negative correlation between concentrations of ions and groundwater ages were found except for k cl and no3 fig 5a c d which are steady at distinctly low concentration notably the concentration of ions also tended to decrease with groundwater mrts the difference may be attributed to the natural attenuation of contaminants and strengthened water rock interactions for enriched oxidation environments under a falling water table lapworth et al 2018 2017 cheng 2015 k cl and no3 in the study area are mainly derived from agrochemical and domestic sewage chen et al 2006 li et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the concentrations of these compounds were elevated in groundwater with mrts 80 years no3 is an indicator of the influence of human activities on the groundwater environment its concentration reached 100 mg l in young groundwater with mrts 20 years in addition the concentrations of k and cl reached 3 4 mg l and 252 6 mg l in young groundwater with mrts 20 years respectively the concentrations of these ions were also high in groundwater with mrts of 20 to 80 years these results suggested that the groundwater with mrts 80 years especially that with mrts 20 years was anthropogenic contaminated according to the relationship between the concentrations of no3 and the mrts the concentrations may continue to increase with time because of nitrification of nh4 in the unsaturated zone the low rate of denitrification in young water or accumulative effects wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the concentration of so4 2 reached 300 mg l in young groundwater within mrts 20 years high concentration of so4 2 is often linked with high no3 but no clear relationship existed between the two ions is observed the correlations of the hydrochemical parameters of groundwater are provided in table s2 this finding suggested different sources for the two ions although sulfur is a component of fertilizers the primary source of so4 2 is detergents with small amounts derived from gypsum and oxidation of inorganic sulfur and reduction by microbial reactions zhou et al 2016 accordingly in the present study so4 2 was decreased distinctly in groundwater with mrts in the group groundwater over 20 years 4 4 characteristics of vulnerability in the shallow groundwater system generally groundwater travel times and concentrations of geogenic ions such as ca2 mg2 and hco3 increase with depth in unconsolidated aquifers broers 2004 the trends may be reversed by anthropic activities the distributions of residence times found within the shallow groundwater at depths 80 m was consistent with mrts 10 to 80 years particularly in zone l1with a high ks value fig 6 young mrts groundwater are indicative of rapid recharge and high vulnerability the high concentrations of no3 so4 2 and tds in wells with depths 80 m fig 6 also suggest rapid recharge and indicate that the aquifer system is vulnerable to vertical contaminant migration at depths 80 m however no clear relationships among concentrations of no3 so4 2 and tds with wells depths were observed such phenomenon can probably be explained by the high pumping rates leading to the enhanced vertical recharge and the mixing of groundwater with different residence times lapworth et al 2017 at present most agricultural well depths are 80 m and they are intensively pumped during agricultural seasons the vulnerability of groundwater tended to be uniform and higher for groundwater of depths 80 m under intensive pumping conditions high concentrations of ions no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were observed in the northwestern parts of the study area due to rapid recharge fig 4 groundwater could be easily contaminated along with high vulnerability in those areas where the groundwater was young however for the youngest groundwater mrt 10 years in area i1 the higher concentrations of ions were not consistently maintained due to the high renewability and productivity related to the high inflow and outflow rates with little clay in the western of the piedmont plain short turnover time were observed as result of thin aquifer however a strong gradient in groundwater age was observed fig 3a within few discontinuous clay layers characterized low ks and sy values fig 1 and fig 3b slow water flow had a low capacity to migrate contaminants thus contaminations can easily enter the aquifer via rapid inflow infiltration but hardly migrate out furthermore the adsorption of clay mineral may strengthen the retention of contaminants the aquifer was generally at high risk of contamination i e highly vulnerable the groundwater in the area exhibited high no3 concentrations and high hardness values in the eastern part of the study area from zone l1 to zone l2 and zone l4 the stratum lithology is dominated by clay layers which leads to a decreased ks and sy values the groundwater is mainly recharged by the later flow with an old mrts relative to those in the western part in addition the groundwater turnover times were long and a slow moving region generated fig 3 therefore contaminants cannot easily andrapidly infiltrate into the aquifers or groundwater relatively lower concentrations of ions were observed except for k and hco3 fig 4 a low vulnerability in these areas was demonstrated 4 5 vulnerability response to intensive groundwater exploitation a short residence time was associated with a high groundwater vulnerability but vulnerability can be impacted by both anthropogenic activity and hydrogeological settings surprisingly the groundwater quality was low at sites 18 and 20 which are associated with old residence times and deep wells table 1 and fig 6 the hydrochemistry is characterized by an elevated concentrations of cl ca2 hco3 tds and hardness and elevated no3 concentrations was also found in the site 18 these sites have probably been impacted by anthropogenic activity such as sewage irrigation an agricultural manure and sanitary sewage were the dominant sources of no3 and cl at most groundwater sites in the study area wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 intense deeper pumping is expected to enhance the vertical recharge from shallow young water resulting in an increased concentration of no3 and cl in deep groundwater aquifer this means that the deeper groundwater is potentially vulnerable to vertical breakthrough of contaminants from shallow aquifers when exploitation of deep groundwater therefore the deep groundwater probably tended to be vulnerable to anthropogenic contaminants slight groundwater deterioration at site 22 was evidenced by the elevated concentrations of hco3 and k values with long residence times this deterioration can be attributed to the disruption of the equilibrium between water and salt of caco3minerals due to the declining of water table ma et al 2018 cheng et al 2017 the groundwater environment trended to oxidize and became enriched in co2 cation exchange may explain for the elevated k but not ca2 these results suggest that the aquifer tended to be deterioration for enhance dissolution of geogenic sources e g caco3 minerals in the study under overpumping condition according to the above analysis although groundwater vulnerability varies with the mrts the depth and hydrogeologic parameters vulnerability would be enhanced by intense exploitation which can cause water quality deterioration a conceptual diagram showing the vulnerability and inflow flow mechanism of groundwater system in response to exploitation is presented in fig 7 1 intense exploitation induced a relatively high vulnerability to anthropogenic contaminations above the main pumped well depth the potential mixing of groundwater with different residence times or recharge times was increased by enhanced vertical recharge and horizontal flow as evidenced by the absence of clear relationships among mrts concentration of ions and well depth within a depth range 2 old residence times groundwater tends to be geogenic deteriorations due to water salt equilibrium being disrupted the hydrogeological environment trended to be oxidized and enriched in co2 with the decline of the water table the water rock interactions of this groundwater have been enhanced as evidenced by elevated concentrations of geogenic sources for example hco3 and k 3 deep groundwater tends to be vulnerable to shallow anthropogenic contamination young water bodies shift downward with the decline in the water table resulting in the vertical migration of anthropogenic contaminants to deeper groundwater due to the intense pumping of deeper groundwater it proved by the elevated concentration of anthropogenic contaminants such as no3 and cl in the study in the deep water samples a similar phenomenon that elevated concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants e g no3 pb as well as a number of pesticides in the deeper part of an aquifer was found by lapworth et al 2018 and 2017 5 conclusion and implications the groundwater environment in the study area has been impacted by anthropogenic pressure the water table has shifted downward and the water quality has deteriorated in local groundwater systems seriously restricting the sustainable development of the local economy and the stability of human society ma et al 2018 one of the causes is groundwater vulnerability and its changes under the pressure of overexploitation the mrts of groundwater was calculated by using the dispersion model with the tritium time series method they ranged from 6 to over 80 years young groundwater with mrts 20 years was distributed in the west and northwest of the piedmont plain the permeability ranges from low to high from west to east within the area west of the hutuo river over time shortened of the mrts and increased water recycling were caused by exploitation moderately old water with mrts of 20 80 years occurred mainly in the central and eastern portions of the plain including the southern portion of the cone of depression where the aquifer s permeability and water yields are relatively poor in the cone of depression young water had shifted downward probably due to exploitation and the mrts may tend to be young over time the groundwater in the east of the plain had long residence times with mrts 60 years the concentrations of hydrochemical compounds in the groundwater samples decreased with mrts in the order of 20 years 20 80 years and 80 years the results suggested that young groundwater with mrts 20 years was strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity due to high vulnerability the impacts extended to old groundwater with mrts 80 years the high concentrations of ions no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were mainly distributed in the north west of the piedmont plain in conjunction with groundwater residence times 20 years because of the short turnover times and high renewability the aquifer was highly vulnerable in groundwater with mrts 20 years in the west the piedmont plain with low ks and sy distinct water deterioration occurred high renewability and low productivity were the factors that driving the deterioration of groundwater quality in this region slightly elevated concentrations of hco3 and k were also observed in groundwater with mrts 80 years in the eastern portion of the piedmont plain these high values probably resulted from disruption of the water rock equilibrium associated with overexploitation the vulnerability of the groundwater system can be increased by intense exploitation to some extent therefore three mechanisms were identified summarized as follows 1 the shallow groundwater system is more vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination the regions of young water had become more extensive and relatively agreed mixed with recent recharges 2 the groundwater system is deteriorating for water salt equilibrium disrupted water rock interactions would be enhanced and elevated concentrations of hydrochemical components such as hco3 developed 3 deeper water became vulnerable to surface anthropogenic contaminants enhanced vertical flow and recharge increased the risks of contamination therefore water quality deterioration occurred with intense groundwater exploitation or overpumping the relationships between mrts and chemical tracers indicate that the shallow aquifer system is suffering deterioration and more vulnerable than before on the piedmont plain a comprehensive strategy should be developed to control contaminants flowing into areas with young groundwater deep old groundwater is at risk of nitrate contamination and

4008,the deterioration of water quality in shallow groundwater systems over the past decades has attracted increased amounts of attention from hydrogeologists groundwater vulnerability and its changes are the factors that cause groundwater deterioration combining of the mean residence times mrts with chemical characteristics of groundwater can be applied to understand groundwater vulnerability and its changes the groundwater mrts ranged from 6 to 180 years with mrts of 6 to 77 years in the shallow aquifer spatial distribution of groundwater mrts suggested that young groundwater trended to extend relatively uniform mrts and concentrations of ions were found above the main pumped well depth high concentrations of ions k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were mainly distributed in the western piedmont plain areas with short turnover time but with low productivity meaning that the aquifer is susceptible to human activities and hardly migrate out elevated concentrations of nitrate and others ions such as k ca2 cl and so4 2 also were observed in moderately old groundwater 20 mrts 80 years indicating that some mixing with recent water within mrts 20 years likely occurs through vertical drainage from the upper to deeper in the single aquifer and that lateral flow occurs along flow paths towards the piezometric depressions caused by the pumping in urban areas slightly elevated hco3 and k were found at east of the areas with long residence times suggested that water salt equilibrium had also been disrupted therefore the anthropogenic influence exceeded the natural attenuation in the current groundwater environment on the piedmont plain and the shijiazhuang groundwater system was identified to be tending more vulnerable under anthropogenic influence some measures must be taken to significantly reduce groundwater withdrawal and pollutant discharge keywords tritium time series data mean residence time hydrochemistry vulnerability north china plain 1 introduction groundwater vulnerability is the sensitivity of groundwater quality affected by anthropogenic activities groundwater age which is a key indicator of vulnerability represents the time since groundwater recharged and is often the moment when pollutants enter the water cycle visser et al 2013 intense pumping can alter natural flow regimes leading to vertical migration of contaminants to deeper water bodies lapworth et al 2018 macdonald et al 2016 hoque et al 2014 declines in the quantity and quality of groundwater induced by overexploitation have been found by some previous studies cheng et al 2017 niu et al 2017 khan et al 2016 zurek et al 2015 moreover groundwater vulnerability and its changes under the pressure of overexploitation are the factors that causer groundwater to deteriorate generally groundwater with young apparent age i e that is frequently recharged from surface flow exhibits rapid respond to pollutants while old groundwater with slow movement and long pathways has greater potentialduration for the attenuation of contaminants and water rock interactions than that of young water pisinaras et al 2016 gurdak and qi 2012 mendizabal and stuyfzand 2011 thus high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants usually were found in the young groundwater whereas high levels of hydrochemical ions derived from natural geogenic sources can be found in the old water santoni et al 2016 visser 2009 these different trends of hadrochemical concentrations with water age can allow us to distinguish the impacts on groundwater quality caused by human activities from those caused by groundwater evolution morgenstern and daughney 2012 therefore considering groundwater residence time and hydrochemistry in combination can significantly improve our understanding of anthropogenic impacts on groundwater quality and provide insight into the vulnerability of aquifers radiogenic tritium 3h has been shown to be a useful tool for determining groundwater residence times chen et al 2003a b lapworth et al 2012 liu et al 2014 su et al 2019 which also can better understanding of the groundwater vulnerability duda and kowalczyk 2019 tritium is the only straightforward and valid age tracer for part of a water molecule and is not affected by any hydrochemical or biological reactions clark and fritz 1997 since the bomb peak of tritium occurred several decades ago and 3h activities decayed a single measurement of tritium concentration is often consistent with several possible groundwater ages this ambiguity can be overcome with tritium time series data using a time series method the unique solution of the convolution integral with age distribution parameters can be established to facilitate more accurate interpretations of groundwater residence time morgenstern et al 2015 the groundwater system located in the area of shijiazhuang sjz in the piedmont region of the north china plain ncp has experienced deterioration in groundwater quality numerous studies had been conducted in the sjz area to address groundwater residence time chen et al 2003a b kreuzer et al 2009 these studies revealed the conditions of groundwater flow and renewability of the groundwater system however due to the differences of research objectives and the inadequate data few studies had focused on the relationships between groundwater residence time and the ions in groundwater e g hydrochemistry and contaminants furthermore the presence of nitrate in groundwater is related to recharge resources and flow patterns which can be determined from the residence time su et al 2019 alikhani et al 2016 the combination of tritium data from past decades with the new data allows us to obtain more accurate groundwater ages the main purposes of this study are to 1 obtain comprehensive insight into residence time and the flow patterns of the shijiazhuang area north china plain 2 identify the evolution mechanisms of groundwater residence time and hydrochemistry and 3 characterize groundwater vulnerability under the condition of exploitation the results may be used to control groundwater contamination 2 hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the ncp which is one of the largest alluvial plains the ncp consists of the piedmont fluvial plain the central alluvial and flood plain and the littoral delta plain chen et al 2003a b this study mainly focuses on the single unconfined aquifer in the piedmont area of the taihang mountains fig 1 around the sjz city which is a major recharge area of groundwater in npc the study area has a continental semiarid temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 c and a mean annual rainfall of approximately 540 mm approximately 70 of the total rainfall occurs from june to august the hutuo river is an ephemeral river in which water flow occurs only during the rainy season and the huangbizhuang reservoir hbz res is located in its upstream stretch groundwater is the major source of water for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes in sjz the main pumping target is the quaternary aquifer system the aquifer is composed of a single layer with gravel and sand the thickness is up to approximately 160 m in the piedmont plain it extends to the east of sjz city near site 24 to site 22 fig 1 chen et al 2001 where is the boundary of single unconfined aquifer the deposits is characterized by a thick layer of sand and gravel with wrapped clay due to the discontinuous clay or aquitard layer the aquifer hydraulic connection is generally high the sediments of all layers become increasingly fine along the flow direction typically changing from sandy gravel in the piedmont plain to medium to fine sand in the central plain archean gneiss and proterozoic carbonates underlie the unconsolidated quaternary sediments chen et al 2005 groundwater flows from west to east with a withdrawal related central cone of depression in the urban sjz area fig 1 in the hutuo river valley plain the aquifer mainly consists of coarse grained sandy gravel and the hydraulic conductivity ks and specific yield sy are good table 1 and fig 1 in contrast in the western part of the piedmont plain some slit and clay are inserted in the gravelly sediments resulting in a poor water conductivity and water yield fig 1 the unconfined piedmont plain is one of the main recharge areas of the ncp groundwater system foster et al 2004 the groundwater in the piedmont region is primarily recharged by precipitation river infiltration of irrigation returns flow and lateral inflow from the taihang mountains fig 1 yang et al 2002 it is noted that the irrigation return flow has become a substantial component of areal recharge kendy et al 2004 however the dynamics of groundwater system had been altered by the overpumping in recent decades consequently a groundwater cone of depression has been developing since 1961 fig 1 the groundwater flow directions have been reshaped to flow to the cone of depression currently the depth to the water table in this area is approximately 10 40 m meanwhile it can reach 50 m below ground surface in the groundwater depression area cheng et al 2017 von rohden et al 2010 currently the main land use types in the region are cultivated land wasteland including mountains and barren land urban land surface water and rural land zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 except for six sample sites from urban land sites 13 14 18 23 42 and 43 the sample sites were mainly located in areas of cultivated land and rural residential land nutrients in the groundwater mainly originated from fertilizers associated to high intensity farming nitrate contamination is an important indicator of groundwater deterioration which is caused by the usage of manure and discharge of untreated urban and industrial wastewater in the area zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2015 chen et al 2006 3 methods and data sources 3 1 sampling and data sources samples were mainly taken from the municipal or agricultural wells which are usually equipped with submersible pumps groundwater was sampled from the wells after pumping for approximately half an hour a totalof 141 samples for tritium analysis were collected at 44 sites fig 1 table 2 repeatedly during the period from 1982 to 2018 a few original sampled wells were not available or accessible therefore in later periods samples were collected from the nearby wells with the same depths additionally 29 hydrochemical samples were collected in the study area fig 1 major anions with the exception of hco3 were analyzed by a thermo scientific dionex ics 4000 system precision 1 the hco3 concentration was titrated by phenolphthalein titration cations were analyzed by an optima 8300 perkinelmer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes precision 1 at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology iheg chinese academy of geological sciences tritium analyses were performed at the iheg by low level counting after conversion of water into h2 gas with a detection limit and precision of approximately 0 1 tu the time series data for tritium were reconstructed from previous studies conducted in 1982 2010 von rohden et al 2010 kreuzer et al 2009 chen et al 2005 wan et al 2003 zhang et al 1987 and the samples were collected in 2010 2018 for this study it is noted that the analysis methods of 3h for the previous studies were same and the detection limited improved from 1tu to 0 1tu these data were also had been verified by cheng 2015 and cheng et al 2017 therefore the data validation was cross checked to ensure that the data were adequate for this study 3 2 groundwater transit times based on the repeated tritium dating the transit time of groundwater represents the time elapsed since the recharge of the tracer from precipitation this term is equivalent to turnover time mean residence time mrt and transit time age the continued decrease in values of 3h in rainfall limits the use of the 3h method for groundwater age dating however using time series tritium data the range and precision of dating can be enhanced cartwright et al 2017 the mean age can be calculated by using lumped parameter models maloszewski and zuber 1996 by using time series 3h lumped parameter models have been used effectively for more than four decades to interpret groundwater age data based on 3h and other tracers rodriguez et al 2021 su et al 2019 liu et al 2014 cook and herczeg 1999 aquifers are recharged through many kinds of processes in the study area thus the dispersion model dm was chosen to characterize the groundwater system the relation among input tracer concentration cin t ie the tracer concentration in recharge water precipitation and the concentration in the sampled water from wells cout t is generally given by the following convolution integral maloszewski and zuber 1996 1 c out t t c in τ g t τ e λ t τ d τ 2 g τ 1 τ 1 4 π τ p d t t e 1 τ t t 2 4 p d τ t

the radioactive decay constant for 3h 12 34 years t is the time of water exit from the system t τ is the transit time of water parcel and tt is the mean transit time of the tracer 3h in this paper of the sample the parameter pd represents the apparent dispersivity of the system practically pd depends on the distribution of travel times the value of sigma ʃ represents the mrts error range the parameters pd and sigma ʃ together with the mrts obtained by fitting observed tritium time series data to match model outputs were calculated by the computer program flowpc maloszewski and zuber 1996 although the 3h 3he method is equal to the piston flow model and could be disturbed by some processes such as gas exchange excess air and chemical degradation morgenstern and daughney 2012 the 3h 3he age dating method is still accurate because 3he is the daughter product of 3h decay and the input function of 3h does not need be known to calculate a residence time cartwright et al 2017 this approach was used in this study to validate the results of the tritium time series data method at 14 of 44 sites the results had been determined by the 3h 3he method kreuzer et al 2009 the results of the two methods are plotted and close to the line 1 1 in fig 2 a therefore the mrts of groundwater calculated by the tritium time series data are suitable and accurate moreover this method can be extended to model mrts exceeding 60 years which is the upper limit of the 3h 3he age dating method 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean residence times calculated from tritium time series data matched results of the optimal mrts are listed in table 2 along with the goodness of fit parameters pd and ʃ and 6 of 44 sites were plotted in fig 2b as example to shown the samples of the 6 sites with the best fit curves the mrts ranged from 6 to 77 years within well depths 100 m and reached 180 years for depths 100 m table 2 the sites with mrts 100 years were distributed on the edge of the piedmont plain fig 3a they recharged early in the last century when the surface and subsurface environments had undergone little anthropogenic alteration thus they appeared to reflect the natural baseline conditions of the groundwater system the groundwater sites with mrts 20 years were mainly in the western and central parts of the piedmont plain fig 3a the areas mainly recharged from rain and irrigation return water rapid vertical inflow and rapid turnover of groundwater occurred in these areas due to with high vertical permeability of unsaturated zone von rohden et al 2010 liu et al 2009 however in some part of western piedmont plain region from shangzhuang to tongye the thinness of the aquifer resulted in a limited amount of aquifer storage and the aquifer contains multiple thin layers of clay fig 3b section b b the water flow in this region was relatively slow and anisotropic the mrts ranged from 10 years to 40 years the range of mrts was larger in the western than in the northwestern part of the piedmont plain groundwater samples with ages 40 years were mainly distributed in the east south part of the study area where ks and sy are relatively low fig 1 l4 the vertical inflow recharge from rain and irrigation returns decreased while the lateral inflow recharge increased fig 3b the flow and renewability were low especially where old water was distributed mrts 80 years the mrts of groundwater in the cone of depression ranged from 6 years site 25 to 52 years site 43 the range of groundwater age in this region 45 years is large for such a small region this large range can be explained by old water via lateral flow along flow paths towards the piezometric depressions created by pumping where it mixed with recent water from vertical flow but due to differing conductivities ks the mixture ratios varied spatially the main mixture model of pumped groundwater in the cone was demonstrated by cheng 2015 and the pumped water age ranged from 20 years to 80 years as shown in fig 3a the cone of depression was divided into four parts based on the mrts of the groundwater young water was found in areas i1 and i2 with mrts 20 years intermediate age water was found in the area ii with mrts from 20 a to 40 years and relatively old water was found in area iii with mrts 40 a in area i coefficients of ks and sy are high in zone l1 near the tai hang mts so the aquifer is recharged adequately and renewed actively the area iii ks and sy are relatively low in zone l2 leading to a relatively slow recharge and poor renewal rate a vertical recharge component was demonstrated by the isoline of water mrts in fig 3b the flow direction was oriented toward the cone of depression the mrts of all sites with depths in the cone 60 m were younger than 20 years these findings suggested that intense exploitation of groundwater enhanced the vertical inflow and shortened the turnover time the young water body had also extended downward as the water table declined the mrt of site 23 was only 9 years although a thin layer of clay was located above the aquifer fig 3a site 23 this site in the area was most affected by overpumping for irrigation and industrial water in contrast the deep groundwater mrt reached 77 years which was observed at site 18 a narrow clay lying above the aquifer may result in recharge primarily occurring from lateral flow mixing with little recharge from vertical inflow the age of the groundwater is probably older than 80 years in the natural state therefore an enhanced vertical inflow may have occurred under the intense exploitation 4 2 spatial characteristics of hydrochemistry the spatial variability of hydrochemistry no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 are presented in fig 4 a d see table s1 for details of the hydrochemical parameters overall there is not significant spatial correlation for these hydrochemical parameters in the study area fig 4 the high concentrations of ions were distributed in the western parts of the study area characterized by young groundwater with mrts 20 years but some of the sampled sites in close proximity to one another in the young water area had significantly different signatures of concentrations in fig 4 high spatial scattering of the concentrations of k na cl no3 and so4 2 was demonstrated this pattern is probably the result of anthropogenic activity min et al 2018 morgrnstern et al 2012 rather than geogenic sources the permeability of deposit sediments ks fig 1 is relatively high and the turnover time is short in the area hence contaminants can rapidly migrate into aquifers the highest concentrations of ions occurred mainly in the western part of the study area due to the high renewability and low water yields in this region the highest values of k mg 2 hco3 no3 total dissolved solids tds and hardness were found at site 9 and the highest of so4 2 value was occurred at site 1 which are both dominated by agricultural land use however the highest concentration of na was found at site 15 and the highest concentration of ca2 and cl were observed at site 44 these sites are in urban areas zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2017 the areas were formerly irrigated by wastewater wang et al 2016 consequently they exhibited a relatively high vulnerability to low water quality high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 were mainly distributed in the western piedmont plain while high concentrations of mg2 were found mostly in the northwestern part of the piedmont plain tds and total hardness are comprehensive features of water quality and exhibited similar patterns the groundwater with high tds and total hardness values was mainly observed in the western part of the piedmont plain although ca2 mg2 and hco3 are derived not only from artificial contaminants but also from water rock reactions geogenic sources they originate mainly from artificial contaminants in the young groundwater group the quality of groundwater was better in the northern portion than in the western portion of the cone of depression in the northern portion of the cone contaminants easily infiltrate into the aquifer and quickly flow out because of the short residence time with high ks and sy values zone l1 in fig 1 and area i in fig 4 in the western portion of the cone contaminants easily infiltrate into the aquifer but slowly flow out because of the relatively long residence time with low ks and sy values zone l2 in fig 1 and area ii in fig 4 furthermore a few layers of silt and clay were present there fig 3b which can adsorb contaminants and reduce migration capabilities borisover and davis 2015 4 3 changes in hydrochemistry with mean residence times the changes in hydrochemistry with mrts can indicate natural geogenic element compositions and anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater in the natural state ions in groundwater are mainly derived from precipitation and dissolution of surrounding rocks and minerals and the chemical content of groundwater increases with retention time in the piedmont plain morgrnstern et al 2015 visser 2009 if aquifers are affected by human activities the trends of increasing concentrations with water age are reversed for example high concentrations of ions especially no3 appear in younger groundwater martínez salvador et al 2019 alikhani et al 2016 the concentrations of ions tds and total hardness varied among the groundwater samples with mrts younger than 20 years 20 80 years and older than 80 years fig 5 significantly higher concentrations of ions no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were found in the young groundwater with mrts 20 years and no clear trends with mrts were observed among the samples of young groundwater the elevated ion concentrations in the young water were probably not derived from geogenic sources rather they were likely anthropogenic contaminants from human land use activities and sewage which usually obtain high salinity pant et al 2020 mahlknecht et al 2017 the ion concentrations increased with groundwater age for the samples with mrts of 20 to 80 years this increase was in accordance with changes in geogenic resources the concentrations in these samples appeared to be dominated by water rock interactions however the concentrations were still higher than those of groundwater with mrts 80 years these concentrations were also affected by groundwater exploitation and anthropogenic contamination in addition the main pumped water body were in the range of 20 years to 80 years cheng 2015 which reflected its mixing with recently recharged groundwater with high concentrations of ions groundwater with mrts 80 years were little impacted by anthropogenic activities for relatively low ion concentrations in this groundwater group a significantly negative correlation between concentrations of ions and groundwater ages were found except for k cl and no3 fig 5a c d which are steady at distinctly low concentration notably the concentration of ions also tended to decrease with groundwater mrts the difference may be attributed to the natural attenuation of contaminants and strengthened water rock interactions for enriched oxidation environments under a falling water table lapworth et al 2018 2017 cheng 2015 k cl and no3 in the study area are mainly derived from agrochemical and domestic sewage chen et al 2006 li et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the concentrations of these compounds were elevated in groundwater with mrts 80 years no3 is an indicator of the influence of human activities on the groundwater environment its concentration reached 100 mg l in young groundwater with mrts 20 years in addition the concentrations of k and cl reached 3 4 mg l and 252 6 mg l in young groundwater with mrts 20 years respectively the concentrations of these ions were also high in groundwater with mrts of 20 to 80 years these results suggested that the groundwater with mrts 80 years especially that with mrts 20 years was anthropogenic contaminated according to the relationship between the concentrations of no3 and the mrts the concentrations may continue to increase with time because of nitrification of nh4 in the unsaturated zone the low rate of denitrification in young water or accumulative effects wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the concentration of so4 2 reached 300 mg l in young groundwater within mrts 20 years high concentration of so4 2 is often linked with high no3 but no clear relationship existed between the two ions is observed the correlations of the hydrochemical parameters of groundwater are provided in table s2 this finding suggested different sources for the two ions although sulfur is a component of fertilizers the primary source of so4 2 is detergents with small amounts derived from gypsum and oxidation of inorganic sulfur and reduction by microbial reactions zhou et al 2016 accordingly in the present study so4 2 was decreased distinctly in groundwater with mrts in the group groundwater over 20 years 4 4 characteristics of vulnerability in the shallow groundwater system generally groundwater travel times and concentrations of geogenic ions such as ca2 mg2 and hco3 increase with depth in unconsolidated aquifers broers 2004 the trends may be reversed by anthropic activities the distributions of residence times found within the shallow groundwater at depths 80 m was consistent with mrts 10 to 80 years particularly in zone l1with a high ks value fig 6 young mrts groundwater are indicative of rapid recharge and high vulnerability the high concentrations of no3 so4 2 and tds in wells with depths 80 m fig 6 also suggest rapid recharge and indicate that the aquifer system is vulnerable to vertical contaminant migration at depths 80 m however no clear relationships among concentrations of no3 so4 2 and tds with wells depths were observed such phenomenon can probably be explained by the high pumping rates leading to the enhanced vertical recharge and the mixing of groundwater with different residence times lapworth et al 2017 at present most agricultural well depths are 80 m and they are intensively pumped during agricultural seasons the vulnerability of groundwater tended to be uniform and higher for groundwater of depths 80 m under intensive pumping conditions high concentrations of ions no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were observed in the northwestern parts of the study area due to rapid recharge fig 4 groundwater could be easily contaminated along with high vulnerability in those areas where the groundwater was young however for the youngest groundwater mrt 10 years in area i1 the higher concentrations of ions were not consistently maintained due to the high renewability and productivity related to the high inflow and outflow rates with little clay in the western of the piedmont plain short turnover time were observed as result of thin aquifer however a strong gradient in groundwater age was observed fig 3a within few discontinuous clay layers characterized low ks and sy values fig 1 and fig 3b slow water flow had a low capacity to migrate contaminants thus contaminations can easily enter the aquifer via rapid inflow infiltration but hardly migrate out furthermore the adsorption of clay mineral may strengthen the retention of contaminants the aquifer was generally at high risk of contamination i e highly vulnerable the groundwater in the area exhibited high no3 concentrations and high hardness values in the eastern part of the study area from zone l1 to zone l2 and zone l4 the stratum lithology is dominated by clay layers which leads to a decreased ks and sy values the groundwater is mainly recharged by the later flow with an old mrts relative to those in the western part in addition the groundwater turnover times were long and a slow moving region generated fig 3 therefore contaminants cannot easily andrapidly infiltrate into the aquifers or groundwater relatively lower concentrations of ions were observed except for k and hco3 fig 4 a low vulnerability in these areas was demonstrated 4 5 vulnerability response to intensive groundwater exploitation a short residence time was associated with a high groundwater vulnerability but vulnerability can be impacted by both anthropogenic activity and hydrogeological settings surprisingly the groundwater quality was low at sites 18 and 20 which are associated with old residence times and deep wells table 1 and fig 6 the hydrochemistry is characterized by an elevated concentrations of cl ca2 hco3 tds and hardness and elevated no3 concentrations was also found in the site 18 these sites have probably been impacted by anthropogenic activity such as sewage irrigation an agricultural manure and sanitary sewage were the dominant sources of no3 and cl at most groundwater sites in the study area wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 intense deeper pumping is expected to enhance the vertical recharge from shallow young water resulting in an increased concentration of no3 and cl in deep groundwater aquifer this means that the deeper groundwater is potentially vulnerable to vertical breakthrough of contaminants from shallow aquifers when exploitation of deep groundwater therefore the deep groundwater probably tended to be vulnerable to anthropogenic contaminants slight groundwater deterioration at site 22 was evidenced by the elevated concentrations of hco3 and k values with long residence times this deterioration can be attributed to the disruption of the equilibrium between water and salt of caco3minerals due to the declining of water table ma et al 2018 cheng et al 2017 the groundwater environment trended to oxidize and became enriched in co2 cation exchange may explain for the elevated k but not ca2 these results suggest that the aquifer tended to be deterioration for enhance dissolution of geogenic sources e g caco3 minerals in the study under overpumping condition according to the above analysis although groundwater vulnerability varies with the mrts the depth and hydrogeologic parameters vulnerability would be enhanced by intense exploitation which can cause water quality deterioration a conceptual diagram showing the vulnerability and inflow flow mechanism of groundwater system in response to exploitation is presented in fig 7 1 intense exploitation induced a relatively high vulnerability to anthropogenic contaminations above the main pumped well depth the potential mixing of groundwater with different residence times or recharge times was increased by enhanced vertical recharge and horizontal flow as evidenced by the absence of clear relationships among mrts concentration of ions and well depth within a depth range 2 old residence times groundwater tends to be geogenic deteriorations due to water salt equilibrium being disrupted the hydrogeological environment trended to be oxidized and enriched in co2 with the decline of the water table the water rock interactions of this groundwater have been enhanced as evidenced by elevated concentrations of geogenic sources for example hco3 and k 3 deep groundwater tends to be vulnerable to shallow anthropogenic contamination young water bodies shift downward with the decline in the water table resulting in the vertical migration of anthropogenic contaminants to deeper groundwater due to the intense pumping of deeper groundwater it proved by the elevated concentration of anthropogenic contaminants such as no3 and cl in the study in the deep water samples a similar phenomenon that elevated concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants e g no3 pb as well as a number of pesticides in the deeper part of an aquifer was found by lapworth et al 2018 and 2017 5 conclusion and implications the groundwater environment in the study area has been impacted by anthropogenic pressure the water table has shifted downward and the water quality has deteriorated in local groundwater systems seriously restricting the sustainable development of the local economy and the stability of human society ma et al 2018 one of the causes is groundwater vulnerability and its changes under the pressure of overexploitation the mrts of groundwater was calculated by using the dispersion model with the tritium time series method they ranged from 6 to over 80 years young groundwater with mrts 20 years was distributed in the west and northwest of the piedmont plain the permeability ranges from low to high from west to east within the area west of the hutuo river over time shortened of the mrts and increased water recycling were caused by exploitation moderately old water with mrts of 20 80 years occurred mainly in the central and eastern portions of the plain including the southern portion of the cone of depression where the aquifer s permeability and water yields are relatively poor in the cone of depression young water had shifted downward probably due to exploitation and the mrts may tend to be young over time the groundwater in the east of the plain had long residence times with mrts 60 years the concentrations of hydrochemical compounds in the groundwater samples decreased with mrts in the order of 20 years 20 80 years and 80 years the results suggested that young groundwater with mrts 20 years was strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity due to high vulnerability the impacts extended to old groundwater with mrts 80 years the high concentrations of ions no3 k na ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 were mainly distributed in the north west of the piedmont plain in conjunction with groundwater residence times 20 years because of the short turnover times and high renewability the aquifer was highly vulnerable in groundwater with mrts 20 years in the west the piedmont plain with low ks and sy distinct water deterioration occurred high renewability and low productivity were the factors that driving the deterioration of groundwater quality in this region slightly elevated concentrations of hco3 and k were also observed in groundwater with mrts 80 years in the eastern portion of the piedmont plain these high values probably resulted from disruption of the water rock equilibrium associated with overexploitation the vulnerability of the groundwater system can be increased by intense exploitation to some extent therefore three mechanisms were identified summarized as follows 1 the shallow groundwater system is more vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination the regions of young water had become more extensive and relatively agreed mixed with recent recharges 2 the groundwater system is deteriorating for water salt equilibrium disrupted water rock interactions would be enhanced and elevated concentrations of hydrochemical components such as hco3 developed 3 deeper water became vulnerable to surface anthropogenic contaminants enhanced vertical flow and recharge increased the risks of contamination therefore water quality deterioration occurred with intense groundwater exploitation or overpumping the relationships between mrts and chemical tracers indicate that the shallow aquifer system is suffering deterioration and more vulnerable than before on the piedmont plain a comprehensive strategy should be developed to control contaminants flowing into areas with young groundwater deep old groundwater is at risk of nitrate contamination and

4009,high resolution characterization of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone architecture sza is crucial for developing remediation strategies inverse modeling approaches are widely used to characterize dnapl sza however unknown parameters permeability and dnapl saturation are usually assumed as gaussian distribution in traditional geostatistical inverse methods e g ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation esmda this assumption may not be true in channels of fluvial deposits the presence of clay lenses will bring significant challenges in reconstructing the dnapl sza using geostatistical inverse methods based on the gaussian assumption moreover the dnapl characterization also suffers from a limited number of borehole data in the field in this study we use esmda s variant ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation direct sampling esmda ds to improve the estimation of non gaussian permeability field and evaluate the benefits of improved permeability estimation on the reconstruction of dnapl source zone the inversion technique is based on the iterative inversion framework to incorporate the clay content information into the dnapl characterization the performance of our proposed framework is examined and discussed through a numerical synthetic case with challenging pool dominated sza to overcome data scarcity we integrated hydrogeological and geophysical electrical resistance tomography datasets results show that the permeability is characterized well using esmda ds method compared with esmda method with the improved permeability estimation the dnapl source zone can be characterized in higher resolution compared with esmda method the root mean square error rmse of permeability is reduced by 38 5 using the esmda ds method then the estimation rmse of dnapl saturation is reduced by 24 9 by improved permeability estimation we also demonstrated the significant benefits of improved permeability estimation on dnapl depletion behavior and plume evolution numerical simulations demonstrate with the improved permeability estimation the dnapl depletion prediction is highly improved the prediction rmse of the dnapl dissolved plume is reduced by 34 5 after 50 years keywords combined esmda ds and esmda method dnapl source zone characterization clay content electrical resistivity tomography 1 introduction dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination has become a severe environmental problem worldwide national research council 2013 owing to its high density low viscosity and low interfacial tension leaked dnapl penetrates deeply into the aquifer pankow and cherry 1996 after migration dnapl may be entrapped as discontinuous ganglia or as pools above a local low permeable zone and serve as long term groundwater contamination kueper et al 2014 national research council 2013 an excellent detailed description of the dnapl source zone architecture sza in the subsurface is necessary to develop an effective remediation method for the contaminated zone koch and nowak 2015 however subsurface heterogeneity influences the dnapl sza significantly tiny changes in the subsurface media might lead to considerably different dnapl sza ferrari et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to characterize the hydrogeological parameters e g permeability before dnapl source zone characterization kueper et al 2014 in recent years many valuable studies have considered the impact of subsurface heterogeneity during dnapl characterization illman et al 2010 kang et al 2020 pollicino et al 2021a yeh and zhu 2007 for dnapl sza estimations several researchers assumed that the log transformed permeability and log transformed dnapl saturation followed a gaussian distribution and various strategies have been proposed yeh and zhu 2007 zhu et al 2009 these include the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2009 ensemble smoothing es van leeuwen and evensen 1996 sequential successive linear estimator ssle yeh and liu 2000 and principal component geostatistical approach pcga kitanidis and lee 2014 these methods are popular in permeability and dnapl distribution inversion owing to their simplicity and flexibility in implementation among these methods ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation esmda emerick and reynolds 2013 can obtain better data estimation of the parameters and cost less computational time than the enkf method emerick 2016 however subsurface hydraulic properties are not always gaussian and may include paleo channels and low permeability lenses zovi et al 2017 these non gaussian aquifers including clay lenses will bring significant challenges in reconstructing sza with geostatistical inverse methods based on the gaussian assumption such as the esmda method previous studies have used two strategies to solve the non gaussian problem caused by the sand clay interbedding aquifer on the one hand some researchers have used parameterization methods to convert the non gaussian parameter to the gaussian parameter chang et al 2010 li et al 2018 li et al 2011 liu and oliver 2005 xu and jaime gomez hernandez 2018 zhou et al 2011 moreover machine learning has been used for the parameterization of non gaussian parameter fields canchumuni et al 2017 mo et al 2020 on the other hand some studies have focused on using geostatistical methods to handle the non gaussian characteristics for instance zhou et al 2012 introduced a pattern search based method based on direct sampling ds to estimate the non gaussian parameter distribution effectively sarma et al 2008 proposed a kernel enkf based on multiple point geostatistics mpg to characterize the permeability li et al 2019 introduced an iterative scheme based on a simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle with hierarchical cluster analysis hca to reconstruct a non gaussian field cao et al 2018 combined ds and es to estimate the non gaussian parameters through pilot points the es ds method not only preserves the non gaussian structure via ds but also efficiently considers dynamic data kang et al 2019 adapted the iterative es ds to the esmda ds because of the better data matches and lower computational cost with the esmda method emerick and reynolds 2013 although there are many solutions for non gaussian permeability fields to the best of our knowledge few studies have considered the non gaussian aquifer problem in dnapl source zones because of the complexity of the joint inversion of the dnapl distribution and non gaussian aquifer permeability compared with the traditional gaussian method the non gaussian method can improve permeability estimation in aquifer including clay lenses however the estimation of dnapl saturation using this improvement remains unclear in an aquifer with low permeability lenses the influence of permeability on the estimation result of dnapl saturation continues to be worthy of study in addition to the problem of inversion methods the reconstruction of dnapl source zones also faces data scarcity from traditional methods such as intrusive drilling parker et al 2008 siegrist et al 2006 in recent years many indirect measurements have been proposed to characterize the dnapl sza pollicino et al 2021b for instance zhou and cardiff 2017 characterize the sza by oscillatory hydraulic testing oht because the changes in the napl distribution influence the effective hydraulic conductivity another widely used indirect method is the partitioning tracer test ptt dridi et al 2009 ptt measures the spatial distribution of dnapl according to the delayed action when the partitioning tracer passes through the dnapl as an extension of ptt yeh and zhu 2007 proposed hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography hptt to estimate both permeability and dnapl saturation by integrating hydraulic tomography ht and the ptt method laboratory experiments have demonstrated that hptt can reconstruct the main part of the sza illman et al 2010 however the hptt method still faces the problem of data sparsity as a supplement to the information electrical resistivity tomography ert as a kind of geophysical method has been applied to map the dnapl distribution because of its nonintrusive and low cost naudet et al 2014 steelman et al 2017 when geophysical methods are applied to characterize the dnapl distribution in an aquifer that includes low permeability clay the clay content parameter cannot be ignored first dnapl tends to accumulate on the top of the low permeability clay layers during the dnapl migration process resulting in long term stable contaminate sources thus information about the clay spatial distribution is essential for the distribution of the dnapl second the presence of clay lenses will produce noise in the ert measurement because high resistivity anomalies associated with dnapls in sandy aquifers generally decrease due to electrically conductive minerals such as clays the clay with unknown content hampers the effectiveness of ert for dnapl mapping cardarelli and di filippo 2009 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 therefore accurately calculate the clay content is important for dnapl characterization however previous studies often neglect the clay content either only considered the dnapl distribution aghasi et al 2013 datta gupta et al 2002 dridi et al 2009 james et al 1997 or both the subsurface heterogeneity and dnapl distribution illman et al 2010 zhu et al 2009 in this study we used the iterative framework proposed by guo et al 2021 to incorporate the clay content information for dnapl source zone characterization based on this framework we compared the iterative esmda method both k and sn are inverted by esmda and combined esmda ds and esmda method k is inverted by esmda ds and sn is inverted by esmda for sza characterization to evaluate the benefit of improved permeability characterization in the reconstruction of the dnapl source zone multi source datasets were used to solve the data sparsity under this framework we estimated the permeability and calculated the clay content by hydraulic head data conservative tracer data and drilling permeability data in stage 1 based on the permeability and clay content information from stage 1 we characterized the dnapl distribution by ptt and ert data in stage 2 after stage 2 the estimated dnapl was used in stage 1 in the next iteration to incorporate the dnapl information into the ht a numerical synthetic case was performed in a non gaussian aquifer with a dnapl sza generated by the multiphase flow model then we simulated the source zone depletion to evaluate the ability of the estimated parameters in predicting the source zone longevity finally the influence of the permeability and clay content on ptt and ert measurements were discussed and the conclusions are presented 2 methods 2 1 multiphase flow model this study used the university of texas chemical compositional simulator utchem to simulate the dnapl source zone generation ht and ptt processes as a 3d multiphase flow model simulator utchem can simulate the napl pollutant transport dissolution and remediation delshad et al 2013 in this study utchem

clay content using the relationship between the permeability and clay content kang et al 2019 the lower threshold permeability of clay free sand k was calculated by revil and cathles 1999 2 k sd d sd

kang et al 2019 power et al 2013 thus the threshold permeability k sd 3 55 10 12 m2 permeability values larger than k sd refer to clay free sand while others indicate sand clay mixtures the volumetric

in this work m cs m sd 1 8 ϕ cl 0 56 power et al 2013 revil et al 2017 we assumed cl 0 for grid cells where k k sd if k k sd we use eq 3 to calculate the corresponding clay content we then calculated the porosity ϕ and clay mass fractions φ w cl the porosity was calculated using the clay content cl 4 ϕ ϕ sd 1 c l ϕ cl c l the mass fraction of the clay and sand grains φ w cl φ w sd for each grid

to invert the permeability and dnapl distribution through an iterative hydrogeophysical inversion framework emerick and reynolds 2013 a flowchart of the iterative esmda method is presented in fig 1 in this iterative framework two stages were used to characterize the dnapl distribution in stage 1 we estimated the permeability and calculated the clay content using drilling permeability data hydraulic head data and conservative tracer data based on the estimated permeability and clay content the dnapl saturation was characterized using partitioning tracer and ert data in stage 2 in stage 1 the utchem software was used to obtain the hydraulic head and conservative tracer see eq 1 then the esmda method was used to assimilate the drilling permeability data hydraulic head data and conservative tracer data to estimate the non gaussian permeability see eqs 9 13 based on the estimated permeability the clay contents were calculated using eqs 2 6 in stage 2 with the information of permeability and clay contents obtained before utchem software is applied to obtain tracer concentration see eq 1 then the hydrogeology information was used to conduct ert forward model see eqs 7 8 finally the esmda method was applied to characterize the dnapl saturation see eqs 9 13 after stage 2 the estimated sn field was applied in stage 1 in the next iteration to form a loop guo et al 2021 this framework will continue to iterate until one of the termination criteria is achieved 1 the iteration number reaches 8 or 2 when the difference in the root mean square error rmse between two adjacent loops is less than the predefined threshold δ for more details about the iteration threshold one can refer to guo et al 2021 the esmda method used in iterative hydrogeophysical inversion can be explained as follows step 1 build the joint vector 9 x p h in this vector p represents the parameters that need to be estimated e g permeability dnapl saturation and h is the state variable

the esmda method shown in the previous section is used to estimate the dnapl distribution in stage 2 the iterative framework of the combined esmda ds and esmda method is similar to that of the iterative esmda method and is not further explained a chart of the combined esmda ds and esmda method is provided in fig 1 as a variant of the esmda the esmda ds method couples the esmda and ds methods to preserve non gaussian structures and efficiently consider dynamic data for the esmda ds method after each assimilation by esmda section 2 3 1 step 5 the ds method interpolates the updated permeability at pilot points to the unsampled zone the extrapolated parameter was implemented for the next iteration for more details about the ds method one can refer to mariethoz et al 2010 3 synthetic case 3 1 synthetic domains and source zone architectures the numerical experiment was developed in a 2 d non gaussian aquifer 24 m 16 m the aquifer was discretized into 48 32 1 536 elements with length of each block size as 0 5 m δ x δ z 0 5 m the background hydraulic gradient was set as 0 003 to make the groundwater flow from left to right based on the training image fig 2 a we used the ds method to generate the non gaussian heterogeneous parameters y log permeability field fig 2b for actual cases training images can be obtained from expert information strebelle 2012 yanshu et al 2020 or geophysical methods zhang et al 2015 the corresponding clay content calculated from the reference permeability is exhibited in fig 2d the tetrachloroethylene pce leakage process is simulated by utchem software in an aquifer the dnapl sza was generated in a non gaussian aquifer as a point source of pce leaking at a rate of 0 16 m3 d for 10 d and migrating naturally for 100 d after migration pce was entrapped above the low permeability lenses fig 2e the ganglia to pool gtp of sza was 0 11 represent pool dominant sza then we assumed the dnapl had reached equilibrium and was immobile kang et al 2020 koch and nowak 2015 the parameters of the synthetic experiment are shown in table 1 3 2 multiple observation data two cases were designed to compare the benefits of improved permeability characterization when reconstructing the dnapl source zone table 2 for case 1 the iterative esmda method was used to characterize both the permeability and dnapl distribution for case 2 the combined esmda ds and esmda method was used to reconstruct the dnapl distribution in both cases the same observation methods were applied to estimate the dnapl sza conservative tracer data hydraulic head data and drilling permeability data were used to reconstruct the ln k log e permeability field in stage 1 and the sn field was further characterized by both ptt and ert data in stage 2 to avoid the destruction of the dnapl sza surface based ert was used to measure the approximate location of the dnapl distribution before the observation wells and a cross borehole ert was installed we set the total length of the surface based ert to 48 m and electrodes with 1 m spacing fig 3 there were no resistivity data beyond the research zone then the agi software directly inverted the apparent resistivity measured by surface based ert with an 8 relative observation error from the results we can find that the abnormally high value of resistivity in the study zone ranges from x 8 to x 16 m where the dnapl sza is most likely to appear thus to accurately depict the dnapl sza without destruction boreholes can be arranged at x 0 8 16 and 24 m in the research zone in stage 1 based on the result from surface based ert four penetrating boreholes were considered in the aquifer at x 0 8 16 and 24 m and each borehole had 12 ports spread evenly fig 4 first we directly sampled aquifer permeability with 2 m spacing z 0 5 2 5 4 5 6 5 8 5 10 5 12 5 14 5 m in each well to conduct the conservative tracer injection bromide in the form of nabr was used as a conservative tracer with a density of 0 5 kg m3 we injected bromide with a constant rate of 5 m3 d in each high permeability port and 0 5 m3 d in each low permeability port at x 0 m we pumped at the rate of 5 m3 d in each high permeability port and 0 5 m3 d in each low permeability port at x 24 m we assumed that the information of permeability in the boreholes is known meanwhile 24 additional ports at x 8 and 16 were used as the observation wells we collected the data once daily with 36 hydraulic head data and 36 conservative data collected from three penetrating vertical wells at x 8 16 and 24 m we conducted this process for 20 d and obtained 720 hydraulic data 720 conservative tracer data and 32 permeability data in stage 2 the previous 48 ports were used as observation ports and four additional ports fig 4 blue quadrate at x 8 and 16 m were added as injection ports to conduct the ptt water was injected at a constant rate of 10 m3 d through one of the four injection ports to form a steady state flow field then a mixture of the partitioning and conservative tracers was released in the same port for 1 d and the simulation was conducted for 5 d in this tracer mixture we use three kinds of partitioning tracer moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 2 2 dimethyl 3 pentanol dmp n hexanol hex and 6 methyl 2 heptanol 6m2h as the partitioning tracer solution with 0 5 kg m3 for each tracer bromide was selected as the conservative tracer with 5 kg m3 to significantly influence the water phase conductivity when bromide was injected into the subsurface to conduct the ert measurements 48 electrodes were placed in vertical boreholes and 25 electrodes were placed on the surface we used a bipole bipole array in our measurements seferou et al 2013 the concentrations were acquired once a day with 48 conservative tracer data and 144 partitioning tracer data the ert measurements were obtained once every 5 d using 5 605 ert data thus for the four port ptt simulation over 20 d 2 880 partitioning tracer concentration measurements and 22 420 ert measurements were collected with the reference permeability clay content and dnapl distribution we could obtain the reference hydraulic head tracer concentration and ert data through the forward models mentioned in sections 2 1 2 2 we added 0 1 1 3 and 8 relative errors to the drilling permeability hydraulic head tracer concentration and bulk resistivity respectively these error levels are based on previous studies such as jardani et al 2013 and nan and wu 2011 3 3 inversion parameters the same initial parameters were used in the two proposed methods iterative esmda method and combined esmda ds and esmda method the initial permeability field was generated from the ds method based on the training image shown in fig 2a with a realization size of 300 the initial sn field dnapl saturation was created by the generated sequential gaussian simulator in the geostatistical software library gslib with mean ln sn 4 6 sn 0 01 standard deviation σ ln s n 1 and ix iz 5 5 m as a prior covariance model deutsch and journel 1998 the realization size of sn is the same as ln k in this study we set the number of multiple data assimilations as 4 na 4 in the permeability and dnapl estimation and the coefficients of data assimilation were set as ɑ1 9 333 ɑ2 7 0 ɑ3 4 0 and ɑ4 2 0 respectively emerick and reynolds 2013 the pilot points fig 4c in the spatial distribution were randomly generated with the number set to 200 in the esmda ds method kang et al 2019 all the simulations and inversions were run on a workstation with an eight core 32 gb ram and 2 6 ghz cpu here the termination threshold δ was set as 0 03 for the iterative inversion framework to quantitatively compare the performance of different cases rmse was applied as the criterion to demonstrate the results of ln k and sn chen and zhang 2006 4 results 4 1 iterative esmda method to test the iterative esmda method on the dnapl sza estimation the sza estimate was analyzed as shown in fig 5 fig 5 presents the ensemble mean of the estimated ln k and sn fields histogram of ln k field and variance of the sn field ln k was estimated through the hydraulic head data conservative tracer data and drilling permeability data dnapl sza was estimated based on integrating the ptt data and ert data in fig 5 a threshold value of sn 0 01 is used for visualization purposes based on multi source datasets the traditional esmda method could roughly reconstruct the permeability the preferential flow conduits and low permeability lenses could be roughly delineated however owing to the deviation between the gaussian assumption and physical reality esmda fails to characterize the channel and lens shape accurately in the histogram the esmda method also fails to preserve the non gaussian properties of the reference field by combining the ptt and ert data the location of the dnapl at high saturation could be estimated however because of errors in the permeability obtained from the previous stage we failed to characterize the spread of the dnapl distribution during this stage the results indicate that in a complex aquifer that contains clay ln k is crucial for estimating the distribution of dnapl although our data integrating ptt and ert data are sufficient we still could not reconstruct the distribution of dnapl at a high resolution owing to the incorrect estimation of the ln k field 4 2 combined esmda ds and esmda method we evaluated the results of the combined esmda ds and esmda method to inverse permeability and dnapl saturation as shown in fig 6 the figure presents the ensemble mean of the calibrated ln k and sn fields the histogram of the ln k field and the variance of the sn field in case 2 the observation data in fig 6 are the same as those in fig 5 in fig 6 a threshold value of sn 0 01 is used in case 2 we used the esmda ds method to estimate the permeability the results suggest that the ensemble mean could capture the spatial distribution structure of the permeability with a high resolution both the low permeability lenses and connectivity of the channel could be recovered well in particular to improve the low permeability media estimation the method provides the basis for further improving the estimation results of dnapl from the histogram the permeability inverted from esmda ds maintained the non gaussian characteristics well from the reference field compared with case 1 the permeability was better estimated in case 2 the results also demonstrate the advantage of the esmda ds method for non gaussian field estimations according to table 3 compared with the esmda method case 1 the rmse of the permeability estimations is reduced by 38 5 with the esmda ds method we successfully reproduced the dnapl distribution field for the sn field owing to a more accurate permeability estimate using the esmda ds method as a result the shape and distribution range of dnapl have been estimated well in addition the variance maps indicate that the dnapl distribution has a lower uncertainty in case 2 than in case 1 according to table 3 compared with the dnapl based on the iterative esmda method case 1 the sn estimation rmse is reduced by 24 9 using the combined esmda ds and esmda method case 2 4 3 comparison of the iterative esmda method with combined esmda ds and esmda method this section reports on the use of different metrics to further compare the iterative esmda method with the combined esmda ds and esmda method to evaluate the benefit of the improved permeability characterization on the high resolution mapping of the dnapl source zone in fig 7 the variance cumulative distribution functions cdfs and scatterplots are used to characterize the permeability in the initial field the variance and cdf exhibit high uncertainty in case 1 with the esmda method the uncertainty of the variance and cdf could be reduced to a minimum value but the cdf ensemble mean fails to match the reference field the scatterplots of case 1 also have poor results in matching the reference field in case 2 the variance of ln k becomes relatively low in the estimated area compared with case 1 the uncertainty of variance and cdf in case 2 are slightly higher because case 1 updates all the permeability parameters in each iteration while case 2 only updates the parameters at pilot points in each iteration and uses ds to generate all the permeability parameters the variance in the channel boundaries has a more considerable uncertainty than the other zones which is consistent with other studies kang et al 2019 in addition the cdf in case 2 estimates permeability field with lower uncertainty and the scatterplots match the reference field better than for case 1 in fig 8 to clarify the effect of the estimation result of dnapl by different ln k values we plot the estimation error sn err sn est sn true false positive and false negative errors of the source zone estimated from cases 1 and 2 the false positive error represents the estimated dnapl in a specific region where no reference dnapl is present in contrast a false negative represents a failure to reconstruct the source zones where the reference field exists fig 8 demonstrates that case 2 has fewer false positive and false negative errors than case 1 the overestimated dnapl masses are 3 21 and 1 30 tons in cases 1 and case 2 respectively the underestimated dnapl masses are 1 79 and 1 23 tons in cases 1 and 2 respectively the results quantitatively indicate that in a clay containing aquifer the dnapl distribution obtained based on the combined esmda ds and esmda method is better than that provided by the iterative esmda method alone to further compare the two methods utchem software was applied to demonstrate the process of sza depletion and plumes based on sn and ln k fields from the reference case 1 and case 2 fig 9 the results indicate that the dnapl source zones will exist for hundreds of years in the aquifer that contains clay after 100 years the contamination plume can still exist stably indicating that dnapl can form a long term source of contamination in case 1 we failed to predict the source zone depletion process and the distribution of plumes owing to the incorrect estimation of the dnapl sza in case 2 we successfully simulated the dnapl source depletion and plume evolution using an accurate estimate of sza which is essential for efficient remediation design and management schemes compared with case 1 the rmse of the predicted dissolution plume in case 2 is reduced by 34 5 after 50 years 40 0 after 100 years and 49 4 after 200 years this significant improvement is because the combined esmda ds and esmda method can better characterize the shape of the dnapl pool 5 discussion to further discuss the effect of permeability and clay improvement on different data ptt and ert data diverse datasets were used to estimate the dnapl distribution table 4 first in fig 10 based on the ln k obtained from the esmda method the sn field was further estimated using the ptt and ert data in case 1 only ptt data in case 1 ptt and only ert data in case 1 ert then based on the ln k obtained from the esmda ds method the sn field was further estimated using both the ptt and ert data in case 2 only ptt data in case 2 ptt and only ert data in case 2 ert in case 1 ptt the estimation using ptt failed to capture the source zone of the reference dnapl distribution because the previously estimated ln k had a significant influence on the results of the dnapl estimation when only a single ptt dataset was used to characterize the dnapl field kang et al 2020 because both the permeability and dnapl saturation can affect the break through curves of ptt when the previously estimated ln k differs significantly from the reference field using only ptt data to estimate dnapl will also result in significant errors in case 2 ptt the estimation using ptt could capture the approximate dnapl source of the reference dnapl field compared with case 1 ptt because of the improved permeability estimation however ptt still failed to reconstruct the dnapl field in detail and overestimated the spread of the dnapl source zone because tracers mostly flowed in high permeability channels the quality of the data collected from observation ports in lenses was low resulting in a scarcity of useful data the variance in the paleo channel regions was lower than that in the lens zones which also indicates that the data from the paleo channel areas are high quality for the pool dnapl estimation ptt could roughly characterize the pool dnapl source zone entrapped in the low permeability region the low permeability region with the pool dnapl could cause a flow bypassing problem which would lead to inaccurate estimation results poor prior permeability may lead to dnapl misestimations guo et al 2021 notably the ptt failed to characterize the pool dnapl sza near the top aquifer because this zone is not located in the highly permeable preferential flow conduits groundwater mobility in this region is lacking making it difficult for the observation port to collect tracers that interacted with the dnapl during the ptt in this zone in case 1 ert the ert method could be applied to the dnapl sza reconstruction because ert is sensitive to dnapl with a high saturation according to the geophysical model however ert fails to estimate the dnapl distribution owing to the erroneous result of the estimated clay content in the previous stage the estimation results verify that accurate prior information on the clay content is necessary for the ert data in the dnapl characterization in case 2 ert using more accurate ln k and clay content the ert successfully captured the dnapl source zone with a high saturation with sufficient data when the precise estimation of the clay content was carried into the second stage to estimate dnapl the noise of the clay in the ert could be eliminated however the high dnapl was overestimated and a substantial portion of the low dnapl source zone was lost owing to the low resolution of the ert compared with case 2 ptt the low measurement accuracy of the ert also provided more significant uncertainty than the ptt in case 1 compared with the single data sources see fig 10 case 1 ptt and 1 ert the estimation result of dnapl is better when using the multi source data however case 1 still could not characterize the dnapl saturation at a high resolution because of the previous poor result of the permeability and clay content nevertheless the results indicate that even if there are significant errors in the prior information of the permeability and clay content multi source datasets can still be used to improve the dnapl estimation in case 2 the ptt and ert data were incorporated to characterize the dnapl distribution the results indicate that the dnapl sza could be well reconstructed by joint inversion compared with the other cases both the pool and residual dnapl source zones were captured by integrating the ert and ptt data when accurate previous information of ln k and clay content were used the improvement in the estimation confirms that ert can be added as an excellent complement to the tracer test ptt could roughly capture the residual dnapl distribution in the high permeability channel using limited datasets case 2 ptt however because of the flow bypassing the dnapl pools in the non gaussian aquifer the partitioning tracer could not sufficiently contact the dnapl pool ptt can only contact the upper surface of dnapl and reconstructed it poorly as a complement ert is sensitive to the dnapl pool and could provide sufficient data therefore the dnapl field from joint inversion is better than that from single datasets with lower uncertainty in the dnapl sza including clay layers accurate prior information ln k and clay content and multi source observation datasets are essential for dnapl characterization with high resolution many outperformance studies have also determined the advantages of multi source datasets aghasi et al 2013 kang et al 2020 the rmse of the sn distribution also demonstrates that by utilizing the complementarity of ptt and ert the dnapl distribution can be better estimated table 5 compared with the ptt method the rmse of the sn distribution can be reduced by 15 7 by integrating the ptt and ert data to further assess the performance of different cases five spatial metrics of the sza were analyzed using a boxplot including the dnapl mass x and z centers and spread of mass shown in fig 11 fig 11 indicates that based on the better ln k and clay content obtained from the esmda ds method we can obtain more accurate dnapl distribution results by integrating ptt and ert case 2 in fig 11a the ptt data provides better results than the ert data for the total dnapl mass whereas the ert method tends to overestimate the mass the results from integrating the ptt and ert data cases 1 and 2 also exhibit more accuracy for the dnapl mass than the single datasets fig 11b and 11c indicate that the center of the source zone is closer to the reference value by improving the estimated permeability fig 11d and 11e demonstrate that the spread of the dnapl saturation can be characterized better by increasing the accuracy of the permeability estimate when the permeability estimate obtained from the esmda method is lacking the spread of dnapl mass cannot be characterized well even when multi source datasets are used comparing case 1 ptt case 1 ert and case 1 6 conclusions this work compared the iterative esmda method with the combined esmda ds and esmda method to evaluate the benefit of improved k on sza estimation in a non gaussian aquifer through an iterative hydrogeophysical inversion framework in the iterative framework two methods are implemented 1 multi source datasets are used in sequence according to their complementarity the permeability and clay content are inverted by integrating the hydraulic head data conservative tracer data and drilling permeability data and the dnapl distribution is inverted by integrating the ptt data and ert data so that the dnapl sza can be reconstructed with high resolution in limited boreholes 2 the estimated clay contents are used as prior information in the dnapl reconstruction to incorporate the clay content into dnapl distribution to demonstrate the advantage of the improved permeability estimation of the dnapl sza a numerical experiment was conducted in a 2d non gaussian aquifer with complex dnapl source zones the results indicate that complex dnapl sources with low permeability clay and a limited number of boreholes bring significant challenges to the iterative esmda method the esmda method can roughly characterize the main permeability pattern but fails to capture the non gaussian characteristics of the reference field which is critical for the dnapl sza owing to the poor estimation of the permeability using only the ptt data produces unsatisfactory results for the dnapl estimation the permeability can be well characterized by using the esmda ds method based on the improved permeability estimation the dnapl source zone can be characterized in a high resolution using the combined esmda ds and esmda method compared with the iterative esmda method the error of the sn estimation is reduced by 24 9 using the combined esmda ds and esmda method the prediction of sza depletion and plumes are also greatly improved by improved permeability estimation the prediction rmse of the dnapl dissolved plume is reduced by 34 5 after 50 years 40 0 after 100 years and 49 4 after 200 years in addition multi source datasets especially using low cost ert data significantly improve data sparsity and result in a more accurate dnapl estimate dnapl sza characterization is a complex inversion problem that includes many nonlinear properties in this work we propose a method by improving the characterization of permeability to accurately estimate the dnapl distribution in non gaussian aquifers with limited boreholes however this framework was examined using a numerical experiment with the assumption of perfect geophysical models the petrophysical model may have some uncertainties for example in petrophysics the saturation and cementation exponent can be changed in different environments revil et al 2018 in addition the groundwater temperature is not constant sen and goode 1992 future work should test the uncertainty of geophysical model on

4009,high resolution characterization of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone architecture sza is crucial for developing remediation strategies inverse modeling approaches are widely used to characterize dnapl sza however unknown parameters permeability and dnapl saturation are usually assumed as gaussian distribution in traditional geostatistical inverse methods e g ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation esmda this assumption may not be true in channels of fluvial deposits the presence of clay lenses will bring significant challenges in reconstructing the dnapl sza using geostatistical inverse methods based on the gaussian assumption moreover the dnapl characterization also suffers from a limited number of borehole data in the field in this study we use esmda s variant ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation direct sampling esmda ds to improve the estimation of non gaussian permeability field and evaluate the benefits of improved permeability estimation on the reconstruction of dnapl source zone the inversion technique is based on the iterative inversion framework to incorporate the clay content information into the dnapl characterization the performance of our proposed framework is examined and discussed through a numerical synthetic case with challenging pool dominated sza to overcome data scarcity we integrated hydrogeological and geophysical electrical resistance tomography datasets results show that the permeability is characterized well using esmda ds method compared with esmda method with the improved permeability estimation the dnapl source zone can be characterized in higher resolution compared with esmda method the root mean square error rmse of permeability is reduced by 38 5 using the esmda ds method then the estimation rmse of dnapl saturation is reduced by 24 9 by improved permeability estimation we also demonstrated the significant benefits of improved permeability estimation on dnapl depletion behavior and plume evolution numerical simulations demonstrate with the improved permeability estimation the dnapl depletion prediction is highly improved the prediction rmse of the dnapl dissolved plume is reduced by 34 5 after 50 years keywords combined esmda ds and esmda method dnapl source zone characterization clay content electrical resistivity tomography 1 introduction dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination has become a severe environmental problem worldwide national research council 2013 owing to its high density low viscosity and low interfacial tension leaked dnapl penetrates deeply into the aquifer pankow and cherry 1996 after migration dnapl may be entrapped as discontinuous ganglia or as pools above a local low permeable zone and serve as long term groundwater contamination kueper et al 2014 national research council 2013 an excellent detailed description of the dnapl source zone architecture sza in the subsurface is necessary to develop an effective remediation method for the contaminated zone koch and nowak 2015 however subsurface heterogeneity influences the dnapl sza significantly tiny changes in the subsurface media might lead to considerably different dnapl sza ferrari et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to characterize the hydrogeological parameters e g permeability before dnapl source zone characterization kueper et al 2014 in recent years many valuable studies have considered the impact of subsurface heterogeneity during dnapl characterization illman et al 2010 kang et al 2020 pollicino et al 2021a yeh and zhu 2007 for dnapl sza estimations several researchers assumed that the log transformed permeability and log transformed dnapl saturation followed a gaussian distribution and various strategies have been proposed yeh and zhu 2007 zhu et al 2009 these include the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2009 ensemble smoothing es van leeuwen and evensen 1996 sequential successive linear estimator ssle yeh and liu 2000 and principal component geostatistical approach pcga kitanidis and lee 2014 these methods are popular in permeability and dnapl distribution inversion owing to their simplicity and flexibility in implementation among these methods ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation esmda emerick and reynolds 2013 can obtain better data estimation of the parameters and cost less computational time than the enkf method emerick 2016 however subsurface hydraulic properties are not always gaussian and may include paleo channels and low permeability lenses zovi et al 2017 these non gaussian aquifers including clay lenses will bring significant challenges in reconstructing sza with geostatistical inverse methods based on the gaussian assumption such as the esmda method previous studies have used two strategies to solve the non gaussian problem caused by the sand clay interbedding aquifer on the one hand some researchers have used parameterization methods to convert the non gaussian parameter to the gaussian parameter chang et al 2010 li et al 2018 li et al 2011 liu and oliver 2005 xu and jaime gomez hernandez 2018 zhou et al 2011 moreover machine learning has been used for the parameterization of non gaussian parameter fields canchumuni et al 2017 mo et al 2020 on the other hand some studies have focused on using geostatistical methods to handle the non gaussian characteristics for instance zhou et al 2012 introduced a pattern search based method based on direct sampling ds to estimate the non gaussian parameter distribution effectively sarma et al 2008 proposed a kernel enkf based on multiple point geostatistics mpg to characterize the permeability li et al 2019 introduced an iterative scheme based on a simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle with hierarchical cluster analysis hca to reconstruct a non gaussian field cao et al 2018 combined ds and es to estimate the non gaussian parameters through pilot points the es ds method not only preserves the non gaussian structure via ds but also efficiently considers dynamic data kang et al 2019 adapted the iterative es ds to the esmda ds because of the better data matches and lower computational cost with the esmda method emerick and reynolds 2013 although there are many solutions for non gaussian permeability fields to the best of our knowledge few studies have considered the non gaussian aquifer problem in dnapl source zones because of the complexity of the joint inversion of the dnapl distribution and non gaussian aquifer permeability compared with the traditional gaussian method the non gaussian method can improve permeability estimation in aquifer including clay lenses however the estimation of dnapl saturation using this improvement remains unclear in an aquifer with low permeability lenses the influence of permeability on the estimation result of dnapl saturation continues to be worthy of study in addition to the problem of inversion methods the reconstruction of dnapl source zones also faces data scarcity from traditional methods such as intrusive drilling parker et al 2008 siegrist et al 2006 in recent years many indirect measurements have been proposed to characterize the dnapl sza pollicino et al 2021b for instance zhou and cardiff 2017 characterize the sza by oscillatory hydraulic testing oht because the changes in the napl distribution influence the effective hydraulic conductivity another widely used indirect method is the partitioning tracer test ptt dridi et al 2009 ptt measures the spatial distribution of dnapl according to the delayed action when the partitioning tracer passes through the dnapl as an extension of ptt yeh and zhu 2007 proposed hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography hptt to estimate both permeability and dnapl saturation by integrating hydraulic tomography ht and the ptt method laboratory experiments have demonstrated that hptt can reconstruct the main part of the sza illman et al 2010 however the hptt method still faces the problem of data sparsity as a supplement to the information electrical resistivity tomography ert as a kind of geophysical method has been applied to map the dnapl distribution because of its nonintrusive and low cost naudet et al 2014 steelman et al 2017 when geophysical methods are applied to characterize the dnapl distribution in an aquifer that includes low permeability clay the clay content parameter cannot be ignored first dnapl tends to accumulate on the top of the low permeability clay layers during the dnapl migration process resulting in long term stable contaminate sources thus information about the clay spatial distribution is essential for the distribution of the dnapl second the presence of clay lenses will produce noise in the ert measurement because high resistivity anomalies associated with dnapls in sandy aquifers generally decrease due to electrically conductive minerals such as clays the clay with unknown content hampers the effectiveness of ert for dnapl mapping cardarelli and di filippo 2009 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 therefore accurately calculate the clay content is important for dnapl characterization however previous studies often neglect the clay content either only considered the dnapl distribution aghasi et al 2013 datta gupta et al 2002 dridi et al 2009 james et al 1997 or both the subsurface heterogeneity and dnapl distribution illman et al 2010 zhu et al 2009 in this study we used the iterative framework proposed by guo et al 2021 to incorporate the clay content information for dnapl source zone characterization based on this framework we compared the iterative esmda method both k and sn are inverted by esmda and combined esmda ds and esmda method k is inverted by esmda ds and sn is inverted by esmda for sza characterization to evaluate the benefit of improved permeability characterization in the reconstruction of the dnapl source zone multi source datasets were used to solve the data sparsity under this framework we estimated the permeability and calculated the clay content by hydraulic head data conservative tracer data and drilling permeability data in stage 1 based on the permeability and clay content information from stage 1 we characterized the dnapl distribution by ptt and ert data in stage 2 after stage 2 the estimated dnapl was used in stage 1 in the next iteration to incorporate the dnapl information into the ht a numerical synthetic case was performed in a non gaussian aquifer with a dnapl sza generated by the multiphase flow model then we simulated the source zone depletion to evaluate the ability of the estimated parameters in predicting the source zone longevity finally the influence of the permeability and clay content on ptt and ert

to invert the permeability and dnapl distribution through an iterative hydrogeophysical inversion framework emerick and reynolds 2013 a flowchart of the iterative esmda method is presented in fig 1 in this iterative framework two stages were used to characterize the dnapl distribution in stage 1 we estimated the permeability and calculated the clay content using drilling permeability data hydraulic head data and conservative tracer data based on the estimated permeability and clay content the dnapl saturation was characterized using partitioning tracer and ert data in stage 2 in stage 1 the utchem software was used to obtain the hydraulic head and conservative tracer see eq 1 then the esmda method was used to assimilate the drilling permeability data hydraulic head data and conservative tracer data to estimate the non gaussian permeability see eqs 9 13 based on the estimated permeability the clay contents were calculated using eqs 2 6 in stage 2 with the information of permeability and clay contents obtained before utchem software is applied to obtain tracer concentration see eq 1 then the hydrogeology information was used to conduct ert forward model see eqs 7 8 finally the esmda method was applied to characterize the dnapl saturation see eqs 9 13 after stage 2 the estimated sn field was applied in stage 1 in the next iteration to form a loop guo et al 2021 this framework will continue to iterate until one of the termination criteria is achieved 1 the iteration number reaches 8 or 2 when the difference in the root mean square error rmse between two adjacent loops is less than the predefined threshold δ for more details about the iteration threshold one can refer to guo et al 2021 the esmda method used in iterative hydrogeophysical inversion can be

the esmda method shown in the previous section is used to estimate the dnapl distribution in stage 2 the iterative framework of the combined esmda ds and esmda method is similar to that of the iterative esmda method and is not further explained a chart of the combined esmda ds and esmda method is provided in fig 1 as a variant of the esmda the esmda ds method couples the esmda and ds methods to preserve non gaussian structures and efficiently consider dynamic data for the esmda ds method after each assimilation by esmda section 2 3 1 step 5 the ds method interpolates the updated permeability at pilot points to the unsampled zone the extrapolated parameter was implemented for the next iteration for more details about the ds method one can refer to mariethoz et al 2010 3 synthetic case 3 1 synthetic domains and source zone architectures the numerical experiment was developed in a 2 d non gaussian aquifer 24 m 16 m the aquifer was discretized into 48 32 1 536 elements with length of each block size as 0 5 m δ x δ z 0 5 m the background hydraulic gradient was set as 0 003 to make the groundwater flow from left to right based on the training image fig 2 a we used the ds method to generate the non gaussian heterogeneous parameters y log permeability field fig 2b for actual cases training images can be obtained from expert information strebelle 2012 yanshu et al 2020 or geophysical methods zhang et al 2015 the corresponding clay content calculated from the reference permeability is exhibited in fig 2d the tetrachloroethylene pce leakage process is simulated by utchem software in an aquifer the dnapl sza was generated in a non gaussian aquifer as a point source of pce leaking at a rate of 0 16 m3 d for 10 d and migrating naturally for 100 d after migration pce was entrapped above the low permeability lenses fig 2e the ganglia to pool gtp of sza was 0 11 represent pool dominant sza then we assumed the dnapl had reached equilibrium and was immobile kang et al 2020 koch and nowak 2015 the parameters of the synthetic experiment are shown in table 1 3 2 multiple observation data two cases were designed to compare the benefits of improved permeability characterization when reconstructing the dnapl source zone table 2 for case 1 the iterative esmda method was used to characterize both the permeability and dnapl distribution for case 2 the combined esmda ds and esmda method was used to reconstruct the dnapl distribution in both cases the same observation methods were applied to estimate the dnapl sza conservative tracer data hydraulic head data and drilling permeability data were used to reconstruct the ln k log e permeability field in stage 1 and the sn field was further characterized by both ptt and ert data in stage 2 to avoid the destruction of the dnapl sza surface based ert was used to measure the approximate location of the dnapl distribution before the observation wells and a cross borehole ert was installed we set the total length of the surface based ert to 48 m and electrodes with 1 m spacing fig 3 there were no resistivity data beyond the research zone then the agi software directly inverted the apparent resistivity measured by surface based ert with an 8 relative observation error from the results we can find that the abnormally high value of resistivity in the study zone ranges from x 8 to x 16 m where the dnapl sza is most likely to appear thus to accurately depict the dnapl sza without destruction boreholes can be arranged at x 0 8 16 and 24 m in the research zone in stage 1 based on the result from surface based ert four penetrating boreholes were considered in the aquifer at x 0 8 16 and 24 m and each borehole had 12 ports spread evenly fig 4 first we directly sampled aquifer permeability with 2 m spacing z 0 5 2 5 4 5 6 5 8 5 10 5 12 5 14 5 m in each well to conduct the conservative tracer injection bromide in the form of nabr was used as a conservative tracer with a density of 0 5 kg m3 we injected bromide with a constant rate of 5 m3 d in each high permeability port and 0 5 m3 d in each low permeability port at x 0 m we pumped at the rate of 5 m3 d in each high permeability port and 0 5 m3 d in each low permeability port at x 24 m we assumed that the information of permeability in the boreholes is known meanwhile 24 additional ports at x 8 and 16 were used as the observation wells we collected the data once daily with 36 hydraulic head data and 36 conservative data collected from three penetrating vertical wells at x 8 16 and 24 m we conducted this process for 20 d and obtained 720 hydraulic data 720 conservative tracer data and 32 permeability data in stage 2 the previous 48 ports were used as observation ports and four additional ports fig 4 blue quadrate at x 8 and 16 m were added as injection ports to conduct the ptt water was injected at a constant rate of 10 m3 d through one of the four injection ports to form a steady state flow field then a mixture of the partitioning and conservative tracers was released in the same port for 1 d and the simulation was conducted for 5 d in this tracer mixture we use three kinds of partitioning tracer moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 2 2 dimethyl 3 pentanol dmp n hexanol hex and 6 methyl 2 heptanol 6m2h as the partitioning tracer solution with 0 5 kg m3 for each tracer bromide was selected as the conservative tracer with 5 kg m3 to significantly influence the water phase conductivity when bromide was injected into the subsurface to conduct the ert measurements 48 electrodes were placed in vertical boreholes and 25 electrodes were placed on the surface we used a bipole bipole array in our measurements seferou et al 2013 the concentrations were acquired once a day with 48 conservative tracer data and 144 partitioning tracer data the ert measurements were obtained once every 5 d using 5 605 ert data thus for the four port ptt simulation over 20 d 2 880 partitioning tracer concentration measurements and 22 420 ert measurements were collected with the reference permeability clay content and dnapl distribution we could obtain the reference hydraulic head tracer concentration and ert data through the forward models mentioned in sections 2 1 2 2 we added 0 1 1 3 and 8 relative errors to the drilling permeability hydraulic head tracer concentration and bulk resistivity respectively these error levels are based on previous studies such as jardani et al 2013 and nan and wu 2011 3 3 inversion parameters the same initial parameters were used in the two proposed methods iterative esmda method and combined esmda ds and esmda method the initial permeability field was generated from the ds method based on the training image shown in fig 2a with a realization size of 300 the initial sn field dnapl saturation was created by the generated sequential gaussian simulator in the geostatistical software library gslib with mean ln sn 4 6 sn 0 01 standard deviation σ ln s n 1 and ix iz 5 5 m as a prior covariance model deutsch and journel 1998 the realization size of sn is the same as ln k in this study we set the number of multiple data assimilations as 4 na 4 in the permeability and dnapl estimation and the coefficients of data assimilation were set as ɑ1 9 333 ɑ2 7 0 ɑ3 4 0 and ɑ4 2 0 respectively emerick and reynolds 2013 the pilot points fig 4c in the spatial distribution were randomly generated with the number set to 200 in the esmda ds method kang et al 2019 all the simulations and inversions were run on a workstation with an eight core 32 gb ram and 2 6 ghz cpu here the termination threshold δ was set as 0 03 for the iterative inversion framework to quantitatively compare the performance of different cases rmse was applied as the criterion to demonstrate the results of ln k and sn chen and zhang 2006 4 results 4 1 iterative esmda method to test the iterative esmda method on the dnapl sza estimation the sza estimate was analyzed as shown in fig 5 fig 5 presents the ensemble mean of the estimated ln k and sn fields histogram of ln k field and variance of the sn field ln k was estimated through the hydraulic head data conservative tracer data and drilling permeability data dnapl sza was estimated based on integrating the ptt data and ert data in fig 5 a threshold value of sn 0 01 is used for visualization purposes based on multi source datasets the traditional esmda method could roughly reconstruct the permeability the preferential flow conduits and low permeability lenses could be roughly delineated however owing to the deviation between the gaussian assumption and physical reality esmda fails to characterize the channel and lens shape accurately in the histogram the esmda method also fails to preserve the non gaussian properties of the reference field by combining the ptt and ert data the location of the dnapl at high saturation could be estimated however because of errors in the permeability obtained from the previous stage we failed to characterize the spread of the dnapl distribution during this stage the results indicate that in a complex aquifer that contains clay ln k is crucial for estimating the distribution of dnapl although our data integrating ptt and ert data are sufficient we still could not reconstruct the distribution of dnapl at a high resolution owing to the incorrect estimation of the ln k field 4 2 combined esmda ds and esmda method we evaluated the results of the combined esmda ds and esmda method to inverse permeability and dnapl saturation as shown in fig 6 the figure presents the ensemble mean of the calibrated ln k and sn fields the histogram of the ln k field and the variance of the sn field in case 2 the observation data in fig 6 are the same as those in fig 5 in fig 6 a threshold value of sn 0 01 is used in case 2 we used the esmda ds method to estimate the permeability the results suggest that the ensemble mean could capture the spatial distribution structure of the permeability with a high resolution both the low permeability lenses and connectivity of the channel could be recovered well in particular to improve the low permeability media estimation the method provides the basis for further improving the estimation results of dnapl from the histogram the permeability inverted from esmda ds maintained the non gaussian characteristics well from the reference field compared with case 1 the permeability was better estimated in case 2 the results also demonstrate the advantage of the esmda ds method for non gaussian field estimations according to table 3 compared with the esmda method case 1 the rmse of the permeability estimations is reduced by 38 5 with the esmda ds method we successfully reproduced the dnapl distribution field for the sn field owing to a more accurate permeability estimate using the esmda ds method as a result the shape and distribution range of dnapl have been estimated well in addition the variance maps indicate that the dnapl distribution has a lower uncertainty in case 2 than in case 1 according to table 3 compared with the dnapl based on the iterative esmda method case 1 the sn estimation rmse is reduced by 24 9 using the combined esmda ds and esmda method case 2 4 3 comparison of the iterative esmda method with combined esmda ds and esmda method this section reports on the use of different metrics to further compare the iterative esmda method with the combined esmda ds and esmda method to evaluate the benefit of the improved permeability characterization on the high resolution mapping of the dnapl source zone in fig 7 the variance cumulative distribution functions cdfs and scatterplots are used to characterize the permeability in the initial field the variance and cdf exhibit high uncertainty in case 1 with the esmda method the uncertainty of the variance and cdf could be reduced to a minimum value but the cdf ensemble mean fails to match the reference field the scatterplots of case 1 also have poor results in matching the reference field in case 2 the variance of ln k becomes relatively low in the estimated area compared with case 1 the uncertainty of variance and cdf in case 2 are slightly higher because case 1 updates all the permeability parameters in each iteration while case 2 only updates the parameters at pilot points in each iteration and uses ds to generate all the permeability parameters the variance in the channel boundaries has a more considerable uncertainty than the other zones which is consistent with other studies kang et al 2019 in addition the cdf in case 2 estimates permeability field with lower uncertainty and the scatterplots match the reference field better than for case 1 in fig 8 to clarify the effect of the estimation result of dnapl by different ln k values we plot the estimation error sn err sn est sn true false positive and false negative errors of the source zone estimated from cases 1 and 2 the false positive error represents the estimated dnapl in a specific region where no reference dnapl is present in contrast a false negative represents a failure to reconstruct the source zones where the reference field exists fig 8 demonstrates that case 2 has fewer false positive and false negative errors than case 1 the overestimated dnapl masses are 3 21 and 1 30 tons in cases 1 and case 2 respectively the underestimated dnapl masses are 1 79 and 1 23 tons in cases 1 and 2 respectively the results quantitatively indicate that in a clay containing aquifer the dnapl distribution obtained based on the combined esmda ds and esmda method is better than that provided by the iterative esmda method alone to further compare the two methods utchem software was applied to demonstrate the process of sza depletion and plumes based on sn and ln k fields from the reference case 1 and case 2 fig 9 the results indicate that the dnapl source zones will exist for hundreds of years in the aquifer that contains clay after 100 years the contamination plume can still exist stably indicating that dnapl can form a long term source of contamination in case 1 we failed to predict the source zone depletion process and the distribution of plumes owing to the incorrect estimation of the dnapl sza in case 2 we successfully simulated the dnapl source depletion and plume evolution using an accurate estimate of sza which is essential for efficient remediation design and management schemes compared with case 1 the rmse of the predicted dissolution plume in case 2 is reduced by 34 5 after 50 years 40 0 after 100 years and 49 4 after 200 years this significant improvement is because the combined esmda ds and esmda method can better characterize the shape of the dnapl pool 5 discussion to further discuss the effect of permeability and clay improvement on different data ptt and ert data diverse datasets were used to estimate the dnapl distribution table 4 first in fig 10 based on the ln k obtained from the esmda method the sn field was further estimated using the ptt and ert data in case 1 only ptt data in case 1 ptt and only ert data in case 1 ert then based on the ln k obtained from the esmda ds method the sn field was further estimated using both the ptt and ert data in case 2 only ptt data in case 2 ptt and only ert data in case 2 ert in case 1 ptt the estimation using ptt failed to capture the source zone of the reference dnapl distribution because the previously estimated ln k had a significant influence on the results of the dnapl estimation when only a single ptt dataset was used to characterize the dnapl field kang et al 2020 because both the permeability and dnapl saturation can affect the break through curves of ptt when the previously estimated ln k differs significantly from the reference field using only ptt data to estimate dnapl will also result in significant errors in case 2 ptt the estimation using ptt could capture the approximate dnapl source of the reference dnapl field compared with case 1 ptt because of the improved permeability estimation however ptt still failed to reconstruct the dnapl field in detail and overestimated the spread of the dnapl source zone because tracers mostly flowed in high permeability channels the quality of the data collected from observation ports in lenses was low resulting in a scarcity of useful data the variance in the paleo channel regions was lower than that in the lens zones which also indicates that the data from the paleo channel areas are high quality for the pool dnapl estimation ptt could roughly characterize the pool dnapl source zone entrapped in the low permeability region the low permeability region with the pool dnapl could cause a flow bypassing problem which would lead to inaccurate estimation results poor prior permeability may lead to dnapl misestimations guo et al 2021 notably the ptt failed to characterize the pool dnapl sza near the top aquifer because this zone is not located in the highly permeable preferential flow conduits groundwater mobility in this region is lacking making it difficult for the observation port to collect tracers that interacted with the dnapl during the ptt in this zone in case 1 ert the ert method could be applied to the dnapl sza reconstruction because ert is sensitive to dnapl with a high saturation according to the geophysical model however ert fails to estimate the dnapl distribution owing to the erroneous result of the estimated clay content in the previous stage the estimation results verify that accurate prior information on the clay content is necessary for the ert data in the dnapl characterization in case 2 ert using more accurate ln k and clay content the ert successfully captured the dnapl source zone with a high saturation with sufficient data when the precise estimation of the clay content was carried into the second stage to estimate dnapl the noise of the clay in the ert could be eliminated however the high dnapl was overestimated and a substantial portion of the low dnapl source zone was lost owing to the low resolution of the ert compared with case 2 ptt the low measurement accuracy of the ert also provided more significant uncertainty than the ptt in case 1 compared with the single data sources see fig 10 case 1 ptt and 1 ert the estimation result of dnapl is better when using the multi source data however case 1 still could not characterize the dnapl saturation at a high resolution because of the previous poor result of the permeability and clay content nevertheless the results indicate that even if there are significant errors in the prior information of the permeability and clay content multi source datasets can still be used to improve the dnapl estimation in case 2 the ptt and ert data were incorporated to characterize the dnapl distribution the results indicate that the dnapl sza could be well reconstructed by joint inversion compared with the other cases both the pool and residual dnapl source zones were captured by integrating the ert and ptt data when accurate previous information of ln k and clay content were used the improvement in the estimation confirms that ert can be added as an excellent complement to the tracer test ptt could roughly capture the residual dnapl distribution in the high permeability channel using limited datasets case 2 ptt however because of the flow bypassing the dnapl pools in the non gaussian aquifer the partitioning tracer could not sufficiently contact the dnapl pool ptt can only contact the upper surface of dnapl and reconstructed it poorly as a complement ert is sensitive to the dnapl pool and could provide sufficient data therefore the dnapl field from joint inversion is better than that from single datasets with lower uncertainty in the dnapl sza including clay layers accurate prior information ln k and clay content and multi source observation datasets are essential for dnapl characterization with high resolution many outperformance studies have also determined the advantages of multi source datasets aghasi et al 2013 kang et al 2020 the rmse of the sn distribution also demonstrates that by utilizing the complementarity of ptt and ert the dnapl distribution can be better estimated table 5 compared with the ptt method the rmse of the sn distribution can be reduced by 15 7 by integrating the ptt and ert data to further assess the performance of different cases five spatial metrics of the sza were analyzed using a boxplot including the dnapl mass x and z centers and spread of mass shown in fig 11 fig 11 indicates that based on the better ln k and clay content obtained from the esmda ds method we can obtain more accurate dnapl distribution results by integrating ptt and ert case 2 in fig 11a the ptt data provides better results than the ert data for the total dnapl mass whereas the ert method tends to overestimate the mass the results from integrating the ptt and ert data cases 1 and 2 also exhibit more accuracy for the dnapl mass than the single datasets fig 11b and 11c indicate that the center of the source zone is closer to the reference value by improving the estimated permeability fig 11d and 11e demonstrate that the spread of the dnapl saturation can be characterized better by increasing the accuracy of the permeability estimate when the permeability estimate obtained from the esmda method is lacking the spread of dnapl mass cannot be characterized well even when multi source datasets are used comparing case 1 ptt case 1 ert and case 1 6 conclusions this work compared the iterative esmda method with the combined esmda ds and esmda method to evaluate the benefit of improved k on sza estimation in a non gaussian aquifer through an iterative hydrogeophysical inversion framework in the iterative framework two methods are implemented 1 multi source datasets are used in sequence according to their complementarity the permeability and clay content are inverted by integrating the hydraulic head data conservative tracer data and drilling permeability data and the dnapl distribution is inverted by integrating the ptt data and ert data so that the dnapl sza can be reconstructed with high resolution in limited boreholes 2 the estimated clay contents are used as prior information in the dnapl reconstruction to incorporate the clay content into dnapl distribution to demonstrate the advantage of the improved permeability estimation of the dnapl sza a numerical experiment was conducted in a 2d non gaussian aquifer with complex dnapl source zones the results indicate that complex dnapl sources with low permeability clay and a limited number of boreholes bring significant challenges to the iterative esmda method the esmda method can roughly characterize the main permeability pattern but fails to capture the non gaussian characteristics of the reference field which is critical for the dnapl sza owing to the poor estimation of the permeability using only the ptt data produces unsatisfactory results for the dnapl estimation the permeability can be well characterized by using the esmda ds method based on the improved permeability estimation the dnapl source zone can be characterized in a high resolution using the combined esmda ds and esmda method compared with the iterative esmda method the error of the sn estimation is reduced by 24 9 using the combined esmda ds and esmda method the prediction of sza depletion and plumes are also greatly improved by improved permeability estimation the prediction rmse of the dnapl dissolved plume is reduced by 34 5 after 50 years 40 0 after 100 years and 49 4 after 200 years in addition multi source datasets especially using low cost ert data significantly improve data sparsity and result in a more accurate dnapl estimate dnapl sza characterization is a complex inversion problem that includes many nonlinear properties in this work we propose a method by improving the characterization of permeability to accurately estimate the dnapl distribution in non gaussian aquifers with limited boreholes however this framework was examined using a numerical experiment with the assumption of perfect geophysical models the petrophysical model may have some uncertainties for example in petrophysics the saturation and cementation exponent can be changed in different environments revil et al 2018 in addition the groundwater temperature is not constant sen and goode 1992 future work should test the uncertainty of geophysical model on
