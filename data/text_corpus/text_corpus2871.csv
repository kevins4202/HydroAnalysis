14355,in the present study the degradation of industrial textile wastewater sdww was investigated using a membrane photocatalytic reactor mpr in the presence of zinc oxide capped with polyethylene glycol zno peg nanoparticles and polypiperazine amide ppa tight ultrafiltration membrane uf ppa the optimum operating conditions of mpr were obtained under initial ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles and 75 dilution of sdww field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and atomic force microscopy afm analyses confirmed that zno peg nanoparticles and the uf ppa membrane have great potential as an alternative treatment to meet the stringent discharge limits the mechanisms of membrane fouling for the optimum operational condition were investigated using model fitting according to the wiesner and aptel equations it was revealed that cake formation occurred rapidly at both stages of the fouling mechanism hence it is believed that this integrated approach has a great potential to be implemented in the industrial textile wastewater treatment sector to ensure the environmental cleanliness for future generations keywords membrane photocatalytic reactor mpr zinc oxide polyethylene glycol textile wastewater membrane fouling mechanism 1 introduction the textile industry is one of the largest consumers of water dyes and chemicals that are used during various stages of textile processing however the large amounts of effluents generated are typically unsuitable for further use it is estimated that about 5000 tons of dyeing materials are discharged into the environment annually 1 such actions are aesthetically undesirable toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic if the discharged materials are committed without prior treatment 2 3 typically the characteristics of textile wastewater vary significantly in colour turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids and electrical conductivity since it contains a large number of chemicals 4 furthermore the dye containing effluents are undesirable because of its breakdown products such as benzidine naphthalene and other aromatic compounds 5 the government is currently introducing more stringent laws as water demands for industrial and public uses have increased the laws aim to reduce the discharge of pollutant effluents into the environment consequently dyeing factories are obligated to upgrade their existing wastewater treatment to meet the requirements for discharging effluents furthermore many dyeing companies now plan to reuse secondary effluents for environmental protection and economic reasons therefore the integrated exploration of dye wastewater treatment is important for treating raw effluents in the dyeing industry currently coagulation flocculation is a recognised process generally practised for treating industrial dye wastewater this is due to its simplicity and effectiveness in reducing pollutants in terms of turbidity colour and odour of wastewater 6 7 the traditional process for textile wastewater treatment has become an unattractive method this is due to high energy demand chemical reagents consumed and operational investment costs required for the tank and dosage units which generate sludge that needs further treatment 8 alternatively the use of a membrane photocatalytic reactor mpr could potentially achieve more sustainable operations typically the mpr ensures efficient degradation of dyes which have gained considerable attention in wastewater treatment in recent years the mpr is a hybrid system demonstrated by the coupling of photocatalysis process and membrane filtration system 9 it also shows remarkable improvement over the existing treatment and has potential impacts for the industrial dye wastewater treatment this is due to several advantages such as a keeping the photocatalyst confined in the reaction environment b realising a continuous process with simultaneous separation of catalyst and products and c controlling the molecules retention time in a reactor 10 therefore mpr can be effectively utilised to decolourise detoxify and treat industrial dye wastewater numerous reports on mpr have used various photocatalyst on conventional materials such as ceramics or polymer membranes bai et al reported the combination of carbon nanotubes with zno cnt zno nano composite ultrafiltration uf membrane this was successfully synthesised through hydrothermal synthesis which concurrently exploits the high adsorption capability and filtration flux properties of the membrane 11 however membrane fouling remains a critical issue typically attributed to the decrease in permeate flux over time according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac working party on membrane nomenclatures membrane fouling is the loss of the performance of a membrane this phenomenon is typically ascribed to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on the external surfaces pore openings or within its pores of the membrane 12 this phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the composition of the feed and the membrane which results in the decline of the permeate flux 10 13 as a consequence productivity could reduce with increasing operational and maintenance costs in principle the characteristics of the photocatalyst membrane pore size and operating variables also have significant impacts on membrane fouling during filtration in mpr systems 10 14 this phenomenon can be addressed by ensuring optimum control of the operational conditions which could increase the permeate flux efficiency and the cost effectiveness of the mpr process in 1985 hermia proposed the blocking filtration laws which were widely employed to explain the fouling phenomena in membrane processes 15 the form of blocking filtration laws can be presented as eq 1 where v is the volume of permeate at the time t and k is the coefficient depending on the flow rate and solution properties the parameter n is a constant which depends on the fouling mechanism involved in the system and the model as summarised in table 1 15 16 furthermore the laws were modified in 1996 by wiesner and aptel according to the authors the plot representing 1 j n versus time presents two stages of the blocking mechanism using two different slopes the term k1 describes the transport of cake forming materials to the membrane whereas k2 indicates the relative importance of the back transport mechanisms in removing materials from the membrane as shown in fig 1 17 the model is verified under three assumptions namely constant membrane resistance constant pressure drop and specific resistance of the cake that is constant with time the experimental observations were used independently to explain the flux decline the mechanism of membrane fouling is illustrated in fig 2 in terms of the standard blocking model intermediate blocking model cake filtration model and the complete blocking model as illustrated in fig 3 1 d 2 t d v 2 k d t d v n due to its excellent properties and affordability the polypiperazine amide ppa tight ultrafiltration membrane uf ppa is a promising approach for the decolourisation of dye wastewater aided by the potential primary treatment in the presence of zno peg nanoparticles despite the numerous publications on mpr performance studies on the performance of zno peg nanoparticles and uf ppa membrane via mpr system for the textile wastewater treatment are still lacking in the literature therefore this work aims to explore the degradation of textile wastewater through the mpr system in the presence of zno peg nanoparticles as photocatalyst and subsequent filtration using the uf ppa membrane the influence of various parameters such as initial ph loading of zno peg and dilution of sdww was also investigated in the present study 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile wastewater sample textile wastewater sdww was generated at a textile factory in johor malaysia where printing dyeing and finishing mainly occurs the sdww is dark blue in colour at room temperature the wastewater used in the experimental work was not subjected to any treatment in the industry the detailed untreated textile wastewater was characterised by ph ph 13 turbidity 56 6 2 1 ntu cod 2028 2 6 mg l and electrical conductivity 13 500 0 1 μs cm as presented in table 2 2 2 synthesis of zno zinc acetate dehydrate and oxalic acid dehydrate were all purchased from r m marketing essex united kingdom uk the zno peg nanoparticles were synthesised through the precipitation method described in zainuri et al 18 consequently 0 15 m of oxalic acid dehydrate solution was added slowly into 0 1 m of zinc acetate dehydrate solution at room temperature 25 c to form a white suspension next 0 015 g l of peg was added into the mixture after 5 min of the reaction 18 the mixture was stirred for 12 h to increase the production of zno before filtration to obtain the precipitate the precipitated sample was subsequently dried in an oven at 80 c for 1 h finally the precipitate was calcined at 550 c for 3 h in the furnace nabertherm model germany to remove any impurities in the zno peg nanoparticles after the calcination process the white zno peg powder was formed and ready for use as a photocatalyst in the mpr system it is crucial to state that the peg was absent on the zno nanoparticles after the calcination process lastly the synthesised sample was characterised using transmission electron microscopy tem as shown in fig 4 the tem micrographs revealed that no agglomeration was observed on the zno peg nanoparticles with an average size ranging from 25 nm to 40 nm 2 3 membrane and experimental set up the polypiperazine amide tight ultrafiltration uf ppa membrane ge osmonics trisep ua60 united states was selected for this study it has been considered as both as a tight uf membrane and an open or loose nanofiltration nf membrane table 3 presents the main characteristics of uf ppa membrane in this work the experiments were performed using the mpr system which consists of a membrane sample with an effective area of 20 60 cm2 the membrane sample was wetted out under 6 bars for about 30 min to prevent compaction during permeation or separation experiments a schematic representation of the mpr shown in fig 5 consists of a 2 l photocatalytic reactor and a membrane separation unit this laboratory pilot plant can be operated either in batch or continuous mode firstly 1 l of sdww wastewater under various initial ph ph 4 7 9 11 and 13 was poured into the reactor subsequently different loadings of zno peg 0 08 0 10 and 0 50 g l which acted as photocatalyst were added to determine the optimum ph and loading required for the different experiments sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl obtained from r m chemicals uk were used in this research for solution ph adjustment the mixtures were subsequently agitated with an overhead stirrer hs 30d 83 w daihan scientific korea at 300 rpm for 30 min in the dark to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the operating temperature was maintained at 25 c by the recirculating cooling water using a water chiller cw 5300a 1800 w s a industrial chiller china moreover various dilutions of sdww 0 50 and 75 dilution of sdww were also investigated during the experiment next the ultraviolet uv c lamp with a wavelength of 253 70 nm tuv 11 w philips poland was switched on and the reaction mixture in the photocatalysis process was irradiated by uv light for 20 min the degraded dye then flowed into stainless steel flat sheet membrane module dimensions 9 8 cm 9 8 cm 5 1 cm using a master flex peristaltic pump at trans membrane pressure of 6 bars in this case the permeated flux was analysed for 3 h while measuring its volume every 5 min using a measuring cylinder the effectiveness of zno peg photocatalyst was investigated through a comparative experiment between the photolysis and photocatalysis process under the best operating conditions obtained in this present study 2 4 analytical methods the colour intensity of the samples was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer labomed inc spectro uv 2650 united states at the maximum absorption wavelength λmax 333 nm the dye degradation was determined by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance peak at the maximum wavelength the turbidity and electrical conductivity of the samples were measured using a turbidity meter eutech instrument tn100 100ntu united states and portable multimeter hach hq40d united states and computed based on eq 2 on the other hand cod analysis was conducted through reagent vials method 8000 in the present study two types of cod reagent vials used were low range 0 150 mg l and high range plus 0 15000 mg l next 2 ml of the sample for the low range and 0 2 ml for the high range plus were pipetted into a cod digestion reagent vials the vial contents were stirred vigorously and subsequently placed in the cod reactor at 150 c for 2 h the samples were cooled and tested by colourimetric method using a laboratory spectrophotometer hach dr6000 united states typically the reacted sample is denoted by the appearance of a pure green colour which signals the cod can be measured or the test repeated with a diluted sample the percentage of degradation was calculated as follows 2 c 0 c i c 0 100 where ci

the membranes was calculated using the volume v of permeate per unit area a and unit time t according to the following equation 3 j 0 v a t the instantaneous permeate flux j at each run was computed at the time intervals t1 and t2 by 4 j v 2 v 1 a t 2 t 1 subsequently the flux was normalised as shown in eq 5 for membrane fouling normalised investigation under various parameters the graph was plotted as normalised flux against operating time for comparison and analysis of the declining permeate flux 5 n o r m a l i s e d f l u x s o l u t i o n f l u x j p u r e w a t e r f l u x j 0 the percentage of each membrane flux decline was specified according to the following equation 6 p e r c e n t a g e o f f l u x d e c l i n e 1 j j 0 100 2 6 membrane characterisation the surface and cross sectional morphology of the membrane samples were analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem gemini supra 55vp zeiss japan before the analysis the membrane samples were dried in a desiccator for 24 h and cut into small analytical pieces next the small pieces were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 6 7 hours for cross sectional analysis the samples were then fractured and dried at 60 c in the oven subsequently the dried samples were coated in gold to generate electrical conductivity the observation of the prepared samples was conducted using a microscope at 2 0 and 10 0 kv for membrane cross sectional and surface views respectively analysis of quantitative surface roughness of the membranes was measured using afm imaging and analysis bruker optics germany the membrane samples were dried under vacuum at 40 c for 24 h each sample was fixed on a specimen holder and 3 μm 3 μm areas were scanned by tapping mode in the air the surface roughness was reported in terms of the average roughness ra and root mean square roughness rq 2 7 membrane fouling mechanism in this study the fouling mechanism for the membranes was analysed at optimum condition using the wiesner and aptel equations the graph of y axis according to blocking filtration laws against time data was fitted using matlab r2016b under optimum operational conditions based on the graphs obtained the degree of model fitness r2 and the fitted parameter constant k were computed to determine the fouling mechanism and explain the rationality of the data collected 3 results and discussion 3 1 permeability study the performance of the uf ppa membrane was critically investigated using reverse osmosis ro water under different operating pressures 3 6 bars at 25 c as revealed in table 4 fig 6 presents the graph of ro water flux against different pressures which indicates the linear line coefficient r2 used to determine the suitability of membrane samples for the mpr system during pure permeability it was found that the r2 exceeded 0 90 for uf ppa membrane which indicates it can be applied to the mpr system hence the uf ppa membrane was selected for the textile wastewater treatment in the present study 3 2 effect of initial ph the experimental results for the flux variation with the operating time for different initial ph 4 7 9 11 and 13 of sdww for constant zno peg loading 0 10 g l and dilution 75 dilution of sdww are presented in fig 7 the descending order of the normalised flux was sequenced as ph 11 ph 9 ph 7 ph 4 ph 13 it should be noted that ph 13 was the initial ph of sdww it was found that gradual fouling occurred during the initial 1 5 h of operations which was caused by the pore blockage of the membrane this was due to the accumulation of deposited layers that adversely affected the process performance subsequently the permeate was stabilised and reached a pseudo steady state after a longer period which was attributed to the formation of the secondary layer on the membrane surface 19 the results showed that the permeated flux was responsive to the solution ph furthermore ph 11 of the feed sdww observably improved the normalised flux which obtained a higher final normalised flux at 0 400 0 413 by 60 decline this trend showed that fouling was reduced at ph 11 due to the effectiveness of the photocatalysis in the primary treatment this substantially reduced the pollutants before it was discharged to the membrane filtration system in addition the results were reasonably dependent on the isoelectric point iep of the zno nanoparticles membrane and dye molecules the uf ppa membrane has an iep of about 5 5 which can exhibit positive charges when the solution ph is lower than the iep for the case of zno iep 9 and dyes molecules iep 5 0 the positive charge will predominate when the solution ph is lower than the sample iep values on the contrary the samples are negatively charged when the solution ph is higher than the iep the decrease of flux with time was evident under the acidic solution due to the weak electrostatic repulsion forces between the molecules and membrane surface this resulted in even weaker performance of the membrane fouling in the acidic solution 4 20 in other instances the extreme ph could adversely affect the membrane since the ph tolerance of uf ppa membrane ranges from ph 2 to 11 based on the information provided by the manufacturer it also indicated that ph 11 is the optimum initial ph for sdww degradation based on the mpr performance which is mainly caused by the strong electrostatic repulsion hence much lower accumulation and deposition of dye molecules and zno photocatalyst were found on the membrane surface 3 2 1 quality of treated sdww the quality of treated wastewater was investigated to assess the optimum initial ph of sdww in the hybrid system as shown in table 5 the resulting information is essential to ensure better performance and provide adequate information on the operating conditions for the textile industry moreover it was observed that the quality of the permeated flux fulfilled all the standard discharge limits stipulated by the department of environment doe and the environment quality act eqa 1974 of malaysia furthermore it was revealed that ph 11 exhibited the highest percentage of degradation compared to other ph values these findings were related to the iep of dyes molecules zno photocatalyst and uf ppa membrane respectively 13 since the iep values at ph 4 7 and 9 are marginally different the zno and dye on the membrane surface easily accumulated to form a cake layer it was also observed that zno nanoparticles at ph below 4 could undergo photo corrosion through self oxidation due to the decomposition of zno to zn2 21 similarly the formation of a high concentration of hydroxyl ions that react with holes to form hydroxyl radicals increased when the initial ph was above the iep of zno which subsequently causes a higher degradation efficiency a similar result was obtained for the photocatalysis process by kazeminezhad and sadollahkhani 22 however the extreme ph might affect the stability of zno due to the possibility of alkaline dissolution of zno 23 therefore ph 13 of the initial feed exhibited the worst performance in dye degradation percentage compared to the ph of the others regarding the turbidity removal all the tested ph were reduced by about 80 during the photocatalysis process except at ph 13 the sudden decrease in the turbidity removal at ph 13 can be explained by the salt formation which resulted in the aggregation of dye in the form of cloudy suspension 24 this effectively reduced the formation of hydroxyl radicals due to the enhancement of light scattering and reduction of photon absorption conversely it was observed that the turbidity values at ph 9 and 11 were completely reduced after the uf ppa process this finding revealed that primary treatment is required for highly turbidity effluents to ensure the membrane operates effectively it was found that ph 11 was the most effective ph for removing cod and electrical conductivity which were obtained at 53 30 1 18 mg l and 92 38 0 06 respectively the previous study also reported that uf membranes 1 kda and 10 kda achieved more than 80 cod removal for the reactive dye solution 25 this finding confirms that the efficiency of the uf process in ensuring the quality required from treated dye wastewater the results obtained indicated only minor differences among the other ph values it could be said that the initial ph was unresponsive to the cod retention rates and electrical conductivity removal overall these results confirmed that ph 11 of feed sdww was the optimum ph in improving the mpr performance 3 3 effect of zno peg loading the relationship between flux declination and zno peg loading at ph 11 and 75 dilution of sdww during the degradation of textile wastewater is reported in fig 8 as shown the normalised flux rate increased with increasing loading of zno peg nanoparticles up to 0 10 g l the final normalised flux for 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles was 0 4133 after 2 h and 50 min this was due to the higher photocatalyst loading which increased the active sites on the photocatalyst surface and consequently favoured the number of hydroxyl radicals furthermore the hydroxyl radicals were strong enough to break the bonds of dye molecules resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide co2 and inorganic ions 26 hence this proved that the normalised flux increased considerably with the increasing rate of photocatalytic degradation when the zno peg loading exceeded 0 10 g l the final normalised flux drastically decreased by 25 67 of the initial flux which signifies the worst possibility of the membrane fouling phenomenon it could be claimed that exceeding this limit of zno peg loading has negative effects on the performance of mpr the previous study reported that the overloaded photocatalyst decreased the permeate due to pore blockage caused by agglomeration 27 moreover an overloaded zno peg photocatalyst could decrease the photocatalytic efficiency due to agglomeration and thus the pore size and porosity of membrane may also reduce 28 zheng and co workers claimed that the optimum photocatalyst loading changes with the mpr system according to the type of photocatalyst light sources contaminants and configurations applied 29 therefore it could be concluded that the optimum photocatalyst loading in the present study was 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles 3 3 1 quality of treated sdww table 6 shows the quality of treated sdww under various loadings after the photocatalysis and membrane filtration process in the mpr in the photocatalysis process the presence of 0 10 g l zno peg nanoparticles exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than 0 08 and 0 30 g l zno peg nanoparticles as observed the degradation efficiency increased significantly by increasing the zno peg loading from 0 08 g l to 0 10 g l but suddenly decreased with further increased loading up to 0 30 g l of zno peg nanoparticles similar findings have been reported on the degradation of industrial dyes used for printing newspapers 13 the results indicated that higher loadings of zno peg nanoparticles increased the surface area of the zno photocatalyst that was available for adsorption and degradation 30 31 the number of active sites also increased resulting in the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation rate conversely there was a decrease in the uv light utilisation rate when the zno peg nanoparticles exceeded the value limit this result was due to an increase in turbidity of the solution and scattering effect which reduced the photocatalytic activity of the zno peg nanoparticles therefore the maximum photocatalytic degradation of sdww wastewater was achieved at 0 10 g l moreover the decolourisation efficiency of the sdww after the uf ppa process was somewhat influenced the photocatalysis process when the zno peg loading was equal to 0 10 g l complete degradation occurred thereby ensuring removal of the sdww colour in contrast to the 0 08 and 0 30 g l overall the decolourisation effect of sdww in the overloaded zno peg nanoparticles was worse than in 0 08 g l and 0 10 g l of the zno peg nanoparticles this could be explained by the difficulty in maintaining the homogenous suspension due to the agglomeration of the photocatalyst therefore this might form a cake layer on the membrane surface consequently a thick layer on the membrane surface might prevent effective filtration of effluents from the photocatalytic reactor therefore 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles was deduced as the optimum photocatalyst loading due to the excellent degradation efficiency of sdww as shown in table 6 the percentage of degradation of sdww was comparable to the turbidity reduction of the photocatalysis and uf ppa processes for the photocatalysis process it could be seen that 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles was less turbid 80 92 0 20 compared to the 0 08 g l and 0 30 g l of zno peg nanoparticles conversely full reduction of turbidity was observed for the 0 08 g l and 0 10 g l zno peg nanoparticles after the uf ppa process this observation could be explained by the excess photocatalyst loading which increased the turbidity of the wastewater therefore this phenomenon inhibited the penetration of light into the solution and the degradation of the pollutants for cod measurement it was found that the removal of cod percentage increased from 96 93 0 03 to 97 37 0 06 with an increase in photocatalyst loading from 0 08 to 0 10 g of zno peg nanoparticles in 1 0 l of sdww in a set of runs however the further increment of the zno peg loading up to 0 10 g l did not increase the percentage reduction of cod due to the occurrence of light interception by the suspension 32 in case of electrical conductivity reduction the pattern of experimental results obtained was similar to the case of cod measurement which was arranged by the following sequence 0 30 g l 0 08 g l 0 10 g l it was found that the permeate quality of sdww was in excellent condition based on the standard of environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 schedule 7 therefore the optimum zno peg loading required to exhibit the maximum degradation of sdww was 0 10 g l 3 4 effect of sdww dilution fig 9 illustrates the decline in the normalised flux data for different dilutions of sdww percentage at a fixed zno peg loading 0 10 g l ph 11 and 75 dilution of sdww over time the initial permeation rate of different dilution factors of sdww was almost identical and afterwards the effect of the transverse hydrodynamic force permeation drag on the fouling of membranes was comparable it can also be observed in fig 9 that the 75 and 0 diluted sdww exhibited the highest flux 0 4133 and the lowest flux 0 1700 respectively the lower dilution factor of sdww was attributed to a higher concentration of sdww as the feed concentration increased the membrane surface concentration also increased as a result of increasing osmotic pressure meanwhile the net driving force of flux through the membrane decreased due to the formation of a thicker layer on the membrane surface hence the observed flux decreased at a lower dilution factor of the sdww wastewater conversely the higher concentration of sdww wastewater resulted in the accumulation of dyes on the membrane surface and incremental resistance of the dye 33 also this resulted in a higher pollutant concentration that was retained on the membrane surface which indicated the reduction of the permeate volume similar effects were previously observed by satyanarayana et al 19 hassani et al 34 and yu et al 35 therefore the dilution of dye wastewater is an important parameter that could be practised in industrial wastewater treatment sector to maintain the stability of the membrane 3 4 1 quality of treated sdww the permeate degradation of sdww wastewater for different dilutions was carried out using zno peg nanoparticles at ph 11 table 7 illustrates the result of permeate degradation percentage of the respective wastewater samples under optimised conditions the results indicated that the degradation of sdww wastewater occurred at an excellent rate with 75 dilution of sdww in contrast to other different percentages of dilution in the case of the photocatalysis process 72 42 0 01 decolourisation efficiency was observed for 25 of sdww whereas for 50 and 100 of sdww at similar conditions only 62 50 0 02 and 54 72 0 03 decolourisation efficiency were recorded respectively this showed that the higher dilution of sdww obtained led to the higher the photodegradation efficiency similar findings using zno photocatalyst were reported by wang et al 36 akyol et al 37 and chakrabarti dutta 32 this was due to the competency between the dyes and the hydroxide ion ohˉ adsorption on the surface of the photocatalyst it can also be described that the increase in sdww concentration was attributed to the adsorption of dyes that suppressed the ohˉ ion adsorption as a result the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh declined since the active sites were covered by dye ions 37 consequently the number of free radicals generated on the surface of zno photocatalyst was insufficient to attack and degrade dyes molecules 24 hence it could be deduced that the lower concentration of the initial sdww leads to an increase in hydroxyl radicals that can attack the pollutants resulting in a higher decolourisation efficiency in the photocatalysis process the higher decolourisation efficiency of the photocatalysis process resulted in the excellent degradation of sdww after uf ppa process as observed in table 7 the colour of the 75 diluted sdww was fully degraded after uf ppa membrane whereas 50 and 0 dilution of sdww was achieved at 96 31 0 04 and 94 25 respectively likewise the results confirmed that the photocatalysis process had a significant effect on the performance of the permeate after the uf ppa process therefore the maximum rate of degradation was achieved at 75 dilution of sdww in promoting full colour degradation efficiency for turbidity reduction it could be seen that 0 dilution of sdww in photocatalysis process showed the worst performance which was 40 34 3 28 in contrast to the 75 and 50 dilution of sdww hence the increment of the initial dye concentration that led to lower uv light penetration through the sdww is due to the cloudy suspension and can be explained by the theory of beer lambert s law 24 consequently the photon absorption on the zno photocatalyst along with the turbidity efficiency is reduced during the photocatalytic activity however the increase in sdww concentration decreased the efficiency of turbidity degradation after the uf ppa process however there were not many differences regarding the turbidity reduction of the permeate due to the application of the tight ultrafiltration membrane termed uf ppa the uf ppa membrane had a significant effect on the removal of cod and electrical conductivity as shown in table 7 as observed all the retentions were more noticeable for 75 dilution of sdww than for 50 and 0 dilution of sdww the results are expected since the small particles molecules and ion can easily pass through the tight uf ppa membrane therefore an excellent permeate was achieved at 75 dilution of sdww due to the natural concentration of organic constituent present however the lower concentration of sdww wastewater revealed the lower concentration of organic constituents in the sdww which could be effectively retained in the hybrid mpr system 3 5 effect of photolysis photocatalysis process in the mpr system table 8 illustrates the photocatalytic degradation and permeate of the treated sdww under two different experimental conditions uv c alone photolysis and uv c zno peg photocatalysis using nf ppa membrane at ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg and 75 dilution of sdww it was found that in the presence of both zno peg nanoparticles and uv c light in the photocatalysis process 72 00 0 03 of dye was degraded after 3 h this is in contrast with 0 degradation for the same experiment performed by uv c light the findings demonstrated that both zno peg photocatalyst and uv c light are required for the effective degradation of sdww in the primary treatment of mpr the uv c light was used for the activation of zno peg nanoparticles by the photo excitation process of the zno followed by the formation of an electron hole pair on the surface of the photocatalyst 9 38 the formation of hydroxyl radicals enhanced the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation furthermore the permeate of the nf process that was subjected to photocatalysis exhibited complete dye rejection this was due to the effectiveness of the photocatalysis process which significantly contributed to the excellent degradation rate after nf process therefore the nf process in the mpr system is considered a polishing step to eliminate the residual colouring compounds 39 therefore the photocatalysis process is a more suitable technique in the mpr system in contrast to the photolysis treatment the effect of primary treatment on the flux decline is presented in fig 10 as observed the photolysis process exhibited the worst performance and obtained the lowest final flux of 18 60 the negligible effect of the photolysis process resulted in the direct filtration of sdww by the nf process which subsequently affected the efficiency of the membrane process by plugging the particles present in sdww effluent the presence of both zno peg and uv c light exhibited the highest normalised flux by 41 33 which proved that photocatalysis is an exceptional primary treatment that effectively degrades sdww wastewater before discharging into the membrane filtration system hence the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface decreased and generated a high volume of permeate these findings also prove that uf ppa could be an excellent alternative replacement for the nf ppa membrane due to the price and potential for effectively treating sdww wastewater 3 6 membrane characterisation fig 11 a b and fig 12 a b present the fesem images of the surface and cross sectional view at 10 0 kv magnification 10 000 and 2 0 kv magnification 800 respectively for the uf ppa membrane this fesem was conducted to investigate the performance changes of the membrane the membrane surface investigation observed that the uf ppa membrane had contaminants or pollutants from the zno photocatalyst or chemical elements in sdww wastewater trapped on the membrane surface after filtration moreover the cross section in fig 11 b shows that after filtration uf ppa membrane was unchanged compared to the fresh uf ppa membrane the influence of the photocatalyst on the surface roughness was investigated through afm analysis on the uf ppa membrane as shown in fig 13 the brightest regions are represented by the highest peaks of the membrane whereas the dark areas on the membrane are the pores or lowest valley the surface roughness parameters ra and rq value are also listed in table 9 it was revealed that the ra and rq values of uf ppa membrane in the presence of zno peg photocatalyst increased from 0 014 0 001 μm to 0 017 0 001 μm and 0 036 0 007 μm to 0 045 0 009 μm respectively the increase in ra and rq values indicate high dye adsorption on the membrane surface 35 however there was only a small change recorded between the fresh uf ppa and uf ppa membranes under optimal conditions this observation confirms that the effectiveness of the primary treatment reduced the load required to degrade the sdww for the membrane filtration system which prevented membrane fouling therefore it is believed that uf ppa is a tight ultrafiltration membrane and good alternative membrane due to its valuable potential and price which could contribute to the performance of the mpr system 3 7 membrane fouling mechanism the wiesner and aptel model was applied to interpret the fouling mechanism of the uf ppa membrane at the optimum conditions ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg loading and 75 dilution of sdww fig 14 shows the fitting of experimental data based on the equations of wiesner and aptel whereas table 10 presents the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 and fitted parameter constant k to indicate the best fit model the results demonstrated that the intermediate blocking standard blocking and cake filtration mechanism could be assumed to describe the fouling phenomenon of the uf ppa membrane however the poor fitting result of the complete blocking mechanism r2 0 1 signified that it is an insignificant mechanism for uf ppa membrane application at the optimum conditions it could be deduced that various sized particles exist in the sdww wastewater which do not fully participate in the sealing of the entrance of the pore membrane 13 furthermore it was observed that both stages of the fouling mechanism were best fitted to the cake filtration model using the wiesner and aptel equations based on the high r2 values compared to other mechanisms it could be said that the first stage represents the initial stage of the cake layer formation whereas the second stage prevailed the growth in the cake layer in particular the first stage took into account the deposition rate of a pollutant from sdww wastewater and zno peg photocatalyst over the membrane surface whereas the second stage showed the progress of cake layer formation from stage 1 similar findings were previously reported by fersi et al 16 conversely the kcf in the second stage filtration was observably lower than the values obtained in the first stage this observation indicated that rapid cake formation occurred during stage 1 which caused an initially sharp decrease in permeate flux for the uf ppa process 16 this result is supported by the findings of normalised flux at the optimal conditions therefore it can be concluded that the best fitting for the experimental data of the uf ppa membrane under optimum condition corresponds to the cake layer formation model at both stages of the fouling mechanism 4 conclusions in the present study the presence of zno peg nanoparticles as a photocatalyst significantly improved the effectiveness of the mpr system which resulted in maximum photocatalytic degradation efficiency and minimum membrane fouling the optimum operational conditions of zno peg in the mpr system were determined at ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles and 75 dilution of sdww wastewater to enhance mpr process performance under the optimal conditions the colour and turbidity of sdww were removed entirely likewise the cod and electrical conductivity degradation of the permeate were lower compared to the original sdww this indicated that the quality of treated sdww wastewater successfully meets the discharge criterion of environmental quality furthermore it proved that the application of the tight ultrafiltration membrane uf ppa is an excellent alternative to nanofiltration membranes used for dye wastewater treatment due to its valuable potential and price of the membrane the fesem and afm analysis confirmed that the presence of zno peg nanoparticles in photocatalysis process is essential as a primary treatment in mpr to reduce the pollutants filtered by the uf ppa membrane both stages of the membrane fouling mechanism for the uf ppa membrane corresponded to the cake filtration model under optimum conditions this finding was attributed to the rapid decline in the first stage followed by the relatively constant flux in the second stage hence this research has presented a novel alternative and advanced method of using zno peg nanoparticles and the uf ppa membrane to solve dye wastewater treatment problems in the industry this discovery could potentially attract researchers and scientists globally due to its high potential in improving the dye degradation rate and membrane fouling

14355,in the present study the degradation of industrial textile wastewater sdww was investigated using a membrane photocatalytic reactor mpr in the presence of zinc oxide capped with polyethylene glycol zno peg nanoparticles and polypiperazine amide ppa tight ultrafiltration membrane uf ppa the optimum operating conditions of mpr were obtained under initial ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles and 75 dilution of sdww field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and atomic force microscopy afm analyses confirmed that zno peg nanoparticles and the uf ppa membrane have great potential as an alternative treatment to meet the stringent discharge limits the mechanisms of membrane fouling for the optimum operational condition were investigated using model fitting according to the wiesner and aptel equations it was revealed that cake formation occurred rapidly at both stages of the fouling mechanism hence it is believed that this integrated approach has a great potential to be implemented in the industrial textile wastewater treatment sector to ensure the environmental cleanliness for future generations keywords membrane photocatalytic reactor mpr zinc oxide polyethylene glycol textile wastewater membrane fouling mechanism 1 introduction the textile industry is one of the largest consumers of water dyes and chemicals that are used during various stages of textile processing however the large amounts of effluents generated are typically unsuitable for further use it is estimated that about 5000 tons of dyeing materials are discharged into the environment annually 1 such actions are aesthetically undesirable toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic if the discharged materials are committed without prior treatment 2 3 typically the characteristics of textile wastewater vary significantly in colour turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids and electrical conductivity since it contains a large number of chemicals 4 furthermore the dye containing effluents are undesirable because of its breakdown products such as benzidine naphthalene and other aromatic compounds 5 the government is currently introducing more stringent laws as water demands for industrial and public uses have increased the laws aim to reduce the discharge of pollutant effluents into the environment consequently dyeing factories are obligated to upgrade their existing wastewater treatment to meet the requirements for discharging effluents furthermore many dyeing companies now plan to reuse secondary effluents for environmental protection and economic reasons therefore the integrated exploration of dye wastewater treatment is important for treating raw effluents in the dyeing industry currently coagulation flocculation is a recognised process generally practised for treating industrial dye wastewater this is due to its simplicity and effectiveness in reducing pollutants in terms of turbidity colour and odour of wastewater 6 7 the traditional process for textile wastewater treatment has become an unattractive method this is due to high energy demand chemical reagents consumed and operational investment costs required for the tank and dosage units which generate sludge that needs further treatment 8 alternatively the use of a membrane photocatalytic reactor mpr could potentially achieve more sustainable operations typically the mpr ensures efficient degradation of dyes which have gained considerable attention in wastewater treatment in recent years the mpr is a hybrid system demonstrated by the coupling of photocatalysis process and membrane filtration system 9 it also shows remarkable improvement over the existing treatment and has potential impacts for the industrial dye wastewater treatment this is due to several advantages such as a keeping the photocatalyst confined in the reaction environment b realising a continuous process with simultaneous separation of catalyst and products and c controlling the molecules retention time in a reactor 10 therefore mpr can be effectively utilised to decolourise detoxify and treat industrial dye wastewater numerous reports on mpr have used various photocatalyst on conventional materials such as ceramics or polymer membranes bai et al reported the combination of carbon nanotubes with zno cnt zno nano composite ultrafiltration uf membrane this was successfully synthesised through hydrothermal synthesis which concurrently exploits the high adsorption capability and filtration flux properties of the membrane 11 however membrane fouling remains a critical issue typically attributed to the decrease in permeate flux over time according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac working party on membrane nomenclatures membrane fouling is the loss of the performance of a membrane this phenomenon is typically ascribed to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on the external surfaces pore openings or within its pores of the membrane 12 this phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the composition of the feed and the membrane which results in the decline of the permeate flux 10 13 as a consequence productivity could reduce with increasing operational and maintenance costs in principle the characteristics of the photocatalyst membrane pore size and operating variables also have significant impacts on membrane fouling during filtration in mpr systems 10 14 this phenomenon can be addressed by ensuring optimum control of the operational conditions which could increase the permeate flux efficiency and the cost effectiveness of the mpr process in 1985 hermia proposed the blocking filtration laws which were widely employed to explain the fouling phenomena in membrane processes 15 the form of blocking filtration laws can be presented as eq 1 where v is the volume of permeate at the time t and k is the coefficient depending on the flow rate and solution properties the parameter n is a constant which depends on the fouling mechanism involved in the system and the model as summarised in table 1 15 16 furthermore the laws were modified in 1996 by wiesner and aptel according to the authors the plot representing 1 j n versus time presents two stages of the blocking mechanism using two different slopes the term k1 describes the transport of cake forming materials to the membrane whereas k2 indicates the relative importance of the back transport mechanisms in removing materials from the membrane as shown in fig 1 17 the model is verified under three assumptions namely constant membrane resistance constant pressure drop and specific resistance of the cake that is constant with time the experimental observations were used independently to explain the flux decline the mechanism of membrane fouling is illustrated in fig 2 in terms of the standard blocking model intermediate blocking model cake filtration model and the complete blocking model as illustrated in fig 3 1 d 2 t d v 2 k d t d v n due to its excellent properties and affordability the polypiperazine amide ppa tight ultrafiltration membrane uf ppa is a promising approach for the decolourisation of dye wastewater aided by the potential primary treatment in the presence of zno peg nanoparticles despite the numerous publications on mpr performance studies on the performance of zno peg nanoparticles and uf ppa membrane via mpr system for the textile wastewater treatment are still lacking in the literature therefore this work aims to explore the degradation of textile wastewater through the mpr system in the presence of zno peg nanoparticles as photocatalyst and subsequent filtration using the uf ppa membrane the influence of various parameters such as initial ph loading of zno peg and dilution of sdww was also investigated in the present study 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile wastewater sample textile wastewater sdww was generated at a textile factory in johor malaysia where printing dyeing and finishing mainly occurs the sdww is dark blue in colour at room temperature the wastewater used in the experimental work was not subjected to any treatment in the industry the detailed untreated textile wastewater was characterised by ph ph 13 turbidity 56 6 2 1 ntu cod 2028 2 6 mg l and electrical conductivity 13 500 0 1 μs cm as presented in table 2 2 2 synthesis of zno zinc acetate dehydrate and oxalic acid dehydrate were all purchased from r m marketing essex united kingdom uk the zno peg nanoparticles were synthesised through the precipitation method described in zainuri et al 18 consequently 0 15 m of oxalic acid dehydrate solution was added slowly into 0 1 m of zinc acetate dehydrate solution at room temperature 25 c to form a white suspension next 0 015 g l of peg was added into the mixture after 5 min of the reaction 18 the mixture was stirred for 12 h to increase the production of zno before filtration to obtain the precipitate the precipitated sample was subsequently dried in an oven at 80 c for 1 h finally the precipitate was calcined at 550 c for 3 h in the furnace nabertherm model germany to remove any impurities in the zno peg nanoparticles after the calcination process the white zno peg powder was formed and ready for use as a photocatalyst in the mpr system it is crucial to state that the peg was absent on the zno nanoparticles after the calcination process lastly the synthesised sample was characterised using transmission electron microscopy tem as shown in fig 4 the tem micrographs revealed that no agglomeration was observed on the zno peg nanoparticles with an average size ranging from 25 nm to 40 nm 2 3 membrane and experimental set up the polypiperazine amide tight ultrafiltration uf ppa membrane ge osmonics trisep ua60 united states was selected for this study it has been considered as both as a tight uf membrane and an open or loose nanofiltration nf membrane table 3 presents the main characteristics of uf ppa membrane in this work the experiments were performed using the mpr system which consists of a membrane sample with an effective area of 20 60 cm2 the membrane sample was wetted out under 6 bars for about 30 min to prevent compaction during permeation or separation experiments a schematic representation of the mpr shown in fig 5 consists of a 2 l photocatalytic reactor and a membrane separation unit this laboratory pilot plant can be operated either in batch or continuous mode firstly 1 l of sdww wastewater under various initial ph ph 4 7 9 11 and 13 was poured into the reactor subsequently different loadings of zno peg 0 08 0 10 and 0 50 g l which acted as photocatalyst were added to determine the optimum ph and loading required for the different experiments sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl obtained from r m chemicals uk were used in this research for solution ph adjustment the mixtures were subsequently agitated with an overhead stirrer hs 30d 83 w daihan scientific korea at 300 rpm for 30 min in the dark to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the operating temperature was maintained at 25 c by the recirculating cooling water using a water chiller cw 5300a 1800 w s a industrial chiller china moreover various dilutions of sdww 0 50 and 75 dilution of sdww were also investigated during the experiment next the ultraviolet uv c lamp with a wavelength of 253 70 nm tuv 11 w philips poland was switched on and the reaction mixture in the photocatalysis process was irradiated by uv light for 20 min the degraded dye then flowed into stainless steel flat sheet membrane module dimensions 9 8 cm 9 8 cm 5 1 cm using a master flex peristaltic pump at trans membrane pressure of 6 bars in this case the permeated flux was analysed for 3 h while measuring its volume every 5 min using a measuring cylinder the effectiveness of zno peg photocatalyst was investigated through a comparative experiment between the photolysis and photocatalysis process under the best operating conditions obtained in this present study 2 4 analytical methods the colour intensity of the samples was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer labomed inc spectro uv 2650 united states at the maximum absorption wavelength λmax 333 nm the dye degradation was determined by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance peak at the maximum wavelength the turbidity and electrical conductivity of the samples were measured using a turbidity meter eutech instrument tn100 100ntu united states and portable multimeter hach hq40d united states and computed based on eq 2 on the other hand cod analysis was conducted through reagent vials method 8000 in the present study two types of cod reagent vials used were low range 0 150 mg l and high range plus 0 15000 mg l next 2 ml of the sample for the low range and 0 2 ml for the high range plus were pipetted into a cod digestion reagent vials the vial contents were stirred vigorously and subsequently placed in the cod reactor at 150 c for 2 h the samples were cooled and tested by colourimetric method using a laboratory spectrophotometer hach dr6000 united states typically the reacted sample is denoted by the appearance of a pure green colour which signals the cod can be measured or the test repeated with a diluted sample the percentage of degradation was calculated as follows 2 c 0 c i c 0 100 where ci

the membranes was calculated using the volume v of permeate per unit area a and unit time t according to the following equation 3 j 0 v a t the instantaneous permeate flux j at each run was computed at the time intervals t1 and t2 by 4 j v 2 v 1 a t 2 t 1 subsequently the flux was normalised as shown in eq 5 for membrane fouling normalised investigation under various parameters the graph was plotted as normalised flux against operating time for comparison and analysis of the declining permeate flux 5 n o r m a l i s e d f l u x s o l u t i o n f l u x j p u r e w a t e r f l u x j 0 the percentage of each membrane flux decline was specified according to the following equation 6 p e r c e n t a g e o f f l u x d e c l i n e 1 j j 0 100 2 6 membrane characterisation the surface and cross sectional morphology of the membrane samples were analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem gemini supra 55vp zeiss japan before the analysis the membrane samples were dried in a desiccator for 24 h and cut into small analytical pieces next the small pieces were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 6 7 hours for cross sectional analysis the samples were then fractured and dried at 60 c in the oven subsequently the dried samples were coated in gold to generate electrical conductivity the observation of the prepared samples was conducted using a microscope at 2 0 and 10 0 kv for membrane cross sectional and surface views respectively analysis of quantitative surface roughness of the membranes was measured using afm imaging and analysis bruker optics germany the membrane samples were dried under vacuum at 40 c for 24 h each sample was fixed on a specimen holder and 3 μm 3 μm areas were scanned by tapping mode in the air the surface roughness was reported in terms of the average roughness ra and root mean square roughness rq 2 7 membrane fouling mechanism in this study the fouling mechanism for the membranes was analysed at optimum condition using the wiesner and aptel equations the graph of y axis according to blocking filtration laws against time data was fitted using matlab r2016b under optimum operational conditions based on the graphs obtained the degree of model fitness r2 and the fitted parameter constant k were computed to determine the fouling mechanism and explain the rationality of the data collected 3 results and discussion 3 1 permeability study the performance of the uf ppa membrane was critically investigated using reverse osmosis ro water under different operating pressures 3 6 bars at 25 c as revealed in table 4 fig 6 presents the graph of ro water flux against different pressures which indicates the linear line coefficient r2 used to determine the suitability of membrane samples for the mpr system during pure permeability it was found that the r2 exceeded 0 90 for uf ppa membrane which indicates it can be applied to the mpr system hence the uf ppa membrane was selected for the textile wastewater treatment in the present study 3 2 effect of initial ph the experimental results for the flux variation with the operating time for different initial ph 4 7 9 11 and 13 of sdww for constant zno peg loading 0 10 g l and dilution 75 dilution of sdww are presented in fig 7 the descending order of the normalised flux was sequenced as ph 11 ph 9 ph 7 ph 4 ph 13 it should be noted that ph 13 was the initial ph of sdww it was found that gradual fouling occurred during the initial 1 5 h of operations which was caused by the pore blockage of the membrane this was due to the accumulation of deposited layers that adversely affected the process performance subsequently the permeate was stabilised and reached a pseudo steady state after a longer period which was attributed to the formation of the secondary layer on the membrane surface 19 the results showed that the permeated flux was responsive to the solution ph furthermore ph 11 of the feed sdww observably improved the normalised flux which obtained a higher final normalised flux at 0 400 0 413 by 60 decline this trend showed that fouling was reduced at ph 11 due to the effectiveness of the photocatalysis in the primary treatment this substantially reduced the pollutants before it was discharged to the membrane filtration system in addition the results were reasonably dependent on the isoelectric point iep of the zno nanoparticles membrane and dye molecules the uf ppa membrane has an iep of about 5 5 which can exhibit positive charges when the solution ph is lower than the iep for the case of zno iep 9 and dyes molecules iep 5 0 the positive charge will predominate when the solution ph is lower than the sample iep values on the contrary the samples are negatively charged when the solution ph is higher than the iep the decrease of flux with time was evident under the acidic solution due to the weak electrostatic repulsion forces between the molecules and membrane surface this resulted in even weaker performance of the membrane fouling in the acidic solution 4 20 in other instances the extreme ph could adversely affect the membrane since the ph tolerance of uf ppa membrane ranges from ph 2 to 11 based on the information provided by the manufacturer it also indicated that ph 11 is the optimum initial ph for sdww degradation based on the mpr performance which is mainly caused by the strong electrostatic repulsion hence much lower accumulation and deposition of dye molecules and zno photocatalyst were found on the membrane surface 3 2 1 quality of treated sdww the quality of treated wastewater was investigated to assess the optimum initial ph of sdww in the hybrid system as shown in table 5 the resulting information is essential to ensure better performance and provide adequate information on the operating conditions for the textile industry moreover it was observed that the quality of the permeated flux fulfilled all the standard discharge limits stipulated by the department of environment doe and the environment quality act eqa 1974 of malaysia furthermore it was revealed that ph 11 exhibited the highest percentage of degradation compared to other ph values these findings were related to the iep of dyes molecules zno photocatalyst and uf ppa membrane respectively 13 since the iep values at ph 4 7 and 9 are marginally different the zno and dye on the membrane surface easily accumulated to form a cake layer it was also observed that zno nanoparticles at ph below 4 could undergo photo corrosion through self oxidation due to the decomposition of zno to zn2 21 similarly the formation of a high concentration of hydroxyl ions that react with holes to form hydroxyl radicals increased when the initial ph was above the iep of zno which subsequently causes a higher degradation efficiency a similar result was obtained for the photocatalysis process by kazeminezhad and sadollahkhani 22 however the extreme ph might affect the stability of zno due to the possibility of alkaline dissolution of zno 23 therefore ph 13 of the initial feed exhibited the worst performance in dye degradation percentage compared to the ph of the others regarding the turbidity removal all the tested ph were reduced by about 80 during the photocatalysis process except at ph 13 the sudden decrease in the turbidity removal at ph 13 can be explained by the salt formation which resulted in the aggregation of dye in the form of cloudy suspension 24 this effectively reduced the formation of hydroxyl radicals due to the enhancement of light scattering and reduction of photon absorption conversely it was observed that the turbidity values at ph 9 and 11 were completely reduced after the uf ppa process this finding revealed that primary treatment is required for highly turbidity effluents to ensure the membrane operates effectively it was found that ph 11 was the most effective ph for removing cod and electrical conductivity which were obtained at 53 30 1 18 mg l and 92 38 0 06 respectively the previous study also reported that uf membranes 1 kda and 10 kda achieved more than 80 cod removal for the reactive dye solution 25 this finding confirms that the efficiency of the uf process in ensuring the quality required from treated dye wastewater the results obtained indicated only minor differences among the other ph values it could be said that the initial ph was unresponsive to the cod retention rates and electrical conductivity removal overall these results confirmed that ph 11 of feed sdww was the optimum ph in improving the mpr performance 3 3 effect of zno peg loading the relationship between flux declination and zno peg loading at ph 11 and 75 dilution of sdww during the degradation of textile wastewater is reported in fig 8 as shown the normalised flux rate increased with increasing loading of zno peg nanoparticles up to 0 10 g l the final normalised flux for 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles was 0 4133 after 2 h and 50 min this was due to the higher photocatalyst loading which increased the active sites on the photocatalyst surface and consequently favoured the number of hydroxyl radicals furthermore the hydroxyl radicals were strong enough to break the bonds of dye molecules resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide co2 and inorganic ions 26 hence this proved that the normalised flux increased considerably with the increasing rate of photocatalytic degradation when the zno peg loading exceeded 0 10 g l the final normalised flux drastically decreased by 25 67 of the initial flux which signifies the worst possibility of the membrane fouling phenomenon it could be claimed that exceeding this limit of zno peg loading has negative effects on the performance of mpr the previous study reported that the overloaded photocatalyst decreased the permeate due to pore blockage caused by agglomeration 27 moreover an overloaded zno peg photocatalyst could decrease the photocatalytic efficiency due to agglomeration and thus the pore size and porosity of membrane may also reduce 28 zheng and co workers claimed that the optimum photocatalyst loading changes with the mpr system according to the type of photocatalyst light sources contaminants and configurations applied 29 therefore it could be concluded that the optimum photocatalyst loading in the present study was 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles 3 3 1 quality of treated sdww table 6 shows the quality of treated sdww under various loadings after the photocatalysis and membrane filtration process in the mpr in the photocatalysis process the presence of 0 10 g l zno peg nanoparticles exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than 0 08 and 0 30 g l zno peg nanoparticles as observed the degradation efficiency increased significantly by increasing the zno peg loading from 0 08 g l to 0 10 g l but suddenly decreased with further increased loading up to 0 30 g l of zno peg nanoparticles similar findings have been reported on the degradation of industrial dyes used for printing newspapers 13 the results indicated that higher loadings of zno peg nanoparticles increased the surface area of the zno photocatalyst that was available for adsorption and degradation 30 31 the number of active sites also increased resulting in the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation rate conversely there was a decrease in the uv light utilisation rate when the zno peg nanoparticles exceeded the value limit this result was due to an increase in turbidity of the solution and scattering effect which reduced the photocatalytic activity of the zno peg nanoparticles therefore the maximum photocatalytic degradation of sdww wastewater was achieved at 0 10 g l moreover the decolourisation efficiency of the sdww after the uf ppa process was somewhat influenced the photocatalysis process when the zno peg loading was equal to 0 10 g l complete degradation occurred thereby ensuring removal of the sdww colour in contrast to the 0 08 and 0 30 g l overall the decolourisation effect of sdww in the overloaded zno peg nanoparticles was worse than in 0 08 g l and 0 10 g l of the zno peg nanoparticles this could be explained by the difficulty in maintaining the homogenous suspension due to the agglomeration of the photocatalyst therefore this might form a cake layer on the membrane surface consequently a thick layer on the membrane surface might prevent effective filtration of effluents from the photocatalytic reactor therefore 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles was deduced as the optimum photocatalyst loading due to the excellent degradation efficiency of sdww as shown in table 6 the percentage of degradation of sdww was comparable to the turbidity reduction of the photocatalysis and uf ppa processes for the photocatalysis process it could be seen that 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles was less turbid 80 92 0 20 compared to the 0 08 g l and 0 30 g l of zno peg nanoparticles conversely full reduction of turbidity was observed for the 0 08 g l and 0 10 g l zno peg nanoparticles after the uf ppa process this observation could be explained by the excess photocatalyst loading which increased the turbidity of the wastewater therefore this phenomenon inhibited the penetration of light into the solution and the degradation of the pollutants for cod measurement it was found that the removal of cod percentage increased from 96 93 0 03 to 97 37 0 06 with an increase in photocatalyst loading from 0 08 to 0 10 g of zno peg nanoparticles in 1 0 l of sdww in a set of runs however the further increment of the zno peg loading up to 0 10 g l did not increase the percentage reduction of cod due to the occurrence of light interception by the suspension 32 in case of electrical conductivity reduction the pattern of experimental results obtained was similar to the case of cod measurement which was arranged by the following sequence 0 30 g l 0 08 g l 0 10 g l it was found that the permeate quality of sdww was in excellent condition based on the standard of environmental quality industrial effluent regulations 2009 schedule 7 therefore the optimum zno peg loading required to exhibit the maximum degradation of sdww was 0 10 g l 3 4 effect of sdww dilution fig 9 illustrates the decline in the normalised flux data for different dilutions of sdww percentage at a fixed zno peg loading 0 10 g l ph 11 and 75 dilution of sdww over time the initial permeation rate of different dilution factors of sdww was almost identical and afterwards the effect of the transverse hydrodynamic force permeation drag on the fouling of membranes was comparable it can also be observed in fig 9 that the 75 and 0 diluted sdww exhibited the highest flux 0 4133 and the lowest flux 0 1700 respectively the lower dilution factor of sdww was attributed to a higher concentration of sdww as the feed concentration increased the membrane surface concentration also increased as a result of increasing osmotic pressure meanwhile the net driving force of flux through the membrane decreased due to the formation of a thicker layer on the membrane surface hence the observed flux decreased at a lower dilution factor of the sdww wastewater conversely the higher concentration of sdww wastewater resulted in the accumulation of dyes on the membrane surface and incremental resistance of the dye 33 also this resulted in a higher pollutant concentration that was retained on the membrane surface which indicated the reduction of the permeate volume similar effects were previously observed by satyanarayana et al 19 hassani et al 34 and yu et al 35 therefore the dilution of dye wastewater is an important parameter that could be practised in industrial wastewater treatment sector to maintain the stability of the membrane 3 4 1 quality of treated sdww the permeate degradation of sdww wastewater for different dilutions was carried out using zno peg nanoparticles at ph 11 table 7 illustrates the result of permeate degradation percentage of the respective wastewater samples under optimised conditions the results indicated that the degradation of sdww wastewater occurred at an excellent rate with 75 dilution of sdww in contrast to other different percentages of dilution in the case of the photocatalysis process 72 42 0 01 decolourisation efficiency was observed for 25 of sdww whereas for 50 and 100 of sdww at similar conditions only 62 50 0 02 and 54 72 0 03 decolourisation efficiency were recorded respectively this showed that the higher dilution of sdww obtained led to the higher the photodegradation efficiency similar findings using zno photocatalyst were reported by wang et al 36 akyol et al 37 and chakrabarti dutta 32 this was due to the competency between the dyes and the hydroxide ion ohˉ adsorption on the surface of the photocatalyst it can also be described that the increase in sdww concentration was attributed to the adsorption of dyes that suppressed the ohˉ ion adsorption as a result the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh declined since the active sites were covered by dye ions 37 consequently the number of free radicals generated on the surface of zno photocatalyst was insufficient to attack and degrade dyes molecules 24 hence it could be deduced that the lower concentration of the initial sdww leads to an increase in hydroxyl radicals that can attack the pollutants resulting in a higher decolourisation efficiency in the photocatalysis process the higher decolourisation efficiency of the photocatalysis process resulted in the excellent degradation of sdww after uf ppa process as observed in table 7 the colour of the 75 diluted sdww was fully degraded after uf ppa membrane whereas 50 and 0 dilution of sdww was achieved at 96 31 0 04 and 94 25 respectively likewise the results confirmed that the photocatalysis process had a significant effect on the performance of the permeate after the uf ppa process therefore the maximum rate of degradation was achieved at 75 dilution of sdww in promoting full colour degradation efficiency for turbidity reduction it could be seen that 0 dilution of sdww in photocatalysis process showed the worst performance which was 40 34 3 28 in contrast to the 75 and 50 dilution of sdww hence the increment of the initial dye concentration that led to lower uv light penetration through the sdww is due to the cloudy suspension and can be explained by the theory of beer lambert s law 24 consequently the photon absorption on the zno photocatalyst along with the turbidity efficiency is reduced during the photocatalytic activity however the increase in sdww concentration decreased the efficiency of turbidity degradation after the uf ppa process however there were not many differences regarding the turbidity reduction of the permeate due to the application of the tight ultrafiltration membrane termed uf ppa the uf ppa membrane had a significant effect on the removal of cod and electrical conductivity as shown in table 7 as observed all the retentions were more noticeable for 75 dilution of sdww than for 50 and 0 dilution of sdww the results are expected since the small particles molecules and ion can easily pass through the tight uf ppa membrane therefore an excellent permeate was achieved at 75 dilution of sdww due to the natural concentration of organic constituent present however the lower concentration of sdww wastewater revealed the lower concentration of organic constituents in the sdww which could be effectively retained in the hybrid mpr system 3 5 effect of photolysis photocatalysis process in the mpr system table 8 illustrates the photocatalytic degradation and permeate of the treated sdww under two different experimental conditions uv c alone photolysis and uv c zno peg photocatalysis using nf ppa membrane at ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg and 75 dilution of sdww it was found that in the presence of both zno peg nanoparticles and uv c light in the photocatalysis process 72 00 0 03 of dye was degraded after 3 h this is in contrast with 0 degradation for the same experiment performed by uv c light the findings demonstrated that both zno peg photocatalyst and uv c light are required for the effective degradation of sdww in the primary treatment of mpr the uv c light was used for the activation of zno peg nanoparticles by the photo excitation process of the zno followed by the formation of an electron hole pair on the surface of the photocatalyst 9 38 the formation of hydroxyl radicals enhanced the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation furthermore the permeate of the nf process that was subjected to photocatalysis exhibited complete dye rejection this was due to the effectiveness of the photocatalysis process which significantly contributed to the excellent degradation rate after nf process therefore the nf process in the mpr system is considered a polishing step to eliminate the residual colouring compounds 39 therefore the photocatalysis process is a more suitable technique in the mpr system in contrast to the photolysis treatment the effect of primary treatment on the flux decline is presented in fig 10 as observed the photolysis process exhibited the worst performance and obtained the lowest final flux of 18 60 the negligible effect of the photolysis process resulted in the direct filtration of sdww by the nf process which subsequently affected the efficiency of the membrane process by plugging the particles present in sdww effluent the presence of both zno peg and uv c light exhibited the highest normalised flux by 41 33 which proved that photocatalysis is an exceptional primary treatment that effectively degrades sdww wastewater before discharging into the membrane filtration system hence the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface decreased and generated a high volume of permeate these findings also prove that uf ppa could be an excellent alternative replacement for the nf ppa membrane due to the price and potential for effectively treating sdww wastewater 3 6 membrane characterisation fig 11 a b and fig 12 a b present the fesem images of the surface and cross sectional view at 10 0 kv magnification 10 000 and 2 0 kv magnification 800 respectively for the uf ppa membrane this fesem was conducted to investigate the performance changes of the membrane the membrane surface investigation observed that the uf ppa membrane had contaminants or pollutants from the zno photocatalyst or chemical elements in sdww wastewater trapped on the membrane surface after filtration moreover the cross section in fig 11 b shows that after filtration uf ppa membrane was unchanged compared to the fresh uf ppa membrane the influence of the photocatalyst on the surface roughness was investigated through afm analysis on the uf ppa membrane as shown in fig 13 the brightest regions are represented by the highest peaks of the membrane whereas the dark areas on the membrane are the pores or lowest valley the surface roughness parameters ra and rq value are also listed in table 9 it was revealed that the ra and rq values of uf ppa membrane in the presence of zno peg photocatalyst increased from 0 014 0 001 μm to 0 017 0 001 μm and 0 036 0 007 μm to 0 045 0 009 μm respectively the increase in ra and rq values indicate high dye adsorption on the membrane surface 35 however there was only a small change recorded between the fresh uf ppa and uf ppa membranes under optimal conditions this observation confirms that the effectiveness of the primary treatment reduced the load required to degrade the sdww for the membrane filtration system which prevented membrane fouling therefore it is believed that uf ppa is a tight ultrafiltration membrane and good alternative membrane due to its valuable potential and price which could contribute to the performance of the mpr system 3 7 membrane fouling mechanism the wiesner and aptel model was applied to interpret the fouling mechanism of the uf ppa membrane at the optimum conditions ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg loading and 75 dilution of sdww fig 14 shows the fitting of experimental data based on the equations of wiesner and aptel whereas table 10 presents the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 and fitted parameter constant k to indicate the best fit model the results demonstrated that the intermediate blocking standard blocking and cake filtration mechanism could be assumed to describe the fouling phenomenon of the uf ppa membrane however the poor fitting result of the complete blocking mechanism r2 0 1 signified that it is an insignificant mechanism for uf ppa membrane application at the optimum conditions it could be deduced that various sized particles exist in the sdww wastewater which do not fully participate in the sealing of the entrance of the pore membrane 13 furthermore it was observed that both stages of the fouling mechanism were best fitted to the cake filtration model using the wiesner and aptel equations based on the high r2 values compared to other mechanisms it could be said that the first stage represents the initial stage of the cake layer formation whereas the second stage prevailed the growth in the cake layer in particular the first stage took into account the deposition rate of a pollutant from sdww wastewater and zno peg photocatalyst over the membrane surface whereas the second stage showed the progress of cake layer formation from stage 1 similar findings were previously reported by fersi et al 16 conversely the kcf in the second stage filtration was observably lower than the values obtained in the first stage this observation indicated that rapid cake formation occurred during stage 1 which caused an initially sharp decrease in permeate flux for the uf ppa process 16 this result is supported by the findings of normalised flux at the optimal conditions therefore it can be concluded that the best fitting for the experimental data of the uf ppa membrane under optimum condition corresponds to the cake layer formation model at both stages of the fouling mechanism 4 conclusions in the present study the presence of zno peg nanoparticles as a photocatalyst significantly improved the effectiveness of the mpr system which resulted in maximum photocatalytic degradation efficiency and minimum membrane fouling the optimum operational conditions of zno peg in the mpr system were determined at ph 11 0 10 g l of zno peg nanoparticles and 75 dilution of sdww wastewater to enhance mpr process performance under the optimal conditions the colour and turbidity of sdww were removed entirely likewise the cod and electrical conductivity degradation of the permeate were lower compared to the original sdww this indicated that the quality of treated sdww wastewater successfully meets the discharge criterion of environmental quality furthermore it proved that the application of the tight ultrafiltration membrane uf ppa is an excellent alternative to nanofiltration membranes used for dye wastewater treatment due to its valuable potential and price of the membrane the fesem and afm analysis confirmed that the presence of zno peg nanoparticles in photocatalysis process is essential as a primary treatment in mpr to reduce the pollutants filtered by the uf ppa membrane both stages of the membrane fouling mechanism for the uf ppa membrane corresponded to the cake filtration model under optimum conditions this finding was attributed to the rapid decline in the first stage followed by the relatively constant flux in the second stage hence this research has presented a novel alternative and advanced method of using zno peg nanoparticles and the uf ppa membrane to solve dye wastewater treatment problems in the industry this discovery could potentially attract researchers and scientists globally due to its high potential in improving the dye degradation rate and membrane fouling

the sol gel route through a series of laboratory experiments with contaminated solutions of clofibric gallic and salicylic acids adsorption isotherms and kinetics are obtained to compare the performance of these elaborated materials the pharmaceutical compounds have been selected as representative contaminants of this type of molecules 2 experimental procedure 2 1 chemicals and reagents the activated carbon used as adsorbent is supplied by cabot corporation target compounds that is clofibric acid ca 2 4 chlorophenoxy 2 methylpropionic acid c10h11clo3 214 65 g mol pka 2 8 gallic acid

received without any further purification all the chemicals were analytical grade titatium isopropoxide ttip isopropanol and nitric acid were obtained from sigma aldrich all the solutions used in adsorption experiments were prepared with bidistilled water 2 2 preparation of the adsorbents the ac tio2 composites were made by coating the virgin activated carbon with tio2 via the sol gel technique at varying loadings ranging between 1 and 10 wt more precisely 1 5 and 10 wt ac tio2 adsorbents were prepared from the ttip solution a volume of 46 45 ml of isopropanol solution is introduced with vigorous stirring into a flask containing 3 55 ml of ttip 99 purity the thick liquid obtained after 30 min of stirring has a whitish color which clears up after about 1 h then 2 ml of nitric acid 1 m was added and ultrasound for 30 min after obtaining the gel 9 g of activated carbon was introduced to form homogeneous and stable mixture of black color solution by magnetic stirrer for 1 h the final mixture solution was dried using an oven at about 353 k and then calcined at 673 k for 4 h 2 3 characterization techniques to characterize the surface charge of the ac and ac tio2 the point of zero charge pzc of the ac and ac tio2 composites was determined using a titration method 64 the procedure consists in placing 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution in reactors and adjusting the ph variation of values between 2 and 12 by addition of 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution in each reactor we add 0 15 g of adsorbent the suspensions should be kept in constant agitation at room temperature for 48 h the contents of these reactors are then filtered through 0 45 μm pore diameter filter media the final ph of each mixture is then measured the phpzc is determined by the point of intersection of the phfinal phinitial curve and the phfinal vs phinitial curve experimental results of the ph determination are illustrated in table 1 showing no substantial modification of the activated carbon surface after the impregnation with titanium oxide the nitrogen praxair 99 999 adsorption analysis at 77 k were performed on a micromeritics asap 2010 volumetric adsorption analyzer about 0 1 g of

considerations 3 1 kinetic modeling kinetic models have been used to investigate the mechanism of sorption and potential rate controlling steps which is helpful for selecting optimum operating conditions for the full scale batch process the results obtained from the experiments at 298 k were examined to describe the reaction kinetics two kinetic models have been tested pseudo first order and pseudo second order the pseudo first order equation is generally expressed as 65 1 d q d t k 1 q e q where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 1 min qt and qe are the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively mg g the pseudo second order model is generally used to describe the adsorption phenomenon of chemisorption type and it is expressed according to the following equation 66 2 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order adsorption g mg min qt is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t mg g and qe is its value at equilibrium mg g 3 2 overview of equilibrium isotherm modeling in order to evaluate the organic compounds adsorption capacity of ac tio2 composites the equilibrium adsorption of ca ga and sa was studied as a function of the contaminant concentration then the adsorption isotherm models are usually used to indicate the interaction between the absorbent and the adsorbate when the adsorption process reaches the equilibrium necessary requirements for the design or modeling of adsorption systems to optimize an adsorbent adsorbate system for the removal of organic or mineral pollutants it is very important to establish the most appropriate correlations to represent the experimental equilibrium data there are several models for predicting the equilibrium distribution experimental results have been analyzed using two parameter isotherm models including freundlich temkin and three parameter adsorption isotherm models including for example sips and tôth isotherm models the theoretical background of adsorption models of langmuir freundlich temkin sips and tôth are described by many authors 65 67 these isotherm models describe well the adsorption behavior under sub critical conditions of several sorbent sorbate systems their mathematical expressions are illustrated in table 2 langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption and refers to homogeneous adsorption which each molecule possess constant enthalpies and sorption activation energy while the assumption of the freundlich isotherm model can be applied to multilayer adsorption with non uniform distribution of adsorption heat and affinities over the heterogeneous surface temkin expression takes account the presence of the interactions between the adsorbates so that the heat of adsorption in the surface decreases linearly with the surface covering due to the decreased adsorbent adsorbate interactions sips is of an empirical equation integrate into three parameter isotherm that combined form of langmuir and freundlich expressions and can be applied on either homogeneous or heterogeneous adsorbent surface tôth is a three parameter isotherm compose of both langmuir and freundlich isotherms this model describes well the heterogeneous adsorption systems under both of low and high end boundary of adsorbate concentration the necessary data are derived from experiments where a mass of adsorbent is equilibrated with a known volume at a specific concentration of a chemical and the resultant equilibrium concentration is measured in solution by the mass balance equation 3 q e c 0 c e v m where co is the initial and ce is the equilibrium concentration mg dm3 while v is the volume of the solution dm3 and m is the weight of adsorbent g 4 results and discussion the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent towards the removal of pollutants is directly related with its physicochemical surface properties therefore to a deeper understanding of the adsorption process it becomes basic to determine the physicochemical features of the materials 4 1 textural morphological and thermal properties of the adsorbents n2 adsorption the n2 adsorption isotherms for the activated carbons considered herein were of type ii in the bddt classification and the hysteresis loop was of type iiib in the rouquerol et al classification the bet specific surface areas were found to be 580 m2 g and the total pore volumes obtained at a relative pressure of 0 98 was 0 570 cm3 g these results indicate that the presence of tio2 in the materials no modify the specific surface area and the pore volume of the activated carbon ftir analysis the ftir technique is an important tool to identify functional groups present on the surface of materials the ftir spectra of original activated carbon and that modified by tio2 are summarized in fig 1 the ftir spectra of ac show the peaks at around 1706 cm 1 and 1576 cm 1 that can be assigned to co bonds of the carboxyl acid groups and the stretching vibrations of conjugated cc bonds of aromatic rings 77 the peak at around 1460 cm 1 corresponds to an oh bending modes of alcoholic phenolic and carboxylic groups or ch bending vibrations bands in the region of 1400 1380 cm 1 are attributed to the cc or to carboxyl carbonate structures or coh and the band at 1250 cm 1 is assigned to co stretching it has been reported 78 that the band 1040 cm 1 is assigned to alcoholic co stretching vibration while the band at 870 cm 1 represents the contribution from ch bond vibration in aromatic compounds 79 as expected the ftir spectrum of each actio2 samples presents a broad band at 780 cm 1 which is characteristic of the vibration tioti and the adsorption bands at about 470 cm 1 is related to the stretching vibrations of the ti o bonds in addition a new adsorption band was found at about 1080 cm 1 in ac tio2 samples which may be ascribed to tioc bonds in according to the literature 80 it means that tio2 particles attached chemically to the ac surfaces and then these particles cannot easily separate to complete this characterization analysis sem and eds were used to evaluate the morphology of the surface and the elemental composition of selected area the sem images of ac and ac tio2 samples are presented in fig 2 this figure shows that the ac fig 2a morphology suggest a smooth surface with regular pores in its structure compared to ac the surface of ac tio2 appears coarse and irregular fig 2b c and d indeed when tio2 is grafted on ac by the sol gel method particles tio2 are uniformly distributed on the surface of ac fig 2b and are introduced in the internal pores consequently the regular pore structure was destroyed and the porosity was increased in the final elaborated solid it is clearly seen that ac 5 tio2 and ac 10 tio2 samples presents the agglomeration of tio2 particles on the carbonaceous surface fig 2c and d compared to ac ac tio2 exhibits many transparent spots further suggesting that the surface area increased moreover the modified ac appeared to have mixtures of micropores and mesopores fig 2d in the literature 81 similar superficial structures were observed in zno tio2 bamboo charcoal further the white area is assigned to ti while the grey and black areas refer to carbon this is confirmed by the elemental analysis of ac tio2 for example the fig 3 shows eds spectrum of the composite ac 1 tio2 which indicates the presence of elements ti o and c on the surface of material for white area of the composite mainly measured with very limited amounts of al si o and s similarly for other white area of the composite ac 1 tio2 the eds data reveal that in the white part still peaks of carbon and peaks of ti could also be seen reflecting that ti and carbon can be simply differentiated by visible color in sem images the mixing of ti and c resulted in a rather irregular covering some area were heavily covered with ti while others contained only a minor amount of ti results are also very similar for the other two composites ac 5 tio2 and ac 10 tio2 tga technique was also used to measure the weight loss as a function of temperature and to have information regarding samples composition and their thermal stability the tga curve of the activated carbon can be divided in three stages when heated at constant rate as shown in fig 4 the first mass loss up to 2 4 wt of initial the activated carbon occurs at low temperature to 298 t 358 k which was caused by extractive compounds evaporation and desorption of physically adsorbed water on the material and moisture loss 82 the second stage is from 358 to 748 k an a very less weight loss was observed of around 1 79 wt then the third stage is from 748 to 1048 k which the mass loss is the greatest and reached 8 36 wt this last proportion of mass loss at such high temperature can be assigned to the decomposition of various functional groups present in the activated carbon such as ethers phenols esters and quinones etc 83 the temperature range for the first mass loss for ac 1 tio2 and ac 5 tio2 extended up to 548 k and the second up to 1043 k the second mass loss of ac 1 tio2 and ac 5 tio2 at central temperature range 358 748 k a gentle mass loss were observed of about 1 88 and 1 94 wt respectively due to the loss of the remaining water molecules bound to the surface and to the dehydroxylation the ti species 84 the overall mass loss up to 1048 k was 8 86 and 9 wt for ac 1 tio2 and ac 5 tio2 respectively thus the incorporation of tio2 did not produce other appreciable thermal effects this corresponds to the burning of residual organic material and chemically adsorbed water for ac 10 tio2 in the central temperature range 348 363 k approximately 2 94 wt corresponds to the burning of residual organic material and chemically adsorbed water 85 the overall mass loss up to 1043 k was 11 wt 4 2 adsorption experiments to quantify the consequences of coating the surface of the activated carbon with tio2 and to investigate its effect on the porosity of these compounds the adsorption capacity of clofibric gallic and salicylic acids on virgin activated carbon and ac tio2 was first established thus kinetics experiments must be investigated in order to determine the time necessary for the adsorption systems to reach equilibrium and to elucidate the mechanism of the adsorption process the preliminary optimization of the experimental parameters allows carrying out tests of adsorption only with one initial concentration for each acid i e 15 mg dm3 the ph value was 3 in all experiments and 25 mg of adsorbents the solution ph has been selected considering the phpzc determined for the materials see table 1 from these results the net charge on the absorbent surface will be positive and will favor the interaction with the acid molecules see fig 5 all the bottles were laid on the shaker with stirring at 180 rpm after a predetermined time in the orbital shaker at room temperature the suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm durapore membrane filters the concentration of the molecule remaining in aqueous solution was measured using a jasco v 730 uv vis spectrometer at the maximum absorption wavelength which was determined experimentally for each molecule 4 3 kinetic models the evolution of the capacity of adsorption of each compound with time at room temperature was presented in fig 6 the maxima adsorption values found were 3 7 mg g for ca 5 3 mg g for ga and 5 7 mg g for sa in all cases on ac 10 tio2 see also table 3 the last experimental data were fitted to study the potential rate controlling steps of adsorption using the pseudo first order the pseudo second order and the intra particle diffusion kinetic models 85 93 the fits of pseudo first and second order models were checked by each non linear plot of qt versus t constant values for the two adsorption kinetic models were calculated and are given in table 4 the coefficient of determination denoted as r2 and chi squared denoted as χ2 were employed to decide which the best model according to the calculated χ2 the pseudo first order model provides the best correlation for the adsorption kinetics of emerging pollutants thus it is appropriated to use the pseudo first order model to predict the adsorption kinetics for all compounds in the study of kinetic of adsorption of sa onto the various solids the value of k1 for activated carbon ac 1 tio2 ac 5 tio2 and ac 10 tio2 were obtained as 0 014 0 020 0 119 0 990 min 1 respectively these results showed that adsorption kinetics on ac 10 tio2 was much faster than on activated carbon due to the microporous network thus the results prove similar adsorption behavior for ca ga and sa on the activated carbon and ac tio2 composites the intra particle diffusion model is showed in fig 7 the intra particule diffusion of organic molecules within studied adsorbents occurs in two stages which indicates that the adsorption mechanism in this case is controlled by two steps the first linear part which corresponds to the adsorption period from 0 to 10 min represents the external mass transfer and the rapid distribution of these molecules on the outer surface of the material in contrast the second linear part includes the adsorption period from 20 to 90 min and represents the intra particule diffusion and the interaction between the molecules and the internal active sites of the present adsorbents the slope of the linear portion table 5 indicates the rate of the adsorption process which decreases with contact time various interaction types to explain the adsorption of organic contaminants on adsorbents have been reported hydrophobic interactions π π stacking interactions van der waals forces electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions taking into account the ph of the solution ph 3 the phpzc of the adsorbents see table 1 between 4 25 and 4 67 and the pka of the pollutants the effect of van der waals and π π interactions can explain the removal of this type of adsorbates see fig 5 4 4 adsorption isotherms otherwise the adsorption equilibrium data were fitted to the freundlich temkin sips and tôth isotherm models the parameters of these models were estimated by non linear regression and the values of the correlation coefficient r2 and χ2 are again calculated and included in table 6 each model constants can be used for predicting the adsorption capacities and also for incorporating into mass transfer relationship to predict the design of contacting experiments for comparison results obtained from the literature on acids adsorption by several adsorbents are summarized in table 3 in this study n values are greater than unity smaller value of 1 n indicating a strong interaction between adsorbates sa ca and ga and adsorbent activated carbon and ac tio2 composites among five isotherm models namely freundlich langmuir temkin sips and tôth used for fitting of the experimental adsorption data of an emerging compounds ca ga and sa on activated carbon and ac tio2 the sips model gave the lowest error and the highest r2 values the product of the sips parameters qs ms which is related to the interaction of the acids with the surface is higher for the modified activated carbon ac tio2 than for the virgin carbon as seen earlier the best fitting results were obtained with the sips isotherm model therefore this isotherm is the one selected to be presented with the experimental data in fig 8 5 conclusions in the present study the removal of three kind of emerging molecules clofibric gallic and salicylic acids from synthetic solutions was investigated by using activated carbon and ac tio2 composites this work shows that modified activated carbon with tio2 could be considered as potential adsorbents for removal of organic compounds from aqueous solutions the adsorption capacity of modified activated carbon for ca ga and sa is higher than that for ac the kinetic study revealed that stirring for 20 min is sufficient for the emerging compound modified activated carbon system to reach equilibrium the adsorption of these compounds onto modified ac obeyed pseudo first order kinetics the sips model is found to well represent the experimental data of adsorption of ca ga and sa by ac and various ac tio2 activated carbon is known for its effectiveness in removing organic molecules from water and wastewater acknowledgement ag thanks santander bank for funding through the research intensification program

for 1 h the final mixture solution was dried using an oven at about 353 k and then calcined at 673 k for 4 h 2 3 characterization techniques to characterize the surface charge of the ac and ac tio2 the point of zero charge pzc of the ac and ac tio2 composites was determined using a titration method 64 the procedure consists in placing 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution in reactors and adjusting the ph variation of values between 2 and 12 by addition of 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution in each reactor we add 0 15 g of adsorbent the suspensions should be kept in constant agitation at room temperature for 48 h the contents of these reactors are then filtered through 0 45 μm pore diameter filter media the final ph of each mixture is then measured the phpzc is determined by the point of intersection of the phfinal phinitial curve and the phfinal vs phinitial curve experimental results of the ph determination are illustrated in table 1 showing no substantial modification of the activated carbon surface after the impregnation with titanium oxide the nitrogen praxair 99 999 adsorption analysis at 77 k were performed on a micromeritics asap 2010 volumetric adsorption analyzer about 0 1 g of activated carbons was used after outgassing at 473 k for 16 h to remove any adsorbed molecules thermogravimetric analyses of the materials were performed using a heating rate of 10 k min and sweeping from room temperature to 1073 k under a nitrogen atmosphere the nitrogen flow is 90 ml min and the mass used for each of the samples varies between 10 and 30 mg powder x ray diffraction patterns of the materials were obtained using a xpert pro diffractometer panalytical scanning electron microscopy sem analysis of the materials was performed using a fei feg 450 microscope 3 theoretical considerations 3 1 kinetic modeling kinetic models have been used to investigate the mechanism of sorption and potential rate controlling steps which is helpful for selecting optimum operating conditions for the full scale batch process the results obtained from the experiments at 298 k were examined to describe the reaction kinetics two kinetic models have been tested pseudo first order and pseudo second order the pseudo first order equation is generally expressed as 65 1 d q d t k 1 q e q where k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 1 min qt and qe are the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively mg g the pseudo second order model is generally used to describe the adsorption phenomenon of chemisorption type and it is expressed according to the following equation 66 2 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order adsorption g mg min qt is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed at time t mg g and qe is its value at equilibrium mg g 3 2 overview of equilibrium isotherm modeling in order to evaluate the organic compounds adsorption capacity of ac tio2 composites the equilibrium adsorption of ca ga and sa was studied as a function of the contaminant concentration then the adsorption isotherm models are usually used to indicate the interaction between the absorbent and the adsorbate when the adsorption process reaches the equilibrium necessary requirements for the design or modeling of adsorption systems to optimize an adsorbent adsorbate system for the removal of organic or mineral pollutants it is very important to establish the most appropriate correlations to represent the experimental equilibrium data there are several models for predicting the equilibrium distribution experimental results have been analyzed using two parameter isotherm models including freundlich temkin and three parameter adsorption isotherm models including for example sips and tôth isotherm models the theoretical background of adsorption models of langmuir freundlich temkin sips and tôth are described by many authors 65 67 these isotherm models describe well the adsorption behavior under sub critical conditions of several sorbent sorbate systems their mathematical expressions are illustrated in table 2 langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption and refers to homogeneous adsorption which each molecule possess constant enthalpies and sorption activation energy while the assumption of the freundlich isotherm model can be applied to multilayer adsorption with non uniform distribution of adsorption heat and affinities over the heterogeneous surface temkin expression takes account the presence of the interactions between the adsorbates so that the heat of adsorption in the surface decreases linearly with the surface covering due to the decreased adsorbent adsorbate interactions sips is of an empirical equation integrate into three parameter isotherm that combined form of langmuir and freundlich expressions and can be applied on either homogeneous or heterogeneous adsorbent surface tôth is a three parameter isotherm compose of both langmuir and freundlich isotherms this model describes well the heterogeneous adsorption systems under both of low and high end boundary of adsorbate concentration the necessary data are derived from experiments where a mass of adsorbent is equilibrated with a known volume at a specific concentration of a chemical and the resultant equilibrium concentration is measured in solution by the mass balance equation 3 q e c 0 c e v m where co is the initial and ce is the equilibrium concentration mg dm3 while v is the volume of the solution dm3 and m is the weight of adsorbent g 4 results and discussion the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent towards the removal of pollutants is directly related with its physicochemical surface properties therefore to a deeper understanding of the adsorption process it becomes basic to determine the physicochemical features of the materials 4 1 textural morphological and thermal properties of the adsorbents n2 adsorption the n2 adsorption isotherms for the activated carbons considered herein were of type ii in the bddt classification and the hysteresis loop was of type iiib in the rouquerol et al classification the bet specific surface areas were found to be 580 m2 g and the total pore volumes obtained at a relative pressure of 0 98 was 0 570 cm3 g these results indicate that the presence of tio2 in the materials no modify the specific surface area and the pore volume of the activated carbon ftir analysis the ftir technique is an important tool to identify functional groups present on the surface of materials the ftir spectra of original activated carbon and that modified by tio2 are summarized in fig 1 the ftir spectra of ac show the peaks at around 1706 cm 1 and 1576 cm 1 that can be assigned to co bonds of the carboxyl acid groups and the stretching vibrations of conjugated cc bonds of aromatic rings 77 the peak at around 1460 cm 1 corresponds to an oh bending modes of alcoholic phenolic and carboxylic groups or ch bending vibrations bands in the region of 1400 1380 cm 1 are attributed to the cc or to carboxyl carbonate structures or coh and the band at 1250 cm 1 is assigned to co stretching it has been reported 78 that the band 1040 cm 1 is assigned to alcoholic co stretching vibration while the band at 870 cm 1 represents the contribution from ch bond vibration in aromatic compounds 79 as expected the ftir spectrum of each actio2 samples presents a broad band at 780 cm 1 which is characteristic of the vibration tioti and the adsorption bands at about 470 cm 1 is related to the stretching vibrations of the ti o bonds in addition a new adsorption band was found at about 1080 cm 1 in ac tio2 samples which may be ascribed to tioc bonds in according to the literature 80 it means that tio2 particles attached chemically to the ac surfaces and then these particles cannot easily separate to complete this characterization analysis sem and eds were used to evaluate the morphology of the surface and the elemental composition of selected area the sem images of ac and ac tio2 samples are presented in fig 2 this figure shows that the ac fig 2a morphology suggest a smooth surface with regular pores in its structure compared to ac the surface of ac tio2 appears coarse and irregular fig 2b c and d indeed when tio2 is grafted on ac by the sol gel method particles tio2 are uniformly distributed on the surface of ac fig 2b and are introduced in the internal pores consequently the regular pore structure was destroyed and the porosity was increased in the final elaborated solid it is clearly seen that ac 5 tio2 and ac 10 tio2 samples presents the agglomeration of tio2 particles on the carbonaceous surface fig 2c and d compared to ac ac tio2 exhibits many transparent spots further suggesting that the surface area increased moreover the modified ac appeared to have mixtures of micropores and mesopores fig 2d in the literature 81 similar superficial structures were observed in zno tio2 bamboo charcoal further the white area is assigned to ti while the grey and black areas refer to carbon this is confirmed by the elemental analysis of ac tio2 for example the fig 3 shows eds spectrum of the composite ac 1 tio2 which indicates the presence of elements ti o and c on the surface of material for white area of the composite mainly measured with very limited amounts of al si o and s similarly for other white area of the composite ac 1 tio2 the eds data reveal that in the white part still peaks of carbon and peaks of ti could also be seen reflecting that ti and carbon can be simply differentiated by visible color in sem images the mixing of ti and c resulted in a rather irregular covering some area were heavily covered with ti while others contained only a minor amount of ti results are also very similar for the other two composites ac 5 tio2 and ac 10 tio2 tga technique was also used to measure the weight loss as a function of temperature and to have information regarding samples composition and their thermal stability the tga curve of the activated carbon can be divided in three stages when heated at constant rate as shown in fig 4 the first mass loss up to 2 4 wt of initial the activated carbon occurs at low temperature to 298 t 358 k which was caused by extractive compounds evaporation and desorption of physically adsorbed water on the material and moisture loss 82 the second stage is from 358 to 748 k an a very less weight loss was observed of around 1 79 wt then the third stage is from 748 to 1048 k which the mass loss is the greatest and reached 8 36 wt this last proportion of mass loss at such high temperature can be assigned to the decomposition of various functional groups present in the activated carbon such as ethers phenols esters and quinones etc 83 the temperature range for the first mass loss for ac 1 tio2 and ac 5 tio2 extended up to 548 k and the second up to 1043 k the second mass loss of ac 1 tio2 and ac 5 tio2 at central temperature range 358 748 k a gentle mass loss were observed of about 1 88 and 1 94 wt respectively due to the loss of the remaining water molecules bound to the surface and to the dehydroxylation the ti species 84 the overall mass loss up to 1048 k was 8 86 and 9 wt for ac 1 tio2 and ac 5 tio2 respectively thus the incorporation of tio2 did not produce other appreciable thermal effects this corresponds to the burning of residual organic material and chemically adsorbed water for ac 10 tio2 in the central temperature range 348 363 k approximately 2 94 wt corresponds to the burning of residual organic material and chemically adsorbed water 85 the overall mass loss up to 1043 k was 11 wt 4 2 adsorption experiments to quantify the consequences of coating the surface of the activated carbon with tio2 and to investigate its effect on the porosity of these compounds the adsorption capacity of clofibric gallic and salicylic acids on virgin activated carbon and ac tio2 was first established thus kinetics experiments must be investigated in order to determine the time necessary for the adsorption systems to reach equilibrium and to elucidate the mechanism of the adsorption process the preliminary optimization of the experimental parameters allows carrying out tests of adsorption only with one initial concentration for each acid i e 15 mg dm3 the ph value was 3 in all experiments and 25 mg of adsorbents the solution ph has been selected considering the phpzc determined for the materials see table 1 from these results the net charge on the absorbent surface will be positive and will favor the interaction with the acid molecules see fig 5 all the bottles were laid on the shaker with stirring at 180 rpm after a predetermined time in the orbital shaker at room temperature the suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm durapore membrane filters the concentration of the molecule remaining in aqueous solution was measured using a jasco v 730 uv vis spectrometer at the maximum absorption wavelength which was determined experimentally for each molecule 4 3 kinetic models the evolution of the capacity of adsorption of each compound with time at room temperature was presented in fig 6 the maxima adsorption values found were 3 7 mg g for ca 5 3 mg g for ga and 5 7 mg g for sa in all cases on ac 10 tio2 see also table 3 the last experimental data were fitted to study the potential rate controlling steps of adsorption using the pseudo first order the pseudo second order and the intra particle diffusion kinetic models 85 93 the fits of pseudo first and second order models were checked by each non linear plot of qt versus t constant values for the two adsorption kinetic models were calculated and are given in table 4 the coefficient of determination denoted as r2 and chi squared denoted as χ2 were employed to decide which the best model according to the calculated χ2 the pseudo first order model provides the best correlation for the adsorption kinetics of emerging pollutants thus it is appropriated to use the pseudo first order model to predict the adsorption kinetics for all compounds in the study of kinetic of adsorption of sa onto the various solids the value of k1 for activated carbon ac 1 tio2 ac 5 tio2 and ac 10 tio2 were obtained as 0 014 0 020 0 119 0 990 min 1 respectively these results showed that adsorption kinetics on ac 10 tio2 was much faster than on activated carbon due to the microporous network thus the results prove similar adsorption behavior for ca ga and sa on the activated carbon and ac tio2 composites the intra particle diffusion model is showed in fig 7 the intra particule diffusion of organic molecules within studied adsorbents occurs in two stages which indicates that the adsorption mechanism in this case is controlled by two steps the first linear part which corresponds to the adsorption period from 0 to 10 min represents the external mass transfer and the rapid distribution of these molecules on the outer surface of the material in contrast the second linear part includes the adsorption period from 20 to 90 min and represents the intra particule diffusion and the interaction between the molecules and the internal active sites of the present adsorbents the slope of the linear portion table 5 indicates the rate of the adsorption process which decreases with contact time various interaction types to explain the adsorption of organic contaminants on adsorbents have been reported hydrophobic interactions π π stacking interactions van der waals forces electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions taking into account the ph of the solution ph 3 the phpzc of the adsorbents see table 1 between 4 25 and 4 67 and the pka of the pollutants the effect of van der waals and π π interactions can explain the removal of this type of adsorbates see fig 5 4 4 adsorption isotherms otherwise the adsorption equilibrium data were fitted to the freundlich temkin sips and tôth isotherm models the parameters of these models were estimated by non linear regression and the values of the correlation coefficient r2 and χ2 are again calculated and included in table 6 each model constants can be used for predicting the adsorption capacities and also for incorporating into mass transfer relationship to predict the design of contacting experiments for comparison results obtained from the literature on acids adsorption by several adsorbents are summarized in table 3 in this study n values are greater than unity smaller value of 1 n indicating a strong interaction between adsorbates sa ca and ga and adsorbent activated carbon and ac tio2 composites among five isotherm models namely freundlich langmuir temkin sips and tôth used for fitting of the experimental adsorption data of an emerging compounds ca ga and sa on activated carbon and ac tio2 the sips model gave the lowest error and the highest r2 values the product of the sips parameters qs ms which is related to the interaction of the acids with the surface is higher for the modified activated carbon ac tio2 than for the virgin carbon as seen earlier the best fitting results were obtained with the sips isotherm model therefore this isotherm is the one selected to be presented with the experimental data in fig 8 5 conclusions in the present study the removal of three kind of emerging molecules clofibric gallic and salicylic acids from synthetic solutions was investigated by using activated carbon and ac tio2 composites this work shows that modified activated carbon with tio2 could be considered as potential adsorbents for removal of organic compounds from aqueous solutions the adsorption capacity of modified activated carbon for ca ga and sa is higher than that for ac the kinetic study revealed that stirring for 20 min is sufficient for the emerging compound modified activated carbon system to reach equilibrium the adsorption of these compounds onto modified ac obeyed pseudo first order kinetics the sips model is found to well represent the experimental data of adsorption of ca ga and sa by ac and various ac tio2 activated carbon is known for its effectiveness in removing organic molecules from water and wastewater acknowledgement ag thanks santander bank for funding through the research intensification program 
14357,coagulation was performed on synthetic test waters prepared with different concentrations of humic acid ha and kaolin to simulate organics and turbidity found in natural surface waters the alkalinity of the test waters was high 180 205 mg l and high basicity pacl was used to coagulate the impurities as it is best suited for high alkalinity waters separate removal mechanisms of ha and kaolin has been dealt in detail by many researchers but in this paper the simultaneous removal mechanisms are stressed upon synthetic test waters were chosen instead of real surface waters to incorporate the effects of fluctuating organics and turbidity to have better insights into the removal mechanisms jar test was used to evaluate the removal efficiency of toc doc uv254 and turbidity zeta potential particle floc size ph and alkalinity were also evaluated before and after the coagulation to investigate the charge neutralisation capacity of pacl at alkaline ph the ph at optimum doses varied from 6 5 to 8 suggesting removal dominantly by sweep coagulation the complete charge neutralisation was not possible which was indicated by the negative zeta potential even at optimum doses as some residual toc 0 5 2 mg l and doc 0 4 1 4 mg l remained in the treated water the residual turbidity at optimum doses was 1 ntu the complex removal mechanisms of ha and kaolin for these test waters were further elucidated by using three adsorption models langmuir freundlich and bet model the bet adsorption model showed highest r2 values suggesting removal by multilayer adsorption keywords pacl coagulation mechanisms humic acid nom removal 1 introduction coagulation is considered to be the most important step of solid liquid separation in a water treatment plant the efficiency of subsequent treatment systems greatly depends upon the efficiency of coagulation coagulation performance determines the amount of residual particles that need to be separated by subsequent rapid sand filtration in a full scale water treatment plant residual particles and unsettled flocs can be challenging to remove in media filtration because the floc may pass straight through the filter bed detach from the filter media or overload the filter 1 lately the removal of nom natural organic matter by enhanced coagulation has gained a lot of importance as nom is a known precursor to the formation of dbps disinfection by products 2 3 many studies have proved that humic substances that constitutes nom if not removed efficiently in the coagulation step can considerably reduce the efficiency of subsequent membrane filtration unit to remove nom from aqueous media 4 5 if the subsequent system is an adsorption system nom often competes for adsorption sites decreasing the removal of other pollutants 6 as such there has arisen a need to optimise the removal of both the impurities for the efficiency of the system and overall efficiency of a water treatment plant the removal mechanism of colloidal turbidity and dissolved nom has been dealt in detail separately however simultaneous optimised removal of these impurities is a complex process and still needs to be understood in detail the removal mechanism of mineral turbidity along with nom becomes quite complex and not much has been reported about this the colloidal particles inorganic and organic particles and dissolved organic matter dom may have different removal paths therefore optimum set of parameters for turbidity removal may differ from nom removal which makes the whole process challenging to obtain optimal water quality one needs to deduce if the process needs to be optimised for particle removal or nom removal to obtain optimal removal of both the impurities this could be a function of the amount of nom and turbidity present in the raw water and also ph alkalinity of the raw water which influence the mechanisms of removal by influencing the type of species generated by the coagulant used 7 for nom coagulation it has largely been reported that the optimum removal happens at a slightly acidic ph of 4 5 6 on the other hand mineral turbidity is effectively removed at near neutral ph range when significant nom is present in the surface water there arises a need to optimize the coagulation process for nom along with turbidity removal acidifying the water for removal of nom and application of high doses of coagulants increases the corrosivity of water and also increases the dose of base required to counter the corrosive tendency of water before water distribution 8 therefore the adjustment of ph specifically for nom removal is considered labour intensive and costly for the treatment plants having very high alkalinity the ph conditions of most water supplies is ph 6 8 9 the presence of high alkalinity and coloured input water has necessitated the evaluation of nom removal by increasing the dose of coagulant i e by performing optimised coagulation research still needs to be done to optimise the simultaneous removal of nom and turbidity from high alkaline waters and elaborate the mechanisms of removal while also incorporating the effect of fluctuations in turbidity and nom concentrations therefore optimisation of the process for simultaneous removal and understanding the interactions of mineral turbidity and nom at alkaline ph becomes important in the light of regulations laid by the government of india for thms trihalomethanes in the drinking water specifications 2012 is 10500 there has arisen a need to evaluate the organics removal and adjust the dose of coagulant under the current ph conditions conventionally alum has been used as a coagulant but with the advancement of coagulant preparation various pre hydrolysed commercial coagulants are available these days which offers a broader operational ph range for coagulation and results in less sludge creation than conventional coagulants in india pacl polyaluminium chloride is being popularly used pacl has become one of the most effective coagulant agents in water and wastewater treatment facilities with various applications including removal of colloids and suspended particles organic matter metal ions phosphates toxic metals and color a range of pre polymerized aluminium solutions such as polyaluminium chlorides pacl polyaluminium sulfates pas polyaluminium ferrous sulphate pafs and polyaluminium chloro sulfates pacs etc are available 10 these commercial coagulants are available in various basicity or b levels to be able to suit the raw water conditions generally for high alkaline waters high basicity pacls are best suited as their ph of minimum solubility is higher than that of low basicity pacl and performs better with no requirement of acid addition 9 also with increased alkalinity the difference in the coagulation behaviour of various coagulants is more pronounced with pacls with different basicity or b values 11 the key mechanisms for the removal of nom by hydrolysing coagulants are complexation charge neutralisation adsorption on amorphous metal hydroxide precipitate and entrapment 6 at higher ph values the dominant specie of al coagulant is al oh 3 the dominant mechanism of removal may be entrapment or adsorption onto the amorphous precipitate the adsorption could be homogenous heterogenous monolayer or multi layer the adsorption of nom may be enhanced or depressed by the presence of turbidity in the past studies have been more focussed on the preparation and development of pacl and other novel coagulants studies have been conducted to understand the speciation characteristics of pacl 12 13 and the performance of preformed and in situ formed species of pacl 11 the coagulation behaviour of polyaluminum chloride pacl with various basicities b oh al values has also been investigated 11 many researchers have coagulated natural river lake water using pre hydrolysed coagulants 14 15 the removal of turbidity by modifying the dosing approaches like dual dosing fecl3 pacl has been studied 16 the binding interactions of metal cations such as aluminium with ha humic acid has been elaborately studied to understand its aggregation kinetics 17 the geometric perspective of the effect of ha on flocculation has been dealt in detail 18 however the effect of changing concentrations and characteristics hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio of organics along with the presence of turbidity in the source water can seriously alter the binding interactions and consequently change the coagulant dose and aggregation mechanisms an empirical perspective to support and validate theoretical understanding and mathematical modelling is still needed to understand the complex removal mechanisms in real time that result in optimised coagulant doses with changing source water quality in this study simulated water was prepared by using humic acid and kaolin as source of organics and turbidity respectively the studies using real water samples are limited and restricts the analyses of fluctuating raw water conditions therefore simulated water samples were prepared in this study to better understand the effects of fluctuating water quality on removal mechanisms and efficiency the ph was not adjusted to mimic what is done in practice with the high alkalinity waters high basicity pacl was used to match the alkalinity of water the objectives of this study were to evaluate toc and turbidity removal for high alkalinity waters while understanding the mechanisms of their simultaneous removal by varying content of ha and kaolin turbidity in the test water synthetic model water was prepared having toc from 0 to 10 mg l and turbidity from 0 to 20 ntu these waters were then coagulated and removal efficiency was assessed by measuring turbidity toc doc uv254 at various doses of high basicity pacl zeta potential was measured to assess the stability of suspensions before and after the coagulation and to assess the charge neutralisation capacity of pacl at alkaline conditions the particle and floc sizes were also measured to understand the role of particle concentration in floc formation the insights into mechanisms of removal are further elucidated by using isotherm models langmuir freundlich and bet model 2 materials and methods the raw water used for the preparation of synthetic test samples for this study was tap water taken from the mnit malaviya national institute of technology jaipur campus the ph of the water was not adjusted as the objective was to find the efficiency of toc and turbidity removal in the alkaline ph range all the analyses were performed on the same day all the reagents used were of analytical grade 2 1 preparation of working suspensions to simulate organics humic acid stock solution was prepared by adding 1 5 g of powdered humic acid sigma and 0 01 m naoh to 1 l of deionized water 12 13 19 the solution was stirred for 5 h to completely dissolve the humic acid the solution was then stored in the refrigerator for later use the toc and doc of the resulting solution was 736 9 mg l and 651 1 mg l respectively the size distribution of the stock solution was 0 267 0 06 μm the stock solution was then diluted to prepare solutions having toc 2 4 6 8 10 mg l to simulate turbidity a stock kaolin suspension was prepared using powdered kaolin sigma having chemical formula al2si2o5 oh 4 11 20 21 the suspension was stirred for 5 h to allow for complete mixing and dissolution of kaolin in the water and then the solution was left undisturbed for 24 h to allow for the settling of settleable particles after 24 h of settling the supernatant was collected and turbidity was determined using nephelometer the turbidity generated by 20 g of kaolin per litre was 67 ntu the size distribution of the stock suspension was 2 3 0 54 μm the stock kaolin solution was diluted to prepare suspensions with turbidity of 5 10 15 and 20 ntu the requisite sample waters were prepared by diluting and mixing the stock solutions of humic acid and kaolin 29 such different suspensions excluding 0 turbidity and 0 toc were prepared by varying toc from 0 to 10 mg l 0 2 4 6 8 10 mg l and turbidity from 0 to 20 ntu 0 5 10 15 20 ntu 2 2 coagulant and its characterisation commercial liquid grade high basicity pacl aditya birla chemicals was used to coagulate the sample waters as its ph of minimum solubility is higher than that of low basicity pacl pacl is better suited for highly alkaline waters as it contains more preformed medium polymeric species or alb species 7 the content of al2o3 was 10 2 10 5 weight weight the doses mentioned in this study are in terms of mg al per litre ftir fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer perkin elmer spectrum version 10 4 00 was used to characterise pacl used in this study for the presence of various chemical bonds 14 the infrared spectrum range was 4000 400 cm 1 2 3 jar test experiments a 6 paddle jar test apparatus was used for performing coagulation flocculation experiments the experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 30 c the volume of jar was 1 l the volume of the sample water taken was 500 ml in 1 l jar to avoid spilling while rapid mixing after the addition of pacl rapid mixing was done at 150 rpm for 2 min and slow mixing at 30 rpm for 20 min after that settling was allowed for 30 min after settling the supernatant was pipetted out for further analysis 2 4 analytical methods the efficiency of the process was examined by measuring ph alkalinity toc doc uv254 particle floc size and zeta potential before and after coagulation flocculation all the analyses were performed in triplicates the toc and doc was measured by using a shimadzu toc l analyser the doc was measured after filtering the sample from 0 45 μm by using a syringe filtration assembly 22 23 the uv254 was measured by using a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer using 1 cm path length quartz cuvette 24 turbidity was analysed using nephlometer lutron tu 2016 25 26 the ph was measured by using ph meter hanna hi98130 27 alkalinity was measured by titrimetric method apha 2320 b 28 zeta potential and particle size of the untreated simulated water and the treated supernatant after coagulation was analysed using zetasizer version 7 11 malvern instruments u k 29 the floc size was analysed using a digital image processing facility the floc sizes for the optimised doses were measured after 2 min of rapid mix and 20 min of slow mix using a camera magnus magcam hd series objective lens assembly and magvision software to give images and size distributions 30 31 the detailed methodology of the digital image processing facility to be included in another scope of study in this study floc size distribution for only 4 cases are discussed low toc and low turbidity low toc and high turbidity high toc and low turbidity and high toc and high turbidity 3 results and discussions 3 1 raw water characterisation the alkalinity of the working suspensions was high ranging from 180 to 205 mg l as caco3 the ph of the suspensions varied from 8 14 to 8 45 the zeta potential varied from 7 63 to 18 mv the suva specific uv absorbance values were greater than 4 for all the suspensions the characteristics of untreated test waters are shown in table 1 3 2 characterisation of pacl ftir has been largely used to determine the bonds present in a coagulant fig 1 shows the ftir spectra of pacl used in this study the strong peak at 3346 53 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of oh bonds the group frequency of 3570 3200 cm 1 broad is assigned to the h bonded oh stretch and 3400 3200 cm 1 is assigned to normal polymeric oh stretch the peak at 1633 33 cm 1 is due to the presence of cc or the oh groups in water molecule the group frequency attributed to the cc is 1680 1620 cm 1 thus the significant presence of oh bonds shows the probability of efficient removal by formation of various aluminium hydroxide species 3 3 optimised toc and turbidity removal for optimising the process simultaneously for nom and turbidity removal such optimum doses were selected where the turbidity reduced below 1 ntu and toc reduced to a level beyond which even after increasing the dose no further appreciable reduction in toc was observed the percentage toc removal with increasing doses of pacl are shown in the fig 2 the removal of toc increased with increasing doses and then plateaued in some suspensions and reversed in some at the optimum doses 30 85 toc removal was obtained at doses varying from 4 to 9 mg al l table 2 the removal percentage was lesser for the suspensions having low input toc the frequency of collisions is proportional to the concentration of particles that are subject to interaction for flocculation the kinetic model is usually given in terms of the collision frequency between microflocs and particles between microflocs and microflocs between microflocs and floc particles or between floc particles and floc particles in case of low particle concentration there is reduced collision frequency which might result in low density floc formation which may not be removed efficiently for the input turbidity of 4 mg l there was marginal increase in toc removal as the input turbidity increased for the input toc of 2 mg l the toc removal percentage reduced at first but then increased with further increase in the input turbidity this can be explained by the fact that an input turbidity of 5 ntu might not be enough to improve the collision frequency with such low input toc concentration however a further increase to 10 15 and 20 ntu offered increased particle collision frequency and slightly improved the toc removal by formation of compact flocs the doc removal varied from 30 to 90 at the optimum doses the residual turbidity was well within 1 ntu at optimised doses as shown in table 3 the removal of uv254 varied from 70 to 90 at optimum doses indicating efficient removal of uv absorbing portion of nom it has been reported that the uv absorbing fractions of organic matter are often main contributors to the formation of dbps 32 3 4 residual toc and doc adsorption of dom dissolved organic matter onto metal hydrous oxides is a function of coagulant type dose and ph 14 controlling the ph can result into better dom removal as the dominant mechanism is considered to be charge neutralisation at slightly acidic ph however when the ph is alkaline the residual hydrophilic dom is bound to occur in the treated water as the dominant mechanism is not charge neutralisation it is well known that the hydrophobic fraction is easier to be removed than hydrophilic fraction via coagulation because of its higher charge density 33 36 the complete toc removal was not achieved and some residual remined in the treated water even at optimum doses the residual toc doc and poc particulate organic matter at the optimum doses is shown in fig 3 the residual toc at optimum doses varied between 0 7 2 mg l only twice the residual toc was below 1 mg l 0 749 and 0 992 mg l the residual toc decreased as the dose increased fig 4 a further reduction in toc was difficult even by increasing the doses the residual doc varied from 0 5 to 1 4 mg l which could possibly be due to the unadsorbed dissolved organics this was also supported by the negative zeta potential described in the later section sabir et al 2013 also reported that the rate of dom removal decreased with increasing coagulant dose beyond a certain coagulant dose 14 restabilisation may pose a problem under increased dose of coagulants excess dosages can result in charge reversal and restabilization of colloids thus increasing the residual doc which could be the reason why the increased doses could not improve the doc removal 37 the suva specific uv absorbance values were 2 at optimum doses indicating the removal of hydrophobic portion of nom the smaller size fraction or the hydrophilic fraction of dom could be possibly difficult to remove as the dominant mechanism at alkaline ph is sweep coagulation rather than charge neutralisation it was reported by sharp et al 2006 that one possible explanation for the poor removal is attributed to the fact that at the coagulation ph of normal operation 5 7 the hydrophilic fractions possess a negligible or slightly positive charge 38 3 5 effect of ph alkalinity and coagulant in this study the prime objective was to assess the removal efficiency of nom and particles at alkaline ph by using high basicity pacl the initial ph of the synthetic test waters was on the alkaline side 8 2 the alkalinity of the test waters was as high as 180 205 mg l the ph and alkalinity were measured after coagulation flocculation and a constant decrease was seen in the ph of all the suspensions with the increase in the coagulant dose for all the suspensions and varying doses the ph even after coagulation remained between 7 5 8 the alkalinity after coagulation dropped and remained between 140 190 mg l for various doses fig 5 the ph at optimum doses for all the suspensions varied in close range of 7 65 8 00 table 4 which could be the ph of minimum solubility where the coagulant is converted to solid floc particles and the removal is possibly occurring by sweep mechanism it has been proposed that the humic acid fraction of nom is recalcitrant to removal at high ph 8 5 39 in a study by sabir et al the doc removal by pacl stagnated after reaching 70 at a ph of 8 5 14 as the ph increases above the optimum more negatively charged al species are formed 9 due to which the destabilization potential is highly reduced and thus the small particles will not be able to aggregate into large flocs and thus remain as residuals 40 the removal of nom at higher ph than the minimum solubility of the coagulant is known to occur primarily by bridging and sweep flocculation for high alkaline waters the challenge is to remove doc for which the dominant removal mechanism is charge neutralisation whereas the bulk nom is efficiently removed if commercial coagulants are used even at alkaline ph values the medium polymeric species such as alb species are responsible for charge neutralisation for conventional coagulants these species are formed at slightly acidic ph but for ipfs inorganic polymer flocculants such as pacls the dependence on the ph is lesser and it contains pre formed hydrolysed species which can cause charge neutralisation of the dissolved organics even at alkaline ph however in this study complete charge neutralisation was not achieved it has been reported that the interactions of non preformed species of conventional coagulants with humic acid are weaker as compared to pre formed species of ipfs it has been reported that there is selective binding of pre hydrolysed al species to carboxylic groups at ph 6 and to phenolic moieties at ph 8 41 pacl work efficiently in terms of residual turbidity for slightly higher ph value i e 7 4 instead of 6 9 7 2 for the case of alum resulting to smaller acid consumption for ph correction 42 pacls are less affected by alkalinity than alum particularly those pacls with higher basicity but the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have not been elucidated 11 it was pointed out by jiao et al 2017 that the increase in ph cause high polymeric hydrolysis products to increase and the particles are easily adsorbed and co precipitated thus sweep flocculation is dominant until ph reaches 8 0 after which al oh 4 becomes the main species 43 thus a combination of charge neutralisation by pre formed alb species and adsorption on to the amorphous precipitate appears to be a probable mechanism of removal in this study 3 6 zeta potential studies coagulation is a physico chemical process aiming at reducing the repulsive potential of electrical double layer of colloids thus destabilizing them 44 the zeta potential values can be effectively used to support the mechanism of removal for surface waters the zeta potential is generally on the negative side aquatic humic and fulvic substances which are negatively charged macromolecules can adsorb onto the surfaces of clay and other natural particles further increasing their negative charge 9 after treatment by coagulation the zeta potential becomes less negative and approaches zero at optimum doses and ph the zeta potential varies with the ph so all the parameters affecting ph would influence zeta potential which would further affect the removal in this study the zeta potential at optimum doses varied from 15 53 to 1 3 mv charge neutralisation at slightly acidic ph is known to remove the smallest of dissolved organic particles 2 6 44 however this may not be the case for sweep coagulation at neutral or alkaline ph as very small dissolved particles such as the hydrophilic portion of nom are recalcitrant to removal and appear as residuals thus always some residual toc doc may be there even after treatment by coagulation showing negative zeta potential in water treatment removal of the hydrophobic portion of nom is found to be more strongly related to the zeta potential 23 36 in this study the initial ph before coagulation is on the alkaline side the dividing line between stable and unstable suspensions is generally taken at either 30 mv or 30 mv particles with zeta potentials more positive than 30 mv or more negative than 30 mv are normally considered stable for the various suspensions prepared in this study the zeta potential was determined before and after coagulation for each dose the zeta potential after the coagulation was negative and never reached zero even at optimum doses it has been elucidated in the previous section that the residual toc after the coagulation was significant to result in a negative zeta potential this residual could be the dissolved portion of nom which is difficult to remove by sweep mechanism at alkaline ph the raw water characteristics shows that the suspension with the presence of toc as low as 2 mg l shows a zeta potential of 15 77 mv and the residual toc ranged from 0 7 to 2 mg l which is likely to show a negative zeta potential for all the suspensions the zeta potential of the suspension after coagulation flocculation is shown in the fig 6 it can be seen that the zeta potential before and after the coagulation is less negative than 30 mv which is the diving line between stable and unstable suspensions this shows that after treatment the suspensions are unstable in fact all the values of zeta potential are less negative than 16 mv after coagulation in almost all the cases there is slight increment in the zeta potential which could be due to partial charge neutralisation due to preformed alb species and partial sweep flocculation due to al oh 3 3 7 particle and floc size analysis the particle and floc sizes at various stages of coagulation flocculation process are shown in table 5 the initial particle size of the test waters having high input toc were smaller as compared to the ones having higher input turbidity the particle size of stock kaolin suspension and stock humic acid solution were 2 3 0 54 μm and 0 267 0 06 μm respectively the size of the particles in stock kaolin suspension was relatively larger than the ones in humic acid solution therefore the test waters with high initial turbidity had a greater number of larger sized particles as the test suspensions were a mixture of ha and kaolin the particle size distribution of the resulting suspensions were in between the size of ha and kaolin stock suspensions in case of low initial particle concentration i e case c toc 2 mg l turbidity 5 ntu the floc size is largest for both the stages 2 and 3 i e after rapid mix and slow mix in case of high particle concentration i e case b toc 10 turbidity 20 ntu the floc size is smallest the other two cases a and d having comparable initial particle concentration showed almost similar floc sizes this shows that lower the particle count lower the collision frequency and more scattered elongated and loose flocs are formed higher particle count resulted in more compact and smaller flocs comparing the case a toc 2 turbidity 20 ntu and b toc 10 turbidity 20 ntu having similar turbidity it can be seen that the flocs formed were lesser in size and compact for an initial toc of 10 mg l rather than 2 mg l similar trend is seen if we compare case c and d this shows that presence of ha resulted in smaller size and compactness of flocs the size distribution of residuals in supernatant in case b c and d is less than the average size of stock kaolin suspension and more than the average size stock of ha solution so it could be said that in case b c and d the residual particles are more likely to be residual ha flocs and in case a it could possibly be a combination of kaolin and ha both in the fig 7 the floc images after slow mixing are shown 3 8 adsorption studies the adsorption of ha and kaolin on al species was studied using three isotherms langmuir freundlich and bet isotherms detailed equations and assumptions in appendix a the assumption of langmuir isotherm is a monolayer physical as well as chemical adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent the adsorbent surface is assumed to be homogenous having equal energy and potential for adsorption in table 6 ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbent in mg l a and b are langmuir constant l mg and maximum sorption mg mg qe is the adsorption capacity in mg mg freundlich isotherm assumes heterogenous or rough surface of the adsorbent and multilayer physical as well as chemical adsorption kf is the freundlich affinity coefficient which refers to the adsorption capacity l mg and n dimensionless is the freundlich exponential coefficient and its value can vary when different types of coagulants and ph values are used at various controlled runs bet isotherm is a modified form of langmuir isotherm bet isotherm assumes a multilayer physical adsorption c is the final concentration of adsorbate in the solution at equilibrium mg l cs is the initial or saturation concentration of the adsorbate in the solution mg l qe is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg mg xm is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed to form a complete monolayer mg mg and a is a constant to describe the energy of interaction between the adsorbate and coagulant solid precipitate of metal hydroxide surface in the table 6 value of r2 is highest for bet model amongst the three models that were compared this suggests that the adsorption of nom is dominantly physical and multi layered however the r2 values are not as high indicating prevalence of some other mechanisms too which could be possibly charge neutralisation by preformed alb species or complexation complexation between carboxylic and phenolic groups of ha and metal cations play an important role in coagulation of ha 45 divalent and trivalent metal cations can form a large number of strong intra or inter molecular bonds with ha 17 in ha kaolin water ha can be adsorbed on the surface of kaolin to form ha kaolin complex this ha kaolin complex is removed mainly by charge neutralization and sweeping of coagulants which is supposed to be major coagulation mechanism 46 there is two way possibility of kaolin ha interaction interaction and then adsorption or adsorption of kaolin or ha on amorphous al oh 3 and then interaction with the other species both these cases support the possibility of multi layer adsorption in this study the ph was on the alkaline side which suggests that the dominant mechanism could be sweep coagulation which involves physical adsorption of the impurities conforming to the r2 values obtained by using bet model thus the ha kaolin particles and ha kaolin complexes could have been dominantly removed by sweep mechanism and to a lesser extent by charge neutralisation sweep flocculation is generally thought to give considerably improved particle removal than when particles are destabilised just by charge neutralisation 37 the calculated constant values a b for langmuir isotherms were negative these negative values of langmuir constants indicate that the nom adsorption mechanism was not based on monolayer formation with a homogeneous surface 14 the previous literatures have mainly proposed two coagulation mechanisms to explain the removal of humic substances 1 charge neutralisation precipitation at acidic ph and 2 adsorption and or sweep coagulation in a hydroxide precipitate at alkaline ph 6 9 37 47 48 however some researchers have pointed out that the main nom removal mechanisms generally associated with inorganic polymeric coagulants such as pacls pfcs etc are adsorption entrapment complexation and to a lesser extent charge neutralization 49 50 the importance of electronegativity and thickness of hydration shell of metal cation used as coagulant has also been elucidated by tan et al 2019 they reported that thick hydration shell of metal ion can reduce its binding affinity to ha 17 tan et al 2018 reported that ha can complex with mg 2 and reduce the negative surface charge of silica aerogels in aqueous medium 51 in this study the high alkalinity could be due to presence of carbonates and bicarbonates of magnesium and calcium there is a strong possibility of complexation between the functional groups of ha and mg 2 or ca 2 thereby resulting in bridging and increase in the aggregation of kaolin turbidity which is a type of alumino silicate in the fig 8 a a schematic representation of the simulated ha kaolin water is shown where the ha represents the humic acid molecules k represents the kaolin particles and ha k represents humic acid kaolin complex that are formed as a result of interaction between humic acid and kaolin particles which may occur before or after adsorption on coagulant species in the fig 8 b the speciation of high basicity pacl is shown under alkaline conditions it is probable that the removal of impurities take place either by charge neutralisation by the alb species fig 8 c or adsorption by the al oh 3 species fig 8 d the removal of small negatively charged dissolved organic matter can be attributed to the preformed alb species the doc was not removed completely which shows that charge neutralisation was lesser prevalent than sweep coagulation 4 conclusions in this study various parameters of importance in coagulation such as ph alkalinity zeta potential residual toc and doc were evaluated and correlated to elucidate the possible mechanisms of removal of mixed ha and kaolin suspensions by using high basicity pacl the optimum doses varied from 4 to 9 mg al l the ph at optimised removal remained between 7 65 8 00 which is closer to the minimum solubility of al species indicating dominance of sweep flocculation the concentration of residuals was also evaluated to support the prevalent mechanism the post coagulation zeta potential was negative due to residual toc and doc the zeta potential at optimum doses varied from 15 53 to 1 3 mv indicating that complete charge neutralisation was not achieved at alkaline conditions and some residual remained in each suspension the residual toc and doc varied from 0 7 to 2 mg l and 0 5 to 1 4 mg l respectively the toc removal percentage was lower for low input toc and turbidity which could be attributed to lower frequency of collisions resulting in loose floc formation and consequent inefficient removal of flocs during settling the suva values at the optimum dose were 2 indicating the removal of high molecular weight doc at optimum doses and indicated that the smaller size fraction or the hydrophilic fraction of dom was difficult to remove as the dominant mechanism at alkaline ph appeared to be sweep coagulation rather than charge neutralisation the mechanism of charge neutralisation also becomes difficult at alkaline ph because the ionization of the functional groups of hydrophilic portion of nom happens to a lesser extent at alkaline ph than at acidic ph however the preformed medium polymeric species or the alb species could be responsible for partial charge neutralisation and removal of some fraction of doc for further insight into the mechanism three theoretical adsorption models were compared for r2 values the r2 values of the bet model were highest as compared to langmuir and freundlich model indicating multi layer physisorption further confirming the dominance of sweep coagulation for the removal of ha and kaolin at alkaline ph the high r2 values for bet isotherm also supported the interactions that might have taken place between ha and kaolin resulting in multilayer formation the floc size data revealed that higher particle concentration of both kaolin and ha resulted in smaller and more compact floc formation and lower particle concentration led to formation of elongated loose and bigger flocs it can be concluded that at alkaline ph concentration of both nom and mineral turbidity has an important role to play for the interaction of particles with coagulant and floc formation for efficient settling appendix a isotherms 1 langmuir isotherm the assumption of langmuir isotherm is a monolayer physical as well as chemical adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent the adsorbent surface is assumed to be homogenous having equal energy and potential for adsorption all vacant sites are homogenous having equal size and shape and have equal affinity for adsorbate one

14357,coagulation was performed on synthetic test waters prepared with different concentrations of humic acid ha and kaolin to simulate organics and turbidity found in natural surface waters the alkalinity of the test waters was high 180 205 mg l and high basicity pacl was used to coagulate the impurities as it is best suited for high alkalinity waters separate removal mechanisms of ha and kaolin has been dealt in detail by many researchers but in this paper the simultaneous removal mechanisms are stressed upon synthetic test waters were chosen instead of real surface waters to incorporate the effects of fluctuating organics and turbidity to have better insights into the removal mechanisms jar test was used to evaluate the removal efficiency of toc doc uv254 and turbidity zeta potential particle floc size ph and alkalinity were also evaluated before and after the coagulation to investigate the charge neutralisation capacity of pacl at alkaline ph the ph at optimum doses varied from 6 5 to 8 suggesting removal dominantly by sweep coagulation the complete charge neutralisation was not possible which was indicated by the negative zeta potential even at optimum doses as some residual toc 0 5 2 mg l and doc 0 4 1 4 mg l remained in the treated water the residual turbidity at optimum doses was 1 ntu the complex removal mechanisms of ha and kaolin for these test waters were further elucidated by using three adsorption models langmuir freundlich and bet model the bet adsorption model showed highest r2 values suggesting removal by multilayer adsorption keywords pacl coagulation mechanisms humic acid nom removal 1 introduction coagulation is considered to be the most important step of solid liquid separation in a water treatment plant the efficiency of subsequent treatment systems greatly depends upon the efficiency of coagulation coagulation performance determines the amount of residual particles that need to be separated by subsequent rapid sand filtration in a full scale water treatment plant residual particles and unsettled flocs can be challenging to remove in media filtration because the floc may pass straight through the filter bed detach from the filter media or overload the filter 1 lately the removal of nom natural organic matter by enhanced coagulation has gained a lot of importance as nom is a known precursor to the formation of dbps disinfection by products 2 3 many studies have proved that humic substances that constitutes nom if not removed efficiently in the coagulation step can considerably reduce the efficiency of subsequent membrane filtration unit to remove nom from aqueous media 4 5 if the subsequent system is an adsorption system nom often competes for adsorption sites decreasing the removal of other pollutants 6 as such there has arisen a need to optimise the removal of both the impurities for the efficiency of the system and overall efficiency of a water treatment plant the removal mechanism of colloidal turbidity and dissolved nom has been dealt in detail separately however simultaneous optimised removal of these impurities is a complex process and still needs to be understood in detail the removal mechanism of mineral turbidity along with nom becomes quite complex and not much has been reported about this the colloidal particles inorganic and organic particles and dissolved organic matter dom may have different removal paths therefore optimum set of parameters for turbidity removal may differ from nom removal which makes the whole process challenging to obtain optimal water quality one needs to deduce if the process needs to be optimised for particle removal or nom removal to obtain optimal removal of both the impurities this could be a function of the amount of nom and turbidity present in the raw water and also ph alkalinity of the raw water which influence the mechanisms of removal by influencing the type of species generated by the coagulant used 7 for nom coagulation it has largely been reported that the optimum removal happens at a slightly acidic ph of 4 5 6 on the other hand mineral turbidity is effectively removed at near neutral ph range when significant nom is present in the surface water there arises a need to optimize the coagulation process for nom along with turbidity removal acidifying the water for removal of nom and application of high doses of coagulants increases the corrosivity of water and also increases the dose of base required to counter the corrosive tendency of water before water distribution 8 therefore the adjustment of ph specifically for nom removal is considered labour intensive and costly for the treatment plants having very high alkalinity the ph conditions of most water supplies is ph 6 8 9 the presence of high alkalinity and coloured input water has necessitated the evaluation of nom removal by increasing the dose of coagulant i e by performing optimised coagulation research still needs to be done to optimise the simultaneous removal of nom and turbidity from high alkaline waters and elaborate the mechanisms of removal while also incorporating the effect of fluctuations in turbidity and nom concentrations therefore optimisation of the process for simultaneous removal and understanding the interactions of mineral turbidity and nom at alkaline ph becomes important in the light of regulations laid by the government of india for thms trihalomethanes in the drinking water specifications 2012 is 10500 there has arisen a need to evaluate the organics removal and adjust the dose of coagulant under the current ph conditions conventionally alum has been used as a coagulant but with the advancement of coagulant preparation various pre hydrolysed commercial coagulants are available these days which offers a broader operational ph range for coagulation and results in less sludge creation than conventional coagulants in india pacl polyaluminium chloride is being popularly used pacl has become one of the most effective coagulant agents in water and wastewater treatment facilities with various applications including removal of colloids and suspended particles organic matter metal ions phosphates toxic metals and color a range of pre polymerized aluminium solutions such as polyaluminium chlorides pacl polyaluminium sulfates pas polyaluminium ferrous sulphate pafs and polyaluminium chloro sulfates pacs etc are available 10 these commercial coagulants are available in various basicity or b levels to be able to suit the raw water conditions generally for high alkaline waters high basicity pacls are best suited as their ph of minimum solubility is higher than that of low basicity pacl and performs better with no requirement of acid addition 9 also with increased alkalinity the difference in the coagulation behaviour of various coagulants is more pronounced with pacls with different basicity or b values 11 the key mechanisms for the removal of nom by hydrolysing coagulants are complexation charge neutralisation adsorption on amorphous metal hydroxide precipitate and entrapment 6 at higher ph values the dominant specie of al coagulant is al oh 3 the dominant mechanism of removal may be entrapment or adsorption onto the amorphous precipitate the adsorption could be homogenous heterogenous monolayer or multi layer the adsorption of nom may be enhanced or depressed by the presence of turbidity in the past studies have been more focussed on the preparation and development of pacl and other novel coagulants studies have been conducted to understand the speciation characteristics of pacl 12 13 and the performance of preformed and in situ formed species of pacl 11 the coagulation behaviour of polyaluminum chloride pacl with various basicities b oh al values has also been investigated 11 many researchers have coagulated natural river lake water using pre hydrolysed coagulants 14 15 the removal of turbidity by modifying the dosing approaches like dual dosing fecl3 pacl has been studied 16 the binding interactions of metal cations such as aluminium with ha humic acid has been elaborately studied to understand its aggregation kinetics 17 the geometric perspective of the effect of ha on flocculation has been dealt in detail 18 however the effect of changing concentrations and characteristics hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio of organics along with the presence of turbidity in the source water can seriously alter the binding interactions and consequently change the coagulant dose and aggregation mechanisms an empirical perspective to support and validate theoretical understanding and mathematical modelling is still needed to understand the complex removal mechanisms in real time that result in optimised coagulant doses with changing source water quality in this study simulated water was prepared by using humic acid and kaolin as source of organics and turbidity respectively the studies using real water samples are limited and restricts the analyses of fluctuating raw water conditions therefore simulated water samples were prepared in this study to better understand the effects of fluctuating water quality on removal mechanisms and efficiency the ph was not adjusted to mimic what is done in practice with the high alkalinity waters high basicity pacl was used to match the alkalinity of water the objectives of this study were to evaluate toc and turbidity removal for high alkalinity waters while understanding the mechanisms of their simultaneous removal by varying content of ha and kaolin turbidity in the test water synthetic model water was prepared having toc from 0 to 10 mg l and turbidity from 0 to 20 ntu these waters were then coagulated and removal efficiency was assessed by measuring turbidity toc doc uv254 at various doses of high basicity pacl zeta potential was measured to assess the stability of suspensions before and after the coagulation and to assess the charge neutralisation capacity of pacl at alkaline conditions the particle and floc sizes were also measured to understand the role of particle concentration in floc formation the insights into mechanisms of removal are further elucidated by using isotherm models langmuir freundlich and bet model 2 materials and methods the raw water used for the preparation of synthetic test samples for this study was tap water taken from the mnit malaviya national institute of technology jaipur campus the ph of the water was not adjusted as the objective was to find the efficiency of toc and turbidity removal in the alkaline ph range all the analyses were performed on the same day all the reagents used were of analytical grade 2 1 preparation of working suspensions to simulate organics humic acid stock solution was prepared by adding 1 5 g of powdered humic acid sigma and 0 01 m naoh to 1 l of deionized water 12 13 19 the solution was stirred for 5 h to completely dissolve the humic acid the solution was then stored in the refrigerator for later use the toc and doc of the resulting solution was 736 9 mg l and 651 1 mg l respectively the size distribution of the stock solution was 0 267 0 06 μm the stock solution was then diluted to prepare solutions having toc 2 4 6 8 10 mg l to simulate turbidity a stock kaolin suspension was prepared using powdered kaolin sigma having chemical formula al2si2o5 oh 4 11 20 21 the suspension was stirred for 5 h to allow for complete mixing and dissolution of kaolin in the water and then the solution was left undisturbed for 24 h to allow for the settling of settleable particles after 24 h of settling the supernatant was collected and turbidity was determined using nephelometer the turbidity generated by 20 g of kaolin per litre was 67 ntu the size distribution of the stock suspension was 2 3 0 54 μm the stock kaolin solution was diluted to prepare suspensions with turbidity of 5 10 15 and 20 ntu the requisite sample waters were prepared by diluting and mixing the stock solutions of humic acid and kaolin 29 such different suspensions excluding 0 turbidity and 0 toc were prepared by varying toc from 0 to 10 mg l 0 2 4 6 8 10 mg l and turbidity from 0 to 20 ntu 0 5 10 15 20 ntu 2 2 coagulant and its characterisation commercial liquid grade high basicity pacl aditya birla chemicals was used to coagulate the sample waters as its ph of minimum solubility is higher than that of low basicity pacl pacl is better suited for highly alkaline waters as it contains more preformed medium polymeric species or alb species 7 the content of al2o3 was 10 2 10 5 weight weight the doses mentioned in this study are in terms of mg al per litre ftir fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer perkin elmer spectrum version 10 4 00 was used to characterise pacl used in this study for the presence of various chemical bonds 14 the infrared spectrum range was 4000 400 cm 1 2 3 jar test experiments a 6 paddle jar test apparatus was used for performing coagulation flocculation experiments the experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 30 c the volume of jar was 1 l the volume of the sample water taken was 500 ml in 1 l jar to avoid spilling while rapid mixing after the addition of pacl rapid mixing was done at 150 rpm for 2 min and slow mixing at 30 rpm for 20 min after that settling was allowed for 30 min after settling the supernatant was pipetted out for further analysis 2 4 analytical methods the efficiency of the process was examined by measuring ph alkalinity toc doc uv254 particle floc size and zeta potential before and after coagulation flocculation all the analyses were performed in triplicates the toc and doc was measured by using a shimadzu toc l analyser the doc was measured after filtering the sample from 0 45 μm by using a syringe filtration assembly 22 23 the uv254 was measured by using a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer using 1 cm path length quartz cuvette 24 turbidity was analysed using nephlometer lutron tu 2016 25 26 the ph was measured by using ph meter hanna hi98130 27 alkalinity was measured by titrimetric method apha 2320 b 28 zeta potential and particle size of the untreated simulated water and the treated supernatant after coagulation was analysed using zetasizer version 7 11 malvern instruments u k 29 the floc size was analysed using a digital image processing facility the floc sizes for the optimised doses were measured after 2 min of rapid mix and 20 min of slow mix using a camera magnus magcam hd series objective lens assembly and magvision software to give images and size distributions 30 31 the detailed methodology of the digital image processing facility to be included in another scope of study in this study floc size distribution for only 4 cases are discussed low toc and low turbidity low toc and high turbidity high toc and low turbidity and high toc and high turbidity 3 results and discussions 3 1 raw water characterisation the alkalinity of the working suspensions was high ranging from 180 to 205 mg l as caco3 the ph of the suspensions varied from 8 14 to 8 45 the zeta potential varied from 7 63 to 18 mv the suva specific uv absorbance values were greater than 4 for all the suspensions the characteristics of untreated test waters are shown in table 1 3 2 characterisation of pacl ftir has been largely used to determine the bonds present in a coagulant fig 1 shows the ftir spectra of pacl used in this study the strong peak at 3346 53 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of oh bonds the group frequency of 3570 3200 cm 1 broad is assigned to the h bonded oh stretch and 3400 3200 cm 1 is assigned to normal polymeric oh stretch the peak at 1633 33 cm 1 is due to the presence of cc or the oh groups in water molecule the group frequency attributed to the cc is 1680 1620 cm 1 thus the significant presence of oh bonds shows the probability of efficient removal by formation of various aluminium hydroxide species 3 3 optimised toc and turbidity removal for optimising the process simultaneously for nom and turbidity removal such optimum doses were selected where the turbidity reduced below 1 ntu and toc reduced to a level beyond which even after increasing the dose no further appreciable reduction in toc was observed the percentage toc removal with increasing doses of pacl are shown in the fig 2 the removal of toc increased with increasing doses and then plateaued in some suspensions and reversed in some at the optimum doses 30 85 toc removal was obtained at doses varying from 4 to 9 mg al l table 2 the removal percentage was lesser for the suspensions having low input toc the frequency of collisions is proportional to the concentration of particles that are subject to interaction for flocculation the kinetic model is usually given in terms of the collision frequency between microflocs and particles between microflocs and microflocs between microflocs and floc particles or between floc particles and floc particles in case of low particle concentration there is reduced collision frequency which might result in low density floc formation which may not be removed efficiently for the input turbidity of 4 mg l there was marginal increase in toc removal as the input turbidity increased for the input toc of 2 mg l the toc removal percentage reduced at first but then increased with further increase in the input turbidity this can be explained by the fact that an input turbidity of 5 ntu might not be enough to improve the collision frequency with such low input toc concentration however a further increase to 10 15 and 20 ntu offered increased particle collision frequency and slightly improved the toc removal by formation of compact flocs the doc removal varied from 30 to 90 at the optimum doses the residual turbidity was well within 1 ntu at optimised doses as shown in table 3 the removal of uv254 varied from 70 to 90 at optimum doses indicating efficient removal of uv absorbing portion of nom it has been reported that the uv absorbing fractions of organic matter are often main contributors to the formation of dbps 32 3 4 residual toc and doc adsorption of dom dissolved organic matter onto metal hydrous oxides is a function of coagulant type dose and ph 14 controlling the ph can result into better dom removal as the dominant mechanism is considered to be charge neutralisation at slightly acidic ph however when the ph is alkaline the residual hydrophilic dom is bound to occur in the treated water as the dominant mechanism is not charge neutralisation it is well known that the hydrophobic fraction is easier to be removed than hydrophilic fraction via coagulation because of its higher charge density 33 36 the complete toc removal was not achieved and some residual remined in the treated water even at optimum doses the residual toc doc and poc particulate organic matter at the optimum doses is shown in fig 3 the residual toc at optimum doses varied between 0 7 2 mg l only twice the residual toc was below 1 mg l 0 749 and 0 992 mg l the residual toc decreased as the dose increased fig 4 a further reduction in toc was difficult even by increasing the doses the residual doc varied from 0 5 to 1 4 mg l which could possibly be due to the unadsorbed dissolved organics this was also supported by the negative zeta potential described in the later section sabir et al 2013 also reported that the rate of dom removal decreased with increasing coagulant dose beyond a certain coagulant dose 14 restabilisation may pose a problem under increased dose of coagulants excess dosages can result in charge reversal and restabilization of colloids thus increasing the residual doc which could be the reason why the increased doses could not improve the doc removal 37 the suva specific uv absorbance values were 2 at optimum doses indicating the removal of hydrophobic portion of nom the smaller size fraction or the hydrophilic fraction of dom could be possibly difficult to remove as the dominant mechanism at alkaline ph is sweep coagulation rather than charge neutralisation it was reported by sharp et al 2006 that one possible explanation for the poor removal is attributed to the fact that at the coagulation ph of normal operation 5 7 the hydrophilic fractions possess a negligible or slightly positive charge 38 3 5 effect of ph alkalinity and coagulant in this study the prime objective was to assess the removal efficiency of nom and particles at alkaline ph by using high basicity pacl the initial ph of the synthetic test waters was on the alkaline side 8 2 the alkalinity of the test waters was as high as 180 205 mg l the ph and alkalinity were measured after coagulation flocculation and a constant decrease was seen in the ph of all the suspensions with the increase in the coagulant dose for all the suspensions and varying doses the ph even after coagulation remained between 7 5 8 the alkalinity after coagulation dropped and remained between 140 190 mg l for various doses fig 5 the ph at optimum doses for all the suspensions varied in close range of 7 65 8 00 table 4 which could be the ph of minimum solubility where the coagulant is converted to solid floc particles and the removal is possibly occurring by sweep mechanism it has been proposed that the humic acid fraction of nom is recalcitrant to removal at high ph 8 5 39 in a study by sabir et al the doc removal by pacl stagnated after reaching 70 at a ph of 8 5 14 as the ph increases above the optimum more negatively charged al species are formed 9 due to which the destabilization potential is highly reduced and thus the small particles will not be able to aggregate into large flocs and thus remain as residuals 40 the removal of nom at higher ph than the minimum solubility of the coagulant is known to occur primarily by bridging and sweep flocculation for high alkaline waters the challenge is to remove doc for which the dominant removal mechanism is charge neutralisation whereas the bulk nom is efficiently removed if commercial coagulants are used even at alkaline ph values the medium polymeric species such as alb species are responsible for charge neutralisation for conventional coagulants these species are formed at slightly acidic ph but for ipfs inorganic polymer flocculants such as pacls the dependence on the ph is lesser and it contains pre formed hydrolysed species which can cause charge neutralisation of the dissolved organics even at alkaline ph however in this study complete charge neutralisation was not achieved it has been reported that the interactions of non preformed species of conventional coagulants with humic acid are weaker as compared to pre formed species of ipfs it has been reported that there is selective binding of pre hydrolysed al species to carboxylic groups at ph 6 and to phenolic moieties at ph 8 41 pacl work efficiently in terms of residual turbidity for slightly higher ph value i e 7 4 instead of 6 9 7 2 for the case of alum resulting to smaller acid consumption for ph correction 42 pacls are less affected by alkalinity than alum particularly those pacls with higher basicity but the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have not been elucidated 11 it was pointed out by jiao et al 2017 that the increase in ph cause high polymeric hydrolysis products to increase and the particles are easily adsorbed and co precipitated thus sweep flocculation is dominant until ph reaches 8 0 after which al oh 4 becomes the main species 43 thus a combination of charge neutralisation by pre formed alb species and adsorption on to the amorphous precipitate appears to be a probable mechanism of removal in this study 3 6 zeta potential studies coagulation is a physico chemical process aiming at reducing the repulsive potential of electrical double layer of colloids thus destabilizing them 44 the zeta potential values can be effectively used to support the mechanism of removal for surface waters the zeta potential is generally on the negative side aquatic humic and fulvic substances which are negatively charged macromolecules can adsorb onto the surfaces of clay and other natural particles further increasing their negative charge 9 after treatment by coagulation the zeta potential becomes less negative and approaches zero at optimum doses and ph the zeta potential varies with the ph so all the parameters affecting ph would influence zeta potential which would further affect the removal in this study the zeta potential at optimum doses varied from 15 53 to 1 3 mv charge neutralisation at slightly acidic ph is known to remove the smallest of dissolved organic particles 2 6 44 however this may not be the case for sweep coagulation at neutral or alkaline ph as very small dissolved particles such as the hydrophilic portion of nom are recalcitrant to removal and appear as residuals thus always some residual toc doc may be there even after treatment by coagulation showing negative zeta potential in water treatment removal of the hydrophobic portion of nom is found to be more strongly related to the zeta potential 23 36 in this study the initial ph before coagulation is on the alkaline side the dividing line between stable and unstable suspensions is generally taken at either 30 mv or 30 mv particles with zeta potentials more positive than 30 mv or more negative than 30 mv are normally considered stable for the various suspensions prepared in this study the zeta potential was determined before and after coagulation for each dose the zeta potential after the coagulation was negative and never reached zero even at optimum doses it has been elucidated in the previous section that the residual toc after the coagulation was significant to result in a negative zeta potential this residual could be the dissolved portion of nom which is difficult to remove by sweep mechanism at alkaline ph the raw water characteristics shows that the suspension with the presence of toc as low as 2 mg l shows a zeta potential of 15 77 mv and the residual toc ranged from 0 7 to 2 mg l which is likely to show a negative zeta potential for all the suspensions the zeta potential of the suspension after coagulation flocculation is shown in the fig 6 it can be seen that the zeta potential before and after the coagulation is less negative than 30 mv which is the diving line between stable and unstable suspensions this shows that after treatment the suspensions are unstable in fact all the values of zeta potential are less negative than 16 mv after coagulation in almost all the cases there is slight increment in the zeta potential which could be due to partial charge neutralisation due to preformed alb species and partial sweep flocculation due to al oh 3 3 7 particle and floc size analysis the particle and floc sizes at various stages of coagulation flocculation process are shown in table 5 the initial particle size of the test waters having high input toc were smaller as compared to the ones having higher input turbidity the particle size of stock kaolin suspension and stock humic acid solution were 2 3 0 54 μm and 0 267 0 06 μm respectively the size of the particles in stock kaolin suspension was relatively larger than the ones in humic acid solution therefore the test waters with high initial turbidity had a greater number of larger sized particles as the test suspensions were a mixture of ha and kaolin the particle size distribution of the resulting suspensions were in between the size of ha and kaolin stock suspensions in case of low initial particle concentration i e case c toc 2 mg l turbidity 5 ntu the floc size is largest for both the stages 2 and 3 i e after rapid mix and slow mix in case of high particle concentration i e case b toc 10 turbidity 20 ntu the floc size is smallest the other two cases a and d having comparable initial particle concentration showed almost similar floc sizes this shows that lower the particle count lower the collision frequency and more scattered elongated and loose flocs are formed higher particle count resulted in more compact and smaller flocs comparing the case a toc 2 turbidity 20 ntu and b toc 10 turbidity 20 ntu having similar turbidity it can be seen that the flocs formed were lesser in size and compact for an initial toc of 10 mg l rather than 2 mg l similar trend is seen if we compare case c and d this shows that presence of ha resulted in smaller size and compactness of flocs the size distribution of residuals in supernatant in case b c and d is less than the average size of stock kaolin suspension and more than the average size stock of ha solution so it could be said that in case b c and d the residual particles are more likely to be residual ha flocs and in case a it could possibly be a combination of kaolin and ha both in the fig 7 the floc images after slow mixing are shown 3 8 adsorption studies the adsorption of ha and kaolin on al species was studied using three isotherms langmuir freundlich and bet isotherms detailed equations and assumptions in appendix a the assumption of langmuir isotherm is a monolayer physical as well as chemical adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent the adsorbent surface is assumed to be homogenous having equal energy and potential for adsorption in table 6 ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbent in mg l a and b are langmuir constant l mg and maximum sorption mg mg qe is the adsorption capacity in mg mg freundlich isotherm assumes heterogenous or rough surface of the adsorbent and multilayer physical as well as chemical adsorption kf is the freundlich affinity coefficient which refers to the adsorption capacity l mg and n dimensionless is the freundlich exponential coefficient and its value can vary when different types of coagulants and ph values are used at various controlled runs bet isotherm is a modified form of langmuir isotherm bet isotherm assumes a multilayer physical adsorption c is the final concentration of adsorbate in the solution at equilibrium mg l cs is the initial or saturation concentration of the adsorbate in the solution mg l qe is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg mg xm is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed to form a complete monolayer mg mg and a is a constant to describe the energy of interaction between the adsorbate and coagulant solid precipitate of metal hydroxide surface in the table 6 value of r2 is highest for bet model amongst the three models that were compared this suggests that the adsorption of nom is dominantly physical and multi layered however the r2 values are not as high indicating prevalence of some other mechanisms too which could be possibly charge neutralisation by preformed alb species or complexation complexation between carboxylic and phenolic groups of ha and metal cations play an important role in coagulation of ha 45 divalent and trivalent metal cations can form a large number of strong intra or inter molecular bonds with ha 17 in ha kaolin water ha can be adsorbed on the surface of kaolin to form ha kaolin complex this ha kaolin complex is removed mainly by charge neutralization and sweeping of coagulants which is supposed to be major coagulation mechanism 46 there is two way possibility of kaolin ha interaction interaction and then adsorption or adsorption of kaolin or ha on amorphous al oh 3 and then interaction with the other species both these cases support the possibility of multi layer adsorption in this study the ph was on the alkaline side which suggests that the dominant mechanism could be sweep coagulation which involves physical adsorption of the impurities conforming to the r2 values obtained by using bet model thus the ha kaolin particles and ha kaolin complexes could have been dominantly removed by sweep mechanism and to a lesser extent by charge neutralisation sweep flocculation is generally thought to give considerably improved particle removal than when particles are destabilised just by charge neutralisation 37 the calculated constant values a b for langmuir isotherms were negative these negative values of langmuir constants indicate that the nom adsorption mechanism was not based on monolayer formation with a homogeneous surface 14 the previous literatures have mainly proposed two coagulation mechanisms to explain the removal of humic substances 1 charge neutralisation precipitation at acidic ph and 2 adsorption and or sweep coagulation in a hydroxide precipitate at alkaline ph 6 9 37 47 48 however some researchers have pointed out that the main nom removal mechanisms generally associated with inorganic polymeric coagulants such as pacls pfcs etc are adsorption entrapment complexation and to a lesser extent charge neutralization 49 50 the importance of electronegativity and thickness of hydration shell of metal cation used as coagulant has also been elucidated by tan et al 2019 they reported that thick hydration shell of metal ion can reduce its binding affinity to ha 17 tan et al 2018 reported that ha can complex with mg 2 and reduce the negative surface charge of silica aerogels in aqueous medium 51 in this study the high alkalinity could be due to presence of carbonates and bicarbonates of magnesium and calcium there is a strong possibility of complexation between the functional groups of ha and mg 2 or ca 2 thereby resulting in bridging and increase in the aggregation of kaolin turbidity which is a type of alumino silicate in the fig 8 a a schematic representation of the simulated ha kaolin water is shown where the ha represents the humic acid molecules k represents the kaolin particles and ha k represents humic acid kaolin complex that are formed as a result of interaction between humic acid and kaolin particles which may occur before or after adsorption on coagulant species in the fig 8 b the speciation of high basicity pacl is shown under alkaline conditions it is probable that the removal of impurities take place either by charge neutralisation by the alb species fig 8 c or adsorption by the al oh 3 species fig 8 d the removal of small negatively charged dissolved organic matter can be attributed to the preformed alb species the doc was not removed completely which shows that charge neutralisation was lesser prevalent than sweep coagulation 4 conclusions in this study various parameters of importance in coagulation such as ph alkalinity zeta potential residual toc and doc were evaluated and correlated to elucidate the possible mechanisms of removal of mixed ha and kaolin suspensions by using high basicity pacl the optimum doses varied from 4 to 9 mg al l the ph at optimised removal remained between 7 65 8 00 which is closer to the minimum solubility of al species indicating dominance of sweep flocculation the concentration of residuals was also evaluated to support the prevalent mechanism the post coagulation zeta potential was negative due to residual toc and doc the zeta potential at optimum doses varied from 15 53 to 1 3 mv indicating that complete charge neutralisation was not achieved at alkaline conditions and some residual remained in each suspension the residual toc and doc varied from 0 7 to 2 mg l and 0 5 to 1 4 mg l respectively the toc removal percentage was lower for low input toc and turbidity which could be attributed to lower frequency of collisions resulting in loose floc formation and consequent inefficient removal of flocs during settling the suva values at the optimum dose were 2 indicating the removal of high molecular weight doc at optimum doses and indicated that the smaller size fraction or the hydrophilic fraction of dom was difficult to remove as the dominant mechanism at alkaline ph appeared to be sweep coagulation rather than charge neutralisation the mechanism of charge neutralisation also becomes difficult at alkaline ph because the ionization of the functional groups of hydrophilic portion of nom happens to a lesser extent at alkaline ph than at acidic ph however the preformed medium polymeric species or the alb species could be responsible for partial charge neutralisation and removal of some fraction of doc for further insight into the mechanism three theoretical adsorption models were compared for r2 values the r2 values of the bet model were highest as compared to langmuir and freundlich model indicating multi layer physisorption further confirming the dominance of sweep coagulation for the removal of ha and kaolin at alkaline ph the high r2 values for bet isotherm also supported the interactions that might have taken place between ha and kaolin resulting in multilayer formation the floc size data revealed that higher particle concentration of both kaolin and ha resulted in smaller and more compact floc formation and lower particle concentration led to formation of elongated loose and bigger flocs it can be concluded that at alkaline ph concentration of both nom and mineral turbidity has an important role to play for the interaction of particles with coagulant and floc formation for efficient settling appendix a isotherms 1 langmuir isotherm the assumption of langmuir isotherm is a monolayer physical as well as chemical adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent the adsorbent surface is assumed to be homogenous having equal energy and potential for adsorption all vacant sites are homogenous having equal size and shape and have equal affinity for adsorbate one

14358,the purpose of this work is to purify wastewater from industrial laundries and return them to the washing process by means of the methods of electrocoagulation and electroflotation laboratory and pilot studies on the wastewater treatment were carried out using aluminium electrodes the process of wastewater treatment has been studied in dependence on treatment time temperature ph and current density the effectiveness of the cleaning process under different values of operating parameters of the reactor was estimated as the percentage of color turbidity and surfactant removal from the wastewater as a result of laboratory studies the optimum values of the operating parameters of the reactor at 90 removal of contamination were the following current density value as 5 26 ma cm2 ph as 5 5 and 5 min processing time the consumption of electrical energy in this case amounted to 1 25 kw h m3 the quality control of the purified water was carried out according to such additional parameters as total suspended solids chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon and the content of metal ions and phosphate and nitrate anions in the water the study of the wastewater treatment in a pilot plant with laboratory values of operating parameters showed the reproducibility of the purification results for the controlled parameters of water quality and suitability of the water for reuse the washing performed with purified water was estimated by the whiteness index for bed linen and was not inferior to the traditional washing with water from a source of water supply keywords laundry wasterwater electrocoagulation electroflotation 1 introduction the widespread use of synthetic surfactants ss as washing stabilizing and foaming agents determines their presence in most types of industrial and domestic wastewater the recent studies show a significant effect of synthetic surfactants on all living organisms plants and humans 1 2 when interacting with other contaminants surfactants contribute to the emulsification and stabilization of liquid and solid dispersed types of contaminants therefore wastewater containing ss are characterized by a complex chemical and phase dispersed composition which makes it possible to treat them as a special type of sewage 3 7 the analysis of existing technological solutions shows that the creation of circulating water supply systems in industrial enterprises is quite a difficult but solvable task at the same time the creation of closed cycle of water consumption can be hampered only by economic reasons the choice of purification technology is being carried out based on the specific operating conditions and features of the cleaning equipment the main criteria that ensure the selection of an appropriate cleaning method should be sufficient wastewater treatment wwt efficiency as well as low operational cost of the cleaning equipment its simplicity and reliability this article discusses the electrocoagulation ec and electroflotation ef as methods that can be applied to the treatment of wastewater from industrial laundries with the purpose of their reuse combined use of these methods has shown their efficiency and cost effectiveness in solving various problems related to the environment protection 8 13 over the past 20 years there is no such industry whose model wastewater would not have been investigated in the laboratories by electrochemical methods in general and by ec in particular there was an attempt to treat and reuse laundry wastewater lww by taking various configurations of hybrid systems based on the biological treatment followed by oxidation and membrane separation 14 18 it should be noted that processes of the surfactants oxidation can be accompanied by the release of more toxic products of destruction it is shown that the photo fenton process proved to be toxicologically safe in comparison with the initial solution 19 removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds from model solutions of wastewater by ec and peroxy electrocoagulation with the help of iron electrodes can be found in 20 23 the purpose of this work is to study the effectiveness of the wwt in one of the industrial type laundries alone with the possibility of the purified wastewater reuse in this connection the influence on the process of wwt of such working parameters as types of electrodes connection applied voltage amount of electricity temperature and ph of the solution together with the nature of the surfactant was considered additionally the energy efficiency of the surface active substances removal was calculated for the ec reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedure recently methods of electrochemical wwt are being increasingly used in recycling water supply processes 24 the methods are characterized by technological simplicity and the process continuity additional chemical reagents are not introduced into the solutions but obtained directly in the electrochemical bath that ensures the ecological safety of the water purification processes 25 29 the process is similar to the treatment of water with appropriate reagents however during ec water is not enriched with sulfates or chlorides the content of which is limited by discharging treated sewage into reservoirs or in circulating systems currently there are various designs of electrocoagulators 8 24 in the present study a plate electrode reactor was used as known plate electrodes are a block of plates arranged perpendicularly and separated by washers in such a way that a gap exists between adjacent plates where the flow of the solution happens in the direction perpendicular to the direction the electric current flows for different ph the electrolysis of wastewater at the anode and cathode proceeds differently the presence of cl anions in water leads to the release and formation of clo anions due to the release of gaseous hydrogen flotation of solid particles including hydroxides of iron and aluminum occurs the main limiting stage of electrocoagulation is the formation of metal cations the second stage of coagulation is reduced to chemical hydration of the resulting metal cations formation of insoluble metal hydroxides and their precipitation crystallization followed by the formation of flakes which can adsorb coarse impurities of the wastewater the process of coagulation in the electrocoagulators proceeds much more intensively than with chemical reagents this can be explained by positive influence of electrophoresis on the mutual coarsening of the nuclei of the metal hydroxide particles and by that the water is being mixed by hydrogen bubbles released at the surface of cathodes the use of ec can reduce the metal doses required for the purification by 20 40 compared with the doses of chemical reagents although al oh 3 produced as the result of anodic aluminum dissolution is thought more active as to the coagulation of pollutants in wastewater the aluminum anodes passivation together with impermeable film formed on cathodes may interfere with the performance of electrocoagulation and electroflotation 30 optimization of the lww treatment relative to such parameters as time ph of the solution and current density was carried out in a stationary mode on a separate ec reactor completely identical to that shown in fig 1 it should be emphasized that in the ec along with the coagulation process flotation occurs the data obtained in stationary mode were applied for the continuous batch mode the hydraulic retention time of the lww in the ec was regulated by the rate at which it entered the reactor and controlled using a flow meter after treatment in the ec water flows by gravity into the ef for additional purification of the remaining dispersed phase the volume of the ef is twice as large as of the ec that doubles the flotation time the continuous batch mode is schematically shown in fig 1 in the ec reactor 7 electrodes including 4 anodes and 3 cathodes were used the system mainly includes ec 2 and ef 4 reactors with a volume of 1 5 dm3 and 3 0 dm3 respectively the aluminum еlectrodes are connected with the source of direct current dc 1 the electrodes part of the ef consists of graphite anode and cathode in the form of a steel mesh with dc source 8 the dimensions of the al electrode are 150 mm 150 mm 2 mm the effective area of all the anodes on both sides is 350 cm2 and the distance between electrodes is 10 mm the ef consists of an outer cylinder reactor with a diameter of 15 сm the lww intended for purification is supplied to the system from storage tank 9 the lww enters the ec reactor through the pipe 5 from the bottom and move upward between the electrodes 2 the wastewater in the ec reactor unit 2 is stirred at 250 rpm by a magnetic stirrer 6 it enters the ef chamber from above and move downward in the opposite direction to the evolving bubbles of gaseous hydrogen thus the formed flocks flotate and adsorb the contaminated particles purified wastewater is removed from the bottom 7 of the ef and the flotation contaminants are removed from the top of it 3 the lww collected from eczacibasi professional company was used for all experimental tests main parameters characterizing the lww taken during the three months period are presented in table 1 2 2 analytical method all chemicals used for this study were obtained from sigma aldrich anionic surfactants methylene blue active substances mbas and other parameters of wastewater were measured according to standard methods 31 32 turbidity was recorded on a 2100 n is turbidimeter hach before the ec the ph of the lww was corrected by the addition of hcl and naoh and its measurement was performed on a thermoscientific ph meter orion star a215 parameters characterizing the wastewater obtained are close by value to the data of the three months monitoring of lww all the experiments were repeated twice to check if the results are reproducible the maximum experimental error was lower than 5 and the average values have been reported each measurement was repeated for three times and the average value was calculated the mbas toc and or cod removal efficiency re is calculated as 1 re ci cj ci x 100 where ci mg l is initial mbas toc or cod concentration and cj is the corresponding final concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the ec reactor the effect of different factors such as current density the amount of electricity and operation time on the temperature of the wastewater was investigated in the laboratory scale studies theoretical and experimental assessment of the electrodes consumption was carried out and ph colort turbidity suspended solids and mbas were analyzed preliminarily the electrodes were cleaned degreased dried and brought to a constant weight electrochemical dissolution of anodes for each amount of electricity passed through the solution was estimated as the loss of the electrode weight fig 2 shows the results of aluminum yield for two different electrode connections in an electrochemical reactor as independent parameter the quantity of electricity q a h which has passed through the solution is taken as can be seen from fig 2 with the increase in the amount of electricity the amount of the formed aluminum increases as well at the initial stage of the solution treatment the yield of al3 does not depend essentially on the connection mode of the electrodes thus for q 1 a h the yield of al3 is 0 45 g for the monopolar connection and 0 37 g for bipolar connection for q 5 a h the yield was 1 73 g for the bipolar electrode connection the corresponding value of the al3 yield is 1 65 g a h 5 for all types of connections the electrodes area is same but difference in their polarization results in different volumes of generated ions of al3 monopolar electrodes have characteristics of low voltage and high current while bipolar electrodes are characterized by high voltage and low current when comparing the influence of the monopolar and bipolar connection of aluminum electrodes on the lww purification it was stated 33 that at ph 5 2 the removal of cod was 62 for monopolar and 7 for bipolar junction of electrodes the authors do not discuss at what values of current density these results are obtained in 34 the conclusion was made about a more efficient cleaning of the lww in the case of bipolar connection of electrodes 3 2 the effect of solution temperature on the yield of al3 ions taking into account the fact that the monopolar connection of the electrodes gives the best results further laboratory investigations were carried out with this configuration of the electrodes the next step in the process optimization was to investigate the effect of the electrolyte temperature in the reactor on the process of the al3 ions production this is important from the point of view that the wastewater entering the electrochemical treatment has a temperature of 30 35 c the dependence of the yield of al3 on the temperature of the treated wastewater is shown for three different values of cd in fig 3 as it can be seen from fig 3 a positive effect of the temperature growth which is important for industrial laundries is observed only before reaching a certain temperature maximum 60 80 c further increase in temperature reduces the yield of the metal this is due to the increasing intensity of the passivation of the aluminum anode for the account of the compaction and swelling of the colloidal aluminum hydroxide in its micropores the increase in the cd values from 1 5 up to 3 0 ma cm2 at the given temperature leads also to an increase in the yield of al3 as can be seen from fig 3 the metal yield is much greater than theoretical values calculated from the faraday law this is primarily related to the fact that electrochemical dissolution of metals involves anodic dissolution due to external electric current and chemical dissolution of anodes and cathodes therefore in practice the yield of metals by electric current can be greater than theoretical values calculated from the faraday formula and can reach 110 125 of the theoretical yield at ph in the range of 5 7 up to 90 of the aluminum anodes are dissolved as the result of the electrochemical process in addition about 10 of the metal dissolves chemically at the same time 3 3 the effect of processing time on the removal of surfactants color and turbidity of the solution the time of the solution treatment is an important characteristic in the studies of the wastewater treatment at industrial enterprises as follows from a number of experimental works 20 33 35 the processing time for cleaning the lww depends on many parameters primarily it depends on the concentration of surfactants cd in the electrolytic cell temperature ph and a number of other parameters as the analysis of these works shows the processing time can vary from 3 to 30 min for example for aluminum electrodes the most optimal processing time at low ph values 4 8 and current density within 4 6 ma cm2 is 5 10 minutes 35 in 34 for the 90 removal of cod and turbidity with the help of bipolar electrodes the processing time was 20 min while for the removal of surfactants and color it was 50 min in fig 4 the results of the surfactants removal from solutions by ec are shown in dependence with the time of processing as follows from the graphs presented in fig 4 within a minimum period of the solution processing time t 1 min the percentage of the surfactants removal is negligible and amounts to 30 40 increase in the treatment time up to 3 min results in a significantly greater surfactant removal for anionic surfactants this value reaches a value of 71 and does not significantly change after more than 7 min of processing the values of cationic and non ionic removal of surfactants for the 3 minute processing reach 89 and 83 respectively and after 5 min the indices grow up to 93 and 91 further increase in the processing time for these two surfactants does not affect the percentage of removal similarly behave such characteristics as color and turbidity their changes as depending on the time of treatment of the solution are shown in fig 5 optimal values of the processing time needed for the removal of turbidity and color can be considered as 5 and 7 min respectively 3 4 the effect of current density on the removal of surfactants color and turbidity as it was mentioned before the process of coagulation in electrocoagulators proceeds much more intensively than reagent coagulation for this study three different surfactants namely cationic anionic and non ionic were taken the dependence between efficiency of the surfactant removal and cd is presented in fig 6 as we can see from the fig 6 the cd increase leads to a greater percentage of the surfactant removal at low values of cd 1 ma cm2 the surfactants removal achieved is in the range of 23 40 of the initial concentration for cationic surfactants a maximum removal 93 is achieved with cd 5 26 ma cm2 for two other surfactants and for the given cd the surfactants removal takes values close to 80 further increase in cd 7 89 ma cm2 for anionic and nonionic surfactants leads to the more effective removal of surfactants within 90 95 as well alone with the removal of surfactants a process of discoloration and removal of the turbidity of wastewater is under way fig 7 presents the results of the effect of cd on the removal of color and turbidity of the solution for cd 1 ma cm2 color removal was 45 and turbidity removal was 53 the increase in cd up to 2 63 ma cm2 leads to a sharp increase in the percentage of color 87 and turbidity 92 removal the maximum turbidity removal 99 is achieved with cd 5 26 ma cm2 when cd 7 89 ma cm2 the maximum percent of color removal is achieved 98 introduction of the surfactants into the solution reduces the rate of the anode dissolution as noted in a number of studies 33 36 37 passivation of both the anode and cathode is a serious disadvantage when using electrocoagulation which leads to a decrease in the rate of dissolution of the anodes a slight dissolution of the anode is observed for anionic surfactants this may be due to greater passivation of the surface of the electrodes in the case of the superimposed potential the motion of negatively charged particles of surfactant to the anode can lead to the formation of stable complex particles on the surface of the electrode and reduction of its effective surface this in turn leads to a slower dissolution of the anode as can be seen the factors such as temperature and cd affect the efficient operation of the anode in the above mentioned works 20 33 35 on cleaning the lww using ec al electrodes for the ph range of 3 9 and processing time of 5 20 minutes the effective cd ranges from 3 to 6 ma cm2 3 5 the influence of the ph on the removal of surfactants color and turbidity the ph of the solution along with processing time and cd is an important parameter for conducting electrochemical reactions in aqueous media in fig 8 the influence of ph values of the medium on the removal of surfactants in the electrochemical reactor is presented for such low ph values as 4 the surfactants removal is achieved within 55 65 of the initial concentration of mbas the percentage of the surfactants removal changes in the following way for ph 4 5 there is a sharp increase 73 84 in average for anionic surfactants a maximum of 93 is achieved at ph 5 5 for two other surfactants a certain decrease is observed and a maximum is achieved at ph 7 5 further increase in ph does not lead to any changes in the percentage a similar study of the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of surfactants in the lww is given in 20 so under laboratory conditions with the use of flat aluminum electrodes at ph 3 cd 3 13 ma cm2 the removal of sds was 95 the effect of the bipolar design of aluminum electrodes on the mbas and turbidity removal process in dependence with the ph of the lww is presented in 35 while maintaining ph of 5 and the treatment time of 5 min the removal efficiency of mbas and turbidity was 97 and 98 respectively this suggests that even at low ph values high removal of mbas can be achieved the change in color and turbidity as a function of the ph of the solution is shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the data in fig 9 at a low ph percentage of removal was 65 for color and 75 for turbidity the increase of ph to 5 5 or higher leads to a complete removal of the turbidity in the solution and to the 90 removal of color it should be noted that the increase in ph values 9 11 leads to the decrease in the degree of removal of surfactants color and turbidity the percentage of removal takes values of 65 54 and 58 for mbas color and turbidity correspondingly the observed effect of ph can be explained by the presence of various hydrated forms of aluminum in the solution as shown in 38 in the ph range of 5 8 the hydrolysis and polymerization of al3 leads to the formation of particles al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al oh 3 and of highly charged polymeric hydroxo complexes al13 oh 32 7 which are effective for coagulation when ph is greater than 10 the main hydrolysis product is al oh 4 which does not favor the formation of anodized aluminum species and the adsorption of dispersed solids at low ph 4 5 where one has only aluminum ions the adsorption effect is insignificant electrical energy consumption eec is the index of the effectiveness for the ec ef processes this important parameter is obtained from the following equation 8 2 weec u v i a t s φ m3 3600 s h 103 w kw where weec is electrical energy kwh m3 u is the cell voltage volt i is current in ampere a t is electrochemical process time sec and φ is the volume of the treated solution to calculate eec those indices were taken as initial parameters at which the 90 removal of surfactant color and turbidity of wastewater had been achieved calculations show that for these three characteristics of the lww the average value of w is equal to 1 25 kw h m3 parameter wееc that is close to our parameters of the ec reactor cd and ph takes the value of 3 68 kw h m3 in 20 the increased wееc value is associated with more than three times growth of time for processing the lww thus in the light of the conducted research it is possible to determine basic optimal conditions for the electrochemical purification of lww as a general criterion for the parameters comparison their 90 removal from the lww was taken for lww taken immediately after the washing process they will be as follows ph is 5 5 cd is 5 26 ma cm2 the treatment time of lww is 5 min these parameters were taken as operating parameters for the pilot plant in conclusion we present the results of the lww purification for the ec ef process see table 1 optimal experimental conditions as seen from the experimental results the values of such parameters as tss cod and toc indicate a significant removal of pollutants from lww the concentrations of phosphate nitrogen and sulfate anions in wastewater are significantly reduced as well 3 6 pilot scale field tests based on the results of laboratory studies of lww a pilot ec plant with a volume of 0 5 m3 h was manufactured twenty aluminum electrodes the area of each was 0 12 m2 with an interelectrode distance of 15 mm were connected in the monopolar manner to prevent the passivation of the electrodes and the formation of sediment on their surface their polarity was changing every 20 min the installation was mounted in the laundry room of a hotel the purpose of the research was to study the process of purification and reuse of lww immediately in an industrial environment the equipment consisted of a lww storage tank a reactor a power source power 50 v 50a the foam collector with sludge flotation and a separator fig 10 shows the scheme of the pilot unit for cleaning lww as it can be seen it consists of an ec ef reactor 1 into which lww is fed via the line 7 the operation of the reactor begins with the supply of electrolyte through the line 8 using the pump 2 the upper part of the reactor provides the output of gases 6 the withdrawal of flotation sludge into the collector 5 along the line 9 and the discharge of purified water through the line 10 into the tank 3 after filtration 4 purified water is fed through the line 11 for reuse after the foam destruction and the solid fraction separation the remaining water returns to the ec reactor for re treatment and purification thus approximately 90 95 of wastewater is returned for reuse table 2 shows the test results for the pilot plant as can be seen from the table satisfactory results are observed for the main parameters of the water quality assessment that allows the water reuse they are standard parameters used in industrial laundries see table 1 the exception is low content of the mbas however their presence allows you to save washing powder for the next wash cycle for example the percentage of turbidity removal during 7 minutes treatment for ph 5 5 is 90 95 color removal is 75 80 and the removal of mbas is 80 85 of the initial concentration as to the other parameters listed in table 1 and characterizing the quality of the purified water they also have a high percentage it should be noted that the washing performed with purified water and water from a water supply source traditional washing did not differ in quality this suggests that it is possible in principle to use treated wastewater in repeated washes and to obtain both economic benefits and an ecologic effect unfortunately it is not yet possible to compare the results of the electrochemical approach to the lww cleaning and re use with other works there is a study 3 in the literature where on the basis of physico chemical pre treatment and different levels of filtration and ultrafiltration the issue of returning water to reuse is solved in terms of the washing quality the results of the second washing based on the purified water do not differ from those for the original water in our case the quality of purified water taken for reuse was checked out on bed linen whiteness measurements were made using a portable device konica minolta cr 20 color reader when using primary water the whiteness index w was 100 8 and for purified water cycles 1 5 the index was changing within 101 4 102 3 the results of the measurements suggest that the lww purified using the ec ef method is quite suitable for reuse in the washing process 4 conclusion the process of the wastewater of industrial laundries treatment done by the method of electrocoagulation has been studied as the result of laboratory studies and the use of a pilot plant the data on the efficiency of removal of surfactants color turbidity depending on parameters such as ph current density processing time and temperature of waste water were obtained it was shown that a content of surfactants in the lww slightly reduces the amount of the coagulant al3 when the anode is dissolved the treatment time of the solution is an important characteristic of the electrocoagulation process since it is directly related to the amount of the coagulant generated the percentage of the surfactant color and turbidity removal is insignificant at the initial stage of the lww treatment t 1 min and it is 30 40 for surfactant and 60 and 70 for turbidity and color respectively the increase in processing time leads to an increase in the percentage of removal and the value of 5 min is taken as optimal and more economical from the point of view of energy consumption the increase in current density cd and processing time leads to an increase in the percentage of the surfactant color and turbidity removal for the solution processing time of 5 min a cd value of 5 26 ma cm2 is taken as optimal the study of the effect of the ph value on the removal of surfactants of color and turbidity has shown that at low ph values ph 4 the percentage of removal for these components of the lww is less than 75 to achieve the 90

14358,the purpose of this work is to purify wastewater from industrial laundries and return them to the washing process by means of the methods of electrocoagulation and electroflotation laboratory and pilot studies on the wastewater treatment were carried out using aluminium electrodes the process of wastewater treatment has been studied in dependence on treatment time temperature ph and current density the effectiveness of the cleaning process under different values of operating parameters of the reactor was estimated as the percentage of color turbidity and surfactant removal from the wastewater as a result of laboratory studies the optimum values of the operating parameters of the reactor at 90 removal of contamination were the following current density value as 5 26 ma cm2 ph as 5 5 and 5 min processing time the consumption of electrical energy in this case amounted to 1 25 kw h m3 the quality control of the purified water was carried out according to such additional parameters as total suspended solids chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon and the content of metal ions and phosphate and nitrate anions in the water the study of the wastewater treatment in a pilot plant with laboratory values of operating parameters showed the reproducibility of the purification results for the controlled parameters of water quality and suitability of the water for reuse the washing performed with purified water was estimated by the whiteness index for bed linen and was not inferior to the traditional washing with water from a source of water supply keywords laundry wasterwater electrocoagulation electroflotation 1 introduction the widespread use of synthetic surfactants ss as washing stabilizing and foaming agents determines their presence in most types of industrial and domestic wastewater the recent studies show a significant effect of synthetic surfactants on all living organisms plants and humans 1 2 when interacting with other contaminants surfactants contribute to the emulsification and stabilization of liquid and solid dispersed types of contaminants therefore wastewater containing ss are characterized by a complex chemical and phase dispersed composition which makes it possible to treat them as a special type of sewage 3 7 the analysis of existing technological solutions shows that the creation of circulating water supply systems in industrial enterprises is quite a difficult but solvable task at the same time the creation of closed cycle of water consumption can be hampered only by economic reasons the choice of purification technology is being carried out based on the specific operating conditions and features of the cleaning equipment the main criteria that ensure the selection of an appropriate cleaning method should be sufficient wastewater treatment wwt efficiency as well as low operational cost of the cleaning equipment its simplicity and reliability this article discusses the electrocoagulation ec and electroflotation ef as methods that can be applied to the treatment of wastewater from industrial laundries with the purpose of their reuse combined use of these methods has shown their efficiency and cost effectiveness in solving various problems related to the environment protection 8 13 over the past 20 years there is no such industry whose model wastewater would not have been investigated in the laboratories by electrochemical methods in general and by ec in particular there was an attempt to treat and reuse laundry wastewater lww by taking various configurations of hybrid systems based on the biological treatment followed by oxidation and membrane separation 14 18 it should be noted that processes of the surfactants oxidation can be accompanied by the release of more toxic products of destruction it is shown that the photo fenton process proved to be toxicologically safe in comparison with the initial solution 19 removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds from model solutions of wastewater by ec and peroxy electrocoagulation with the help of iron electrodes can be found in 20 23 the purpose of this work is to study the effectiveness of the wwt in one of the industrial type laundries alone with the possibility of the purified wastewater reuse in this connection the influence on the process of wwt of such working parameters as types of electrodes connection applied voltage amount of electricity temperature and ph of the solution together with the nature of the surfactant was considered additionally the energy efficiency of the surface active substances removal was calculated for the ec reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedure recently methods of electrochemical wwt are being increasingly used in recycling water supply processes 24 the methods are characterized by technological simplicity and the process continuity additional chemical reagents are not introduced into the solutions but obtained directly in the electrochemical bath that ensures the ecological safety of the water purification processes 25 29 the process is similar to the treatment of water with appropriate reagents however during ec water is not enriched with sulfates or chlorides the content of which is limited by discharging treated sewage into reservoirs or in circulating systems currently there are various designs of electrocoagulators 8 24 in the present study a plate electrode reactor was used as known plate electrodes are a block of plates arranged perpendicularly and separated by washers in such a way that a gap exists between adjacent plates where the flow of the solution happens in the direction perpendicular to the direction the electric current flows for different ph the electrolysis of wastewater at the anode and cathode proceeds differently the presence of cl anions in water leads to the release and formation of clo anions due to the release of gaseous hydrogen flotation of solid particles including hydroxides of iron and aluminum occurs the main limiting stage of electrocoagulation is the formation of metal cations the second stage of coagulation is reduced to chemical hydration of the resulting metal cations formation of insoluble metal hydroxides and their precipitation crystallization followed by the formation of flakes which can adsorb coarse impurities of the wastewater the process of coagulation in the electrocoagulators proceeds much more intensively than with chemical reagents this can be explained by positive influence of electrophoresis on the mutual coarsening of the nuclei of the metal hydroxide particles and by that the water is being mixed by hydrogen bubbles released at the surface of cathodes the use of ec can reduce the metal doses required for the purification by 20 40 compared with the doses of chemical reagents although al oh 3 produced as the result of anodic aluminum dissolution is thought more active as to the coagulation of pollutants in wastewater the aluminum anodes passivation together with impermeable film formed on cathodes may interfere with the performance of electrocoagulation and electroflotation 30 optimization of the lww treatment relative to such parameters as time ph of the solution and current density was carried out in a stationary mode on a separate ec reactor completely identical to that shown in fig 1 it should be emphasized that in the ec along with the coagulation process flotation occurs the data obtained in stationary mode were applied for the continuous batch mode the hydraulic retention time of the lww in the ec was regulated by the rate at which it entered the reactor and controlled using a flow meter after treatment in the ec water flows by gravity into the ef for additional purification of the remaining dispersed phase the volume of the ef is twice as large as of the ec that doubles the flotation time the continuous batch mode is schematically shown in fig 1 in the ec reactor 7 electrodes including 4 anodes and 3 cathodes were used the system mainly includes ec 2 and ef 4 reactors with a volume of 1 5 dm3 and 3 0 dm3 respectively the aluminum еlectrodes are connected with the source of direct current dc 1 the electrodes part of the ef consists of graphite anode and cathode in the form of a steel mesh with dc source 8 the dimensions of the al electrode are 150 mm 150 mm 2 mm the effective area of all the anodes on both sides is 350 cm2 and the distance between electrodes is 10 mm the ef consists of an outer cylinder reactor with a diameter of 15 сm the lww intended for purification is supplied to the system from storage tank 9 the lww enters the ec reactor through the pipe 5 from the bottom and move upward between the electrodes 2 the wastewater in the ec reactor unit 2 is stirred at 250 rpm by a magnetic stirrer 6 it enters the ef chamber from above and move downward in the opposite direction to the evolving bubbles of gaseous hydrogen thus the formed flocks flotate and adsorb the contaminated particles purified wastewater is removed from the bottom 7 of the ef and the flotation contaminants are removed from the top of it 3 the lww collected from eczacibasi professional company was used for all experimental tests main parameters characterizing the lww taken during the three months period are presented in table 1 2 2 analytical method all chemicals used for this study were obtained from sigma aldrich anionic surfactants methylene blue active substances mbas and other parameters of wastewater were measured according to standard methods 31 32 turbidity was recorded on a 2100 n is turbidimeter hach before the ec the ph of the lww was corrected by the addition of hcl and naoh and its measurement was performed on a thermoscientific ph meter orion star a215 parameters characterizing the wastewater obtained are close by value to the data of the three months monitoring of lww all the experiments were repeated twice to check if the results are reproducible the maximum experimental error was lower than 5 and the average values have been reported each measurement was repeated for three times and the average value was calculated the mbas toc and or cod removal efficiency re is calculated as 1 re ci cj ci x 100 where ci mg l is initial mbas toc or cod concentration and cj is the corresponding final concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the ec reactor the effect of different factors such as current density the amount of electricity and operation time on the temperature of the wastewater was investigated in the laboratory scale studies theoretical and experimental assessment of the electrodes consumption was carried out and ph colort turbidity suspended solids and mbas were analyzed preliminarily the electrodes were cleaned degreased dried and brought to a constant weight electrochemical dissolution of anodes for each amount of electricity passed through the solution was estimated as the loss of the electrode weight fig 2 shows the results of aluminum yield for two different electrode connections in an electrochemical reactor as independent parameter the quantity of electricity q a h which has passed through the solution is taken as can be seen from fig 2 with the increase in the amount of electricity the amount of the formed aluminum increases as well at the initial stage of the solution treatment the yield of al3 does not depend essentially on the connection mode of the electrodes thus for q 1 a h the yield of al3 is 0 45 g for the monopolar connection and 0 37 g for bipolar connection for q 5 a h the yield was 1 73 g for the bipolar electrode connection the corresponding value of the al3 yield is 1 65 g a h 5 for all types of connections the electrodes area is same but difference in their polarization results in different volumes of generated ions of al3 monopolar electrodes have characteristics of low voltage and high current while bipolar electrodes are characterized by high voltage and low current when comparing the influence of the monopolar and bipolar connection of aluminum electrodes on the lww purification it was stated 33 that at ph 5 2 the removal of cod was 62 for monopolar and 7 for bipolar junction of electrodes the authors do not discuss at what values of current density these results are obtained in 34 the conclusion was made about a more efficient cleaning of the lww in the case of bipolar connection of electrodes 3 2 the effect of solution temperature on the yield of al3 ions taking into account the fact that the monopolar connection of the electrodes gives the best results further laboratory investigations were carried out with this configuration of the electrodes the next step in the process optimization was to investigate the effect of the electrolyte temperature in the reactor on the process of the al3 ions production this is important from the point of view that the wastewater entering the electrochemical treatment has a temperature of 30 35 c the dependence of the yield of al3 on the temperature of the treated wastewater is shown for three different values of cd in fig 3 as it can be seen from fig 3 a positive effect of the temperature growth which is important for industrial laundries is observed only before reaching a certain temperature maximum 60 80 c further increase in temperature reduces the yield of the metal this is due to the increasing intensity of the passivation of the aluminum anode for the account of the compaction and swelling of the colloidal aluminum hydroxide in its micropores the increase in the cd values from 1 5 up to 3 0 ma cm2 at the given temperature leads also to an increase in the yield of al3 as can be seen from fig 3 the metal yield is much greater than theoretical values calculated from the faraday law this is primarily related to the fact that electrochemical dissolution of metals involves anodic dissolution due to external electric current and chemical dissolution of anodes and cathodes therefore in practice the yield of metals by electric current can be greater than theoretical values calculated from the faraday formula and can reach 110 125 of the theoretical yield at ph in the range of 5 7 up to 90 of the aluminum anodes are dissolved as the result of the electrochemical process in addition about 10 of the metal dissolves chemically at the same time 3 3 the effect of processing time on the removal of surfactants color and turbidity of the solution the time of the solution treatment is an important characteristic in the studies of the wastewater treatment at industrial enterprises as follows from a number of experimental works 20 33 35 the processing time for cleaning the lww depends on many parameters primarily it depends on the concentration of surfactants cd in the electrolytic cell temperature ph and a number of other parameters as the analysis of these works shows the processing time can vary from 3 to 30 min for example for aluminum electrodes the most optimal processing time at low ph values 4 8 and current density within 4 6 ma cm2 is 5 10 minutes 35 in 34 for the 90 removal of cod and turbidity with the help of bipolar electrodes the processing time was 20 min while for the removal of surfactants and color it was 50 min in fig 4 the results of the surfactants removal from solutions by ec are shown in dependence with the time of processing as follows from the graphs presented in fig 4 within a minimum period of the solution processing time t 1 min the percentage of the surfactants removal is negligible and amounts to 30 40 increase in the treatment time up to 3 min results in a significantly greater surfactant removal for anionic surfactants this value reaches a value of 71 and does not significantly change after more than 7 min of processing the values of cationic and non ionic removal of surfactants for the 3 minute processing reach 89 and 83 respectively and after 5 min the indices grow up to 93 and 91 further increase in the processing time for these two surfactants does not affect the percentage of removal similarly behave such characteristics as color and turbidity their changes as depending on the time of treatment of the solution are shown in fig 5 optimal values of the processing time needed for the removal of turbidity and color can be considered as 5 and 7 min respectively 3 4 the effect of current density on the removal of surfactants color and turbidity as it was mentioned before the process of coagulation in electrocoagulators proceeds much more intensively than reagent coagulation for this study three different surfactants namely cationic anionic and non ionic were taken the dependence between efficiency of the surfactant removal and cd is presented in fig 6 as we can see from the fig 6 the cd increase leads to a greater percentage of the surfactant removal at low values of cd 1 ma cm2 the surfactants removal achieved is in the range of 23 40 of the initial concentration for cationic surfactants a maximum removal 93 is achieved with cd 5 26 ma cm2 for two other surfactants and for the given cd the surfactants removal takes values close to 80 further increase in cd 7 89 ma cm2 for anionic and nonionic surfactants leads to the more effective removal of surfactants within 90 95 as well alone with the removal of surfactants a process of discoloration and removal of the turbidity of wastewater is under way fig 7 presents the results of the effect of cd on the removal of color and turbidity of the solution for cd 1 ma cm2 color removal was 45 and turbidity removal was 53 the increase in cd up to 2 63 ma cm2 leads to a sharp increase in the percentage of color 87 and turbidity 92 removal the maximum turbidity removal 99 is achieved with cd 5 26 ma cm2 when cd 7 89 ma cm2 the maximum percent of color removal is achieved 98 introduction of the surfactants into the solution reduces the rate of the anode dissolution as noted in a number of studies 33 36 37 passivation of both the anode and cathode is a serious disadvantage when using electrocoagulation which leads to a decrease in the rate of dissolution of the anodes a slight dissolution of the anode is observed for anionic surfactants this may be due to greater passivation of the surface of the electrodes in the case of the superimposed potential the motion of negatively charged particles of surfactant to the anode can lead to the formation of stable complex particles on the surface of the electrode and reduction of its effective surface this in turn leads to a slower dissolution of the anode as can be seen the factors such as temperature and cd affect the efficient operation of the anode in the above mentioned works 20 33 35 on cleaning the lww using ec al electrodes for the ph range of 3 9 and processing time of 5 20 minutes the effective cd ranges from 3 to 6 ma cm2 3 5 the influence of the ph on the removal of surfactants color and turbidity the ph of the solution along with processing time and cd is an important parameter for conducting electrochemical reactions in aqueous media in fig 8 the influence of ph values of the medium on the removal of surfactants in the electrochemical reactor is presented for such low ph values as 4 the surfactants removal is achieved within 55 65 of the initial concentration of mbas the percentage of the surfactants removal changes in the following way for ph 4 5 there is a sharp increase 73 84 in average for anionic surfactants a maximum of 93 is achieved at ph 5 5 for two other surfactants a certain decrease is observed and a maximum is achieved at ph 7 5 further increase in ph does not lead to any changes in the percentage a similar study of the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of surfactants in the lww is given in 20 so under laboratory conditions with the use of flat aluminum electrodes at ph 3 cd 3 13 ma cm2 the removal of sds was 95 the effect of the bipolar design of aluminum electrodes on the mbas and turbidity removal process in dependence with the ph of the lww is presented in 35 while maintaining ph of 5 and the treatment time of 5 min the removal efficiency of mbas and turbidity was 97 and 98 respectively this suggests that even at low ph values high removal of mbas can be achieved the change in color and turbidity as a function of the ph of the solution is shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the data in fig 9 at a low ph percentage of removal was 65 for color and 75 for turbidity the increase of ph to 5 5 or higher leads to a complete removal of the turbidity in the solution and to the 90 removal of color it should be noted that the increase in ph values 9 11 leads to the decrease in the degree of removal of surfactants color and turbidity the percentage of removal takes values of 65 54 and 58 for mbas color and turbidity correspondingly the observed effect of ph can be explained by the presence of various hydrated forms of aluminum in the solution as shown in 38 in the ph range of 5 8 the hydrolysis and polymerization of al3 leads to the formation of particles al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al oh 3 and of highly charged polymeric hydroxo complexes al13 oh 32 7 which are effective for coagulation when ph is greater than 10 the main hydrolysis product is al oh 4 which does not favor the formation of anodized aluminum species and the adsorption of dispersed solids at low ph 4 5 where one has only aluminum ions the adsorption effect is insignificant electrical energy consumption eec is the index of the effectiveness for the ec ef processes this important parameter is obtained from the following equation 8 2 weec u v i a t s φ m3 3600 s h 103 w kw where weec is electrical energy kwh m3 u is the cell voltage volt i is current in ampere a t is electrochemical process time sec and φ is the volume of the treated solution to calculate eec those indices were taken as initial parameters at which the 90 removal of surfactant color and turbidity of wastewater had been achieved calculations show that for these three characteristics of the lww the average value of w is equal to 1 25 kw h m3 parameter wееc that is close to our parameters of the ec reactor cd and ph takes the value of 3 68 kw h m3 in 20 the increased wееc value is associated with more than three times growth of time for processing the lww thus in the light of the conducted research it is possible to determine basic optimal conditions for the electrochemical purification of lww as a general criterion for the parameters comparison their 90 removal from the lww was taken for lww taken immediately after the washing process they will be as follows ph is 5 5 cd is 5 26 ma cm2 the treatment time of lww is 5 min these parameters were taken as operating parameters for the pilot plant in conclusion we present the results of the lww purification for the ec ef process see table 1 optimal experimental conditions as seen from the experimental results the values of such parameters as tss cod and toc indicate a significant removal of pollutants from lww the concentrations of phosphate nitrogen and sulfate anions in wastewater are significantly reduced as well 3 6 pilot scale field tests based on the results of laboratory studies of lww a pilot ec plant with a volume of 0 5 m3 h was manufactured twenty aluminum electrodes the

morphology and size of the crystals crystallization time and improves crystallinity of the synthesized clays 21 23 nanoparticles have some drawback such as low stability photo corrosion and toxicity

their high surface to volume ratio which enhance the interaction of these nanoparticles with pollutants adsorbents caused faster and more efficient separation of the pollutants from wastewater therefore application of nanocomposites can significantly decrease water treatment costs 26 28 nitrate compound is one of the water and wastewater pollutants which may pass into the groundwater resources as a result of water pollution with organic materials accumulation of urban industrial garbage and chemical spill or accumulation of manure on wastewater facilities the primary risk of nitrate in drinking water occurs when the nitrate is converted to nitrite in the digestive system reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the body can cause methemoglobinemia cancer and liver damage 29 35 due to high adsorption capacity of nanocomposites they were used as effective adsorbents to remove nitrate from water however separation of nanocomposites from water is based on filtration or

flask and 50 ml of each of these solutions was used in each test from this solution several standard solutions of 1 12 mg l were prepared by dilution nitrate concentration was certained with a standard approach called ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method this method conformed the procedure explained in the standard methods to examine water and wastewater nitrate ion adsorbance at 220 nm was measured against distilled water background and at 275 nm to determine interference with dissolved organic matter net adsorbance due to no3 ions was calculated by the following equation 39 1 no3 adsorbance ads220 2 ads275 the molar nitrate adsorption coefficient was calculated using the standard curve the gradient of the standard curve line is the molar nitrate adsorption coefficient the following equation illustrates the accordance of the beer lambert law with the line equation 2 a εb c y mx b in this article several parameters such as ph contact time adsorbent dosage and nitrate

4 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of nitrate ions in solutions m is the adsorbent mass g and v is the solution volume l 40 2 5 reduction bod and cod from industrial wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod is often used as a measure of pollutants in natural waters and wastewater and biochemical oxygen demand bod is a measure of oxygen consumed by microorganisms in the bod measurement 2 g of nanocomposite was added into 50 ml industrial wastewater and was poured into special bod digital bottles the bottles were transferred to the incubator at

ii sulfate into 500 ml of distilled water then 2 g of nanocomposite was added into 50 ml industrial wastewater and it was spilled on digestion solution the materials were placed in the thermoformer for 2 h at 150 c then using a spectrophotometer absorbance was read for cod in wavelength of 600 nm 39 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization by xrd ftir sem edx vsm bet and phpzc fig 1 shows xrd patterns of the raw bentonite a mb b fe3o4 nps c and fe3o4 mb nanocomposite for raw bentonite in addition to montmorillonite as the main mineral other minerals such as kaolinite quartz illite and cristobalite exist as impurity however it can be mentioned that montmorillonite is the common main phase among other impurities characteristic peaks of this pattern 1 1 joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds card no 03 0019 emerged apart from the peaks related to bentonite impurities in 2θ 7 26 19 75 and 21 87 in the xrd pattern of the mb strong peak 001 related to montmorillonite shifted from 2θ 7 26 to 2θ 6 90 smaller angles due to increase of the distance between the layers caused by washing with acid under the influence of ultrasonic waves ultrasonic cavitation is very effective for better dispersion of bentonite in acid and breaking chemical bonds also this effect was used to decrease the size of the particles and to improve the amorphicity moreover it can be observed that the intensity of the peaks of some minerals such as quartz illite and cristobalite decreased after chemical modification as fig 1 c depicts the characteristic and high intensity peak of fe3o4 nps jcpds card no 010750449 at 2θ 35 89 plane 311 is related to the spinel phase of fe3o4 in addition the peaks for other impurities like goethite phase are not to be found as xrd patterns of magnetite and maghemite are close to each other the prepared sample may contain negligible amounts of maghemite phase as shown in fig 1 d for fe3o4 mb nanocomposite the characteristic peaks of mb have not changed but in high percentages of fe3o4 nps content some overlap in the fe3o4 and mb peaks are revealed broad diffraction pattern of these samples could be probably due to nano size of the nanocomposite additionally a 27 95 nm crystal size is calculated for nanocomposites using sherrer formula fig 2 presents ftir spectra of mb a fe3o4 mb before adsorption b and after adsorption with nitrate c the peak at 471 cm 1 and 609 cm 1 is related to bending vibrations of si o si bonds and si o al bonds respectively moreover the peak appearing at 791 cm 1 is associated with quartz as confirmed by xrd high intensity peak at 1036 cm 1 stretching vibration of si o and the one at 3740 cm 1 is related to hydroxyl groups of octahedral sheets on bentonite the peaks at 1638 cm 1 and 3437 cm 1 are related to bending and stretching vibrations of water molecules adsorbed on the surface of bentonite the small fe o vibrational peak in the 500 600 cm 1 area overlaps with the bending peaks of bentonite also the fig 2 c reveals the appearance of a new peak at 1341 cm 1 in the spectrum of nanocomposite after nitrate adsorption which is attributed to the stretching vibration of c n functional group furthermore peak at 1385 cm 1in the nitrate adsorbed on fe3o4 mb was contributed by n o stretching sem images are used to investigate the morphology and uniformity as well as alignment and distribution of the samples fig 3 displays the sem image and edx analysis of the raw bentonite a mb with different magnifications in the presence of ultrasound b and the absence of ultrasound b fig 3 a shows bentonite as a solid composed of irregular particles having several sheets in an agglomerated form in various particle sizes edx analysis of bentonite confirms the existence of si al and o as the main elements of bentonite which is the same for montmorillonite phase presence of na and absence of ca revealed na based bentonite in fig 3 b with migration of h ions to bentonite layers the edges of the sheets are opened and separated also the particle size is reduced the particle size of this sample is approximately 35 nm also in the absence of ultrasound the dispersed particles agglomerated in the acid and particles are not well separated fig 4 a shows sem images of the fe3o4 mb nanocomposite as sem images show iron oxide nanoparticles were attached to each other due to their magnetic nature and had high tendency to self agglomeration in the form of bulk uniformity and distribution of particles on bentonite could indicate the use of proper temperature during their processing when the sonochemistry device is used for homogenization the main goal is to reduce the size of the small particles in the solution to achieve greater stability and uniformity this reduction in particle size along with increase in the number of particles by breaking the particle into the smaller particles is due to the application of ultrasound in sonochemical homogenization due to the process of cavitation and explosion of bubbles the liquid flow with a high velocity is locally produced which in collision with the particles in the solution causes them to disperse as seen the size of synthesized nanoparticles is in the range of 40 nm the results of sem images of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite indicate the distribution and dispersion of iron oxide nanoparticles on the surface of bentonite it can also be seen that nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on clay ultrasonic waves power conducts to more nucleation during the co precipitation procedure therefore small particles with high dispersion could be created with higher nucleation speeds 41 fig 4 b shows the synthesis of nanocomposite in a co precipitation method without the presence of ultrasound whehre crystallization and separation in particles did not occur well although the sample exhibits a good magnetic property in the edx analysis fig 4 c of this nanocomposite the presence of elements of both phases indicates the formation of a composite fig 5 shows the magnetization behavior of the nanocomposite powder at room temperature the inset shows a picture of the fe3o4 mb nanocomposite dispersed in water and its response to an external magnet the saturation magnetization value for the nanocomposite powder was found to be 50 23 emu gfe given the high magnetism of the nanoparticles it can be claimed that non magnetic phases do not exist in the sample or at least their amount is very small according to references 42 43 the magnetization is related to particle size and cation distribution bet results of the samples are shown in table 1 studies on the modification of bentonite and the synthesis of the nanocomposite in the presence and absence of ultrasound showed that ultrasound waves can form nanoparticles as a homogeneous and smooth layer on the inner wall of porous compositions without blocking their cavities and the synthesized nanoparticles exhibit better properties bet surface area measurements were performed on samples the samples without sonication and the presence of ultrasound based on results illustrated in table 1 the surface area of the samples are great in the presence of ultrasound and have a better adsorption as illustrated in fig 6 δph value is equal to zero in initial ph of 7 3 in addition the point of zero charge ph phpzc of the prepared fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was obtained to be 7 3 for the solution with ph less than 7 3 the nanocomposite is positively charged on the other hand with ph higher than phpzc the nanocomposite gets a negative charge the phpzc of the prepared fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was distinguished using the salt addition method in order to do so a series of sodium chloride solutions with the concentration of 0 5 mol l 1 was prepared with different ph ranging from 3 to 9 here to control the initial ph of the solution 1 mol l 1 naoh and hcl solutions were utilized as well in the next step 0 1 g of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was added for each salt solution and then the obtained suspension was shaken for 24 h at ambient temperature afterward the primitive ph was measured and then the changes in δph of the solutions were depicted against initial ph values the initial ph value displayed on the phpzc of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in which the δph was equal to zero in other words phpzc equals the initial ph based on which the fe3o4 mb nanocomposite does not change the solution ph 44 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph ph is one of the effective factors which can affect the process by its influence on pollutant structure and surface charge of the adsorbent in this study it was revealed that solution ph was effective in achieving maximum removal to investigate the impact of ph 0 4 g of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in the 50 mg l nitrate solution was used and the solution ph was set at 3 5 7 and 9 as shown in fig 7 a nitrate removal by fe3o4 mb nanocomposite is higher in lower ph values and the removal rate decreases by shifting toward alkaline ph values the minimum nitrate removal was obtained at ph value of 9 and its maximum was observed at ph value of 5 therefore the rest of the tests were performed at ph of 5 the reason for high adsorption efficiency at lower ph values could be attributed to increase in h ions in the solution and decrease in oh ions in acidic ph values due to increase in accessible h that being added to adsorbent surface causes the synthesized nano adsorbent to have positive charge therefore electrostatic attraction force between the adsorbent and adsorbed pollutant it can adsorb negatively charged species 45 3 2 2 effect of contact time one of the important factors in nitrate removal processes is the required time for interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbed pollutant in this study 0 4 g of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in the 50 mg l nitrate solution was stirred for 2 h by a mechanical stirrer the results shown in fig 7 b indicate that at the beginning of the experiment due to presence of more active sites nitrate removal efficiency increases at 90 min the reaction reached its equilibrium limit and removal rate showed no significant variation from this moment on this could be due to decrease in concentration of dissolved nitrate as well as to decline in active sites on the adsorbent surface 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent amount adsorbent amount is one of the other effective factors 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 g of the prepared nanocomposite were added to the 50 mg l nitrate solutions the results in fig 7 c show that by increasing the adsorbent amount from 0 2 g to 0 6 g the nitrate removal was increased which is due to enhancement of active sites number which in turn increases the contact surface between the adsorbent and pollutants 3 2 4 effect of initial nitrate concentration this study showed that significant decrease of nitrate by fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was achievable for a wide range of initial concentrations of nitrate 30 200 mg l for this purpose nitrate solutions with different concentrations 30 50 100 150 and 200 mg l were prepared and then 50 ml of these solutions were added to containers including 0 4 g of adsorbent as shown in fig 7 d by increasing the initial concentration of nitrate the removal percentage was decreased which can be due to the saturation of the active sites in other words at the start of the adsorption process active sites on the surface of adsorbent are easily exposed to nitrate ions as shown in figure the lowest removal rate was observed for the highest concentration of nitrate 200 mg l and the maximum removal percentage was for the lowest concentration 30 mg l by increasing the initial concentration from 30 to 200 mg l nitrate removal percentage in fe3o4 mb nanocomposite decreased from 72 6 to 14 1 furthermore in another experiment 0 6 g of synthesized nanocomposite led to a 79 decrease in nitrate concentration the initial concentration of nitrate was 30 mg l 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms studies adsorption isotherms describe the interactive behavior of solution and adsorbents these isotherms are a series of equations to describe the equilibrium state of the adsorbed materials between the solid and liquid phases langmuir equation considers a mono layer adsorption at a uniform adsorbent level with energetically same sorption sites the linear and non linear forms of langmuir isotherm equations are given by eqs 5 and 6 5 c e q e 1 q m a x k l 1 q m a x c e 6 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e in the above formula ce is the balance concentration of the adsorbate mg l 1 qe is the amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent mg g 1 qmax and kl are langmuir constants related to adsorption capacity and amount of adsorption respectively in addition the necessary properties of the langmuir isotherm can be explained by a separation parameter rl defined by eq 7 7 r l 1 1 k l c 0 in the above equation c is the initial concentration of nitrate ppm or mg l 1 and b is the langmuir constant g l 1 the amount of separation parameter rl shows the isotherms shape and the nature of the adsorption process is unsuitable rl 1 linear rl 1 suitable 0 r l 1 and irreversible rl 0 freundlich equation explains balance on heterogeneous surfaces and thus does not assume mono layer capacity the linear and non linear forms of freundlich isotherm equations are given by eqs 8 and 9 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e 9 q e k f c e 1 n kf and n are constants for this isotherm with n giving a mark of how suitable the adsorption process is kf mg g 1 is relevant with adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the gradient 1 n ranging between 0 and 1 is a measure of surface heterogeneity becoming more heterogeneous as its value gets near to zero value n 1 shows a normal langmuir isotherm while n 1 is indicative of efficient adsorption 46 in this study freundlich and langmuir models were used to explain the relevance between the amounts of nitrate adsorbed and its balance concentration in solution at 25 c nitrate solutions 30 50 100 150 mg l 1 ph 5 and contact time 90 min were studied using adsorbate 0 4 g table 2 and fig 8 show the results and their relevant parameters fig 8 shows linear a and non linear b forms of langmuir isotherms and linear c and non linear d forms of freundlich model the statistical parameters in table 2 and high regression coefficient indicate that the pollutant removal by fe3o4 mb nanocomposite with r2 0 9845 for to linear form and 0 9147 for to non linear form can be described by langmuir isotherm model in langmuir model a layer of dissolved molecules is adsorbed by the adsorbent and the adsorption energy is the same for all the adsorbent surface points in freundlich model however the sites on the adsorbent surface are not uniform and have different adsorption abilities 3 3 reduction bod and cod from industrial wastewater in this series of experiments as table 3 reports the activity of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in reducing bod and cod concentration of industrial wastewater coming from a pharmacy unit was tested the results show that 2 g of prepared nanocomposite can decrease cod and bod concentration approximately to 88 8 and 84 88 respectively table 4 reports daily values of bod5 as shown in fig 9 prepared nanocomposite can fill its active sites by the pollutants in the first hours and after several days it shows no desorption 3 4 reproducibility and desorption of nanocomposite study the nanocomposite was reconstructed 3 times with deionized water to investigate nanocomposite repeatability in the nitrate removal process changes in some parts were low and in some parts were high these changes are shown in fig 7 where removal percentage was determined using standard deviation generally as shown in the bod5 test there is no desorption in long time contact of nano adsorbent with pollutants bentonite and iron mines are abundant in iran and nanocomposite production is economical bentonite is cheap and available material than can be used to prepare applied nanocomposites in water and wastewater treatment so can reduce the cost of refining this design has been investigated in the laboratory scale its implementation in an industrial scale with easy and cost effective methods based on nanotechnology and granulation nanocomposite could be an effective step towards reducing water refinery and wastewater costs in the next phase of the project this nanocomposite after contact with nitrate contaminated solutions can be used as a substitute for nitrate fertilizers 3 5 comparison of the adsorption capacities of nitrate and bod cod at the end the adsorption capacity mg g 1 of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite for the removal of nitrate bod and cod from water and wastewater and other experimental conditions of some different sorbents was compared with different adsorbents reported in literature this comparison is shown in table 5 47 53 4 conclusion fe3o4 mb nanocomposite with significant magnetic properties and proper adsorption capacity was synthesized by ultrasound assisted co precipitation method results of xrd ftir sem edx and vsm showed that a combination of sonochemical and co precipitation method was a cost effective higher yield short reaction time procedure thus a facile route to produce nano adsorbent from the sem images approximate size of the stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles on the bentonite substrate is about 40 nm in general the magnetic nanocomposite can be used for adsorption of pollutants from water and wastewater which can be separated from the liquid phase by a magnet the synthesized magnetic nanocomposite is indicative of high efficiency in reducing of nitrate bod and cod concentrations accordingly at ph 5 adsorbent amount 0 6 g and the initial nitrate concentration 30 mg l during 90 min 79 of nitrate was removed langmuir isotherm model is more in accordance with data than freundlich model indicating adsorption on the homogeneous and one layered surfaces furthermore 84 88 of bod and 88 8 of cod of the industrial wastewater were removed by 2 g of synthesized sample 
14359,in this research modification of bentonite and synthesis of fe3o4 bentonite nanocomposite are reported in the presence of ultrasound the samples were prepared by chemical co precipitation and sonochemical methods and the structural order textural magnetic and surface area properties were examined using xrd ftir sem edx vsm bet and point of zero charge ph phpzc analysis then the as synthesized nanocomposite was used to remove nitrate bod and cod from water and industrial wastewater batch adsorption experiments were conducted where the influence of several parameters such as ph

time of 90 min adsorbent amount of 0 6 g and the initial nitrate concentration of 30 mg l for further investigation some tests were conducted on industrial wastewater of pharmaceutical units to evaluate the bod and cod reduction using 2 g of synthesized sample 84 88 of bod and 88 8 of cod of the industrial wastewater were removed keywords bentonite fe3o4 nanocomposite fe3o4 mb modified

220 nm was measured against distilled water background and at 275 nm to determine interference with dissolved organic matter net adsorbance due to no3 ions was calculated by the following equation 39 1 no3 adsorbance ads220 2 ads275 the molar nitrate adsorption coefficient was calculated using the standard curve the gradient of the standard curve line is the molar nitrate adsorption coefficient the following equation illustrates the accordance of the beer lambert law with the line equation 2 a εb c y mx b in this article several parameters such as ph contact time adsorbent dosage and nitrate concentration were studied furthermore adsorption isotherm charts were used to describe the adsorption equilibrium state in aqueous solutions all experiments were performed at room temperature and using mechanical stirrer 130 200 rpm finally nanocomposite was separated from water by magnet the percent removal of nitrate by the present nanocomposite is given by 3 removal c0 ce c0 100 where c0 and ce refer to the initial and equilibrium concentrations mg l 1 of nitrate respectively furthermore the amount of nitrate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent qe in mg g 1 was calculated as follows 4 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of nitrate ions in solutions m is the adsorbent mass g and v is the solution volume l 40 2 5 reduction bod and cod from industrial wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod is often used as a measure of pollutants in natural waters and wastewater and biochemical oxygen demand bod is a measure of oxygen consumed by microorganisms in the bod measurement 2 g of nanocomposite was added into 50 ml industrial wastewater and was poured into special bod digital bottles the bottles were transferred to the incubator at 20 c for five days and then bod5 were obtained from the difference between the initial and the final values of dissolved oxygen measured the cod of samples was determined by the open reflux dichromate titrimetric method in the cod measurement the digestion solution was prepared by adding 3 g potassium dichromate previously dried for 2 h at 103 c 167 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and 33 3 mercury ii sulfate into 500 ml of distilled water then 2 g of nanocomposite was added into 50 ml industrial wastewater and it was spilled on digestion solution the materials were placed in the thermoformer for 2 h at 150 c then using a spectrophotometer absorbance was read for cod in wavelength of 600 nm 39 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization by xrd ftir sem edx vsm bet and phpzc fig 1 shows xrd patterns of the raw bentonite a mb b fe3o4 nps c and fe3o4 mb nanocomposite for raw bentonite in addition to montmorillonite as the main mineral other minerals such as kaolinite quartz illite and cristobalite exist as impurity however it can be mentioned that montmorillonite is the common main phase among other impurities characteristic peaks of this pattern 1 1 joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds card no 03 0019 emerged apart from the peaks related to bentonite impurities in 2θ 7 26 19 75 and 21 87 in the xrd pattern of the mb strong peak 001 related to montmorillonite shifted from 2θ 7 26 to 2θ 6 90 smaller angles due to increase of the distance between the layers caused by washing with acid under the influence of ultrasonic waves ultrasonic cavitation is very effective for better dispersion of bentonite in acid and breaking chemical bonds also this effect was used to decrease the size of the particles and to improve the amorphicity moreover it can be observed that the intensity of the peaks of some minerals such as quartz illite and cristobalite decreased after chemical modification as fig 1 c depicts the characteristic and high intensity peak of fe3o4 nps jcpds card no 010750449 at 2θ 35 89 plane 311 is related to the spinel phase of fe3o4 in addition the peaks for other impurities like goethite phase are not to be found as xrd patterns of magnetite and maghemite are close to each other the prepared sample may contain negligible amounts of maghemite phase as shown in fig 1 d for fe3o4 mb nanocomposite the characteristic peaks of mb have not changed but in high percentages of fe3o4 nps content some overlap in the fe3o4 and mb peaks are revealed broad diffraction pattern of these samples could be probably due to nano size of the nanocomposite additionally a 27 95 nm crystal size is calculated for nanocomposites using sherrer formula fig 2 presents ftir spectra of mb a fe3o4 mb before adsorption b and after adsorption with nitrate c the peak at 471 cm 1 and 609 cm 1 is related to bending vibrations of si o si bonds and si o al bonds respectively moreover the peak appearing at 791 cm 1 is associated with quartz as confirmed by xrd high intensity peak at 1036 cm 1 stretching vibration of si o and the one at 3740 cm 1 is related to hydroxyl groups of octahedral sheets on bentonite the peaks at 1638 cm 1 and 3437 cm 1 are related to bending and stretching vibrations of water molecules adsorbed on the surface of bentonite the small fe o vibrational peak in the 500 600 cm 1 area overlaps with the bending peaks of bentonite also the fig 2 c reveals the appearance of a new peak at 1341 cm 1 in the spectrum of nanocomposite after nitrate adsorption which is attributed to the stretching vibration of c n functional group furthermore peak at 1385 cm 1in the nitrate adsorbed on fe3o4 mb was contributed by n o stretching sem images are used to investigate the morphology and uniformity as well as alignment and distribution of the samples fig 3 displays the sem image and edx analysis of the raw bentonite a mb with different magnifications in the presence of ultrasound b and the absence of ultrasound b fig 3 a shows bentonite as a solid composed of irregular particles having several sheets in an agglomerated form in various particle sizes edx analysis of bentonite confirms the existence of si al and o as the main elements of bentonite which is the same for montmorillonite phase presence of na and absence of ca revealed na based bentonite in fig 3 b with migration of h ions to bentonite layers the edges of the sheets are opened and separated also the particle size is reduced the particle size of this sample is approximately 35 nm also in the absence of ultrasound the dispersed particles agglomerated in the acid and particles are not well separated fig 4 a shows sem images of the fe3o4 mb nanocomposite as sem images show iron oxide nanoparticles were attached to each other due to their magnetic nature and had high tendency to self agglomeration in the form of bulk uniformity and distribution of particles on bentonite could indicate the use of proper temperature during their processing when the sonochemistry device is used for homogenization the main goal is to reduce the size of the small particles in the solution to achieve greater stability and uniformity this reduction in particle size along with increase in the number of particles by breaking the particle into the smaller particles is due to the application of ultrasound in sonochemical homogenization due to the process of cavitation and explosion of bubbles the liquid flow with a high velocity is locally produced which in collision with the particles in the solution causes them to disperse as seen the size of synthesized nanoparticles is in the range of 40 nm the results of sem images of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite indicate the distribution and dispersion of iron oxide nanoparticles on the surface of bentonite it can also be seen that nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on clay ultrasonic waves power conducts to more nucleation during the co precipitation procedure therefore small particles with high dispersion could be created with higher nucleation speeds 41 fig 4 b shows the synthesis of nanocomposite in a co precipitation method without the presence of ultrasound whehre crystallization and separation in particles did not occur well although the sample exhibits a good magnetic property in the edx analysis fig 4 c of this nanocomposite the presence of elements of both phases indicates the formation of a composite fig 5 shows the magnetization behavior of the nanocomposite powder at room temperature the inset shows a picture of the fe3o4 mb nanocomposite dispersed in water and its response to an external magnet the saturation magnetization value for the nanocomposite powder was found to be 50 23 emu gfe given the high magnetism of the nanoparticles it can be claimed that non magnetic phases do not exist in the sample or at least their amount is very small according to references 42 43 the magnetization is related to particle size and cation distribution bet results of the samples are shown in table 1 studies on the modification of bentonite and the synthesis of the nanocomposite in the presence and absence of ultrasound showed that ultrasound waves can form nanoparticles as a homogeneous and smooth layer on the inner wall of porous compositions without blocking their cavities and the synthesized nanoparticles exhibit better properties bet surface area measurements were performed on samples the samples without sonication and the presence of ultrasound based on results illustrated in table 1 the surface area of the samples are great in the presence of ultrasound and have a better adsorption as illustrated in fig 6 δph value is equal to zero in initial ph of 7 3 in addition the point of zero charge ph phpzc of the prepared fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was obtained to be 7 3 for the solution with ph less than 7 3 the nanocomposite is positively charged on the other hand with ph higher than phpzc the nanocomposite gets a negative charge the phpzc of the prepared fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was distinguished using the salt addition method in order to do so a series of sodium chloride solutions with the concentration of 0 5 mol l 1 was prepared with different ph ranging from 3 to 9 here to control the initial ph of the solution 1 mol l 1 naoh and hcl solutions were utilized as well in the next step 0 1 g of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was added for each salt solution and then the obtained suspension was shaken for 24 h at ambient temperature afterward the primitive ph was measured and then the changes in δph of the solutions were depicted against initial ph values the initial ph value displayed on the phpzc of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in which the δph was equal to zero in other words phpzc equals the initial ph based on which the fe3o4 mb nanocomposite does not change the solution ph 44 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph ph is one of the effective factors which can affect the process by its influence on pollutant structure and surface charge of the adsorbent in this study it was revealed that solution ph was effective in achieving maximum removal to investigate the impact of ph 0 4 g of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in the 50 mg l nitrate solution was used and the solution ph was set at 3 5 7 and 9 as shown in fig 7 a nitrate removal by fe3o4 mb nanocomposite is higher in lower ph values and the removal rate decreases by shifting toward alkaline ph values the minimum nitrate removal was obtained at ph value of 9 and its maximum was observed at ph value of 5 therefore the rest of the tests were performed at ph of 5 the reason for high adsorption efficiency at lower ph values could be attributed to increase in h ions in the solution and decrease in oh ions in acidic ph values due to increase in accessible h that being added to adsorbent surface causes the synthesized nano adsorbent to have positive charge therefore electrostatic attraction force between the adsorbent and adsorbed pollutant it can adsorb negatively charged species 45 3 2 2 effect of contact time one of the important factors in nitrate removal processes is the required time for interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbed pollutant in this study 0 4 g of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in the 50 mg l nitrate solution was stirred for 2 h by a mechanical stirrer the results shown in fig 7 b indicate that at the beginning of the experiment due to presence of more active sites nitrate removal efficiency increases at 90 min the reaction reached its equilibrium limit and removal rate showed no significant variation from this moment on this could be due to decrease in concentration of dissolved nitrate as well as to decline in active sites on the adsorbent surface 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent amount adsorbent amount is one of the other effective factors 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 g of the prepared nanocomposite were added to the 50 mg l nitrate solutions the results in fig 7 c show that by increasing the adsorbent amount from 0 2 g to 0 6 g the nitrate removal was increased which is due to enhancement of active sites number which in turn increases the contact surface between the adsorbent and pollutants 3 2 4 effect of initial nitrate concentration this study showed that significant decrease of nitrate by fe3o4 mb nanocomposite was achievable for a wide range of initial concentrations of nitrate 30 200 mg l for this purpose nitrate solutions with different concentrations 30 50 100 150 and 200 mg l were prepared and then 50 ml of these solutions were added to containers including 0 4 g of adsorbent as shown in fig 7 d by increasing the initial concentration of nitrate the removal percentage was decreased which can be due to the saturation of the active sites in other words at the start of the adsorption process active sites on the surface of adsorbent are easily exposed to nitrate ions as shown in figure the lowest removal rate was observed for the highest concentration of nitrate 200 mg l and the maximum removal percentage was for the lowest concentration 30 mg l by increasing the initial concentration from 30 to 200 mg l nitrate removal percentage in fe3o4 mb nanocomposite decreased from 72 6 to 14 1 furthermore in another experiment 0 6 g of synthesized nanocomposite led to a 79 decrease in nitrate concentration the initial concentration of nitrate was 30 mg l 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms studies adsorption isotherms describe the interactive behavior of solution and adsorbents these isotherms are a series of equations to describe the equilibrium state of the adsorbed materials between the solid and liquid phases langmuir equation considers a mono layer adsorption at a uniform adsorbent level with energetically same sorption sites the linear and non linear forms of langmuir isotherm equations are given by eqs 5 and 6 5 c e q e 1 q m a x k l 1 q m a x c e 6 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e in the above formula ce is the balance concentration of the adsorbate mg l 1 qe is the amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent mg g 1 qmax and kl are langmuir constants related to adsorption capacity and amount of adsorption respectively in addition the necessary properties of the langmuir isotherm can be explained by a separation parameter rl defined by eq 7 7 r l 1 1 k l c 0 in the above equation c is the initial concentration of nitrate ppm or mg l 1 and b is the langmuir constant g l 1 the amount of separation parameter rl shows the isotherms shape and the nature of the adsorption process is unsuitable rl 1 linear rl 1 suitable 0 r l 1 and irreversible rl 0 freundlich equation explains balance on heterogeneous surfaces and thus does not assume mono layer capacity the linear and non linear forms of freundlich isotherm equations are given by eqs 8 and 9 8 log q e log k f 1 n log c e 9 q e k f c e 1 n kf and n are constants for this isotherm with n giving a mark of how suitable the adsorption process is kf mg g 1 is relevant with adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the gradient 1 n ranging between 0 and 1 is a measure of surface heterogeneity becoming more heterogeneous as its value gets near to zero value n 1 shows a normal langmuir isotherm while n 1 is indicative of efficient adsorption 46 in this study freundlich and langmuir models were used to explain the relevance between the amounts of nitrate adsorbed and its balance concentration in solution at 25 c nitrate solutions 30 50 100 150 mg l 1 ph 5 and contact time 90 min were studied using adsorbate 0 4 g table 2 and fig 8 show the results and their relevant parameters fig 8 shows linear a and non linear b forms of langmuir isotherms and linear c and non linear d forms of freundlich model the statistical parameters in table 2 and high regression coefficient indicate that the pollutant removal by fe3o4 mb nanocomposite with r2 0 9845 for to linear form and 0 9147 for to non linear form can be described by langmuir isotherm model in langmuir model a layer of dissolved molecules is adsorbed by the adsorbent and the adsorption energy is the same for all the adsorbent surface points in freundlich model however the sites on the adsorbent surface are not uniform and have different adsorption abilities 3 3 reduction bod and cod from industrial wastewater in this series of experiments as table 3 reports the activity of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite in reducing bod and cod concentration of industrial wastewater coming from a pharmacy unit was tested the results show that 2 g of prepared nanocomposite can decrease cod and bod concentration approximately to 88 8 and 84 88 respectively table 4 reports daily values of bod5 as shown in fig 9 prepared nanocomposite can fill its active sites by the pollutants in the first hours and after several days it shows no desorption 3 4 reproducibility and desorption of nanocomposite study the nanocomposite was reconstructed 3 times with deionized water to investigate nanocomposite repeatability in the nitrate removal process changes in some parts were low and in some parts were high these changes are shown in fig 7 where removal percentage was determined using standard deviation generally as shown in the bod5 test there is no desorption in long time contact of nano adsorbent with pollutants bentonite and iron mines are abundant in iran and nanocomposite production is economical bentonite is cheap and available material than can be used to prepare applied nanocomposites in water and wastewater treatment so can reduce the cost of refining this design has been investigated in the laboratory scale its implementation in an industrial scale with easy and cost effective methods based on nanotechnology and granulation nanocomposite could be an effective step towards reducing water refinery and wastewater costs in the next phase of the project this nanocomposite after contact with nitrate contaminated solutions can be used as a substitute for nitrate fertilizers 3 5 comparison of the adsorption capacities of nitrate and bod cod at the end the adsorption capacity mg g 1 of fe3o4 mb nanocomposite for the removal of nitrate bod and cod from water and wastewater and other experimental conditions of some different sorbents was compared with different adsorbents reported in literature this comparison is shown in table 5 47 53 4 conclusion fe3o4 mb nanocomposite with significant magnetic properties and proper adsorption capacity was synthesized by ultrasound assisted co precipitation method results of xrd ftir sem edx and vsm showed that a combination of sonochemical and co precipitation method was a cost effective higher yield short reaction time procedure thus a facile route to produce nano adsorbent from the sem images approximate size of the stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles on the bentonite substrate is about 40 nm in general the magnetic nanocomposite can be used for adsorption of pollutants from water and wastewater which can be separated from the liquid phase by a magnet the synthesized magnetic nanocomposite is indicative of high efficiency in reducing of nitrate bod and cod concentrations accordingly at ph 5 adsorbent amount 0 6 g and the initial nitrate concentration 30 mg l during 90 min 79 of nitrate was removed langmuir isotherm model is more in accordance with data than freundlich model indicating adsorption on the homogeneous and one layered surfaces furthermore 84 88 of bod and 88 8 of cod of the industrial wastewater were removed by 2 g of synthesized sample
