and cloud top heights exhibited a decreasing trend in june whereas an increase in vigorous deep convection was observed in august september mainly in southern korea the decadal trends in august and september were associated with large scale circulation changes while the trend in september was attributed to increasing typhoon visits over the korean peninsula the cloud top changes with lowered

sohn 2015 park et al 2015 song et al 2020a ryu et al 2021 the heavy rain clouds with rain rates exceeding 40 mm h 1 over the korea japan region exhibited the mean storm height of 8 3 km and cloud top height of 12 6 km song et al 2020a by contrast those storm and cloud top heights were 10 4 10 5 km and 13 2 14 3 km in continental regions such as the united states and central africa song et al 2020a

2020a active collision coalescence process of raindrops under the humid environment was understood a key mechanism producing heavy rainfall without a sufficient vertical development accompanied by

four decades except in the month of june with a notable decrease in rainfall song and sohn 2020 this pattern was understood in associated with the weakening of the northward propagation of the north pacific subtropical high together with differential heating over northeastern china and the far east of russia lee at al 2020 however because overall precipitation is determined by both frequent light rain events and rare heavy rain events narrowing the focus to heavy rainfall may result in different cloud characteristics and long term trends for this purpose hourly data analysis is required unlike the common approach based on monthly data this study mainly focuses on long term variations in heavy rainfall and associated cloud top patterns over the korean peninsula over the past four decades since single geostationary satellites typically operate for up to ten years long term cloud data are difficult to obtain from a single satellite recently knapp et al 2011 provided useful long term consistent global cloud data by merging multi geostationary satellites called the gridded satellites gridsat these datasets have been widely used to analyze global climatology and long term cloud features haffke and magnusdottir 2013 kossin et al 2013 funk et al 2015 khanna et al 2017 taylor et al 2017 this study utilized the gridsat product along with 3 hourly rain gauge data for june july august and september jjas from 1983 to 2021 to understand long term cloud top patterns associated with heavy rainfall over the korean peninsula to the best of our knowledge no similar research based on gridsat covering these four decades has been attempted in the korean domain apart from the 10 year mean climatology of cloud patterns for heavy rainfall by song and sohn 2015 and a single case study by kim et al 2022 this study also analyzed the changes in thermodynamic and dynamic environments to explain possible reasons for the observed cloud pattern changes this study can contribute to a better understanding for the long term variability of precipitating clouds over the korean peninsula 2 data and methods this study primarily used 3 hourly accumulated precipitation data from the automated synoptic observation system asos in south korea for the jjas period from 1983 to 2021 during this period 70 95 stations were in operation here the 3 hourly accumulated rainfall data were converted into 3 hourly mean rainfall intensity centered at regular 3 hour intervals i e 00 03 06 09 12 15 18 21 utc from four adjacent hourly data points to fairly compare the rainfall data with the instantaneous 3 hourly cloud data to select heavy rainfall events 3 hourly rainfall data averaged over all stations were sorted in a descending size order a total of 2109 heavy rainfall events in terms of 3 hourly cases were subjectively classified encompassing half of the total rainfall for the entire period despite a rare occurrence frequency in the top 5 54 the selected heavy rainfall events recorded the minimum mean and maximum values for the area averaged 3 hourly rainfall as 1 60 2 27 and 10 11 mm respectively the heavy rainfall characteristics could be diminished in the case of a larger dataset whereas statistical representation in terms of climate change can be reduced in the case of a smaller dataset along with rainfall data this study used 6 hourly typhoon best track data from the japan meteorological agency jma a typhoon event was defined as the occurrence of tropical storms severe tropical storms or typhoons with a maximum wind speed exceeding 17 m s 1 over the korean domain 124 131 e and 33 39 n which is a coverage of ground based measurements in south korea cheung et al 2018 also used a similar 5 degree domain for a typhoon study in this study 3 hourly typhoon events were artificially estimated by doubling the 6 hourly data cloud data were obtained from the gridsat infrared brightness temperature at 11 Âµm tb11 at 3 hourly intervals and 0 07 0 07 grid resolutions over the korean domain 124 131 e and 33 39 n the datasets were produced by consistently calibrating data from multiple geostationary satellites such as gms 1 2 3 4 5 goes 9 mtsat 1r and himawari 8 over the korean domain in this study the tb11 distributions for heavy rainfall cases were assumed to be cloud top temperature as in song et al 2019 2020a since infrared radiances were mostly emitted from the cloud top for overcast clouds associated with heavy rainfall this assumption may not be valid in localized rain cases because tb11 can be affected by the surface of the surrounding cloud free areas thus tb11 is more contaminated by the surface rather than by the cloud top as it moves away from south korea the total number of heavy rainfall events was reduced to 1992 due to missing geostationary data era5 reanalysis data with 3 hourly intervals and 0 25 0 25 grid resolutions hersbach et al 2020 were also used to analyze convective available potential energy cape total precipitation water tpw vertically integrated moisture flux convergence mfc and air temperatures 300 500 850 1000 hpa in addition to synoptic distributions at 200 500 850 hpa using these datasets the monthly mean climatology and linear trends were mainly analyzed for the linear trend a decadal change in each variable was calculated by considering the year and julian time of each heavy rainfall event as an independent variable 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the monthly time series jjas 1983 2021 of heavy rainfall events in south korea heavy rainfall events occurred more frequently between july august 29 6 33 0 than in june 18 0 and september 19 5 this is consistent with the monthly features of total rainfall showing dominant rainfall in july august 29 5 31 7 compared with june and september 19 4 it is generally known that rainfall in june july occurs mostly during the changma period over the korean peninsula whereas the rainfall in august september is also affected by intermittent typhoon events as shown by the black bars in fig 1 the contribution of typhoons to heavy rainfall events in august and september was 29 9 and 20 1 respectively when the indirect effect of typhoons was further considered the impact of typhoons on rainfall in august and september can be more dominant since precipitation and heavy rainfall events change significantly every year the heavy rainfall events in the july september period did not exhibit statistically significant changes however the heavy rainfall events in june exhibited a notable decreasing trend of 2 00 decade 1 fig 1 which is consistent with the june rainfall patterns in song and sohn 2020 and lee et al 2020 the linear trend in june was significant at a 95 confidence level although there were differences in the spatial distribution no apparent differences in the monthly mean rainfall intensity were found fig 2 thus the large amount of rainfall in july and august was mainly attributed to the rainfall occurrence frequency rather than to the rainfall intensity since heavy rainfall events in south korea were considered the mean tb11 composites exhibited a cold temperature over the inland areas of south korea and a warm temperature over the surrounding areas fig 2 the cold and warm tb11 areas indicate convective cloud systems with deep and moderate top heights respectively notably the mean tb11 in june 248 6 k was 6 5 7 4 k colder than in july and august from climatological radiosonde observations song et al 2020b the mean air temperature in june at the 350 hpa level roughly 250 k level was 4 6 k colder than that in july and august thus the colder tb11 in june is thought to be affected by the colder air temperature near the cloud top rather than being an indicator of a taller cloud top height in relation to that heavy rainfall systems over the korean peninsula are mostly determined by humid environments under low instability conditions as a part of warm type heavy rainfall song and sohn 2015 song et al 2020a sohn et al 2013 the mean cape and tpw were 143 381 j kg 1 and 49 54 mm respectively in august the contribution of cape was further increased but it was still much lower than that of continental regions such as the united states and central africa with capes of 853 1143 j kg 1 song et al 2020a the lower cape condition over korea indicated that thermodynamic instability is not a key process in producing heavy rainfall as noted in song and sohn 2015 since water vapor is typically transported from the southern ocean to the korean peninsula cape and tpw were relatively high over the ocean fig 3 shows the decadal linear trends with unit of per decade of rainfall intensity tb11 cape and tpw for the period 1983 2021 when heavy rainfall events occurred in south korea the decreasing trend of rainfall in june was linked to the increase in tb11 indicating a lowering of cloud top height and more frequent clear sky events in july no evident trends in rainfall and tb11 were observed except for the increased tb11 over the southern area the rainfall and cloud tops in august were reduced over the central region and enhanced over the southern region of the korean peninsula this indicates a shift in rainfall and vigorous convection trends towards the southern region these changes were mainly related to the increased moisture i e tpw over the southern region but decreased over the central region the cape in august exhibited a decreasing pattern over widespread areas the rainfall and tb11 changes in september exhibited similar patterns to those in august but increased rainfall and decreased tb11 trends were more prominent the enhancing cloud top trends in september were related to the widest areas with a 99 confidence level indicated as small black squares it was linked to decreasing cape and increasing tpw trends mainly over the southern ocean of the korean peninsula the tb11 changes in september were also characterized by a west east pattern showing increasing and decreasing trends in contrast to the north south pattern in august these patterns were inversely correlated with the spatial patterns of tpw trends however the increasing cape and tb11 in june as well as the decreasing cape and tb11 in august september are difficult to be intuitively understood the numerical experiments of song et al 2017 showed that the storm height of heavy rainfall tended to be lowered under humid and low instability conditions i e high tpw and low cape as a result of warm type heavy rainfall under humid and abundant cloud conditions the vertical gradient of temperature can be weakened leading to a neutralized atmospheric column with a relatively low cape fig 4 exhibited the weakened vertical gradient between 300 and 500 hpa and 1000 hpa in august september by contrast the temperature gradient increased in june inducing the increase of cape in conclusion cape is not a good indicator for explaining the warm type heavy rainfall as noted by song and sohn 2015 and song et al 2020a heavy rainfall systems over the korean peninsula are more affected by dynamical forcings than by thermodynamic instability in particular hong 2004 emphasized that heavy rainfall systems over korea was characterized as thermodynamically near neural condition i e low cape in contrast to large cape over the united states if a tremendous water vapor is supplied by the dynamic forcings e g horizontal moisture convergence cloud top height can be elevated as a result of the increased relative humidity the mean composite results for 1983 2021 exhibited strong dynamic forcings with vertical connections for upper level divergence at 200 hpa mid level updraft at 500 hpa and mfc when heavy rainfall occurred in south korea fig 5 moreover a strong convergence between the cold dry continental and warm moist maritime air masses could be clearly identified in particular tremendous moisture transported by southwesterly winds around the periphery of the northwestern pacific high is an important dynamical factor that induces a humid environment in korea from june to september the eastward and northward components of the moisture flux at 850 hpa tended to weaken and strengthen respectively it is related to the northward propagation of the northwest pacific high from june to september the heavy rain systems in june and september were more affected by dynamic forcings than those in july and august as noted in the reddish areas in fig 5 by contrast the thermodynamic instability expressed by cape was largest in august fig 2 the decadal linear trends for the synoptic charts at the upper mid lower levels are presented in fig 6 in june the northward propagation of the northwestern pacific high was weakening and it was associated with a reduction in mid level updraft and mfc over the southern ocean of the korean peninsula as noted by lee at al 2021 drought and flood years in june were closely related to the northward propagation of the northwestern pacific high these changes can partially explain the observed decreasing rainfall and increasing tb11 trends in june in july no evident decadal trend was observed except for a strengthened anticyclonic circulation around north eastern china the upper level divergence mid level updraft and mfc in august also exhibited north south patterns over the middle and southern regions of korea consistent with the rainfall tb11 and tpw trends the enhanced moisture toward the southern region of korea was a result of the strengthened convergence between anticyclonic circulation in the east china sea and cyclonic circulation in the eastern ocean of korea among these four months september was characterized by the largest dynamic change exhibiting enhanced cyclonic circulations over the shandong peninsula at the upper level and the southern ocean of the korean peninsula at mid lower levels these circulation changes induced strong upper level divergence and mid level updrafts along with a tremendous water vapor supply over the korean peninsula this was also related to the weakening of the mid level updraft and mfc over the yellow sea these synoptic patterns in september can explain the spatial distribution changes of tb11 and tpw with the west east gradient as well as the rainfall observations this study also addressed the possible relationship between typhoons and tb11 changes while considering that typhoons can exhibit the lowest tb11 i e highest cloud top height over a wide area among all rain systems in korea song et al 2020 note that isolated thunderstorms can also exhibit the lower tb11 pattern but its spatial coverage is limited to inland regions in korea the number of typhoons passing over korea over the past two decades september 2002 2021 increased by 414 compared with september 1983 2001 thus these systems accounted for a large portion of heavy rain events in september fig 1 thus we can conclude that the more frequent occurrence of deep convections with a lower tb11 in september was closely related to frequent typhoon passes over korea over the past four decades this is also consistent with lee et al 2019 who showed that typhoon track density in september 1983 2016 increased around the east china sea and korea while it decreased in the western pacific regions located at latitudes below 20 n in association with a greater expansion of subtropical high and strong easterly winds over the latitude band of 30 40 n both park et al 2011 and lee et al 2019 indicated that the weakening vertical wind shear over mid latitudes is an important factor inducing more typhoon visits occurrences over the korean peninsula as displayed in fig 6 the horizontal wind speed at mid upper levels in september was significantly weakened in the direction opposite to the mean westerly wind indicating weakening of the upper level jet stream fig 7 in the supporting information further shows the climatological mean and decadal trend of geopotential height z850 and equivalent potential temperature gradient at 850 hpa Î´Î¸850 Î´y over the 124 131 e area here Î´Î¸850 Î´y can represent an approximate location of the meiyu baiu changma monsoon fronts tomita et al 2011 li et al 2018 the climatological mean results exhibit the northward expansion of the northwestern pacific high and monsoon front from june to august followed by the southward retreat in september the decadal trend results show that the subtropical high is weakening in june and strengthening in august in addition around the convergence zone with the maximum Î´Î¸850 Î´y negative and positive trends of Î´Î¸850 Î´y are evident in june and august respectively these results suggest the weakening and strengthening of first and secondary changma periods respectively 4 summary and conclusions this study examined the long term in jjas from 1983 to 2021 climatology and decadal trend of heavy rainfall events and associated cloud top temperature inferred from the gridsat tb11 in the korean domain 124 131 e and 33 39 n thermodynamic cape tpw and mfc and dynamical patterns synoptic maps at 200 500 850 hpa were also analyzed using era5 reanalysis heavy rainfall events were representative of half of the total rainfall for the entire period and were more frequent in july august than in june or september in terms of mean climatology the tb11 in june was colder than those in july and august due to the difference in climatological air temperature in the decadal trend tb11 in june exhibited an increasing tendency over south korea in association with reduced rainfall a certain portion of the increased tb11 in june was affected by the increasing trend of environmental temperature throughout the troposphere no apparent trend was observed in july heavy rainfall events and cloud tops in august exhibited a decreasing trend over the central region and an increasing trend over the southern region of the korean peninsula the increased occurrence of vigorous deep convection in the southern region in august was associated with tremendous moisture transport from the strengthened convergence between anticyclonic circulation in the east china sea and cyclonic circulation located in the eastern ocean of korea september was characterized by the largest dynamical change in association with enhanced cyclonic circulation around the east china sea this was related to more frequent typhoon visits in september over the korean peninsula inducing colder tb11 and increasing deep convection considering that most previous studies on long term rainfall variation over korea have been confined to rainfall and reanalysis products this study is valuable in terms of the application of long term satellite derived cloud data over a wide area including land and sea although no obvious trend was found on a monthly scale except for continuously decreasing rainfall in june heavy rainfall events and associated cloud top patterns represented notable trends at the 3 hourly scale in fact typhoon related cloud and synoptic patterns in september would not have been found if this study focused on monthly data the increasing occurrence of vigorous deep convection in august september is important for understanding the local changes in cloud systems over korea related to global climate change along with the decreasing cloud top in june the elevated cloud tops in august indicate a shift of the cloud system toward late summer associated with the strengthened secondary changma period this was supported by the meridional evolutionary pattern of geopotential height and equivalent potential temperature at 850 hpa in relation to the cloud trend further research will be needed from various observational

level was 4 6 k colder than that in july and august thus the colder tb11 in june is thought to be affected by the colder air temperature near the cloud top rather than being an indicator of a taller cloud top height in relation to that heavy rainfall systems over the korean peninsula are mostly determined by humid environments under low instability conditions as a part of warm type heavy rainfall song and sohn 2015 song et al 2020a sohn et al 2013 the mean cape and tpw were 143 381 j kg 1 and 49 54 mm respectively in august the contribution of cape was further increased but it was still much lower than that of continental regions such as the united states and central africa with capes of 853 1143 j kg 1 song et al 2020a the lower cape condition over korea indicated that thermodynamic instability is not a key process in producing heavy rainfall as noted in song and sohn 2015 since water vapor is typically transported from the southern ocean to the korean peninsula cape and tpw were relatively high over the ocean fig 3 shows the decadal linear trends with unit of per decade of rainfall intensity tb11 cape and tpw for the period 1983 2021 when heavy rainfall events occurred in south korea the decreasing trend of rainfall in june was linked to the increase in tb11 indicating a lowering of cloud top height and more frequent clear sky events in july no evident trends in rainfall and tb11 were observed except for the increased tb11 over the southern area the rainfall and cloud tops in august were reduced over the central region and enhanced over the southern region of the korean peninsula this indicates a shift in rainfall and vigorous convection trends towards the southern region these changes were mainly related to the increased moisture i e tpw over the southern region but decreased over the central region the cape in august exhibited a decreasing pattern over widespread areas the rainfall and tb11 changes in september exhibited similar patterns to those in august but increased rainfall and decreased tb11 trends were more prominent the enhancing cloud top trends in september were related to the widest areas with a 99 confidence level indicated as small black squares it was linked to decreasing cape and increasing tpw trends mainly over the southern ocean of the korean peninsula the tb11 changes in september were also characterized by a west east pattern showing increasing and decreasing trends in contrast to the north south pattern in august these patterns were inversely correlated with the spatial patterns of tpw trends however the increasing cape and tb11 in june as well as the decreasing cape and tb11 in august september are difficult to be intuitively understood the numerical experiments of song et al 2017 showed that the storm height of heavy rainfall tended to be lowered under humid and low instability conditions i e high tpw and low cape as a result of warm type heavy rainfall under humid and abundant cloud conditions the vertical gradient of temperature can be weakened leading to a neutralized atmospheric column with a relatively low cape fig 4 exhibited the weakened vertical gradient between 300 and 500 hpa and 1000 hpa in august september by contrast the temperature gradient increased in june inducing the increase of cape in conclusion cape is not a good indicator for explaining the warm type heavy rainfall as noted by song and sohn 2015 and song et al 2020a heavy rainfall systems over the korean peninsula are more affected by dynamical forcings than by thermodynamic instability in particular hong 2004 emphasized that heavy rainfall systems over korea was characterized as thermodynamically near neural condition i e low cape in contrast to large cape over the united states if a tremendous water vapor is supplied by the dynamic forcings e g horizontal moisture convergence cloud top height can be elevated as a result of the increased relative humidity the mean composite results for 1983 2021 exhibited strong dynamic forcings with vertical connections for upper level divergence at 200 hpa mid level updraft at 500 hpa and mfc when heavy rainfall occurred in south korea fig 5 moreover a strong convergence between the cold dry continental and warm moist maritime air masses could be clearly identified in particular tremendous moisture transported by southwesterly winds around the periphery of the northwestern pacific high is an important dynamical factor that induces a humid environment in korea from june to september the eastward and northward components of the moisture flux at 850 hpa tended to weaken and strengthen respectively it is related to the northward propagation of the northwest pacific high from june to september the heavy rain systems in june and september were more affected by dynamic forcings than those in july and august as noted in the reddish areas in fig 5 by contrast the thermodynamic instability expressed by cape was largest in august fig 2 the decadal linear trends for the synoptic charts at the upper mid lower levels are presented in fig 6 in june the northward propagation of the northwestern pacific high was weakening and it was associated with a reduction in mid level updraft and mfc over the southern ocean of the korean peninsula as noted by lee at al 2021 drought and flood years in june were closely related to the northward propagation of the northwestern pacific high these changes can partially explain the observed decreasing rainfall and increasing tb11 trends in june in july no evident decadal trend was observed except for a strengthened anticyclonic circulation around north eastern china the upper level divergence mid level updraft and mfc in august also exhibited north south patterns over the middle and southern regions of korea consistent with the rainfall tb11 and tpw trends the enhanced moisture toward the southern region of korea was a result of the strengthened convergence between anticyclonic circulation in the east china sea and cyclonic circulation in the eastern ocean of korea among these four months september was characterized by the largest dynamic change exhibiting enhanced cyclonic circulations over the shandong peninsula at the upper level and the southern ocean of the korean peninsula at mid lower levels these circulation changes induced strong upper level divergence and mid level updrafts along with a tremendous water vapor supply over the korean peninsula this was also related to the weakening of the mid level updraft and mfc over the yellow sea these synoptic patterns in september can explain the spatial distribution changes of tb11 and tpw with the west east gradient as well as the rainfall observations this study also addressed the possible relationship between typhoons and tb11 changes while considering that typhoons can exhibit the lowest tb11 i e highest cloud top height over a wide area among all rain systems in korea song et al 2020 note that isolated thunderstorms can also exhibit the lower tb11 pattern but its spatial coverage is limited to inland regions in korea the number of typhoons passing over korea over the past two decades september 2002 2021 increased by 414 compared with september 1983 2001 thus these systems accounted for a large portion of heavy rain events in september fig 1 thus we can conclude that the more frequent occurrence of deep convections with a lower tb11 in september was closely related to frequent typhoon passes over korea over the past four decades this is also consistent with lee et al 2019 who showed that typhoon track density in september 1983 2016 increased around the east china sea and korea while it decreased in the western pacific regions located at latitudes below 20 n in association with a greater expansion of subtropical high and strong easterly winds over the latitude band of 30 40 n both park et al 2011 and lee et al 2019 indicated that the weakening vertical wind shear over mid latitudes is an important factor inducing more typhoon visits occurrences over the korean peninsula as displayed in fig 6 the horizontal wind speed at mid upper levels in september was significantly weakened in the direction opposite to the mean westerly wind indicating weakening of the upper level jet stream fig 7 in the supporting information further shows the climatological mean and decadal trend of geopotential height z850 and equivalent potential temperature gradient at 850 hpa Î´Î¸850 Î´y over the 124 131 e area here Î´Î¸850 Î´y can represent an approximate location of the meiyu baiu changma monsoon fronts tomita et al 2011 li et al 2018 the climatological mean results exhibit the northward expansion of the northwestern pacific high and monsoon front from june to august followed by the southward retreat in september the decadal trend results show that the subtropical high is weakening in june and strengthening in august in addition around the convergence zone with the maximum Î´Î¸850 Î´y negative and positive trends of Î´Î¸850 Î´y are evident in june and august respectively these results suggest the weakening and strengthening of first and secondary changma periods respectively 4 summary and conclusions this study examined the long term in jjas from 1983 to 2021 climatology and decadal trend of heavy rainfall events and associated cloud top temperature inferred from the gridsat tb11 in the korean domain 124 131 e and 33 39 n thermodynamic cape tpw and mfc and dynamical patterns synoptic maps at 200 500 850 hpa were also analyzed using era5 reanalysis heavy rainfall events were representative of half of the total rainfall for the entire period and were more frequent in july august than in june or september in terms of mean climatology the tb11 in june was colder than those in july and august due to the difference in climatological air temperature in the decadal trend tb11 in june exhibited an increasing tendency over south korea in association with reduced rainfall a certain portion of the increased tb11 in june was affected by the increasing trend of environmental temperature throughout the troposphere no apparent trend was observed in july heavy rainfall events and cloud tops in august exhibited a decreasing trend over the central region and an increasing trend over the southern region of the korean peninsula the increased occurrence of vigorous deep convection in the southern region in august was associated with tremendous moisture transport from the strengthened convergence between anticyclonic circulation in the east china sea and cyclonic circulation located in the eastern ocean of korea september was characterized by the largest dynamical change in association with enhanced cyclonic circulation around the east china sea this was related to more frequent typhoon visits in september over the korean peninsula inducing colder tb11 and increasing deep convection considering that most previous studies on long term rainfall variation over korea have been confined to rainfall and reanalysis products this study is valuable in terms of the application of long term satellite derived cloud data over a wide area including land and sea although no obvious trend was found on a monthly scale except for continuously decreasing rainfall in june heavy rainfall events and associated cloud top patterns represented notable trends at the 3 hourly scale in fact typhoon related cloud and synoptic patterns in september would not have been found if this study focused on monthly data the increasing occurrence of vigorous deep convection in august september is important for understanding the local changes in cloud systems over korea related to global climate change along with the decreasing cloud top in june the elevated cloud tops in august indicate a shift of the cloud system toward late summer associated with the strengthened secondary changma period this was supported by the meridional evolutionary pattern of geopotential height and equivalent potential temperature at 850 hpa in relation to the cloud trend further research will be needed from various observational

approach to address swat s reservoir operation limitation which aligns very well with the presented extensive literature the hydrology of bas is the most complex and the least studied among the nile

simulated the water balance inside the bas without studying the effect of the future development scenarios in the bas on the downstream countries which is the main objective of this paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the bas basin is a part of the eastern nile basin that drains water to the white nile at 9 370 n 31 550e it extends from 3 40 n 31 40e to 9 60 n 36 30 e and lies mainly in ethiopia and south sudan bas is characterized by large variations in altitudes refer to fig 1a high elevations are mainly found in the east and south reaching up to 3 200 m above mean sea level amsl associated with steep slopes in the middle the terrain suddenly drops towards the outlet of bas at the white nile with elevations reaching 400 m amsl associated with mild slopes bas catchment is composed of seven main tributaries the major tributary of which is the baro river whose name changes into the sobat river after it crosses the international borders between ethiopia and south sudan there are some other tributaries that connect directly to the baro such as alwero and pibor rivers the pibor also has some main tributaries that connect to it which are gilo akobo and agwei bas includes several counties from ethiopia and south sudan such as gambella oromiya southern nations nationalities and peoples snnp beneshangul gumuz bs g regions see fig 1b nelson and burtis 1995 while pibor sub catchments contribute with at most 10 of the overall flow of bas despite pibor catchment being bigger than baro catchment the baro catchment has the biggest contribution to the flow at bas outlet at hillet doleib with a value reaching 55 of the whole flow pibor river s low contribution is mostly due to two factors first a lower yearly total rainfall compared to other catchments and second mild slopes and flat terrain for a significant stretch of its downstream catchment all river catchments in the basin have losses at the downstream due to very mild near the outlets which permits losses and spilling to happen the spilling from the baro river to the machar marches is the most researched and quantified amount 2 2 research methodology the procedures followed to achieve the research goals are summarized in the flow chart presented in fig 2 after carrying out the literature review different types of data required for the setup of the numerical models are compiled and collected these datasets include static terrain data observed meteorological data observed river flow data as well as data needed to build future development scenarios the compiled data are used in the setup of the hydrological model swat to generate runoff at specific locations in addition to the calibration and validation tests sensitivity analyses of the model parameters are performed for the swat model the output from swat is linked to the hec ressim model after model verification the hec ressim is used to simulate current flow conditions baseline scenario and future development scenarios 2 3 model setup 2 3 1 description of numerical models 2 3 1 1 swat model arc swat soil and water assessment tool integrated with arcgis version 2012 10 18 is a physically based semi distributed continuous time model that requires input data that varies with space or time or both such as topography soil properties land cover vegetation and weather in swat basins can be divided to sub basins in to account for spatial variation of different model parameters and for calculation purposes at different scales moreover swat divides sub basins to homogenous areas called hydrologic response units hru where each unit has a unique combination of land cover soil type slope class and management practice the processes that can be performed by swat related to hydrology are infiltration percolation surface runoff shallow and deep aquifers flow evapotranspiration and channel routing neitsch et al 2011 the main governing equation for all the hydrological processes in swat model is the water balance equation as below 1 sw t sw o r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content sw o is the initial soil water content r day is the rainfall depth for the day q surf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess e a is the amount of evapotranspiration w seep is the amount of percolation and bypass flow exiting the soil profile bottom and q gw is the amount of return flow to simulate each of these water balance components swat incorporates combinations of physical and empirical methods that could be used importantly surface runoff is estimated by using the modified soil conservation service curve number method nrcs 1986 more information about swat model is available in neitsch et al 2011 and arnold et al 2011 swat has shown good performance in simulating and predicting river flow in different rivers including the nile aloui et al 2023 van griensven et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 however as in the case of many other hydrological models a major model limitation is the inadequacy of methods incorporated in swat to accurately simulate reservoir operation akoko et al 2021 to overcome this limitation one approach is to couple swat with a reservoir simulation model that can capture reservoir operation with higher accuracy touch et al 2020 which we followed in this study an offline coupling approach was used in which swat was configured to run for the whole simulation period using a simplified representation of the reservoirs on the river system following model calibration validation flows were passed to the reservoir simulation model i e hec ressim in which a more refined and accurate representation of reservoir operation is incorporated and used to adjust the simulated flows the river system in our study area is not extensively regulated which strengthens the validity of this coupling strategy 2 3 1 2 hec ressim hec ressim is a famous reservoir simulation model that has been extensively used in different reservoir simulation case studies including studies that have coupled it with hydrological models kim et al 2020 the software simulates different reservoir operations for one or more reservoirs for different operational objectives the model is suitable for high and low flow water management practices water supply for planning studies detailed reservoir regulation plan investigations and real time decision support hec ressim can represent reservoir systems by building a network of elements junctions reaches diversion and reservoirs the software can simulate single and continuous events using a user defined time step hec ressim simulates reservoir operation using the concept of a guide curve that represents the decision makers target elevation for each time step the software can also perform rule based simulations by allowing the addition of operational constraints that are written in if then else statements the reservoir pool storage could be discretized to multiple zones and each zone can have different operation decisions and constraints more detailed information are found in the software manual klipsch and hurst 2007 usace 2013 there are other alternative models that could be more complex such as weap sieber 2006 or riverware zagona et al 2010 that are advantageous over hec ressim in including optimization features for reservoir operation however there is no need for optimization to meet the objectives and scope of this study also hec ressim has wide application in evaluating the impacts of development projects using simulation approach belachew and mekonen 2014 piman et al 2013 fayaed et al 2013 accordingly hec ressim was considered to be adequate to perform this study 2 4 models setup process 2 4 1 swat model setup the outlets at which swat will calculate flow and delineate the sub catchment were entered considering projects locations and flow stations the output of delineation resulted in 48 sub catchments as illustrated in fig 3 swat divides each sub catchment to homogenous regions based on land cover soil and slope class called hydrologic response units hrus then the model is applied to each hru separately and outputs are summed up at sub catchments outlets the main purpose of these hru is to increase accuracy and describe physical processes in a better way daily time step is adopted for the bas hydrological simulation the simulation period is the same as that of meteorological input data that extends from 1950 to 2008 considering a warmup period of 2 years in order to reach steady state and representative values for some model parameters rainfall distribution is represented in swat using skewed normal distribution which proved to generate more representative stream flow manning s equation is used to calculate the flow rates and velocities the hydrologic muskingum river routing method is used for flow routing runoff is estimated by using the modified method of scs curve number method and to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet the hargreaves method has been used due to large swamps and losses in the bas basin that do not have enough data to model three virtual reservoirs were added to three sub catchments that contain high losses to simulate swamp losses 2 4 2 hec ressim model setup fig 4 shows the stream alignment and the different rivers included in the model the locations of the junctions were adjusted to be at the sub catchment outlets that were used in swat to study the impacts of proposed development projects on the nile flows arriving at had the stream alignment was extended beyond the boundaries of bas to include other rivers and catchments like the blue nile tekeze atbara white nile and the main nile till aswan the lag time routing method is used for flow routing in the hec ressim model a total lag time of 400 hours is deduced from comparing the observed flow at gambella and the outlet at hillet doleib this lag time difference is distributed among the river reaches downstream gambella till the outlet over a length of 400 km the spilling in baro at the mashar marshes is expressed in the models as a function of the baro flow itself this relation was originally developed by sutcliffe and parks 1999 to quantify the spilling from baro on an annual basis this function is modified to estimate monthly values of spilling from baro fig 5 shows the developed spilling function from baro in comparison with observed data from nile encyclopedia hassan 2012 reservoir physical and operational data are added to the model physical data are mainly the dam s body dimensions gates and spillways capacity curves pool elevation storage surface area relation pool net evaporation power plant data and tail water rating curve operational data define the driving rules that will control and define the dam releases water allocation for different uses and pool losses for all reservoirs the pool storage is divided into three different operational zones each zone has a different set of operation rules and constrains these three zones are inactive conservation and flood control zones the input flows that are used in the bas model are the runoff generated from swat model for bas catchments after the calibration and validation process covering the period from 1952 to 2008 with a monthly time step observed flows from the white nile blue nile and atbara rivers are added to the extended model 2 5 datasets used the main data types needed for the setup of swat are terrain elevation land cover soil and meteorological data hec ressim requires some inputs like river flow proposed and existing projects data moreover both models require observed flow and reservoir pool elevation records for calibration validation and verification purposes 2 5 1 static data this type of data describes the shape of earth s surface in the study area which is the base for building the model its main use is to determine the study area boundaries catchment delineation also it contributes to the calculations of runoff terrain data used in the hydrological model are mainly a digital elevation model dem the river network layer and the river junctions and outlets 2 5 1 1 dem fig 1a shows a void filled srtm 90m dem which is compiled from hydrosheds website hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives introduced by usgs lehner et al 2011 the spatial resolution of the srtm is 90 m at the equator the vertical accuracy in elevation does not exceed 16 m hydrosheds performed several processing steps including modification to the original srtm in order to increase accuracy decrease errors and fill no data cells these modifications include filtering merging data from different dem versions void filling using different algorithms and interpolation to add logical values to no data cells stream burning and upscaling techniques also manual corrections were made where necessary preliminary quality assessments indicate that the accuracy of hydrosheds significantly exceeds that of existing global watershed and river maps lehner 2013 2 5 1 2 river network since the stream network over the landscape is known it is good approach to impose that known drainage pattern into the dem that methodology is known as burning in the streams for this purpose a river network 15 arcsecond resolution 500 m at equator covering africa was downloaded from the usgs hydrosheds website the network is originally dem generated at 3 arcsececond resolution but it underwent many corrections and modifications in parallel with dem conditioning and processing lehner et al 2011 the derived river network was compared visually to the rivers of the digital chart of the world dcw arcworld and various atlases and paper maps lehner 2013 2 5 1 3 junctions and outlets junctions are points of a specific interest in the model a junction may be just a confluence of two streams or a location of dam or irrigation project also may be flow observation station watershed or basin outlet in order to know the flow at the project locations their coordinates should be included in the delineation process in addition the observation stations coordinates should be included in the delineation as junctions for calibration and validation purpose the coordinates of the model junctions were compiled from entro hassan 2012 fig 1a shows the main junctions used in swat model and the dem and river network used 2 5 1 4 land cover data land cover data is usually formed by analyzing satellite or aerial imagery land cover is a mandatory component in runoff and plant growth calculations the land cover data used in the model is globcover 2009 v2 3 team et al 2011 this dataset has spatial resolution of 300 m 300 m with global coverage it contains 22 land cover types that are well documented and comparable all over the world fig 6a shows that the land covers in the bas is dominated by pasture and savanna in the ethiopian highlands followed by forest and shrubs at middle altitudes major existences of agriculture land exist in pibor sub basin and near the outlet at hillet doleib wetland and water bodies can be noticed within the pibor sub basin and at the location of machar marshes 2 5 1 5 soil data the arcswat model requires data on different textural and physicochemical properties such as soil texture available water content hydraulic conductivity bulk density and organic carbon content for different layers of each soil type the soil data is based on soil categories provided by the international soil resource and information centre isric that has compiled a draft 1 1 million scale soil map for northeast africa batjes 2005 a total of 438 soil classes are found for the whole eastern nile basin each soil class is classified into 11 soil textures refer to fig 6b 2 5 2 hydrometric and meteorological data this data is the main drive of the model s water balance and the main input in the runoff calculations it includes rainfall temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and potential evaporation optional there are 60 different metrological observation stations inside or near the study area that are available to us during this study but unfortunately most of these stations have problems related to consistency recording period and available time step therefore it was better to use a global data set after verifying and comparing it with observations the ghcn2 modified version of the global historical climatology network data set was used ghcn2 rainfall and temperature data on bas available from nasa on daily time step and in grid format covering the entire basin area http hydro engr scu edu files gridded obs global 1950 2008 accessed 01 dec 2022 it has temporal extent of 59 years 1950 2008 and spatial resolution of 50 kilometers geographic wgs84 found in daily time step that dataset encompasses time series for rainfall and temperature maximum and minimum swat requires weather data point for each sub catchment separately since the time series data of ghcn2 are gap free extracted time series were written directly to each of the delineated sub catchment in bas observed river flow is essential for the calibration and validation process the study area contains many stations but the available data for most of them contain gaps or have short recording length only two of them are without gaps and have relatively long time series record these two stations are gambella and hillet doleib the data are found in monthly time step from the period of 1920 1993 for gambella and 1905 1983 for hillet doleib the source of the data is the ethiopian master plan made by ethiopian ministry of water and energy awulachew et al 2007 2 5 3 data for the developed scenarios 2 5 3 1 baseline simulation the purpose of this experiment is to simulate the historical flow conditions existing structures and water resource projects in order to create a reference baseline conditions to compare them against the outcomes of development scenarios experiments table 1 shows the key characteristics of existing dams and irrigation projects that are taken in consideration in the baseline experiment in the hec ressim model existing projects data was compiled from entro hassan 2012 there are additional projects and abstractions located on other sub basins of the en especially the blue nile but current model is concerned only with bas and other sub basins are modeled by considering the effect of their net downstream observed flows swat model outputs are used to force the hec ressim model in the period 1952 2008 within the bas sub basin while for other sub basins the downstream historical observed flow records were used to force the extended hec ressim model 2 5 3 2 development scenarios development plans in the bas sub basins are largely dependent on water resources and can be broadly categorized into hydropower projects and irrigated agriculture schemes in this paper the potential development projects were classified under three development scenarios scenario 1 represents the basin conditions when all potential hydropower projects are implemented and operational table 2 and fig 7 show the locations and key characteristics of the potential hydropower projects in basin and their key characteristics as included in scenario 1 there are ten proposed dams all of which are located in the upstream part of bas mainly upstream gambella this area has high potential for hydropower generation due to its high terrain slopes and sudden terrain drops which provides favorable conditions for hydropower generation the total installed capacity for potential hydropower projects is about 2816 mw and the total storage capacity for these dams is estimated to be 24 km3 among them tams dam has the highest installed capacity of 1060 mw and also the highest storage capacity of 10 4 km3 hassan 2012 one of the dams included in scenario 1 is geba r dam which is currently under construction since late 2014 but it is included in scenario 1 assuming it is constructed and under operation now this dam is located on geba river a main tributary of baro river and is intended for hydropower but since this dam has been already under construction we give it further special attention and studied it separately to detect its potential impacts on the nile inflow arriving at had during the first filling period and before its full operation scenario 2 includes all potential irrigated agriculture schemes in the basin and finally scenario 3 represents the ultimate development conditions in the basin where all potential hydropower and irrigated agriculture schemes are implemented and operational i e scenario 3 is simply a combination of scenario 1 scenario 2 table 3 and fig 8 show locations and key characteristics of potential irrigated agriculture schemes in bas sub basin which are included in the development scenario 2 downstream of gambella terrain slopes are mild providing favorite conditions for supplementary irrigation based agriculture developments according to the ethiopian ministry of water and energy bas is the second largest river basin in ethiopia with land suitable for irrigation estimated at 1 million hectares awulachew 2007 a total of 14 irrigation schemes with an area of 1 million hectares are supplied from 6 dam reservoirs and 2 pumping stations the overall supplementary irrigation demands for these projects are estimated at 6 km3 year which are planned to be supplied by dams with total reservoirs storage capacity of 16 2 km3 scenario 3 is a combination of scenario 1 and scenario 2 and represents the ultimate conditions of water based development in bas it includes 9 hydropower dams 5 irrigation dams 1 dual purpose dam gilo1 dam and 2 pumping schemes the total storage capacity for dams included in this scenario is estimated to be 37 km3 scenario 3 is expected to have the most significant effect on the contribution of bas at had due to the large storages encountered 2 6 model calibration and validation 2 6 1 sensitivity analysis for swat model sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify the most sensitive parameters that affect the flow sensitivity analysis in swat combines the latin hypercube lh sampling and one factor at a time oat sampling holvoet et al 2005 a total of 27 parameters that affect the water balance and flow equations were subject to this analysis model simulations were carried out for the period from 1952 1993 and assessed at gambella and hillet doleib initially the sensitivity analysis was carried out for gambella sub catchment only and then repeated for the rest of the sub catchments of bas excluding gambella this resulted in two sets of flow sensitive parameters according to lenhart et al 2002 if the relative sensitivity is less than 0 05 the model sensitivity to this parameter can be neglected insensitive parameter accordingly table 4 summarizes the most sensitive parameters that affect the water balance and flow calculations in bas associated with their sensitivity ranking 2 6 2 calibration of swat model swat cup is external software linked with swat and used to perform the calibration process automatically the calibration parameters are selected to be the most sensitive parameters resulted from the previous step the calibration and validation processes are made separately at gambella and hillet doleib swat cup allows evaluating the calibration process by setting an objective function depending on one of four statistical measures whose value changes by carrying trials and changing the set of parameter values in each trial optimization technique these statistical measures are the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rsr and the mean relative bias pbais the goodness of the fit is assessed based on the performance rating values moriasi et al 2007 in which the calibration performance rating can be classified as unsatisfactory satisfactory good and very good corresponding to nse values of 0 5 0 5 0 65 0 65 0 75 and 0 75 respectively table 5 shows the calibrated values at both stations which reflect certain generated flow time series this series was evaluated by using statistical measures with observations in the calibration period the upper left and lower left panels of fig 9a and b show the simulated flow using the calibrated parameters compared with the observed flows for gambella and hillet doleib stations the nse values at both stations were 0 9 gambella station and 0 75 hillet doleib station which indicates that the calibration performance rating can be classified as very good and good respectively according to moriasi et al 2007 2 6 3 validation of swat model the bas hydrological model is validated using a different simulation window at gambella and hillet doleib as shown in the upper right and lower right panels of fig 9c and d the nse values at both stations were 0 83 at gambella and 0 62 hillet doleib which indicates that the validation performance rating can be classified as very good and satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 2 6 4 validation of hec ressim model the hec ressim model is verified to check data entry water balance reservoir operation and reach flow routing the model is verified at the flow stations of gambella hillet doleib and dongola upstream of had in addition to verifying had pool elevation fig 10 shows the verification results at dongla flow station fig 10a had pool elevation fig 10b flow at gambella station fig 10c and flow at hillet doleib fig 10d the coefficient of determination and the nse are calculated at each site to assess the goodness of the simulation and they indicate the validity of the model to simulation to the flow conditions and reservoir operation in the basin 3 results and discussion in all development scenarios historical hydrometric data covering a period of 57 years from1952 to 2008 is assumed to be repeated in the future combined with the model setup for each development scenario swat s simulated stream flows are used after calibration and validation to force the hec ressim model historical observed river flows are used to consider the effect from other nile sub basins physical data for all existing and potential dams were compiled from entro hydropower toolkits hassan 2012 dam pool elevation storage surface area curves are deduced by applying spatial processing of the srtm 90m dem gates capacity curves are calculated according to orifice hydraulics lindell et al 2018 and the spillway capacity curves are calculated according to ogee weir hydraulics operation rules for dams are simplified to be based on guide curves only to produce satisfactory hydropower generation close to the target generation at some dams release allocation priority is set to ensure logical operation policy and to utilize water for the main purpose of the dam reservoirs are assumed to operate separately without tandem or cascade operation 3 1 base line simulation fig 11 shows the results of enb water balance as resulted from the baseline simulation the water balance for hec ressim model is calculated at different points and compared with historical water balance for the nile sutcliffe and parks 1999 fig 11a shows a schematic of the water balance whereas fig 11b shows a comparison of water balance figures at certain nodes from all streams in the bas with the historical values of the nile sutcliffe and parks 1999 that reflect the accuracy and consistency of hec ressim model results the effect of merowe dam in sudan which is in operation since 2010 is included in this simulation pool evaporation losses is found to be 1 54 km3 year which compares well with the estimated value by sudanese ministry of irrigation and water resources that is equal to 1 5 km3 year hassan 2012 the annual average spillage from the baro river at machar marshes is estimated at 4 75 km3 year see fig 11a the spillage from the baro river was estimated by others from 2 3 to 5 km3 year nbi and entro 2020 which is consistent with the simulation results 3 2 development scenarios fig 12a shows the simulated mean monthly flow averaged over the simulation period from 1952 to 2008 as a result of the development scenario 1 hydropower dams compared with the simulated flow from the baseline conditions it shows that in case of scenario 1 there will be an increase of the nile inflow to had by an average annual flow of 1 33 km3 year it should be noted that these results did not consider the initial filling of geba r dam what have been simulated here are the operational conditions of the dams that include only evaporation losses keeping in mind that evaporation losses are taking place it was necessary to understand the rational of the inflow increase at had to interpret that the model water balance is examined it is noted that the flow pattern upstream machar marches and downstream for all included hydropower projects is affected by the regulation effect caused by the potential dams the adopted dam operation rules are targeting to reserve water at high flow periods and to partially release it in low flow periods these operation policies resulted in a more controlled flow pattern in which flows at high flow periods decreased compared to those of baseline simulation while flow at low flow periods increased fig 12 b as a result of this flow regulation and changes in the natural flow pattern the spilling from baro river is affected fig 12c shows the average monthly spilling from baro river at machar marshes before and after adding the hydropower projects the spilling decreases at the high flow periods from august to december at the time when flows in the baro goes below the spilling threshold of 540 m3 s sutcliffe and parks 1999 this indicates that the decreased flow in baro river upstream machar marshes below the spilling threshold will result in decreased spilling and eventually will result in increased contribution from the bas to the inflow at had fig 12d shows a schematic drawing of the water balance in development scenario 1 it indicates that the losses due to baro river spilling at machar marshes is decreased from an average volume of 4 75 km3 year in the baseline simulation to an average volume of 3 32 km3 year after adding the potential hydropower projects the water balance during the filling period of geba r dam indicated flow reduction of 3 1 km3 that is used to fill the reservoir however the flow losses are decreased to 2 17 km3 at had during the filling period or 1 42 km3 in first year this is explained by the decrease in baro spilling at machar marshes due to the regulated flow pattern during initial filling of the reservoir in the operation phase of the dam it is noticed that minor losses occur due to evaporation from the reservoir surface area the evaporation losses are estimated at 3 km3 year which is negligible because the reservoir is located in an area with low net evaporation rates in development scenario 2 the prevailing irrigation pattern in bas is shown in fig 13a it is a supplementary irrigation pattern in which irrigation is applied only during the dry periods and not needed during the rainy season from august to october the irrigation pattern has two local maxima in july and in january according to the assumed demand pattern scenario 2 irrigation requirements are estimated at 6 km3 year the simulation results indicated that irrigation requirements could not be met from the basin water resources a total of 5 km3 out of the required 6 km3 could be secured annually this is explained by the fluctuations in the river flow that sometimes may not be able to fulfill the irrigation requirements the annual reduction in the inflow at had is estimated at 4 41 km3 year fig 13b this is also explained by the controlled flow pattern resulting from the dams included in scenario 2 which caused further reduction in the spilling from the baro by about 0 57 km3 year compared to the baseline simulation fig 13d as a consequence of flow reduction at had by 4 41 km3 year the hydropower generation at had will be negatively affected fig 13c shows the had s average annual hydropower energy produced under scenario 2 compared to the baseline conditions it is noticed that there will be a reduction in hydropower energy generation of 5 on average while the maximum reduction may reach 24 the ultimate development conditions in the bas basin was simulated by the development scenario 3 in which all potential hydropower projects and irrigated agriculture schemes are assumed to be in place and operational it is found that scenario 1 with all hydropower generation projects increased the flow at had by 1 33 km3 year while scenario 2 with all irrigation schemes decreased the flow at had by 4 41 km3 year the combination of the two scenarios resulted in an intermediate effect in which the apparent flow reduction from scenario 2 will be relaxed scenario 3 is expected to reduce the annual flow at had by 3 61 km3 year fig 14a fig 14b shows the reduction in had s hydropower energy generation with an average reduction of 4 and a maximum reduction of 19 3 3 comparison with previous studies there are very limited studies that investigated the development projects and their impacts on the bas and the downstream possibly due to the complexity of simulating the hydrology and water balance of this part of the nile basin nbi and entro 2020 presented a multi model framework that comprises mike 11 and mike she to simulate the hydrology and river swamp hydraulics of the bas that were used to simulate the mashar marches spilling mechanism and to evaluate the marches water balance table 6 provides a comparison between our results and the study prepared by nbi and entro 2020 as the table shows under the baseline simulation there is a similarity between both studies in simulating the baro flow at the upstream downstream locations and the spillage to mashar the fact that both studies use completely different modeling approaches could be an indication of their validity and credibility nbi and entro 2020 studied development scenarios among them was one scenario assuming all hydropower dams were built and operational and also another scenario that assumes all hydropower dams and irrigation dams were built and operational as table 6 shows those two scenarios do not compare well with our scenario results that assume the same type of development this dissimilarity could be attributed to different reasons but possibly nbi and entro 2020 might have assumed higher dam storage capacities and higher irrigation abstractions this understanding could not be verified as nbi and entro 2020 did not include a detailed scenarios description nonetheless based on our study it is evident that there is a threshold of a total storage capacity that if introduced to the bas and managed properly will result in more controlled flow and fewer spillage losses and eventually increase the outflow of the whole bas basin however development will lose this benefit if excessive development produces more storage capacity that is greater than this threshold capacity and the flow reduction at had would rise 4 conclusions the baro akobo sobat bas basin is one of the four sub basins of the eastern nile basin blue nile baro akobo sobat tekeze atbara setit and main nile the eastern nile basin contributes about 85 of the nile flow arriving at aswan bas is target for several plans for large scale water infrastructure development projects dams hydropower and irrigated agriculture in ethiopia and south sudan the impacts of the planned developments to downstream countries were not investigated in detail and are not clear from the water security perspective nevertheless bas could provide a venue for joint cooperative development potential among the basin countries in conserving the huge substantial losses from the vast swamps in the basin e g machar marshes in south sudan this study presented an assessment of the impact of the proposed water resources development projects in the bas river system and the anticipated impacts on water flows arriving at aswan the main conclusions of this research can be summarized as follows two models were configured and coupled to simulate the system hydrology using swat model and the water balance using hec ressim model in the basin sensitivity analysis for swat model was carried out and resulted in the most sensitive parameters that were used to calibrate and validate the model using ground observations of flow discharges and reservoir water levels the calibration validation results for the two models showed statistical correlations that are satisfactory to very good using the developed modelling framework for bas simulations were run for three development scenarios as well as a baseline simulation i e existing conditions without any future developments the development scenarios that were studied were the development of the hydropower potential scenario 1 in the basin 10 dams capacity 2816 mw irrigated agriculture development scenario 2 14 irrigation scheme area 1 million hectares and combined hydropower and irrigation development scenario 3 also the research studied the impacts of the filling of geba r dam capacity 310 mw that is currently under construction model outcomes of different scenarios were compared with those of the baseline simulation and the results showed some changes to had s current conditions the hydropower based development scenario in bas enhanced the flow arriving at aswan by 1 3 km3 year because the controlled flow pattern produced by the projected dams reduced swamp losses the filling process of geba r dam under construction will decrease the flow contribution arriving at aswan by about 2 17 km3 the irrigated agriculture development scenario decreased the bas flow contribution arriving at aswan by 4 4 km3 year the combined hydropower and irrigation development scenario decreased the bas flow contribution arriving at aswan by 3 6 km3 year the hydropower production at aswan was slightly affected due to the above scenarios with a reduction of 5 on average for the case of the irrigated agriculture development scenario bas could offer a

hassan 2012 the calibration and validation results for the bas catchment were unsatisfactory at the bas outlet in hillet doleib flow station dams and other development projects were studied roughly as swat had limited options in regard to simulating water resources projects in addition the potential development projects in bas were not included the most comprehensive study about bas is carried out

approach to address swat s reservoir operation limitation which aligns very well with the presented extensive literature the hydrology of bas is the most complex and the least studied among the nile river sub basins due to limited observations inaccessible locations and the long history of political instability and civil wars in the region entro offered an analysis of a pre existing mike hydro basin model that contains the entire baro akobo sobat sub basin nbi and entro 2020 the integrated hydrological modelling system mike she links a river model mike 11 in 1d to a gridded topography

upstream of the machar marshes are represented by the mike hydro basin model the mike she model had simulated many development scenarios nbi and entro 2020 the previous models prepared by entro simulated the water balance inside the bas without studying the effect of the future development scenarios in the bas on the downstream countries which is the main objective of this paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the bas basin is a part of the eastern nile basin that drains water to the white nile at 9 370 n 31 550e it extends from 3 40 n 31 40e to 9 60 n 36 30 e and lies mainly in ethiopia and south sudan bas is characterized by large variations in altitudes refer to fig 1a high elevations are mainly found in the east and south reaching up to 3 200 m above mean sea level amsl associated with steep slopes in the middle the terrain suddenly drops towards the outlet of bas at the white nile with elevations reaching 400 m amsl associated with mild slopes bas catchment is composed of seven main tributaries the major tributary of which is the baro river whose name changes into the sobat river after it crosses the international borders between ethiopia and south sudan there are some other tributaries that connect directly to the baro such as alwero and pibor rivers the pibor also has some main tributaries that connect to it which are gilo akobo and agwei bas includes several counties from ethiopia and south sudan such as gambella oromiya southern nations nationalities and peoples snnp beneshangul gumuz bs g regions see fig 1b nelson and burtis 1995 while pibor sub catchments contribute with at most 10 of the overall flow of bas despite pibor catchment being bigger than baro catchment the baro catchment has the biggest contribution to the flow at bas outlet at hillet doleib with a value reaching 55 of the whole flow pibor river s low contribution is mostly due to two factors first a lower yearly total rainfall compared to other catchments and second mild slopes and flat terrain for a significant stretch of its downstream catchment all river catchments in the basin have losses at the downstream due to very mild near the outlets which permits losses and spilling to happen the spilling from the baro river to the machar marches is the most researched and quantified amount 2 2 research methodology the procedures followed to achieve the research goals are summarized in the flow chart presented in fig 2 after carrying out the literature review different types of data required for the setup of the numerical models are compiled and collected these datasets include static terrain data observed meteorological data observed river flow data as well as data needed to build future development scenarios the compiled data are used in the setup of the hydrological model swat to generate runoff at specific locations in addition to the calibration and validation tests sensitivity analyses of the model parameters are performed for the swat model the output from swat is linked to the hec ressim model after model verification the hec ressim is used to simulate current flow conditions baseline scenario and future development scenarios 2 3 model setup 2 3 1 description of numerical models 2 3 1 1 swat model arc swat soil and water assessment tool integrated with arcgis version 2012 10 18 is a physically based semi distributed continuous time model that requires input data that varies with space or time or both such as topography soil properties land cover vegetation and weather in swat basins can be divided to sub basins in to account for spatial variation of different model parameters and for calculation purposes at different scales moreover swat divides sub basins to homogenous areas called hydrologic response units hru where each unit has a unique combination of land cover soil type slope class and management practice the processes that can be performed by swat related to hydrology are infiltration percolation surface runoff shallow and deep aquifers flow evapotranspiration and channel routing neitsch et al 2011 the main governing equation for all the hydrological processes in swat model is the water balance equation as below 1 sw t sw o r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content sw o is the initial soil water content r day is the rainfall depth for the day q surf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess e a is the amount of evapotranspiration w seep is the amount of percolation and bypass flow exiting the soil profile bottom and q gw is the amount of return flow to simulate each of these water balance components swat incorporates combinations of physical and empirical methods that could be used importantly surface runoff is estimated by using the modified soil conservation service curve number method nrcs 1986 more information about swat model is available in neitsch et al 2011 and arnold et al 2011 swat has shown good performance in simulating and predicting river flow in different rivers including the nile aloui et al 2023 van griensven et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 however as in the case of many other hydrological models a major model limitation is the inadequacy of methods incorporated in swat to accurately simulate reservoir operation akoko et al 2021 to overcome this limitation one approach is to couple swat with a reservoir simulation model that can capture reservoir operation with higher accuracy touch et al 2020 which we followed in this study an offline coupling approach was used in which swat was configured to run for the whole simulation period using a simplified representation of the reservoirs on the river system following model calibration validation flows were passed to the reservoir simulation model i e hec ressim in which a more refined and accurate representation of reservoir operation is incorporated and used to adjust the simulated flows the river system in our study area is not extensively regulated which strengthens the validity of this coupling strategy 2 3 1 2 hec ressim hec ressim is a famous reservoir simulation model that has been extensively used in different reservoir simulation case studies including studies that have coupled it with hydrological models kim et al 2020 the software simulates different reservoir operations for one or more reservoirs for different operational objectives the model is suitable for high and low flow water management practices water supply for planning studies detailed reservoir regulation plan investigations and real time decision support hec ressim can represent reservoir systems by building a network of elements junctions reaches diversion and reservoirs the software can simulate single and continuous events using a user defined time step hec ressim simulates reservoir operation using the concept of a guide curve that represents the decision makers target elevation for each time step the software can also perform rule based simulations by allowing the addition of operational constraints that are written in if then else statements the reservoir pool storage could be discretized to multiple zones and each zone can have different operation decisions and constraints more detailed information are found in the software manual klipsch and hurst 2007 usace 2013 there are other alternative models that could be more complex such as weap sieber 2006 or riverware zagona et al 2010 that are advantageous over hec ressim in including optimization features for reservoir operation however there is no need for optimization to meet the objectives and scope of this study also hec ressim has wide application in evaluating the impacts of development projects using simulation approach belachew and mekonen 2014 piman et al 2013 fayaed et al 2013 accordingly hec ressim was considered to be adequate to perform this study 2 4 models setup process 2 4 1 swat model setup the outlets at which swat will calculate flow and delineate the sub catchment were entered considering projects locations and flow stations the output of delineation resulted in 48 sub catchments as illustrated in fig 3 swat divides each sub catchment to homogenous regions based on land cover soil and slope class called hydrologic response units hrus then the model is applied to each hru separately and outputs are summed up at sub catchments outlets the main purpose of these hru is to increase accuracy and describe physical processes in a better way daily time step is adopted for the bas hydrological simulation the simulation period is the same as that of meteorological input data that extends from 1950 to 2008 considering a warmup period of 2 years in order to reach steady state and representative values for some model parameters rainfall distribution is represented in swat using skewed normal distribution which proved to generate more representative stream flow manning s equation is used to calculate the flow rates and velocities the hydrologic muskingum river routing method is used for flow routing runoff is estimated by using the modified method of scs curve number method and to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet the hargreaves method has been used due to large swamps and losses in the bas basin that do not have enough data to model three virtual reservoirs were added to three sub catchments that contain high losses to simulate swamp losses 2 4 2 hec ressim model setup fig 4 shows the stream alignment and the different rivers included in the model the locations of the junctions were adjusted to be at the sub catchment outlets that were used in swat to study the impacts of proposed development projects on the nile flows arriving at had the stream alignment was extended beyond the boundaries of bas to include other rivers and catchments like the blue nile tekeze atbara white nile and the main nile till aswan the lag time routing method is used for flow routing in the hec ressim model a total lag time of 400 hours is deduced from comparing the observed flow at gambella and the outlet at hillet doleib this lag time difference is distributed among the river reaches downstream gambella till the outlet over a length of 400 km the spilling in baro at the mashar marshes is expressed in the models as a function of the baro flow itself this relation was originally developed by sutcliffe and parks 1999 to quantify the spilling from baro on an annual basis this function is modified to estimate monthly values of spilling from baro fig 5 shows the developed spilling function from baro in comparison with observed data from nile encyclopedia hassan 2012 reservoir physical and operational data are added to the model physical data are mainly the dam s body dimensions gates and spillways capacity curves pool elevation storage surface area relation pool net evaporation power plant data and tail water rating curve operational data define the driving rules that will control and define the dam releases water allocation for different uses and pool losses for all reservoirs the pool storage is divided into three different operational zones each zone has a different set of operation rules and constrains these three zones are inactive conservation and flood control zones the input flows that are used in the bas model are the runoff generated from swat model for bas catchments after the calibration and validation process covering the period from 1952 to 2008 with a monthly time step observed flows from the white nile blue nile and atbara rivers are added to the extended model 2 5 datasets used the main data types needed for the setup of swat are terrain elevation land cover soil and meteorological data hec ressim requires some inputs like river flow proposed and existing projects data moreover both models require observed flow and reservoir pool elevation records for calibration validation and verification purposes 2 5 1 static data this type of data describes the shape of earth s surface in the study area which is the base for building the model its main use is to determine the study area boundaries catchment delineation also it contributes to the calculations of runoff terrain data used in the hydrological model are mainly a digital elevation model dem the river network layer and the river junctions and outlets 2 5 1 1 dem fig 1a shows a void filled srtm 90m dem which is compiled from hydrosheds website hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives introduced by usgs lehner et al 2011 the spatial resolution of the srtm is 90 m at the equator the vertical accuracy in elevation does not exceed 16 m hydrosheds performed several processing steps including modification to the original srtm in order to increase accuracy decrease errors and fill no data cells these modifications include filtering merging data from different dem versions void filling using different algorithms and interpolation to add logical values to no data cells stream burning and upscaling techniques also manual corrections were made where necessary preliminary quality assessments indicate that the accuracy of hydrosheds significantly exceeds that of existing global watershed and river maps lehner 2013 2 5 1 2 river network since the stream network over the landscape is known it is good approach to impose that known drainage pattern into the dem that methodology is known as burning in the streams for this purpose a river network 15 arcsecond resolution 500 m at equator covering africa was downloaded from the usgs hydrosheds website the network is originally dem generated at 3 arcsececond resolution but it underwent many corrections and modifications in parallel with dem conditioning and processing lehner et al 2011 the derived river network was compared visually to the rivers of the digital chart of the world dcw arcworld and various atlases and paper maps lehner 2013 2 5 1 3 junctions and outlets junctions are points of a specific interest in the model a junction may be just a confluence of two streams or a location of dam or irrigation project also may be flow observation station watershed or basin outlet in order to know the flow at the project locations their coordinates should be included in the delineation process in addition the observation stations coordinates should be included in the delineation as junctions for calibration and validation purpose the coordinates of the model junctions were compiled from entro hassan 2012 fig 1a shows the main junctions used in swat model and the dem and river network used 2 5 1 4 land cover data land cover data is usually formed by analyzing satellite or aerial imagery land cover is a mandatory component in runoff and plant growth calculations the land cover data used in the model is globcover 2009 v2 3 team et al 2011 this dataset has spatial resolution of 300 m 300 m with global coverage it contains 22 land cover types that are well documented and comparable all over the world fig 6a shows that the land covers in the bas is dominated by pasture and savanna in the ethiopian highlands followed by forest and shrubs at middle altitudes major existences of agriculture land exist in pibor sub basin and near the outlet at hillet doleib wetland and water bodies can be noticed within the pibor sub basin and at the location of machar marshes 2 5 1 5 soil data the arcswat model requires data on different textural and physicochemical properties such as soil texture available water content hydraulic conductivity bulk density and organic carbon content for different layers of each soil type the soil data is based on soil categories provided by the international soil resource and information centre isric that has compiled a draft 1 1 million scale soil map for northeast africa batjes 2005 a total of 438 soil classes are found for the whole eastern nile basin each soil class is classified into 11 soil textures refer to fig 6b 2 5 2 hydrometric and meteorological data this data is the main drive of the model s water balance and the main input in the runoff calculations it includes rainfall temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and potential evaporation optional there are 60 different metrological observation stations inside or near the study area that are available to us during this study but unfortunately most of these stations have problems related to consistency recording period and available time step therefore it was better to use a global data set after verifying and comparing it with observations the ghcn2 modified version of the global historical climatology network data set was used ghcn2 rainfall and temperature data on bas available from nasa on daily time step and in grid format covering the entire basin area http hydro engr scu edu files gridded obs global 1950 2008 accessed 01 dec 2022 it has temporal extent of 59 years 1950 2008 and spatial resolution of 50 kilometers geographic wgs84 found in daily time step that dataset encompasses time series for rainfall and temperature maximum and minimum swat requires weather data point for each sub catchment separately since the time series data of ghcn2 are gap free extracted time series were written directly to each of the delineated sub catchment in bas observed river flow is essential for the calibration and validation process the study area contains many stations but the available data for most of them contain gaps or have short recording length only two of them are without gaps and have relatively long time series record these two stations are gambella and hillet doleib the data are found in monthly time step from the period of 1920 1993 for gambella and 1905 1983 for hillet doleib the source of the data is the ethiopian master plan made by ethiopian ministry of water and energy awulachew et al 2007 2 5 3 data for the developed scenarios 2 5 3 1 baseline simulation the purpose of this experiment is to simulate the historical flow conditions existing structures and water resource projects in order to create a reference baseline conditions to compare them against the outcomes of development scenarios experiments table 1 shows the key characteristics of existing dams and irrigation projects that are taken in consideration in the baseline experiment in the hec ressim model existing projects data was compiled from entro hassan 2012 there are additional projects and abstractions located on other sub basins of the en especially the blue nile but current model is concerned only with bas and other sub basins are modeled by considering the effect of their net downstream observed flows swat model outputs are used to force the hec ressim model in the period 1952 2008 within the bas sub basin while for other sub basins the downstream historical observed flow records were used to force the extended hec ressim model 2 5 3 2 development scenarios development plans in the bas sub basins are largely dependent on water resources and can be broadly categorized into hydropower projects and irrigated agriculture schemes in this paper the potential development projects were classified under three development scenarios scenario 1 represents the basin conditions when all potential hydropower projects are implemented and operational table 2 and fig 7 show the locations and key characteristics of the potential hydropower projects in basin and their key characteristics as included in scenario 1 there are ten proposed dams all of which are located in the upstream part of bas mainly upstream gambella this area has high potential for hydropower generation due to its high terrain slopes and sudden terrain drops which provides favorable conditions for hydropower generation the total installed capacity for potential hydropower projects is about 2816 mw and the total storage capacity for these dams is estimated to be 24 km3 among them tams dam has the highest installed capacity of 1060 mw and also the highest storage capacity of 10 4 km3 hassan 2012 one of the dams included in scenario 1 is geba r dam which is currently under construction since late 2014 but it is included in scenario 1 assuming it is constructed and under operation now this dam is located on geba river a main tributary of baro river and is intended for hydropower but since this dam has been already under construction we give it further special attention and studied it separately to detect its potential impacts on the nile inflow arriving at had during the first filling period and before its full operation scenario 2 includes all potential irrigated agriculture schemes in the basin and finally scenario 3 represents the ultimate development conditions in the basin where all potential hydropower and irrigated agriculture schemes are implemented and operational i e scenario 3 is simply a combination of scenario 1 scenario 2 table 3 and fig 8 show locations and key characteristics of potential irrigated agriculture schemes in bas sub basin which are included in the development scenario 2 downstream of gambella terrain slopes are mild providing favorite conditions for supplementary irrigation based agriculture developments according to the ethiopian ministry of water and energy bas is the second largest river basin in ethiopia with land suitable for irrigation estimated at 1 million hectares awulachew 2007 a total of 14 irrigation schemes with an area of 1 million hectares are supplied from 6 dam reservoirs and 2 pumping stations the overall supplementary irrigation demands for these projects are estimated at 6 km3 year which are planned to be supplied by dams with total reservoirs storage capacity of 16 2 km3 scenario 3 is a combination of scenario 1 and scenario 2 and represents the ultimate conditions of water based development in bas it includes 9 hydropower dams 5 irrigation dams 1 dual purpose dam gilo1 dam and 2 pumping schemes the total storage capacity for dams included in this scenario is estimated to be 37 km3 scenario 3 is expected to have the most significant effect on the contribution of bas at had due to the large storages encountered 2 6 model calibration and validation 2 6 1 sensitivity analysis for swat model sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify the most sensitive parameters that affect the flow sensitivity analysis in swat combines the latin hypercube lh sampling and one factor at a time oat sampling holvoet et al 2005 a total of 27 parameters that affect the water balance and flow equations were subject to this analysis model simulations were carried out for the period from 1952 1993 and assessed at gambella and hillet doleib initially the sensitivity analysis was carried out for gambella sub catchment only and then repeated for the rest of the sub catchments of bas excluding gambella this resulted in two sets of flow sensitive parameters according to lenhart et al 2002 if the relative sensitivity is less than 0 05 the model sensitivity to this parameter can be neglected insensitive parameter accordingly table 4 summarizes the most sensitive parameters that affect the water balance and flow calculations in bas associated with their sensitivity ranking 2 6 2 calibration of swat model swat cup is external software linked with swat and used to perform the calibration process automatically the calibration parameters are selected to be the most sensitive parameters resulted from the previous step the calibration and validation processes are made separately at gambella and hillet doleib swat cup allows evaluating the calibration process by setting an objective function depending on one of four statistical measures whose value changes by carrying trials and changing the set of parameter values in each trial optimization technique these statistical measures are the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rsr and the mean relative bias pbais the goodness of the fit is assessed based on the performance rating values moriasi et al 2007 in which the calibration performance rating can be classified as unsatisfactory satisfactory good and very good corresponding to nse values of 0 5 0 5 0 65 0 65 0 75 and 0 75 respectively table 5 shows the calibrated values at both stations which reflect certain generated flow time series this series was evaluated by using statistical measures with observations in the calibration period the upper left and lower left panels of fig 9a and b show the simulated flow using the calibrated parameters compared with the observed flows for gambella and hillet doleib stations the nse values at both stations were 0 9 gambella station and 0 75 hillet doleib station which indicates that the calibration performance rating can be classified as very good and good respectively according to moriasi et al 2007 2 6 3 validation of swat model the bas hydrological model is validated using a different simulation window at gambella and hillet doleib as shown in the upper right and lower right panels of fig 9c and d the nse values at both stations were 0 83 at gambella and 0 62 hillet doleib which indicates that the validation performance rating can be classified as very good and satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 2 6 4 validation of hec ressim model the hec ressim model is verified to check data entry water balance reservoir operation and reach flow routing the model is verified at the flow stations of gambella hillet doleib and dongola upstream of had in addition to verifying had pool elevation fig 10 shows the verification results at dongla flow station fig 10a had pool elevation fig 10b flow at gambella station fig 10c and flow at hillet doleib fig 10d the coefficient of determination and the nse are calculated at each site to assess the goodness of the simulation and they indicate the validity of the model to simulation to the flow conditions and reservoir operation in the basin 3 results and discussion in all development scenarios historical hydrometric data covering a period of 57 years from1952 to 2008 is assumed to be repeated in the future combined with the model setup for each development scenario swat s simulated stream flows are used after calibration and validation to force the hec ressim model historical observed river flows are used to consider the effect from other nile sub basins physical data for all existing and potential dams were compiled from entro hydropower toolkits hassan 2012 dam pool elevation storage surface area curves are deduced by applying spatial processing of the srtm 90m dem gates capacity curves are calculated according to orifice hydraulics lindell et al 2018 and the spillway capacity curves are calculated according to ogee weir hydraulics operation rules for dams are simplified to be based on guide curves only to produce satisfactory hydropower generation close to the target generation at some dams release allocation priority is set to ensure logical operation policy and to utilize water for the main purpose of the dam reservoirs are assumed to operate separately without tandem or cascade operation 3 1 base line simulation fig 11 shows the results of enb water balance as resulted from the baseline simulation the water balance for hec ressim model is calculated at different points and compared with historical water balance for the nile sutcliffe and parks 1999 fig 11a shows a schematic of the water balance whereas fig 11b shows a comparison of water balance figures at certain nodes from all streams in the bas with the historical values of the nile sutcliffe and parks 1999 that reflect the accuracy and consistency of hec ressim model results the effect of merowe dam in sudan which is in operation since 2010 is included in this simulation pool evaporation losses is found to be 1 54 km3 year which compares well with the estimated value by sudanese ministry of irrigation and water resources that is equal to 1 5 km3 year hassan 2012 the annual average spillage from the baro river at machar marshes is estimated at 4 75 km3 year see fig 11a the spillage from the baro river was estimated by others from 2 3 to 5 km3 year nbi and entro 2020 which is consistent with the simulation results 3 2 development scenarios fig 12a shows the simulated mean monthly flow averaged over the simulation period from 1952 to 2008 as a result of the development scenario 1 hydropower dams compared with the simulated flow from the baseline conditions it shows that in case of scenario 1 there will be an increase of the nile inflow to had by an average annual flow of 1 33 km3 year it should be noted that these results did not consider the initial filling of geba r dam what have been simulated here are the operational conditions of the dams that include only evaporation losses keeping in mind that evaporation losses are taking place it was necessary to understand the rational of the inflow increase at had to interpret that the model water balance is examined it is noted that the flow pattern upstream machar marches and downstream for all included hydropower projects is affected by the regulation effect caused by the potential dams the adopted dam operation rules are targeting to reserve water at high flow periods and to partially release it in low flow periods these operation policies resulted in a more controlled flow pattern in which flows at high flow periods decreased compared to those of baseline simulation while flow at low flow periods increased fig 12 b as a result of this flow regulation and changes in the natural flow pattern the spilling from baro river is affected fig 12c shows the average monthly spilling from baro river at machar marshes before and after adding the hydropower projects the spilling decreases at the high flow periods from august to december at the time when flows in the baro goes below the spilling threshold of 540 m3 s sutcliffe and parks 1999 this indicates that the decreased flow in baro river upstream machar marshes below the spilling threshold will result in decreased spilling and eventually will result in increased contribution from the bas to the inflow at had fig 12d shows a schematic drawing of the water balance in development scenario 1 it indicates that the losses due to baro river spilling at machar marshes is decreased from an average volume of 4 75 km3 year in the baseline simulation to an average volume of 3 32 km3 year after adding the potential hydropower projects the water balance during the filling period of geba r dam indicated flow reduction of 3 1 km3 that is used to fill the reservoir however the flow losses are decreased to 2 17 km3 at had during the filling period or 1 42 km3 in first year this is explained by the decrease in baro spilling at machar marshes due to the regulated flow pattern during initial filling of the reservoir in the operation phase of the dam it is noticed that minor losses occur due to evaporation from the reservoir surface area the evaporation losses are estimated at 3 km3 year which is negligible because the reservoir is located in an area with low net evaporation rates in development scenario 2 the prevailing irrigation pattern in bas is shown in fig 13a it is a supplementary irrigation pattern in which irrigation is applied only during the dry periods and not needed during the rainy season from august to october the irrigation pattern has two local maxima in july and in january according to the assumed demand pattern scenario 2 irrigation requirements are estimated at 6 km3 year the simulation results indicated that irrigation requirements could not be met from the basin water resources a total of 5 km3 out of the required 6 km3 could be secured annually this is explained by the fluctuations in the river flow that sometimes may not be able to fulfill the irrigation requirements the annual reduction in the inflow at had is estimated at 4 41 km3 year fig 13b this is also explained by the controlled flow pattern resulting from the dams included in scenario 2 which caused further reduction in the spilling from the baro by about 0 57 km3 year compared to the baseline simulation fig 13d as a consequence of flow reduction at had by 4 41 km3 year the hydropower generation at had will be negatively affected fig 13c shows the had s average annual hydropower energy produced under scenario 2 compared to the baseline conditions it is noticed that there will be a reduction in hydropower energy generation of 5 on average while the maximum reduction may reach 24 the ultimate development conditions in the bas basin was simulated by the development scenario 3 in which all potential hydropower projects and irrigated agriculture schemes are assumed to be in place and operational it is found that scenario 1 with all hydropower generation projects increased the flow at had by 1 33 km3 year while scenario 2 with all irrigation schemes decreased the flow at had by 4 41 km3 year the combination of the two scenarios resulted in an intermediate effect in which the apparent flow reduction from scenario 2 will be relaxed scenario 3 is expected to reduce the annual flow at had by 3 61 km3 year fig 14a fig 14b shows the reduction in had s hydropower energy generation with an average reduction of 4 and a maximum reduction of 19 3 3 comparison with previous studies there are very limited studies that investigated the development projects and their impacts on the bas and the downstream possibly due to the complexity of simulating the hydrology and water balance of this part of the nile basin nbi and entro 2020 presented a multi model framework that comprises mike 11 and mike she to simulate the hydrology and river swamp hydraulics of the bas that were used to simulate the mashar marches spilling mechanism and to evaluate the marches water balance table 6 provides a comparison between our results and the study prepared by nbi and entro 2020 as the table shows under the baseline simulation there is a similarity between both studies in simulating the baro flow at the upstream downstream locations and the spillage to mashar the fact that both studies use completely different modeling approaches could be an indication of their validity and credibility nbi and entro 2020 studied development scenarios among them was one scenario assuming all hydropower dams were built and operational and also another scenario that assumes all hydropower dams and irrigation dams were built and operational as table 6 shows those two scenarios do not compare well with our scenario results that assume the same type of development this dissimilarity could be attributed to different reasons but possibly nbi and entro 2020 might have assumed higher dam storage capacities and higher irrigation abstractions this understanding could not be verified as nbi and entro 2020 did not include a detailed scenarios description nonetheless based on our study it is evident that there is a threshold of a total storage capacity that if introduced to the bas and managed properly will result in more controlled flow and fewer spillage losses and eventually increase the outflow of the whole bas basin however development will lose this benefit if excessive development produces more storage capacity that is greater than this threshold capacity and the flow reduction at had would rise 4 conclusions the baro akobo sobat bas basin is one of the four sub basins of the eastern nile basin blue nile baro akobo sobat tekeze atbara setit and main nile the eastern nile basin contributes about 85 of the nile flow arriving at aswan bas is target for several plans for large scale water infrastructure development projects dams hydropower and irrigated agriculture in ethiopia and south sudan the impacts of the planned developments to downstream countries were not investigated in detail and are not clear from the water security perspective nevertheless bas could provide a venue for joint cooperative development potential among the basin countries in conserving the huge substantial losses from the vast swamps in the basin e g machar marshes in south sudan this study presented an assessment of the impact of the proposed water resources development projects in the bas river system and the anticipated impacts on water flows arriving at aswan the main conclusions of this research can be summarized as follows two models were configured and coupled to simulate the system hydrology using swat model and the water balance using hec ressim model in the basin sensitivity analysis for swat model was carried out and resulted in the most sensitive parameters that were used to calibrate and validate the model using ground observations of flow discharges and reservoir water levels the calibration validation results for the two models showed statistical correlations that are satisfactory to very good using the developed modelling framework for bas simulations were run for three development scenarios as well as a baseline simulation i e existing conditions without any future developments the development scenarios that were studied were the development of the hydropower potential scenario 1 in the basin 10 dams capacity 2816 mw irrigated agriculture development scenario 2 14 irrigation scheme area 1 million hectares and combined hydropower and irrigation development scenario 3 also the research studied the impacts of the filling of geba r dam capacity 310 mw that is currently under construction model outcomes of different scenarios were compared with those of the baseline simulation and the results showed some changes to had s current conditions the hydropower based development scenario in bas enhanced the flow arriving at aswan by 1 3 km3 year because the controlled flow pattern produced by the projected dams reduced swamp losses the filling process of geba r dam under construction will decrease the flow contribution arriving at aswan by about 2 17 km3 the irrigated agriculture development scenario decreased the bas flow contribution arriving at aswan by 4 4 km3 year the combined hydropower and irrigation development scenario decreased the bas flow contribution arriving at aswan by 3 6 km3 year the hydropower production at aswan was slightly affected due to the above scenarios with a reduction of 5 on average for the case of the irrigated agriculture development scenario bas could offer a platform for mutual cooperative development among basin countries in order to prevent the enormous water losses from the basin s massive marshes e g machar marshes in south sudan credit authorship

mexico nm to the junta de los rios the convergence of the rio grande rg with the rio conchos in far west texas tx northern chihuahua ch this part of the rg basin faces water scarcity characterized by limited and dwindling supplies of water increasing demands for water from multiple sectors and a segmented governance system spanning three states in two countries hargrove et al 2013 the basin faces several drivers of change hargrove and heyman 2020 including 1 climate change that is impacting both water supply and demand garfin et al 2018 llewellyn et al 2013 2 agricultural intensification characterized by increasing production of high value high water demand crops hargrove et al 2021 3 urban growth impacting water demand and quality hargrove et al 2021 and 4 demand for environmental services such as riparian habitat and environmental flows llewellyn et al 2013 these converging drivers are resulting in dwindling surface water supplies and groundwater depletion not unlike many other basins especially in arid and semi arid regions gleeson et al 2012 wada et al 2010 dalin et al 2017 aeschbach hertig et al 2012 jasechko et al 2021 furthermore the water governance system in the region developed over 100 years ago is characterized by rigid water institutions weak stakeholder participation outside the direct beneficiaries of water allocations division by artificial borders and political jurisdictions and growing conflicts among the primary water users and other legitimate stakeholders hargrove and heyman 2020 hargrove et al 2021 resulting in what can be characterized as a

systems and research efforts to date are still inadequate to address the challenges of understanding and managing transboundary water challenges that include technical social political and jurisdictional issues sanchez and eckstein 2020 sanchez et al 2020 the challenges of this region are relevant because some if not most of them are faced by other river basins in arid and semi arid regions of the u s and the world where societies are dependent on a desert river basin and its associated aquifers to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture as well as growing urban populations while facing environmental needs as well castle et al 2014 thus the core question for the mrg and similar regions is how can water be managed so that the three largest competing sectors agricultural urban industrial and environmental can realize a sustainable future in such challenged water systems where supplies are dwindling and demands are increasing siloed component based research and analyses by single disciplines alone will not be able to adequately address this question a focus on probable possible and preferable water futures is called for one in which integrated science that cuts across traditional boundaries including disciplinary biophysical sectoral social and jurisdictional ones is combined with holistic collaborative management to identify the probable and possible outcomes while stakeholder driven decision making determines the preferable outcomes amara 1981 given the precarious position of the mrg basin s water resources under drivers of change we addressed these challenges by synthesizing and testing a holistic vision of water sustainability challenges and proposing integrative collaborative approaches and solutions crossing boundaries that are not commonly breached in the scientific literature using a suite of models that operate at a range of spatial and temporal scales we utilized stakeholder participatory approaches to modeling focused on the future of water in the region in the face of several drivers of change and evaluated possible interventions that might alter the future through stakeholder interactions we also evaluated the preference of or willingness to adopt certain technologies our objectives were to 1 demonstrate and test this holistic and integrated approach to address the core question above which is also applicable to similar regions worldwide and 2 synthesize the results into an analysis of the future of water in the mrg basin bridging several boundaries including disciplinary biophysical sectoral social and jurisdictional ones to provide an integrative narrative of the future of water in our region is a significant scientific contribution of our work 2 methods 2 1 our study area the middle rio grande waterscape our study area is illustrated in fig 1 and includes the mrg and two aquifers that contain good quality freshwater the mesilla bolson mb called conejos mÃ©danos in mx and hueco bolson hb called valle de juÃ¡rez in mx plus the associated alluvial aquifer connected to the river the river is the only significant source of surface water and the two aquifers are the primary sources of fresh groundwater for users in nm tx and ch which are dominated by three municipalities with a combined population of over 2 million people las cruces nm el paso tx and ciudad juÃ¡rez ch and a productive irrigated agriculture in the alluvial plain of the river on both sides of the border irrigated agriculture is confined primarily to the river corridor and is a highly managed system with little riparian habitat connected to a network of irrigation canals diverting water to agriculture and a network of drains to return unused water to the river the amount of surface water is dictated primarily by snowfall snowmelt and runoff in the rg headwaters in colorado co and northern nm streamflow in the upper part of the basin is partitioned under the rio grande compact of 1939 and the us mexico treaty of 1906 legally binding agreements between upstream users and downstream users with the water for downstream users collected and stored in several reservoirs of which the largest is elephant butte eb reservoir fig 1 the primary sources of good quality groundwater are contained in the hb and the mb the deeper hb and large portions of the mb both shared by the us and mx are primarily fossil deposits of water with little or no recharge thus drawdown represents withdrawals against current and future reserves of freshwater as well as growing threats of increasing salinity in those reserves both aquifers contain both fresh and brackish water with salinity levels ranging from 1000 mg l total dissolved solids tds in the freshwater to brackish concentrations of up to 3000 mg l and higher there is much more brackish water than freshwater in mayer et al 2021 the current rate of depletion for the hb was estimated to be 191 mcm yr this estimate is supported by decreases in published groundwater elevations which have accelerated over the past 50 years fig 2 we estimate that a total of more than 9000 mcm of freshwater have been removed from the hb over the past 100 years through 2013 based on the volume of freshwater remaining and the depletion rate mayer et al 2021 estimated that the recoverable freshwater will be completely depleted in approximately 42 years with serious economic outcomes hurd and coonrod 2012 unless there are significant interventions to alter supply and or demand business as usual without significant decreases to pumping is clearly not sustainable at the same time both ep and cj have experienced increasing salinity in the water being pumped because high pumping and depletion rates have caused brackish water intrusion into freshwater zones of the hb for example salinity increased from 750 mg l to 1200 mg l from 1979 to 1993 in an el paso water epw monitoring well an increase of 30 mg l per year mayer et al 2021 thus usable freshwater might be depleted even sooner than 42 years due to saltwater intrusion the situation is further exacerbated by changes in the agricultural sector where growers have transitioned away from annual crops with limited profit margins such as cotton to higher value perennials such as pecans which require comparatively much more water hargrove et al 2021 the result is that while a warmer drier climate is reducing water supplies from the river agricultural users are driven to pump more groundwater to meet irrigation needs this is compounded by urbanization of agricultural land due to population growth and urban sprawl mubako et al 2018 resulting in increased water demand overall hargrove et al 2021 thus finite and relatively cheap freshwater supplies are dwindling some steps to augment water supplies have been taken by the two primary urban water utilities epw and junta municipal de agua y saneamiento jmas in cj such as desalination and use of brackish water increased water recycling and reuse and importation of water plus efforts to reduce demand through conservation also have been made with some success but in sum these efforts to augment supply and reduce demand have made and in the future are likely to make only relatively small changes in the regional rate of groundwater pumping and aquifer depletion as out results will demonstrate 2 2 stakeholder engagement and participation our process of stakeholder engagement and participation is described in hargrove and heyman 2020 and was based on methods of participatory modeling morua robles et al 2014 kelly et al 2013 our target audiences were all stakeholders concerned about the future of water in the mrg region and their involvement was an iterative process that built upon each encounter over the course of five years from our work with stakeholders including those representing agriculture urban users environmental concerns social justice and government policy interests we summarize below important challenges to sustainable water futures organized into four key themes hargrove and heyman 2020 which also provided focus for our modeling work 2 2 1 the spiral of climate change prolonged drought groundwater depletion and salinization predicting planning and managing for prolonged drought was the top concern of most stakeholders both agricultural and urban coupled with concerns about the future of aquifers stakeholders agreed that identifying and quantifying the impact of future climate scenarios including the depletion of groundwater reserves was a prerequisite to planning and managing for what they termed prolonged drought at present agricultural stakeholders response to the growing unreliability of water supplies from the river is to pump more groundwater and the response to the concomitant dropping water tables is to dig deeper wells 2 2 2 agricultural intensification urbanization and lack of conjunctive management in brief agricultural intensification is leading to greater extraction of groundwater as surface water supplies become increasingly unreliable the net result is aquifer depletion and deterioration of water quality primarily from brackish groundwater intrusion combined with return flows that are more saline than what was extracted components of the conjunctive water system in the basin have been modeled but generally the connection of the surface and groundwater is poorly understood though some progress has been made fuchs et al 2019 a better understanding of the interaction of surface and groundwater to support better conjunctive management remains a research challenge stakeholders desire to know the limits of groundwater pumping for the future at present both agricultural and urban stakeholders solution to dwindling supplies and increasing demand is to augment supplies through technology management and or importation on the other hand environmental and social justice stakeholders tend to define the problem through the need to reduce demand by the big water users through conservation which would allow expanded access for environmental uses and for thousands of vulnerable border residents who lack access to potable water hargrove et al 2018 2 2 3 the complexity and obsolescence of the water governance framework the water governance framework for this binational multi state region was described in detail in hargrove et al 2021 a major deficiency is that the relevant treaty and interstate compacts were established prior to the development of a full understanding hydrologically of the connectivity between surface water and groundwater due to the fragmented jurisdictional boundaries diverse sectoral uses and weakly acknowledged surface subsurface interactions first termed hydroschizophrenia by llamas 1975 applied to transboundary waters by jarvis et al 2005 and applied more generally to the situation in the mrg by hargrove et al 2021 interested parties often conceptualize the water system in divided non integrated ways and therefore place blame on some other part of the system other users or jurisdictional areas when faced with undesirable outcomes this has led to numerous ongoing legal challenges lawsuits currently within nm and between tx and nm as we will report in our results we tried to breach these boundaries through our holistic approach 2 2 4 land ownership water rights and threats agricultural stakeholders particularly in the u s and to a lesser degree in mexico have a strong feeling of ownership of water rights as part of land ownership coupled with the concomitant sense of threat to those water rights emanating from the current situation of increasingly unreliable water supplies hargrove and heyman 2020 the sense of threat the growing unreliability of water supplies and the growing tension among different sectors of users and across jurisdictional boundaries converge to put farmers on guard against multiple threats and risks to not only their rights to water but to their livelihood and quality of life brause 2021 they tend to approach these perceived threats from a standpoint of scarcity commonly blaming competing users for the unreliability of water supplies for agriculture this stance adds to the wickedness of the problem in visualizing and addressing water futures 2 3 theory crossing boundaries in evaluating water futures to address the core question and the chief concerns of stakeholders identified above we focused our research on water futures considering possible probable and preferable future outcomes from the known drivers of change and considering interventions that could alter those outcomes we accomplished this by developing and evaluating scenarios using models and with the input and participation of stakeholders to evaluate water futures we integrated dynamics across numerous dimensions that ordinarily are bounded and studied separately from each other for example granados olivas et al 2019 our research goal was to use modeling approaches that integrate across an array of artificial divisions i e surface subsurface water urban agricultural environmental uses and international interstate jurisdictions use stakeholder inputs and modeling outputs to evaluate water futures and address concerns of stakeholders about water futures including evaluating improvements in management technology policy such connections are usually acknowledged but less often breached in practice because a large interdisciplinary binational team is needed to do so as a result the interacting dynamics across biophysical and sociopolitical dimensions are in general poorly integrated in either research or practice the value of our integrative project was to unify all the drivers stocks and flows of water in one integrated vision of the regional system across conventional boundaries drawing on our own published work and that of others we present here the results of our synthesis especially results for several boundary crossing processes that we addressed that inform not only the future of the mrg but also similar desert river systems in the southwestern us and around the world our contribution is a holistic vision of water sustainability challenges and potential solutions for the future based on our own and other published work on components of the system in our region 2 4 modeling framework we developed and or evaluated a suite of calibrated models that performed at various spatial from agricultural field to river basin and temporal from daily to decades scales and which functioned across biophysical and jurisdictional boundaries to address the important themes and research questions of concern about future conditions and potential interventions that could alter future conditions our suite of modeling tools are presented and summarized in table 1 below we briefly describe some of the specific uses of each model in our analyses throughout the modeling activities we incorporated stakeholder participation in an iterative way as we tested scenarios shared results discussed interventions and tested interventions hargrove and heyman 2020 scientifically sound climate scenarios for the future were fundamental to our modeling work we developed several climate scenarios to use in simulations with the bucket model the mrg water balance model and the suite of swat modflow based models we used a large ensemble of usbr generated projections of naturalized streamflow along the rg which were driven by cmip5 global climate model simulations the usbr simulations are widely used by regional water managers providing us with an ensemble of state of the art credible projections of future climate and streamflow including a wide range of global climate models and future greenhouse gas forcing scenarios output used in our research included bias adjusted downscaled temperature and precipitation in the study area and associated projections of naturalized rg flow the procedures used for statistical downscaling bcsd and the surface hydrological model driven by simulated climate variables vic are discussed in detail by usbr 2013 and llewellyn et al 2013 for our project townsend and gutzler 2020 developed an adjustment algorithm to shift usbr s flow projections from eb dam to a point upstream corresponding to the san marcial gage near the inlet to eb reservoir more importantly the adjustment procedure also statistically accounted for upstream anthropogenic withdrawals by bias correcting the simulated annual flows during a historical period to match the statistics of gaged flow at san marcial preserving this bias adjustment into the future essentially assumes no change in upstream water management policy through this century townsend and gutzler 2020 the mrg water balance model was used to develop projections of the future of water resources in the region under 1 business as usual conditions 2 future climate scenarios 3 changing demands for water and 4 conjunctive management to include consequences of groundwater pumping irrigation system efficiency and seepage from the main channel of the rg and irrigation channels this model was also enhanced or combined with other cost accounting models to project future costs for urban water assess costs of environmental flows and address policy questions the hydroeconomic optimization bucket model was used in paired comparisons with and without proposed interventions to permit assessment of changes in outcomes the annual water balance component of the bucket model was used to simulate storages and flows for climate scenarios in a futures mode sub models were developed for reservoir evaporation rates reservoir elevation storage surface area irrigated agriculture evapotranspiration and return flows urban evapotranspiration and return flows groundwater surface water exchanges and groundwater elevations it was used as a decision support framework for improving our and stakeholders understanding of the basin evaluating scenarios from an economics perspective and addressing questions that were important to stakeholders swim 1 0 the user interface with the bucket model enables users to graphically a define default or customized parameters representing human activities and climate scenarios b seamlessly run the bucket model c graphically explore the outputs of the model and d graphically explore the sources and processing provenance of the data villanueva rosales et al 2017 garnica chavira et al 2018 links to swim 1 0 are provided in table s1 in the supplementary material file an improved version swim 2 0 will expand its capabilities and uses and continue to provide access to the bucket model and mrg water balance model to assess land use and land cover change lulc we produced historical and current land use land cover maps and the results were used in the bucket and swat models to evaluate water use implications of lulc this required development of a methodology for improving land use classification through analyzing patterns of temporal change mubako et al 2018 we successfully completed the generation of the annual lulc maps from 1990 to 2015 for the entire us mx study area mubako et al 2018 and evaluated land cover change through a markov change analysis future projections of land use change were not made swat mf was used in a variety of ways including evaluation of climate change impacts agricultural water management interventions and adaptation to cope with warm dry futures pinales munguÃ­a et al 2019 samimi et al 2018 2020 2022 2023 we also modified swat with a salinity module and simulated salinity processes in the eb irrigation district using the swat salt to assess biophysical factors that impact salinity samimi et al 2019 smituv a system dynamic model in stella was used for assessing field scale salinity in pecan poulose et al 2021 palmate et al 2022 3 results we synthesize and organize our results into four major themes in response to stakeholders chief concerns and described above in section 2 2 1 climate change and the future of surface and groundwater 2 agricultural intensification and the future of agriculture 3 urbanization and the future for urban water use and 4 implications for the future of water governance 3 1 theme climate change and the future of surface and groundwater 3 1 1 impacts of climate change on the future of surface water usbr s cmip5 based future climate projections range from very wet to very dry spanning an enormous range that limits certainty in future water supply projections lehner et al 2019 assessing which projections are most likely was beyond the scope of our project we provide here an example of some results of projections of streamflow into eb reservoir fig 3 adapted from townsend and gutzler 2020 to bracket the possibilities in future climate we chose specific simulations that included a very wet future simulating flows that tend to increase with time green curve in fig 3 a midrange projection that exhibits drier conditions after mid century purple curve in fig 3 and a very dry simulation that includes almost no high flow years in the future red curve in fig 3 this wide range of future rg inflow scenarios was used as input to many of the other modeling assessments carried out to examine potential climate change impacts on reservoir management groundwater and crop selection strategies as described in the sections to follow the ensemble of simulations black curves in fig 4 exhibits a trend toward more prolonged drought and dwindling supplies of surface water over the next 50 years consistent with recent consensus assessments of likely future trends in streamflow and aridity in the southwestern us jay et al 2018 hicke et al 2022 the ensemble average decline occurs despite the presence of several very wet simulations such as the green curve in fig 4 the implications for surface water supplies associated with the three individual scenarios in fig 3 were explored using the mrg water balance model fig 4 adapted from holmes et al 2022 in these scenarios surface water collected in eb reservoir met allocated demand in only about 20 of the years under the midrange drier scenario purple curve in figs 3 and 4 b and did not meet full demand at any time during the period of simulation under the very dry scenario red curve in figs 3 and 4a 3 1 2 impacts of climate change on the future of groundwater the drivers of change discussed above for surface water climate plus growing demands plus compensatory groundwater use to meet surface water shortfalls portend the exacerbation of groundwater declines for the future projected impacts of climate change on groundwater storage in the hueco bolson are shown in fig 5 for the same climate scenarios used in fig 4 a very dry future a moderately dry future and a very wet future results show that for the very dry scenario the freshwater in the hb could be depleted in only 30 years and for the moderately dry scenario about 40 50 years 3 2 theme agricultural intensification and the future of agriculture 3 2 1 intensification of agriculture and its impact on total demand the results of decreasing surface supply under changing climate and increasing total demand under agricultural intensification lead to increasingly large and sustained deficits in surface water supply which in turn lead to more groundwater use to make up the surface water deficit plus the groundwater being pumped today is increasingly saline as the freshwater of the shared aquifers is depleted if the current trajectory of intensification of production continues it will have significant implications for sustainable water management in the region our results samimi et al 2023 show that if we were to experience a prolonged drought of 8 10 years for example current irrigation methods limits would fail to meet the needs of pecans unless all other crops are removed from production to save pecan orchards fig 6 relatively strong measures such as eliminating the cultivation of alfalfa for example generate only moderate water savings samimi et al 2023 more extreme interventions will be needed under continuing climate change as agricultural intensification continues 3 2 2 potential interventions 3 2 2 1 alternative sources of water almost all treated wastewater is used already for irrigation in our region another potentially significant alternative source is brackish water which is not used at this time for irrigation using our models we evaluated pecan water use for two future adaptation scenarios in a dry climate future samimi et al 2022 a irrigation with river water fresh groundwater and desalinated groundwater this exemplifies a dry period where surface water is inadequate there is heavy reliance on groundwater and desalination is available to treat brackish groundwater and b irrigation with river water and fresh groundwater only this exemplifies a dry period where surface water is inadequate there is heavy reliance on groundwater that is becoming more saline and desalination is not available fig 7 these results show that as groundwater becomes more saline agricultural productivity decreases unless saline groundwater can be treated or replaced with alternate sources either of which will be very costly we conducted a cost analysis of desalination in agriculture we examined the potential for irrigating salt sensitive crops e g pecans with blends of desalinated brackish groundwater and fresh surface or groundwater and irrigating salt tolerant crops e g quinoa with desalination concentrate water we used a simple cost benefit model that estimated crop yields based on irrigation water salinity the net return was based on gross returns from the harvested crops minus production costs production costs included the net present value for purchasing and operating the desalination unit and other farm input expenses such as labor fertilizer and operation of machinery irrigation water scheduling was based on current practices in the region the results of this simple analysis resulted in desalination costs that are prohibitive compared to the net returns the costs exceeded benefits over a range of sensitive variables such as the fractions of salt sensitive and salt tolerant crops desalinated water freshwater blends energy prices and discount rates however desalination costs to farmers could be reduced by offsetting the purchase price with incentives and or by using solar power to generate the electricity required by the desalination system furthermore salt tolerant crops such as quinoa have not been cultivated in the region so it is not known if farmers would be willing to dedicate land to adopting these crops with no processing or marketing infrastructure in place 3 2 2 2 alternative methods and improved management of irrigation flood irrigation remains the predominant form of irrigation in the study area in terms of water use efficiency flood irrigation is generally in the range of 65 70 most of the unused 30 35 of applied water percolates below the root zone with about 5 10 being lost to evaporation samani et al 2011 we evaluated several improved irrigation methods including surge irrigation and drip irrigation alatorre cejudo et al 2019 ganjegunte et al 2020 drip irrigation can improve efficiency to 80 90 but has a significant capital cost furthermore many irrigators are reluctant to adopt high efficiency irrigation methods such as drip irrigation because of salinity concerns we compared rootzone salinity under four types of irrigation systems with water having an electrical conductivity ec of 1 ds m ganjegunte et al 2020 results showed that flood irrigation resulted in higher salinity in the root zone compared to drip or surge irrigation the subsurface drip evaluation was in a turf field and resulted in concentrated salinity at the soil surface because salts accumulated at the drip line and migrated to the soil surface due to high evaporation rates surge or surface drip irrigation shows a lot of promise for decreasing total water use especially when using groundwater as the source cox et al 2018 deb et al 2013 stetson and mecham 2011 shalekbriski et al 2019 flood irrigation using surface water is not as efficient in terms of crop production but the water lost to percolation becomes recharge to groundwater a time based method of scheduling irrigation is followed by most irrigators in our region and is based on simply counting the number of days since the last irrigation by using evapotranspiration et based irrigation scheduling our results show that at least two irrigations per season can be saved without reductions in yield ganjegunte et al 2012 for example with an estimated 6100 ha in pecans in the el paso county irrigation district and 127 mm irrigation 2 fewer irrigations translate into a potential water savings of 15 mcm per year 3 2 2 3 improved salinity management as groundwater becomes more saline soil salinity builds up over time gypsum as a soil amendment improves the leaching of salt in soil because calcium sulfate is very effective at replacing sodium chloride ganjegunte et al 2017 using a sulfur burner is also effective in converting elemental sulfur to sulfate through oxidation which will form calcium sulfate in soil and in turn leach sodium salts from the profile this was shown to be an effective treatment for reducing salt in soil ganjegunte et al 2018 ganjegunte and clark 2019 3 2 2 4 alternative crops we evaluated several alternative crops to pecan such as other perennials like pistachio pomegranate niu et al 2018 hooks et al 2021 and switchgrass sun et al 2018 and annuals such as guar energy sorghum forage sorghum and canola suthar et al 2018a 2018b 2019 though these crops are generally adapted to the climate and soil conditions of our region they cannot compete economically with pecan under current economic conditions also in many cases transitioning to these crops is limited by the lack of crop specialized infrastructure such as processing facilities and or developed markets chaganti et al 2020 2021a 2021b in summary though alternative crops have the potential to produce with much less water inputs they will not be adopted under current conditions without significant financial investments in infrastructure external incentives to farmers or both 3 3 theme urbanization and the future of urban water use 3 3 1 current water use by ep cj though the three largest cities in the region ep lc and cj rely primarily on groundwater from the mb and hb it is important to recognize that the cities use other water sources as well fig 8 illustrates the average volume of water from each source delivered to treatment facilities in ep and cj ep s water portfolio is more diverse than that of cj cj s large dependence on hb freshwater makes it more vulnerable as freshwater storage in hb is depleted table 2 presents water use from ep cj and lc alger et al 2020 these results show that cj uses more water than ep but since the population in cj greatly exceeds that of el paso the per capita use in ep is almost twice that of cj cj 135 ep 235 m3 the difference in per capita use is explained mostly by the greater evaporative outdoor use in ep more than 50 of total use in ep and only 33 in cj 3 3 2 the future under business as usual we developed a baseline scenario that was meant to set the stage for choosing interventions that might alter the future the baseline scenario assumes that urban populations and thus water demands will increase and there will be no significant change in policies that would slow depletion of the hb thus it describes a future with business as usual bau our bau scenario spans a 50 year period 2020 2070 and is based on the following assumptions a population will increase by 66 in cj and 35 in ep and per capita usage will remain the same resulting in an average annual demand for cj of 252 mcm yr and el paso of 174 mcm yr over the 50 year period b pumping from the hb will increase in proportion to the increase in demand for the two cities c water availability from the rg will be reduced over the period due to low flows caused by climate change in the headwaters resulting in a reduction of the availability from this source for epw of 26 37 mcm yr for most years d warmer temperatures will impact water demand in cities including a lengthening growing season by at least 4 6 weeks and more days over 38 degrees c these changes cause greater total et from landscaping and outdoor green spaces e other users especially irrigators will use more groundwater for reasons described above f recharge from the river will decrease because flow will be reduced due to climate change while recharge from canals also will diminish as irrigation districts concrete line their ditches to enhance downstream deliveries g average salinity in groundwater pumped from the hb will increase from 500 mg l to over 1500 mg l as tds h average groundwater levels in the hb will change at a rate equivalent to the depletion rate the result of projecting the bau scenario 50 years into the future is shown in fig 9 given a depletion rate of 258 mcm yr and an estimate for recoverable freshwater of 8018 mcm the recoverable freshwater would be completely depleted in 31 years derived from fig 9 where compete depletion is defined by the point at which the aquifer can no longer support the water supply needs of users furthermore the negative impacts of depletion could affect users well before complete depletion since cones of depression around wells could increase faster than average making water levels drop below the well intake necessitating either abandonment or drilling deeper wells also from fig 9 regardless it is certain that pumping costs will grow substantially throughout the 50 yr period of projection as a result of dropping water tables and energy costs under this bau scenario usable freshwater in the hb will be completely depleted by about the year 2050 or before depending on the salinity dynamics meeting drinking and other household needs for water for millions of people on both sides of the border are compelling reasons for stakeholders to identify affordable and effective solutions to aquifer depletion clearly action is called for to avert this devastating result 3 3 3 future supply and demand and cost of alternative sources fig 10 shows the projected population growth and concomitant water demand relative to current supply projected demand is expected to exceed projected supply within the next thirty or so years assuming no change in per capita consumption as groundwater sources are depleted alternative sources will have to be tapped to meet growing demand resulting in increased cost of water to residents fig 11 the least expensive alternative source is desalination of brackish groundwater while water importation is the most expensive furthermore urban centers can improve water sustainability and resiliency by reusing municipal wastewater especially for drinking water supplies direct potable reuse of wastewater could reduce the amount of fresh groundwater pumping by cities though it is a very expensive alternative and carries a certain amount of consumer stigma we evaluated several conservation practices at the household level for urban consumers capt et al 2021 the greatest consumptive use in the urban environment and thus the greatest opportunity for conservation is outdoor vegetation and evaporation from bare soil alger et al 2020 reducing landscaping uses of water through practices like xeriscaping and others would be an effective way to reduce urban demand and if incentivized could be financially attractive to urban water users also rainwater harvesting and its use for outdoor watering is an effective way to reduce use of potable water for landscaping hargrove et al 2020 regardless since alternative sources are several times more expensive per unit volume than current sources and reductions in per capita consumption cannot reasonably make up the difference consumers will have to expect to pay considerably more for potable water in the future as alternative sources become necessary 3 4 theme implications of water futures for water governance 3 4 1 management of eb reservoir we evaluated the impact of the current eb reservoir operating rules for downstream releases on the ability to account for climate change and resulting conditions in the watershed holmes et al 2022 we addressed these questions a under current operating rules how will downstream surface water supplies be affected by projected climate change b how resilient are the current reservoir management rules to projected climate change c how will increases in temperature which will lead to higher evaporative losses from reservoirs compare to impacts on upstream snow fed flows results from holmes et al 2022 for future climate simulations with warming temperatures showed decreases in surface water supplies across all parameters explored despite increasing evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures in our climate projections there was little change in the volume lost to reservoir surface evaporation compared to the past 50 years this is because the operating agreement for releasing water from the reservoir results in continuously low reservoir surface area and thus similar evaporation volumes under low inflows thus maintaining the current operating agreement for releases under a warming climate results in lower downstream water availability overall local precipitation and evaporation had little impact on reservoir storage and thus future water supply in the mrg is relatively insensitive to projected changes in local precipitation instead the water supply is strongly determined by diminishing snowmelt runoff occurring far upstream unfortunately this means that water managers and or users would have limited ability to impact water supply through local water capture or changes in storage policies because such policies are unlikely to compensate for diminishing water flows into the reservoir our results show that water availability will need to be addressed through changes in policies that impact reservoir releases and the related water demand downstream for our study reservoir management practices were held constant throughout the study period which allowed us to isolate the hydrologic effects of climate change on water availability but given the high probability of reduced flows into the reservoir managers and users will need to find ways to adapt to diminishing reliability of water availability by reconsidering reservoir operating policies and or renegotiating water sharing agreements to better match the water demand with a diminishing supply that the reservoir system can support 3 4 2 environmental flows historically almost no surface water has been allocated to serve environmental needs in the region by agreement with the usbr all the water stored in eb reservoir is allocated to the two irrigation districts in nm and tx and by treaty to the irrigation district in ch this precludes environmental uses of rg water and remains a subject of debate for future water policy the international boundary and water commission ibwc has proposed periodic pulse flows in times of ample supply to flood riparian areas to encourage riparian vegetation we evaluated the water requirements for pulse flows every 5 10 years table 3 for this evaluation we applied the hydroeconomic optimization bucket model to investigate cost to water users as a result of securing water for environmental flows without assigning any economic benefit to environmental flows torell et al 2022 two eb inflow scenarios were considered 1 a baseline of historical weather 1995 2015 a very wet scenario projection 2016 2024 and 2 50 of inflows as prescribed for scenario 1 above we calculated the amounts of water and approximate costs for each of these scenarios at best out of any climate or pulse flow timing scenario the total value of water is reduced by only 0 05 at worst the total value of water is reduced by 2 5 this strategy would require relatively small amounts of water amounting to generally less than 2 of the total annual flow in any one year yet there currently is insufficient political will to make changes to provide this amount of water for environmental flows 3 4 3 agricultural interventions to improve water use efficiency and decrease total water use we evaluated several interventions that are technically feasible and that could change either water use efficiency and or total water use in agriculture significantly specifically game changing interventions include desalination of brackish groundwater conversion from flood to drip irrigation and alternative crops that would require much less water all of these either would require considerable capital expense to implement desalination and drip irrigation or are much less profitable than pecan production we tested these ideas with stakeholders but found no interest or desire to implement these practices without considerable financial incentives other interventions that are less costly and that they are willing to implement have much smaller but still significant impacts like improved irrigation timing for example interventions that will have significant impact will require policies to incentivize their adoption 3 4 4 slowing groundwater depletion at present there is no shared governance of groundwater in the hb either binationally or between states but governed instead by the rules and regulations of the individual states and or countries who share it furthermore the hydrological fact that surface and subsurface water are connected and should be managed conjunctively is not considered in this strictly delineated governance system hargrove et al 2021 based on these conditions we evaluated with stakeholders possible and preferable changes to water governance that would prolong the life of the aquifer we conducted a binational multisector serious games workshop to explore collaborative solutions for extending the life of the shared hb aquifer mayer et al 2021 we evaluated several potential pumping restrictions with stakeholders including 1 each city ep and cj reduce pumping by 15 2 each city reduce pumping by 25mcm yr 3 each city reduce pumping by 35 4 each city reduce pumping by 50 mcm yr 5 each city reduce pumping by 35 plus reduce demand by 13 and 6 reduce pumping by 50mc yr and reduce demand by 44 mcm yr since cj relies much more on the hb and pumps much more than ep equal percentage reductions mean that cj has to reduce pumping by much larger amounts than ep stakeholder preferences spanned the range of choices with no clear consensus on preference detailed results can be found in mayer et al 2021 since the two countries come to the issue with uneven financial and technical resources and different political and social constraints an easy and obvious solution is not possible even though we did not achieve a consensus the value of the serious game workshop was building knowledge interest understanding and mutual recognition among stakeholders from both sides of the border in an informal setting the qualities of mutual respect and trust essential for long run convergence were enhanced by shared learning in the games process e g a key realization was the cost and necessity of ensuring water supply for the municipal utilities especially cj in spite of not achieving consensus on a single path forward frameworks for potential binational solutions emerged including 1 participants agreed that action to slow the drawdown of fresh water in the hb is needed because of the serious negative effects to the region of completely depleting its freshwater 2 prolonging the life of the freshwater aquifer will require binational action because unilateral action on one side of the border is not enough and 3 solutions all include conservation of freshwater pumping from the aquifer the remaining differences being in the level of reduction and cost of conservation and alternative replacement to carry out that reduction such stakeholder consensus sets the stage for future discussions and negotiations aimed at binational cooperation in adaptive management 3 4 5 affordability of and access to potable water for vulnerable populations the rising costs of water are expected to have undue impact on vulnerable populations in ep a city in which 17 6 of the population lives below the poverty line we assessed these impacts through a household level analysis in different census tracts heyman et al 2022 in the context of varying water supply scenarios facing epw plus different climate and fresh groundwater depletion scenarios as well as regional demographic growth scenarios this was used then to calculate future costs to consumers following current billing practice all future supply models were dramatically more costly fig 12 from heyman et al 2022 shows significant impacts of higher costs on poor areas of the city seen in deeper orange and red they show profound cost of living impacts on low income households even for a minimal human need for water and cooling with potential for widespread debt and shutoffs these results show the need for future policy discussions to address social justice concerns related to the much greater cost of water 4 discussion 4 1 approach our project focused on the future of water in our region a region that is characterized by increasing water scarcity as supplies dwindle and demands rise addressing our objective of demonstrating and testing a holistic and integrated approach to addressing the core question regarding the future sustainability of water in the region required us to breach several common boundaries surface and subsurface water water quantity and quality primarily salt agricultural urban and industrial and ecosystem services sectors and the political jurisdictions of three states tx nm and ch in two nations the us and mx our research results and products were directed toward issues and questions identified at the start of the project by stakeholders several researchers have proven and or reviewed the positive results of stakeholder engagement and participatory approaches to water resources management robles morua et al 2014 megdal et al 2016 basco carrera et al 2017 but few have included the wide range of stakeholders that we did and focused stakeholder engagement on projections of the future hargrove and heyman 2020 the research required a large and diverse team from six institutions in the us and mx in particular the work of our modeling team culminated in making major models like the bucket model and mrg water balance model available through swim and the results from more computationally demanding models like swat modflow swat salt and others available to stakeholders our approach was built on working in interdisciplinary teams focused on the problems identified by stakeholders and cutting across sectors of users and political boundaries our research team representing a range of disciplines and the range of geographies of the region functioned as a whole rather than siloed components breeching a chief challenge of wicked water resources problems freeman 2000 this required frequent and regular communications and in person working meetings in addition to stakeholders we also engaged students at every level of this important work and thereby modeled interdisciplinary problem solving research approaches as part of their training and education the result is that we brought together many of the challenging pieces of the wicked water resources problem in the mrg and at least provided a coherent and holistic view of the water future though the preferred interventions are not yet agreed upon mayer et al 2021 4 2 implications of results for the future of water in the mrg our results show that there is a high probability of declining surface water inflows due to climate change in the rio grande headwaters found also by christensen et al 2004 hurd and coonrod 2012 and garfin et al 2018 our contribution is that we provide some quantification of these deficits for fifty years into the future using future climate projections our results show that there is increased risk of prolonged surface water shortages since eb reservoir will frequently be below 10 and 50 full under current water release protocols and will meet irrigation demands only 20 of the time under a plausible drier future climate scenario in spite of these deficits relatively low volumes of water would be required for environmental pulse flows a need emphasized by llewellyn et al 2013 and would result in relatively small reductions in the total value of water in the region while meeting important environmental goals increased groundwater extraction is now and will continue to be the response to decreased surface water as is the case for many other similarly challenged basins lamontagne et al 2014 mccallum et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 most of the groundwater pumped and the surface water delivered for irrigation in agriculture or used outdoors in urban areas is consumed via et extreme interventions will be needed in agriculture in order to sustain agricultural intensification under continuing climate change some examples of potential technologies that hold promise include desalination of brackish groundwater for irrigation developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use and transitioning to high value crops that are relatively drought and salt tolerant to increase the resiliency of irrigated agriculture samimi et al 2022b these measures need to be combined with improvements in agricultural irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and improved management such as et based irrigation scheduling to reduce demand through conservation in addition these water saving practices need to be combined with policies to limit water use since savings at the farm level paradoxically can lead to expansion of production a phenomenon known as jevon s paradox and proven worldwide in large scale projects aimed at improving irrigation efficiency perry et al 2017 without a concomitant change in water policy to capture savings through conservation farmers tend to use saved water to expand production in urban settings most of the water indoors is recycled through the wastewater system thus the greatest savings at a household level is through outdoor water conservation including more xeriscaping improved landscape irrigation and reduced reliance on water cooler based air conditioning though its replacement would be costly to financially marginalized households there is very little aquifer recharge in this desert river basin much more is pumped about 230 mcm yr primarily by cities than is replaced about 40 mcm yr from a combination of natural and agricultural recharge flood irrigation using surface water does provide some recharge to groundwater but flood irrigation using groundwater provides only return flow not really recharge total fresh groundwater depletion is likely well before the end of the century in about 40 50 years without changes in management technologies and or policies this result would be catastrophic to the economic health of the region hurd and coonrod 2012 stakeholders throughout the basin agree that interventions to prevent this probable outcome fresh groundwater depletion are called for but they do not agree on which possible interventions might be preferable the situation of stakeholders pointing of fingers at others expresses the fragmentation of water governance rights and responsibilities in the basin across nations states and other jurisdictions urban agricultural conflicts and surface subsurface water boundaries while stakeholder consensus did not emerge a basis for a common understanding of the problem was developed and for building knowledge and rapport for future shared decisions was established mayer et al 2021 policy management and or conservation changes could extend the life of aquifers but not indefinitely and will come at a high cost there is much more brackish groundwater compared to fresh groundwater but it is not useable as is and is expensive to treat these realities are what lead bierkens and wada 2019 to conclude that physically non sustainable withdrawal of groundwater is a global problem that is a slowly ticking time bomb for food security and related economic sustainability of civilizations worldwide our results show that greater systemic efforts at conservation use of brackish water via desalination increased reuse through water treatment artificial aquifer recharge and possibly water importation will all be necessary to meet growing demands of urban centers in challenged basins such as the mrg the net result is not that the region will run out of water but that water will be much more costly in the future within the next 3 4 decades the relatively cheap water will be consumed a significant social justice question needing serious research and policy debate is how will water needs be prioritized as supplies dwindle and who will bear the cost of developing and using new water sources to meet those needs heyman et al 2022 4 3 limitations of our study we faced a number of limitations related to data gaps for 1 groundwater extraction in mexico we were forced to use how much was licensed not how much was actually pumped in our analyses 2 private well pumping especially in texas where it is not reported 3 spatially specific data for recharge and return flows and water quality data for same 4 information on the distribution of crops year to year which impacts modeling results and 5 land cover change which was incompletely modeled and depended largely on extrapolation from historical data another limitation of our study was that we chose out of necessity with respect to limited resources to focus on water quantity primarily and much less on water quality increasing salinity is a growing problem in surface water groundwater and agricultural soils in both urban and agricultural sectors and will have significant consequences for the future this issue has received some attention in the literature but until now has not received the rigorous study that it deserves in the mrg a large scale salt mass balance approach is called for to understand the dynamics of salinization of our soils and water both surface and groundwater other water quality issues such as arsenic and nutrient loading are also deserving of attention finally our modeling of future decision making was based totally on hydroeconomic optimization which perhaps works fairly well for the agricultural sector but might not work as well for other users sectors our swim online platform needs to continue to be enhanced to enable modelers to easily add their models to the platform allowing stakeholders to run diverse models through a single interface the technical objective is to lower the barriers to learning how to run different models that may provide alternative perspectives on water issues ultimately the primary goal is to support stakeholders at all levels individual institutional policy in envisioning plausible future scenarios identifying those that are most desirable and considering interventions that could be made to reach desirable future outcomes 4 4 future research needs additional research is needed to address some of the limitations above especially analyzing and modeling the medium term dynamics of salinization in both agriculture and urban water supplies understanding the complex dynamics of water quantity and salinity in desert river basins in conjunction with aquifers containing both fresh and brackish water is paramount to sustaining useable water supplies pauloo et al 2021 the lack of water available for and allocated to environmental flows remains a challenge for the mrg it is necessary to better understand the feasibility and hydrologic and economic tradeoffs of environmental water allocation to support ecosystem services in this water scarce region under scenarios of climate change future research can explore a dynamic environmental water allocation scheme by adjusting the amount and cost of environmental flows based on water availability during wet or dry periods and economic value of water to minimize the effects of environmental water allocation on agricultural water availability and other water uses with regard to the future of water in the mrg there is a particular need for social science research to support adaptive management to arrive at preferred solutions and interventions that will promote sustainability the mrg presents a special challenge for transboundary water management based on collective goal setting rather than continuing the current fragmented approach to depletion of the common pool resource of freshwater adaptive cooperation could provide a useful framework for meeting this challenge what discursive and governance approaches could strengthen a shared common pool vision and practical governance system especially for transboundary situations heyman 2023 how can this be applied to the mrg and other transboundary conjunctive river aquifer settings the answers to these and other related questions could provide a way forward to a more sustainable water future 5 conclusions business as usual in the mrg is not sustainable climate is becoming warmer and drier now and this trend is expected to continue the situation will become perilous as it continues if change accelerates and it becomes much drier the situation can become even catastrophic the probable outcomes for the future of water in the region include 1 trends in agricultural intensification and the shift to perennial crops are locking in water demand combined with an increasing reliance on groundwater 2 growing urban populations are increasing overall demand forcing cities to more expensive sources of water 3 a warmer drier climate in the rio grande headwaters will result in less reliable surface water supplies and increasing reliance on groundwater 4 surface water is over allocated and the current governance structure does not allow flexibility in allocations that could result in more efficiency as supplies become less reliable nor is it likely to in the near future and 5 governance of groundwater is fractured between three states in two countries but stakeholders are interested in seeing voluntary binational cooperation on groundwater management moving forward we evaluated possible interventions technologically possible but not necessarily economically viable for agriculture possible interventions center around 1 alternative sources of water especially desalination of brackish water 2 alternative methods of irrigation especially drip irrigation 3 improved water management especially et based irrigation management 4 improved salinity management especially gypsum application or use of sulfur burner technologies and 5 alternative crops none of which are as profitable as pecans so their adoption would have to be subsidized we evaluated possible interventions that rely on alternative water sources for urban water use as well these include 1 more desalination 2 direct potable re use and 3 imported water all of these would make water much more expensive for urban consumers conservation especially related to outdoor water use also could be efficacious to a degree at much less cost the question of which of these is preferable in terms of efficacy cost and social justice is a question to be answered by stakeholders informed by policy oriented scientific research and would require much more public engagement and civic discourse than is now practiced typically however water management across all sectors and jurisdictions must be improved to realize a more sustainable future we faced several limitations including data gaps for a number of important parameters such as groundwater extraction in mexico private well pumping in texas spatially specific data for recharge and return flows and water quality data for same information on the distribution of crops year to year and detailed land cover change in addition a significant limitation of our study was that we did not focus as much attention on water quality issues especially salt as was probably warranted other water quality issues such as arsenic and nutrient loading are also deserving of attention finally our modeling of future decision making was based totally on hydroeconomic optimization which perhaps works well for the agricultural sector but might not work as well for other users sectors additional research is needed to address some of the limitations above especially analyzing and modeling the medium term dynamics of salinization in both agriculture and urban water supplies there is a need for a better understanding of the hydrologic and economic tradeoffs for water allocation to environmental flows regarding the future of water in the mrg there is a particular need for social science research to support adaptive management to arrive at preferred solutions and interventions that will promote sustainability the mrg presents a special challenge for transboundary water management based on collective goal setting rather than continuing the current fragmented approach to the depletion of the common pool resource of freshwater adaptive cooperation could provide a useful framework for meeting this challenge the answers to these and other related questions could provide a way forward to a more sustainable water future our work has several broader impacts for the scientific community as well as a broad range of stakeholders especially water managers and users for the scientific community we have demonstrated a viable process of identifying and engaging stakeholders in identifying problems evaluating modeling results that characterize the future identifying potential solutions or interventions and responding to modeling results that evaluate the outcomes of interventions our process formed the basis upon which we were able to synthesize a holistic vision of the future of water for the mrg though much work still needs to be done to identify stakeholder preferable interventions to achieve a sustainable future our interdisciplinary research team functioned as a whole rather than siloed components breeching a chief challenge of wicked water resources problems for water managers and users to meet the challenges of the future a new approach is called for one based on adaptive management pahl wostl 2007 and cooperation among sectors and across jurisdictions the challenges to achieving a more sustainable water future are many but among the greatest threats is aquifer depletion since groundwater is the most important source for urban uses and a growing source for agricultural uses because the aquifers are shared between the us and mx the problem of depletion is also shared thus the responsibility for the solutions also must be shared adaptive cooperation could provide a useful framework for meeting this challenge adaptive cooperation is needed across four important themes plus additional research and outreach in support of these themes 1 information sharing especially regarding groundwater pumping trends in total water demand use of alternative sources and conservation measures 2 conservation especially regarding outdoor water use in urban settings and improved irrigation management in agricultural settings 3 greater development and use of alternative water sources especially desalination wastewater reuse and imported water and 4 new limits to water allocation withdrawals coupled with more flexibility in uses a major policy question is how will the cost of these actions be borne credit authorship contribution statement w l hargrove conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation

chihuahua mexico study focus the future of water for the mrg and many other arid and semi arid regions of the world is challenged by a changing climate agricultural intensification growing urban populations and a segmented governance system in a transboundary setting the core question for such settings is how can water be managed so that competing agricultural urban and environmental sectors can realize a sustainable future we synthesize results from interdisciplinary research aimed at water futures considering possible probable and preferable outcomes from the known drivers of change in

water futures drivers of change agricultural intensification urbanization changing climate adaptive cooperation participatory modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction this research is focused on the future of water in the transboundary middle rio grande mrg basin defined by the portion of the basin from elephant butte eb reservoir in southern new mexico nm to the junta de los rios the convergence of the rio grande rg with the rio conchos in far west texas tx northern chihuahua ch this part of the rg basin faces water scarcity characterized by limited and dwindling supplies of water increasing demands for water from multiple sectors and a segmented governance system spanning three states in two countries hargrove et al 2013 the basin faces several drivers of change hargrove and heyman 2020 including 1 climate change that is impacting both water supply and demand garfin et al 2018 llewellyn et al 2013 2 agricultural intensification characterized by increasing production of high value high water demand crops hargrove et al 2021 3 urban growth impacting water demand and quality hargrove et al 2021 and 4 demand for environmental services such as riparian habitat and environmental flows llewellyn et al 2013 these converging drivers are resulting in dwindling surface water supplies and groundwater depletion not unlike many other basins especially in arid and semi arid regions gleeson et al 2012 wada et al 2010 dalin et al 2017 aeschbach hertig et al 2012 jasechko et al 2021 furthermore the water governance system in the region developed over 100 years ago is characterized by rigid water institutions weak stakeholder participation outside the direct beneficiaries of water allocations division by artificial borders and political jurisdictions and growing conflicts among the primary water users and other legitimate stakeholders hargrove and heyman 2020 hargrove et al 2021 resulting in what can be characterized as a wicked water resources problem rittel and webber 1973 comprehensive reviews on the state of knowledge of water resources in the region from about ten years ago gutzler 2013 hargrove et al 2013 hogan 2013 johnston 2013 scott and buechler 2013 sheng 2013 walsh 2013 showed that models have been developed for partial components of this system but modeling approaches in the mrg generally have paid limited attention to system feedbacks and non linear behavior human and climatic drivers of change and connections between surface and subsurface water all factors that have been shown to be important in other locations ahn and kim 2016 ahn et al 2016 kim et al 2017 lamontagne et al 2014 mccallum et al 2013 in the mrg and many other locations integrated analyses that result in holistic management strategies have been broached rarely talchabhadel et al 2021 provided a more recent and extensive review of one vital component of the system the hueco bolson hb aquifer concluding that modeling systems and research efforts to date are still inadequate to address the challenges of understanding and managing transboundary water challenges that include technical social political and jurisdictional issues sanchez and eckstein 2020 sanchez et al 2020 the challenges of this region are relevant because some if not most of them are faced by other river basins in arid and semi arid regions of the u s and the world where societies are dependent on a desert river basin and its associated aquifers to meet the needs of irrigated agriculture as well as growing urban populations while facing environmental needs as well castle et al 2014 thus the core question for the mrg and similar regions is how can water be managed so that the three largest competing sectors agricultural urban industrial and environmental can realize a sustainable future in such challenged water systems where supplies are dwindling and demands are increasing siloed component based research and analyses by single disciplines alone will not be able to adequately address this question a focus on probable possible and preferable water futures is called for one in which integrated science that cuts across traditional boundaries including disciplinary biophysical sectoral social and jurisdictional ones is combined with holistic collaborative management to identify the probable and possible outcomes while stakeholder driven decision making determines the preferable outcomes amara 1981 given the precarious position of the mrg basin s water resources under drivers of change we addressed these challenges by synthesizing and testing a holistic vision of water sustainability challenges and proposing integrative collaborative approaches and solutions crossing boundaries that are not commonly breached in the scientific literature using a suite of models that operate at a range of spatial and temporal scales we utilized stakeholder participatory approaches to modeling focused on the future of water in the region in the face of several drivers of change and evaluated possible interventions that might alter the future through stakeholder interactions we also evaluated the preference of or willingness to adopt certain technologies our objectives were to 1 demonstrate and test this holistic and integrated approach to address the core question above which is also applicable to similar regions worldwide and 2 synthesize the results into an analysis of the future of water in the mrg basin bridging several boundaries including disciplinary biophysical sectoral social and jurisdictional ones to provide an integrative narrative of the future of water in our region is a significant scientific contribution of our work 2 methods 2 1 our study area the middle rio grande waterscape our study area is illustrated in fig 1 and includes the mrg and two aquifers that contain good quality freshwater the mesilla bolson mb called conejos mÃ©danos in mx and hueco bolson hb called valle de juÃ¡rez in mx plus the associated alluvial aquifer connected to the river the river is the only significant source of surface water and the two aquifers are the primary sources of fresh groundwater for users in nm tx and ch which are dominated by three municipalities with a combined population of over 2 million people las cruces nm el paso tx and ciudad juÃ¡rez ch and a productive irrigated agriculture in the alluvial plain of the river on both sides of the border irrigated agriculture is confined primarily to the river corridor and is a highly managed system with little riparian habitat connected to a network of irrigation canals diverting water to agriculture and a network of drains to return unused water to the river the amount of surface water is dictated primarily by snowfall snowmelt and runoff in the rg headwaters in colorado co and northern nm streamflow in the upper part of the basin is partitioned under the rio grande compact of 1939 and the us mexico treaty of 1906 legally binding agreements between upstream users and downstream users with the water for downstream users collected and stored in several reservoirs of which the largest is elephant butte eb reservoir fig 1 the primary sources of good quality groundwater are contained in the hb and the mb the deeper hb and large portions of the mb both shared by the us and mx are primarily fossil deposits of water with little or no recharge thus drawdown represents withdrawals against current and future reserves of freshwater as well as growing threats of increasing salinity in those reserves both aquifers contain both fresh and brackish water with salinity levels ranging from 1000 mg l total dissolved solids tds in the freshwater to brackish concentrations of up to 3000 mg l and higher there is much more brackish water than freshwater in mayer et al 2021 the current rate of depletion for the hb was estimated to be 191 mcm yr this estimate is supported by decreases in published groundwater elevations which have accelerated over the past 50 years fig 2 we estimate that a total of more than 9000 mcm of freshwater have been removed from the hb over the past 100 years through 2013 based on the volume of freshwater remaining and the depletion rate mayer et al 2021 estimated that the recoverable freshwater will be completely depleted in approximately 42 years with serious economic outcomes hurd and coonrod 2012 unless there are significant interventions to alter supply and or demand business as usual without significant decreases to pumping is clearly not sustainable at the same time both ep and cj have experienced increasing salinity in the water being pumped because high pumping and depletion rates have caused brackish water intrusion into freshwater zones of the hb for example salinity increased from 750 mg l to 1200 mg l from 1979 to 1993 in an el paso water epw monitoring well an increase of 30 mg l per year mayer et al 2021 thus usable freshwater might be depleted even sooner than 42 years due to saltwater intrusion the situation is further exacerbated by changes in the agricultural sector where growers have transitioned away from annual crops with limited profit margins such as cotton to higher value perennials such as pecans which require comparatively much more water hargrove et al 2021 the result is that while a warmer drier climate is reducing water supplies from the river agricultural users are driven to pump more groundwater to meet irrigation needs this is compounded by urbanization of agricultural land due to population growth and urban sprawl mubako et al 2018 resulting in increased water demand overall hargrove et al 2021 thus finite and relatively cheap freshwater supplies are dwindling some steps to augment water supplies have been taken by the two primary urban water utilities epw and junta municipal de agua y saneamiento jmas in cj such as desalination and use of brackish water increased water recycling and reuse and importation of water plus efforts to reduce demand through conservation also have been made with some success but in sum these efforts to augment supply and reduce demand have made and in the future are likely to make only relatively small changes in the regional rate of groundwater pumping and aquifer depletion as out results will demonstrate 2 2 stakeholder engagement and participation our process of stakeholder engagement and participation is described in hargrove and heyman 2020 and was based on methods of participatory modeling morua robles et al 2014 kelly et al 2013 our target audiences were all stakeholders concerned about the future of water in the mrg region and their involvement was an iterative process that built upon each encounter over the course of five years from our work with stakeholders including those representing agriculture urban users environmental concerns social justice and government policy interests we summarize below important challenges to sustainable water futures organized into four key themes hargrove and heyman 2020 which also provided focus for our modeling work 2 2 1 the spiral of climate change prolonged drought groundwater depletion and salinization predicting planning and managing for prolonged drought was the top concern of most stakeholders both agricultural and urban coupled with concerns about the future of aquifers stakeholders agreed that identifying and quantifying the impact of future climate scenarios including the depletion of groundwater reserves was a prerequisite to planning and managing for what they termed prolonged drought at present agricultural stakeholders response to the growing unreliability of water supplies from the river is to pump more groundwater and the response to the concomitant dropping water tables is to dig deeper wells 2 2 2 agricultural intensification urbanization and lack of conjunctive management in brief agricultural intensification is leading to greater extraction of groundwater as surface water supplies become increasingly unreliable the net result is aquifer depletion and deterioration of water quality primarily from brackish groundwater intrusion combined with return flows that are more saline than what was extracted components of the conjunctive water system in the basin have been modeled but generally the connection of the surface and groundwater is poorly understood though some progress has been made fuchs et al 2019 a better understanding of the interaction of surface and groundwater to support better conjunctive management remains a research challenge stakeholders desire to know the limits of groundwater pumping for the future at present both agricultural and urban stakeholders solution to dwindling supplies and increasing demand is to augment supplies through technology management and or importation on the other hand environmental and social justice stakeholders tend to define the problem through the need to reduce demand by the big water users through conservation which would allow expanded access for environmental uses and for thousands of vulnerable border residents who lack access to potable water hargrove et al 2018 2 2 3 the complexity and obsolescence of the water governance framework the water governance framework for this binational multi state region was described in detail in hargrove et al 2021 a major deficiency is that the relevant treaty and interstate compacts were established prior to the development of a full understanding hydrologically of the connectivity between surface water and groundwater due to the fragmented jurisdictional boundaries diverse sectoral uses and weakly acknowledged surface subsurface interactions first termed hydroschizophrenia by llamas 1975 applied to transboundary waters by jarvis et al 2005 and applied more generally to the situation in the mrg by hargrove et al 2021 interested parties often conceptualize the water system in divided non integrated ways and therefore place blame on some other part of the system other users or jurisdictional areas when faced with undesirable outcomes this has led to numerous ongoing legal challenges lawsuits currently within nm and between tx and nm as we will report in our results we tried to breach these boundaries through our holistic approach 2 2 4 land ownership water rights and threats agricultural stakeholders particularly in the u s and to a lesser degree in mexico have a strong feeling of ownership of water rights as part of land ownership coupled with the concomitant sense of threat to those water rights emanating from the current situation of increasingly unreliable water supplies hargrove and heyman 2020 the sense of threat the growing unreliability of water supplies and the growing tension among different sectors of users and across jurisdictional boundaries converge to put farmers on guard against multiple threats and risks to not only their rights to water but to their livelihood and quality of life brause 2021 they tend to approach these perceived threats from a standpoint of scarcity commonly blaming competing users for the unreliability of water supplies for agriculture this stance adds to the wickedness of the problem in visualizing and addressing water futures 2 3 theory crossing boundaries in evaluating water futures to address the core question and the chief concerns of stakeholders identified above we focused our research on water futures considering possible probable and preferable future outcomes from the known drivers of change and considering interventions that could alter those outcomes we accomplished this by developing and evaluating scenarios using models and with the input and participation of stakeholders to evaluate water futures we integrated dynamics across numerous dimensions that ordinarily are bounded and studied separately from each other for example granados olivas et al 2019 our research goal was to use modeling approaches that integrate across an array of artificial divisions i e surface subsurface water urban agricultural environmental uses and international interstate jurisdictions use stakeholder inputs and modeling outputs to evaluate water futures and address concerns of stakeholders about water futures including evaluating improvements in management technology policy such connections are usually acknowledged but less often breached in practice because a large interdisciplinary binational team is needed to do so as a result the interacting dynamics across biophysical and sociopolitical dimensions are in general poorly integrated in either research or practice the value of our integrative project was to unify all the drivers stocks and flows of water in one integrated vision of the regional system across conventional boundaries drawing on our own published work and that of others we present here the results of our synthesis especially results for several boundary crossing processes that we addressed that inform not only the future of the mrg but also similar desert river systems in the southwestern us and around the world our contribution is a holistic vision of water sustainability challenges and potential solutions for the future based on our own and other published work on components of the system in our region 2 4 modeling framework we developed and or evaluated a suite of calibrated models that performed at various spatial from agricultural field to river basin and temporal from daily to decades scales and which functioned across biophysical and jurisdictional boundaries to address the important themes and research questions of concern about future conditions and potential interventions that could alter future conditions our suite of modeling tools are presented and summarized in table 1 below we briefly describe some of the specific uses of each model in our analyses throughout the modeling activities we incorporated stakeholder participation in an iterative way as we tested scenarios shared results discussed interventions and tested interventions hargrove and heyman 2020 scientifically sound climate scenarios for the future were fundamental to our modeling work we developed several climate scenarios to use in simulations with the bucket model the mrg water balance model and the suite of swat modflow based models we used a large ensemble of usbr generated projections of naturalized streamflow along the rg which were driven by cmip5 global climate model simulations the usbr simulations are widely used by regional water managers providing us with an ensemble of state of the art credible projections of future climate and streamflow including a wide range of global climate models and future greenhouse gas forcing scenarios output used in our research included bias adjusted downscaled temperature and precipitation in the study area and associated projections of naturalized rg flow the procedures used for statistical downscaling bcsd and the surface hydrological model driven by simulated climate variables vic are discussed in detail by usbr 2013 and llewellyn et al 2013 for our project townsend and gutzler 2020 developed an adjustment algorithm to shift usbr s flow projections from eb dam to a point upstream corresponding to the san marcial gage near the inlet to eb reservoir more importantly the adjustment procedure also statistically accounted for upstream anthropogenic withdrawals by bias correcting the simulated annual flows during a historical period to match the statistics of gaged flow at san marcial preserving this bias adjustment into the future essentially assumes no change in upstream water management policy through this century townsend and gutzler 2020 the mrg water balance model was used to develop projections of the future of water resources in the region under 1 business as usual conditions 2 future climate scenarios 3 changing demands for water and 4 conjunctive management to include consequences of groundwater pumping irrigation system efficiency and seepage from the main channel of the rg and irrigation channels this model was also enhanced or combined with other cost accounting models to project future costs for urban water assess costs of environmental flows and address policy questions the hydroeconomic optimization bucket model was used in paired comparisons with and without proposed interventions to permit assessment of changes in outcomes the annual water balance component of the bucket model was used to simulate storages and flows for climate scenarios in a futures mode sub models were developed for reservoir evaporation rates reservoir elevation storage surface area irrigated agriculture evapotranspiration and return flows urban evapotranspiration and return flows groundwater surface water exchanges and groundwater elevations it was used as a decision support framework for improving our and stakeholders understanding of the basin evaluating scenarios from an economics perspective and addressing questions that were important to stakeholders swim 1 0 the user interface with the bucket model enables users to graphically a define default or customized parameters representing human activities and climate scenarios b seamlessly run the bucket model c graphically explore the outputs of the model and d graphically explore the sources and processing provenance of the data villanueva rosales et al 2017 garnica chavira et al 2018 links to swim 1 0 are provided in table s1 in the supplementary material file an improved version swim 2 0 will expand its capabilities and uses and continue to provide access to the bucket model and mrg water balance model to assess land use and land cover change lulc we produced historical and current land use land cover maps and the results were used in the bucket and swat models to evaluate water use implications of lulc this required development of a methodology for improving land use classification through analyzing patterns of temporal change mubako et al 2018 we successfully completed the generation of the annual lulc maps from 1990 to 2015 for the entire us mx study area mubako et al 2018 and evaluated land cover change through a markov change analysis future projections of land use change were not made swat mf was used in a variety of ways including evaluation of climate change impacts agricultural water management interventions and adaptation to cope with warm dry futures pinales munguÃ­a et al 2019 samimi et al 2018 2020 2022 2023 we also modified swat with a salinity module and simulated salinity processes in the eb irrigation district using the swat salt to assess biophysical factors that impact salinity samimi et al 2019 smituv a system dynamic model in stella was used for assessing field scale salinity in pecan poulose et al 2021 palmate et al 2022 3 results we synthesize and organize our results into four major themes in response to stakeholders chief concerns and described above in section 2 2 1 climate change and the future of surface and groundwater 2 agricultural intensification and the future of agriculture 3 urbanization and the future for urban water use and 4 implications for the future of water governance 3 1 theme climate change and the future of surface and groundwater 3 1 1 impacts of climate change on the future of surface water usbr s cmip5 based future climate projections range from very wet to very dry spanning an enormous range that limits certainty in future water supply projections lehner et al 2019 assessing which projections are most likely was beyond the scope of our project we provide here an example of some results of projections of streamflow into eb reservoir fig 3 adapted from townsend and gutzler 2020 to bracket the possibilities in future climate we chose specific simulations that included a very wet future simulating flows that tend to increase with time green curve in fig 3 a midrange projection that exhibits drier conditions after mid century purple curve in fig 3 and a very dry simulation that includes almost no high flow years in the future red curve in fig 3 this wide range of future rg inflow scenarios was used as input to many of the other modeling assessments carried out to examine potential climate change impacts on reservoir management groundwater and crop selection strategies as described in the sections to follow the ensemble of simulations black curves in fig 4 exhibits a trend toward more prolonged drought and dwindling supplies of surface water over the next 50 years consistent with recent consensus assessments of likely future trends in streamflow and aridity in the southwestern us jay et al 2018 hicke et al 2022 the ensemble average decline occurs despite the presence of several very wet simulations such as the green curve in fig 4 the implications for surface water supplies associated with the three individual scenarios in fig 3 were explored using the mrg water balance model fig 4 adapted from holmes et al 2022 in these scenarios surface water collected in eb reservoir met allocated demand in only about 20 of the years under the midrange drier scenario purple curve in figs 3 and 4 b and did not meet full demand at any time during the period of simulation under the very dry scenario red curve in figs 3 and 4a 3 1 2 impacts of climate change on the future of groundwater the drivers of change discussed above for surface water climate plus growing demands plus compensatory groundwater use to meet surface water shortfalls portend the exacerbation of groundwater declines for the future projected impacts of climate change on groundwater storage in the hueco bolson are shown in fig 5 for the same climate scenarios used in fig 4 a very dry future a moderately dry future and a very wet future results show that for the very dry scenario the freshwater in the hb could be depleted in only 30 years and for the moderately dry scenario about 40 50 years 3 2 theme agricultural intensification and the future of agriculture 3 2 1 intensification of agriculture and its impact on total demand the results of decreasing surface supply under changing climate and increasing total demand under agricultural intensification lead to increasingly large and sustained deficits in surface water supply which in turn lead to more groundwater use to make up the surface water deficit plus the groundwater being pumped today is increasingly saline as the freshwater of the shared aquifers is depleted if the current trajectory of intensification of production continues it will have significant implications for sustainable water management in the region our results samimi et al 2023 show that if we were to experience a prolonged drought of 8 10 years for example current irrigation methods limits would fail to meet the needs of pecans unless all other crops are removed from production to save pecan orchards fig 6 relatively strong measures such as eliminating the cultivation of alfalfa for example generate only moderate water savings samimi et al 2023 more extreme interventions will be needed under continuing climate change as agricultural intensification continues 3 2 2 potential interventions 3 2 2 1 alternative sources of water almost all treated wastewater is used already for irrigation in our region another potentially significant alternative source is brackish water which is not used at this time for irrigation using our models we evaluated pecan water use for two future adaptation scenarios in a dry climate future samimi et al 2022 a irrigation with river water fresh groundwater and desalinated groundwater this exemplifies a dry period where surface water is inadequate there is heavy reliance on groundwater and desalination is available to treat brackish groundwater and b irrigation with river water and fresh groundwater only this exemplifies a dry period where surface water is inadequate there is heavy reliance on groundwater that is becoming more saline and desalination is not available fig 7 these results show that as groundwater becomes more saline agricultural productivity decreases unless saline groundwater can be treated or replaced with alternate sources either of which will be very costly we conducted a cost analysis of desalination in agriculture we examined the potential for irrigating salt sensitive crops e g pecans with blends of desalinated brackish groundwater and fresh surface or groundwater and irrigating salt tolerant crops e g quinoa with desalination concentrate water we used a simple cost benefit model that estimated crop yields based on irrigation water salinity the net return was based on gross returns from the harvested crops minus production costs production costs included the net present value for purchasing and operating the desalination unit and other farm input expenses such as labor fertilizer and operation of machinery irrigation water scheduling was based on current practices in the region the results of this simple analysis resulted in desalination costs that are prohibitive compared to the net returns the costs exceeded benefits over a range of sensitive variables such as the fractions of salt sensitive and salt tolerant crops desalinated water freshwater blends energy prices and discount rates however desalination costs to farmers could be reduced by offsetting the purchase price with incentives and or by using solar power to generate the electricity required by the desalination system furthermore salt tolerant crops such as quinoa have not been cultivated in the region so it is not known if farmers would be willing to dedicate land to adopting these crops with no processing or marketing infrastructure in place 3 2 2 2 alternative methods and improved management of irrigation flood irrigation remains the predominant form of irrigation in the study area in terms of water use efficiency flood irrigation is generally in the range of 65 70 most of the unused 30 35 of applied water percolates below the root zone with about 5 10 being lost to evaporation samani et al 2011 we evaluated several improved irrigation methods including surge irrigation and drip irrigation alatorre cejudo et al 2019 ganjegunte et al 2020 drip irrigation can improve efficiency to 80 90 but has a significant capital cost furthermore many irrigators are reluctant to adopt high efficiency irrigation methods such as drip irrigation because of salinity concerns we compared rootzone salinity under four types of irrigation systems with water having an electrical conductivity ec of 1 ds m ganjegunte et al 2020 results showed that flood irrigation resulted in higher salinity in the root zone compared to drip or surge irrigation the subsurface drip evaluation was in a turf field and resulted in concentrated salinity at the soil surface because salts accumulated at the drip line and migrated to the soil surface due to high evaporation rates surge or surface drip irrigation shows a lot of promise for decreasing total water use especially when using groundwater as the source cox et al 2018 deb et al 2013 stetson and mecham 2011 shalekbriski et al 2019 flood irrigation using surface water is not as efficient in terms of crop production but the water lost to percolation becomes recharge to groundwater a time based method of scheduling irrigation is followed by most irrigators in our region and is based on simply counting the number of days since the last irrigation by using evapotranspiration et based irrigation scheduling our results show that at least two irrigations per season can be saved without reductions in yield ganjegunte et al 2012 for example with an estimated 6100 ha in pecans in the el paso county irrigation district and 127 mm irrigation 2 fewer irrigations translate into a potential water savings of 15 mcm per year 3 2 2 3 improved salinity management as groundwater becomes more saline soil salinity builds up over time gypsum as a soil amendment improves the leaching of salt in soil because calcium sulfate is very effective at replacing sodium chloride ganjegunte et al 2017 using a sulfur burner is also effective in converting elemental sulfur to sulfate through oxidation which will form calcium sulfate in soil and in turn leach sodium salts from the profile this was shown to be an effective treatment for reducing salt in soil ganjegunte et al 2018 ganjegunte and clark 2019 3 2 2 4 alternative crops we evaluated several alternative crops to pecan such as other perennials like pistachio pomegranate niu et al 2018 hooks et al 2021 and switchgrass sun et al 2018 and annuals such as guar energy sorghum forage sorghum and canola suthar et al 2018a 2018b 2019 though these crops are generally adapted to the climate and soil conditions of our region they cannot compete economically with pecan under current economic conditions also in many cases transitioning to these crops is limited by the lack of crop specialized infrastructure such as processing facilities and or developed markets chaganti et al 2020 2021a 2021b in summary though alternative crops have the potential to produce with much less water inputs they will not be adopted under current conditions without significant financial investments in infrastructure external incentives to farmers or both 3 3 theme urbanization and the future of urban water use 3 3 1 current water use by ep cj though the three largest cities in the region ep lc and cj rely primarily on groundwater from the mb and hb it is important to recognize that the cities use other water sources as well fig 8 illustrates the average volume of water from each source delivered to treatment facilities in ep and cj ep s water portfolio is more diverse than that of cj cj s large dependence on hb freshwater makes it more vulnerable as freshwater storage in hb is depleted table 2 presents water use from ep cj and lc alger et al 2020 these results show that cj uses more water than ep but since the population in cj greatly exceeds that of el paso the per capita use in ep is almost twice that of cj cj 135 ep 235 m3 the difference in per capita use is explained mostly by the greater evaporative outdoor use in ep more than 50 of total use in ep and only 33 in cj 3 3 2 the future under business as usual we developed a baseline scenario that was meant to set the stage for choosing interventions that might alter the future the baseline scenario assumes that urban populations and thus water demands will increase and there will be no significant change in policies that would slow depletion of the hb thus it describes a future with business as usual bau our bau scenario spans a 50 year period 2020 2070 and is based on the following assumptions a population will increase by 66 in cj and 35 in ep and per capita usage will remain the same resulting in an average annual demand for cj of 252 mcm yr and el paso of 174 mcm yr over the 50 year period b pumping from the hb will increase in proportion to the increase in demand for the two cities c water availability from the rg will be reduced over the period due to low flows caused by climate change in the headwaters resulting in a reduction of the availability from this source for epw of 26 37 mcm yr for most years d warmer temperatures will impact water demand in cities including a lengthening growing season by at least 4 6 weeks and more days over 38 degrees c these changes cause greater total et from landscaping and outdoor green spaces e other users especially irrigators will use more groundwater for reasons described above f recharge from the river will decrease because flow will be reduced due to climate change while recharge from canals also will diminish as irrigation districts concrete line their ditches to enhance downstream deliveries g average salinity in groundwater pumped from the hb will increase from 500 mg l to over 1500 mg l as tds h average groundwater levels in the hb will change at a rate equivalent to the depletion rate the result of projecting the bau scenario 50 years into the future is shown in fig 9 given a depletion rate of 258 mcm yr and an estimate for recoverable freshwater of 8018 mcm the recoverable freshwater would be completely depleted in 31 years derived from fig 9 where compete depletion is defined by the point at which the aquifer can no longer support the water supply needs of users furthermore the negative impacts of depletion could affect users well before complete depletion since cones of depression around wells could increase faster than average making water levels drop below the well intake necessitating either abandonment or drilling deeper wells also from fig 9 regardless it is certain that pumping costs will grow substantially throughout the 50 yr period of projection as a result of dropping water tables and energy costs under this bau scenario usable freshwater in the hb will be completely depleted by about the year 2050 or before depending on the salinity dynamics meeting drinking and other household needs for water for millions of people on both sides of the border are compelling reasons for stakeholders to identify affordable and effective solutions to aquifer depletion clearly action is called for to avert this devastating result 3 3 3 future supply and demand and cost of alternative sources fig 10 shows the projected population growth and concomitant water demand relative to current supply projected demand is expected to exceed projected supply within the next thirty or so years assuming no change in per capita consumption as groundwater sources are depleted alternative sources will have to be tapped to meet growing demand resulting in increased cost of water to residents fig 11 the least expensive alternative source is desalination of brackish groundwater while water importation is the most expensive furthermore urban centers can improve water sustainability and resiliency by reusing municipal wastewater especially for drinking water supplies direct potable reuse of wastewater could reduce the amount of fresh groundwater pumping by cities though it is a very expensive alternative and carries a certain amount of consumer stigma we evaluated several conservation practices at the household level for urban consumers capt et al 2021 the greatest consumptive use in the urban environment and thus the greatest opportunity for conservation is outdoor vegetation and evaporation from bare soil alger et al 2020 reducing landscaping uses of water through practices like xeriscaping and others would be an effective way to reduce urban demand and if incentivized could be financially attractive to urban water users also rainwater harvesting and its use for outdoor watering is an effective way to reduce use of potable water for landscaping hargrove et al 2020 regardless since alternative sources are several times more expensive per unit volume than current sources and reductions in per capita consumption cannot reasonably make up the difference consumers will have to expect to pay considerably more for potable water in the future as alternative sources become necessary 3 4 theme implications of water futures for water governance 3 4 1 management of eb reservoir we evaluated the impact of the current eb reservoir operating rules for downstream releases on the ability to account for climate change and resulting conditions in the watershed holmes et al 2022 we addressed these questions a under current operating rules how will downstream surface water supplies be affected by projected climate change b how resilient are the current reservoir management rules to projected climate change c how will increases in temperature which will lead to higher evaporative losses from reservoirs compare to impacts on upstream snow fed flows results from holmes et al 2022 for future climate simulations with warming temperatures showed decreases in surface water supplies across all parameters explored despite increasing evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures in our climate projections there was little change in the volume lost to reservoir surface evaporation compared to the past 50 years this is because the operating agreement for releasing water from the reservoir results in continuously low reservoir surface area and thus similar evaporation volumes under low inflows thus maintaining the current operating agreement for releases under a warming climate results in lower downstream water availability overall local precipitation and evaporation had little impact on reservoir storage and thus future water supply in the mrg is relatively insensitive to projected changes in local precipitation instead the water supply is strongly determined by diminishing snowmelt runoff occurring far upstream unfortunately this means that water managers and or users would have limited ability to impact water supply through local water capture or changes in storage policies because such policies are unlikely to compensate for diminishing water flows into the reservoir our results show that water availability will need to be addressed through changes in policies that impact reservoir releases and the related water demand downstream for our study reservoir management practices were held constant throughout the study period which allowed us to isolate the hydrologic effects of climate change on water availability but given the high probability of reduced flows into the reservoir managers and users will need to find ways to adapt to diminishing reliability of water availability by reconsidering reservoir operating policies and or renegotiating water sharing agreements to better match the water demand with a diminishing supply that the reservoir system can support 3 4 2 environmental flows historically almost no surface water has been allocated to serve environmental needs in the region by agreement with the usbr all the water stored in eb reservoir is allocated to the two irrigation districts in nm and tx and by treaty to the irrigation district in ch this precludes environmental uses of rg water and remains a subject of debate for future water policy the international boundary and water commission ibwc has proposed periodic pulse flows in times of ample supply to flood riparian areas to encourage riparian vegetation we evaluated the water requirements for pulse flows every 5 10 years table 3 for this evaluation we applied the hydroeconomic optimization bucket model to investigate cost to water users as a result of securing water for environmental flows without assigning any economic benefit to environmental flows torell et al 2022 two eb inflow scenarios were considered 1 a baseline of historical weather 1995 2015 a very wet scenario projection 2016 2024 and 2 50 of inflows as prescribed for scenario 1 above we calculated the amounts of water and approximate costs for each of these scenarios at best out of any climate or pulse flow timing scenario the total value of water is reduced by only 0 05 at worst the total value of water is reduced by 2 5 this strategy would require relatively small amounts of water amounting to generally less than 2 of the total annual flow in any one year yet there currently is insufficient political will to make changes to provide this amount of water for environmental flows 3 4 3 agricultural interventions to improve water use efficiency and decrease total water use we evaluated several interventions that are technically feasible and that could change either water use efficiency and or total water use in agriculture significantly specifically game changing interventions include desalination of brackish groundwater conversion from flood to drip irrigation and alternative crops that would require much less water all of these either would require considerable capital expense to implement desalination and drip irrigation or are much less profitable than pecan production we tested these ideas with stakeholders but found no interest or desire to implement these practices without considerable financial incentives other interventions that are less costly and that they are willing to implement have much smaller but still significant impacts like improved irrigation timing for example interventions that will have significant impact will require policies to incentivize their adoption 3 4 4 slowing groundwater depletion at present there is no shared governance of groundwater in the hb either binationally or between states but governed instead by the rules and regulations of the individual states and or countries who share it furthermore the hydrological fact that surface and subsurface water are connected and should be managed conjunctively is not considered in this strictly delineated governance system hargrove et al 2021 based on these conditions we evaluated with stakeholders possible and preferable changes to water governance that would prolong the life of the aquifer we conducted a binational multisector serious games workshop to explore collaborative solutions for extending the life of the shared hb aquifer mayer et al 2021 we evaluated several potential pumping restrictions with stakeholders including 1 each city ep and cj reduce pumping by 15 2 each city reduce pumping by 25mcm yr 3 each city reduce pumping by 35 4 each city reduce pumping by 50 mcm yr 5 each city reduce pumping by 35 plus reduce demand by 13 and 6 reduce pumping by 50mc yr and reduce demand by 44 mcm yr since cj relies much more on the hb and pumps much more than ep equal percentage reductions mean that cj has to reduce pumping by much larger amounts than ep stakeholder preferences spanned the range of choices with no clear consensus on preference detailed results can be found in mayer et al 2021 since the two countries come to the issue with uneven financial and technical resources and different political and social constraints an easy and obvious solution is not possible even though we did not achieve a consensus the value of the serious game workshop was building knowledge interest understanding and mutual recognition among stakeholders from both sides of the border in an informal setting the qualities of mutual respect and trust essential for long run convergence were enhanced by shared learning in the games process e g a key realization was the cost and necessity of ensuring water supply for the municipal utilities especially cj in spite of not achieving consensus on a single path forward frameworks for potential binational solutions emerged including 1 participants agreed that action to slow the drawdown of fresh water in the hb is needed because of the serious negative effects to the region of completely depleting its freshwater 2 prolonging the life of the freshwater aquifer will require binational action because unilateral action on one side of the border is not enough and 3 solutions all include conservation of freshwater pumping from the aquifer the remaining differences being in the level of reduction and cost of conservation and alternative replacement to carry out that reduction such stakeholder consensus sets the stage for future discussions and negotiations aimed at binational cooperation in adaptive management 3 4 5 affordability of and access to potable water for vulnerable populations the rising costs of water are expected to have undue impact on vulnerable populations in ep a city in which 17 6 of the population lives below the poverty line we assessed these impacts through a household level analysis in different census tracts heyman et al 2022 in the context of varying water supply scenarios facing epw plus different climate and fresh groundwater depletion scenarios as well as regional demographic growth scenarios this was used then to calculate future costs to consumers following current billing practice all future supply models were dramatically more costly fig 12 from heyman et al 2022 shows significant impacts of higher costs on poor areas of the city seen in deeper orange and red they show profound cost of living impacts on low income households even for a minimal human need for water and cooling with potential for widespread debt and shutoffs these results show the need for future policy discussions to address social justice concerns related to the much greater cost of water 4 discussion 4 1 approach our project focused on the future of water in our region a region that is characterized by increasing water scarcity as supplies dwindle and demands rise addressing our objective of demonstrating and testing a holistic and integrated approach to addressing the core question regarding the future sustainability of water in the region required us to breach several common boundaries surface and subsurface water water quantity and quality primarily salt agricultural urban and industrial and ecosystem services sectors and the political jurisdictions of three states tx nm and ch in two nations the us and mx our research results and products were directed toward issues and questions identified at the start of the project by stakeholders several researchers have proven and or reviewed the positive results of stakeholder engagement and participatory approaches to water resources management robles morua et al 2014 megdal et al 2016 basco carrera et al 2017 but few have included the wide range of stakeholders that we did and focused stakeholder engagement on projections of the future hargrove and heyman 2020 the research required a large and diverse team from six institutions in the us and mx in particular the work of our modeling team culminated in making major models like the bucket model and mrg water balance model available through swim and the results from more computationally demanding models like swat modflow swat salt and others available to stakeholders our approach was built on working in interdisciplinary teams focused on the problems identified by stakeholders and cutting across sectors of users and political boundaries our research team representing a range of disciplines and the range of geographies of the region functioned as a whole rather than siloed components breeching a chief challenge of wicked water resources problems freeman 2000 this required frequent and regular communications and in person working meetings in addition to stakeholders we also engaged students at every level of this important work and thereby modeled interdisciplinary problem solving research approaches as part of their training and education the result is that we brought together many of the challenging pieces of the wicked water resources problem in the mrg and at least provided a coherent and holistic view of the water future though the preferred interventions are not yet agreed upon mayer et al 2021 4 2 implications of results for the future of water in the mrg our results show that there is a high probability of declining surface water inflows due to climate change in the rio grande headwaters found also by christensen et al 2004 hurd and coonrod 2012 and garfin et al 2018 our contribution is that we provide some quantification of these deficits for fifty years into the future using future climate projections our results show that there is increased risk of prolonged surface water shortages since eb reservoir will frequently be below 10 and 50 full under current water release protocols and will meet irrigation demands only 20 of the time under a plausible drier future climate scenario in spite of these deficits relatively low volumes of water would be required for environmental pulse flows a need emphasized by llewellyn et al 2013 and would result in relatively small reductions in the total value of water in the region while meeting important environmental goals increased groundwater extraction is now and will continue to be the response to decreased surface water as is the case for many other similarly challenged basins lamontagne et al 2014 mccallum et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 most of the groundwater pumped and the surface water delivered for irrigation in agriculture or used outdoors in urban areas is consumed via et extreme interventions will be needed in agriculture in order to sustain agricultural intensification under continuing climate change some examples of potential technologies that hold promise include desalination of brackish groundwater for irrigation developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use and transitioning to high value crops that are relatively drought and salt tolerant to increase the resiliency of irrigated agriculture samimi et al 2022b these measures need to be combined with improvements in agricultural irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and improved management such as et based irrigation scheduling to reduce demand through conservation in addition these water saving practices need to be combined with policies to limit water use since savings at the farm level paradoxically can lead to expansion of production a phenomenon known as jevon s paradox and proven worldwide in large scale projects aimed at improving irrigation efficiency perry et al 2017 without a concomitant change in water policy to capture savings through conservation farmers tend to use saved water to expand production in urban settings most of the water indoors is recycled through the wastewater system thus the greatest savings at a household level is through outdoor water conservation including more xeriscaping improved landscape irrigation and reduced reliance on water cooler based air conditioning though its replacement would be costly to financially marginalized households there is very little aquifer recharge in this desert river basin much more is pumped about 230 mcm yr primarily by cities than is replaced about 40 mcm yr from a combination of natural and agricultural recharge flood irrigation using surface water does provide some recharge to groundwater but flood irrigation using groundwater provides only return flow not really recharge total fresh groundwater depletion is likely well before the end of the century in about 40 50 years without changes in management technologies and or policies this result would be catastrophic to the economic health of the region hurd and coonrod 2012 stakeholders throughout the basin agree that interventions to prevent this probable outcome fresh groundwater depletion are called for but they do not agree on which possible interventions might be preferable the situation of stakeholders pointing of fingers at others expresses the fragmentation of water governance rights and responsibilities in the basin across nations states and other jurisdictions urban agricultural conflicts and surface subsurface water boundaries while stakeholder consensus did not emerge a basis for a common understanding of the problem was developed and for building knowledge and rapport for future shared decisions was established mayer et al 2021 policy management and or conservation changes could extend the life of aquifers but not indefinitely and will come at a high cost there is much more brackish groundwater compared to fresh groundwater but it is not useable as is and is expensive to treat these realities are what lead bierkens and wada 2019 to conclude that physically non sustainable withdrawal of groundwater is a global problem that is a slowly ticking time bomb for food security and related economic sustainability of civilizations worldwide our results show that greater systemic efforts at conservation use of brackish water via desalination increased reuse through water treatment artificial aquifer recharge and possibly water importation will all be necessary to meet growing demands of urban centers in challenged basins such as the mrg the net result is not that the region will run out of water but that water will be much more costly in the future within the next 3 4 decades the relatively cheap water will be consumed a significant social justice question needing serious research and policy debate is how will water needs be prioritized as supplies dwindle and who will bear the cost of developing and using new water sources to meet those needs heyman et al 2022 4 3 limitations of our study we faced a number of limitations related to data gaps for 1 groundwater extraction in mexico we were forced to use how much was licensed not how much was actually pumped in our analyses 2 private well pumping especially in texas where it is not reported 3 spatially specific data for recharge and return flows and water quality data for same 4 information on the distribution of crops year to year which impacts modeling results and 5 land cover change which was incompletely modeled and depended largely on extrapolation from historical data another limitation of our study was that we chose out of necessity with respect to limited resources to focus on water quantity primarily and much less on water quality increasing salinity is a growing problem in surface water groundwater and agricultural soils in both urban and agricultural sectors and will have significant consequences for the future this issue has received some attention in the literature but until now has not received the rigorous study that it deserves in the mrg a large scale salt mass balance approach is called for to understand the dynamics of salinization of our soils and water both surface and groundwater other water quality issues such as arsenic and nutrient loading are also deserving of attention finally our modeling of future decision making was based totally on hydroeconomic optimization which perhaps works fairly well for the agricultural sector but might not work as well for other users sectors our swim online platform needs to continue to be enhanced to enable modelers to easily add their models to the platform allowing stakeholders to run diverse models through a single interface the technical objective is to lower the barriers to learning how to run different models that may provide alternative perspectives on water issues ultimately the primary goal is to support stakeholders at all levels individual institutional policy in envisioning plausible future scenarios identifying those that are most desirable and considering interventions that could be made to reach desirable future outcomes 4 4 future research needs additional research is needed to address some of the limitations above especially analyzing and modeling the medium term dynamics of salinization in both agriculture and urban water supplies understanding the complex dynamics of water quantity and salinity in desert river basins in conjunction with aquifers containing both fresh and brackish water is paramount to sustaining useable water supplies pauloo et al 2021 the lack of water available for and allocated to environmental flows remains a challenge for the mrg it is necessary to better understand the feasibility and hydrologic and economic tradeoffs of environmental water allocation to support ecosystem services in this water scarce region under scenarios of climate change future research can explore a dynamic environmental water allocation scheme by adjusting the amount and cost of environmental flows based on water availability during wet or dry periods and economic value of water to minimize the effects of environmental water allocation on agricultural water availability and other water uses with regard to the future of water in the mrg there is a particular need for social science research to support adaptive management to arrive at preferred solutions and interventions that will promote sustainability the mrg presents a special challenge for transboundary water management based on collective goal setting rather than continuing the current fragmented approach to depletion of the common pool resource of freshwater adaptive cooperation could provide a useful framework for meeting this challenge what discursive and governance approaches could strengthen a shared common pool vision and practical governance system especially for transboundary situations heyman 2023 how can this be applied to the mrg and other transboundary conjunctive river aquifer settings the answers to these and other related questions could provide a way forward to a more sustainable water future 5 conclusions business as usual in the mrg is not sustainable climate is becoming warmer and drier now and this trend is expected to continue the situation will become perilous as it continues if change accelerates and it becomes much drier the situation can become even catastrophic the probable outcomes for the future of water in the region include 1 trends in agricultural intensification and the shift to perennial crops are locking in water demand combined with an increasing reliance on groundwater 2 growing urban populations are increasing overall demand forcing cities to more expensive sources of water 3 a warmer drier climate in the rio grande headwaters will result in less reliable surface water supplies and increasing reliance on groundwater 4 surface water is over allocated and the current governance structure does not allow flexibility in allocations that could result in more efficiency as supplies become less reliable nor is it likely to in the near future and 5 governance of groundwater is fractured between three states in two countries but stakeholders are interested in seeing voluntary binational cooperation on groundwater management moving forward we evaluated possible interventions technologically possible but not necessarily economically viable for agriculture possible interventions center around 1 alternative sources of water especially desalination of brackish water 2 alternative methods of irrigation especially drip irrigation 3 improved water management especially et based irrigation management 4 improved salinity management especially gypsum application or use of sulfur burner technologies and 5 alternative crops none of which are as profitable as pecans so their adoption would have to be subsidized we evaluated possible interventions that rely on alternative water sources for urban water use as well these include 1 more desalination 2 direct potable re use and 3 imported water all of these would make water much more expensive for urban consumers conservation especially related to outdoor water use also could be efficacious to a degree at much less cost the question of which of these is preferable in terms of efficacy cost and social justice is a question to be answered by stakeholders informed by policy oriented scientific research and would require much more public engagement and civic discourse than is now practiced typically however water management across all sectors and jurisdictions must be improved to realize a more sustainable future we faced several limitations including data gaps for a number of important parameters such as groundwater extraction in mexico private well pumping in texas spatially specific data for recharge and return flows and water quality data for same information on the distribution of crops year to year and detailed land cover change in addition a significant limitation of our study was that we did not focus as much attention on water quality issues especially salt as was probably warranted other water quality issues such as arsenic and nutrient loading are also deserving of attention finally our modeling of future decision making was based totally on hydroeconomic optimization which perhaps works well for the agricultural sector but might not work as well for other users sectors additional research is needed to address some of the limitations above especially analyzing and modeling the medium term dynamics of salinization in both agriculture and urban water supplies there is a need for a better understanding of the hydrologic and economic tradeoffs for water allocation to environmental flows regarding the future of water in the mrg there is a particular need for social science research to support adaptive management to arrive at preferred solutions and interventions that will promote sustainability the mrg presents a special challenge for transboundary water management based on collective goal setting rather than continuing the current fragmented approach to the depletion of the common pool resource of freshwater adaptive cooperation could provide a useful framework for meeting this challenge the answers to these and other related questions could provide a way forward to a more sustainable water future our work has several broader impacts for the scientific community as well as a broad range of stakeholders especially water managers and users for the scientific community we have demonstrated a viable process of identifying and engaging stakeholders in identifying problems evaluating modeling results that characterize the future identifying potential solutions or interventions and responding to modeling results that evaluate the outcomes of interventions our process formed the basis upon which we were able to synthesize a holistic vision of the future of water for the mrg though much work still needs to be done to identify stakeholder preferable interventions to achieve a sustainable future our interdisciplinary research team functioned as a whole rather than siloed components breeching a chief challenge of wicked water resources problems for water managers and users to meet the challenges of the future a new approach is called for one based on adaptive management pahl wostl 2007 and cooperation among sectors and across jurisdictions the challenges to achieving a more sustainable water future are many but among the greatest threats is aquifer depletion since groundwater is the most important source for urban uses and a growing source for agricultural uses because the aquifers are shared between the us and mx the problem of depletion is also shared thus the responsibility for the solutions also must be shared adaptive cooperation could provide a useful framework for meeting this challenge adaptive cooperation is needed across four important themes plus additional research and outreach in support of these themes 1 information sharing especially regarding groundwater pumping trends in total water demand use of alternative sources and conservation measures 2 conservation especially regarding outdoor water use in urban settings and improved irrigation management in agricultural settings 3 greater development and use of alternative water sources especially desalination wastewater reuse and imported water and 4 new limits to water allocation withdrawals coupled with more flexibility in uses a major policy question is how will the cost of these actions be borne credit authorship contribution statement w l hargrove conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation

7723,study region addis ababa capital city of ethiopia addis ababa s surface water reservoirs and groundwater infrastructures are in the akaki watershed of the awash basin study focus this study integrates a hydrological model socioeconomic data and different water management scenarios to investigate the current and future water supply and demand baseline water supply and water demand data are obtained from addis ababa water and sewerage authority the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to simulate reservoir sedimentation and water quantity in the akaki watershed the city s water demand projection is based on the standard public water demand requirement and projected population the study considered five scenarios to assess the gaps between water supply and demand new hydrological insights for the region simulation results showed that the area upstream of the existing reservoirs has the potential to supply 651 452 m3 day of surface water however currently the reservoirs are supplying only 224 658 m3 day of water with an optimistic scenario of planned reservoirs and groundwater boreholes becoming operational by 2029 water supply will only meet demands through 2035 afterwards the gap between water supply and demand will increase due to an increase in population therefore additional water supply projects effective water use and maintaining critical hydrological ecosystem services are required to bridge the gap between water supply and demand graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrological modeling water supply and demand reservoirs sedimentation water management scenarios addis ababa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global land use change is among the best well documented global changes and it has been unprecedented since the 1950 s more natural landscapes were converted into cropland after 1950 than between 1700 and 1850 mea 2005 for instance land use change occurred over 32 of the global land area from 1960 to 2019 winkler et al 2021 natural land cover change is caused by human activities and indirect drivers with about 60 due to direct human actions the remainder is due to indirect drivers such as climate change which triggers vegetation loss in arid and semi arid ecosystems song et al 2018 land use change has caused a rapid transformation of natural ecosystems into human dominated ecosystems such as cropland and urban areas lambin and meyfroidt 2011 mea 2005 urbanization is an unprecedented phenomenon affecting ecosystems throughout the world for example only 30 of the world s population lived in urban areas in the 1950 s however 55 lived in urban areas in 2018 un 2019 this unprecedented urban population growth is projected to continue for decades about 5 17 billion 60 and 6 68 billion 68 of the world population will live in urban areas by 2030 and 2050 respectively un 2019 parallel to urban population growth global urban areas have been expanding and disrupting natural ecosystems angel et al 2011 d amour et al 2017 liu et al 2019 urban areas are projected to increase from 300 000 km2 in 2000 770 000 km2 in 2030 and 1200 000 km2 in 2050 angel et al 2011 urban area expansion triggers multifaceted effects on critical hydrological ecosystem services such as terrestrial net primary productivity provision of fresh water carbon storage climate regulation and flood regulation liu et al 2019 wan et al 2015 zank et al 2016 rapid urbanization climate change and significant lifestyle improvements put immense pressure on the natural environment and urban infrastructure these changes may result in some urban areas becoming challenging places for human habitation and potentially unlivable world bank 2013 world bank 2015 un 2019 for example rapid urbanization and population growth may increase vulnerability to water supply shortages mcdonald et al 2011 the nature conservancy 2014 world bank 2019 mcdonald et al 2011 estimated that about 525 million people in cities currently have no adequate water supply and another 890 million people live in cities with suboptimal water quality population growth estimates in cities over the next two decades indicate that existing water supply capacities require substantial attention to meet growing water supply demands howard 2003 bates et al 2008 world bank 2019 as in the rest of the world rapid urbanization has occurred in ethiopia over the last four decades world bank 2016 terfa et al 2019 people living in ethiopia s urban areas accounted for only 13 69 of the total population in 1994 however by 2007 16 18 of the total population was living in urban areas fdre pcc 2007 the world bank estimates that the urban population in ethiopia may increase from 15 2 million in 2012 42 3 million in 2037 which is a 178 increase world bank 2016 ethiopia s capital addis ababa has experienced immense socio economic and environmental changes over the past several decades its population increased six fold from 1950 to 2007 fdre pcc 2007 and is projected to surpass 5 million in 2037 fdre csa 2013 likewise its urban area has significantly expanded by 186 7 from 1987 to 2017 terfa et al 2019 shawul et al 2019 also reported that addis ababa s urban area increased from 49 km2 in 1974 to more than 343 km2 in 2014 however natural land cover areas have significantly decreased fetene and worku 2013 feyissa and gebremariam 2018 shawul et al 2019 teferi and abraha 2018 in the akaki watershed where addis ababa is located grassland declined from 19 6 in 1974 to 2 5 in 2011 and forest area decreased from 7 1 in 1974 to 5 3 in 2014 shawul et al 2019 the increasing urban population and expanded urban areas in and around addis ababa have increased the city s vulnerability to climate change through risks such as exacerbated flooding birhanu et al 2016 feyissa and gebremariam 2018 teferi and abraha 2018 for example aba samuel lake is one of the largest water bodies in the akaki watershed the lake provides ecosystem services such as fresh water for irrigation flood regulation and pollutant reduction however the area of aba samuel lake has decreased by 43 from 1972 to 2002 kaczynski and rylko 2016 birhanu et al 2016 estimated that flood risk in the city has increased by 25 the decrease in natural vegetation coverage has also resulted in biodiversity loss in the surrounding area fetene and worku 2013 woldegerima et al 2017 forestland in the entoto menagesha and wechecha mountains decreased from 30 in 1973 to 14 5 in 2013 feyissa and gebremariam 2018 and has triggered the loss of biodiversity evenness and density of ecologically and economically essential trees atinafe et al 2020 fetene and worku 2013 deforestation and urban expansion in and around addis ababa have increased surface runoff flooding land surface temperature and decreased groundwater recharge and wetlands extent birhanu et al 2016 kaczynski and rylko 2016 teferi and abraha 2018 worku et al 2021 the expansion of addis ababa and increasing economic activities such as establishing industries at the city s periphery have also caused a decrease in water quality in the akaki river anteneh et al 2018 mengesha et al 2017 anteneh et al 2018 assessed water quality in the legedadi and dire reservoirs within the akaki watershed they used ph turbidity total hardness lead iron and chromium as water quality indicators they reported that most of these indicators did not meet the who minimum water quality standards for drinking water mengesha et al 2017 reported that nitrate phosphate and zinc concentrations were 30 32 and 51 respectively above the acceptable concentration standard in the akaki river domestic and industrial waste dumping from the city into the groundwater recharge and extraction areas results in polluted groundwater resources industries in addis ababa and its surrounding areas e g legedadi sebeta akaki and dukem dump pollutants into groundwater recharge areas without proper treatment worku 2017 muleta and abate 2020 report 13 abandoned wells out of 24 in the akaki well fields due to low water levels and discharge rates suggesting a depleted aquifer providing a municipal water supply to addis ababa began in 1901 15 years after the city s formal establishment in 1886 at the time the primary water sources were kebena and kechene rivers adam 1999 sime 1998 treating water from these rivers started in 1938 after constructing the entoto water treatment plant which has a capacity of 1500 m3 day adam 1999 since 1970 addis ababa s city government has expanded the water supply sources by building additional projects such as the gefersa reservoir legedadi reservoir dire reservoir additional water treatment plants and other well and spring developments adam 1999 sime 1998 most potable water supply 65 is produced from legedadi dire and gefersa reservoirs in comparison the akaki well field supplies the remaining 35 addis ababa water and sewerage authority aawsa 2011 although the addis ababa city government has regularly undertaken efforts to increase water supply to the city the gap between the water supply and demand continues to widen due to population growth lifestyle improvements and groundwater aquifer depletion according to aawsa 2011 the water supply has only met around 50 of the demand since 2005 alemu and dioha 2020 estimated that unmet water demand between 2015 and 2030 may increase by 48 this trend is likely to continue into the near future one cause for the significant gap between the water supply and demand is water loss in the system aawsa 2012 reported that leakages and inefficiencies in the distribution system caused more than a 30 water supply loss climate change and soil erosion leading to reservoir siltation may also exacerbate the existing gap between water supply and demand in addis ababa arsiso et al 2017 estimate that the unmet water demand in addis ababa will be 239 506 m3 day 433 917 m3 day and 1043 095 m3 day in 2030 2035 and 2037 respectively under the intermediate climate change scenario rcp4 5 representative concentration pathway 4 5 and a high population growth rate of 3 3 in low population growth rate of 2 5 and under climate change scenarios of rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 the study showed that the unmet water demand will be 704 876 m3 day and 862 767 m3 day in 2037 respectively arsiso et al 2017 in addition soil erosion has led to reservoir siltation reducing the reservoirs live water storage volume for instance the storage capacity of the legedadi reservoir was reduced by 4 5 from 1979 to 1998 due to soil erosion dar al omran 2011 water funds are public private partnerships that involve a finance mechanism to invest in nature based solutions to protect water quality and quantity gonzÃ¡lez 2021 they are considered an appropriate framework for improving landscape functions while improving water supplies in urban areas to reduce the water supply and environmental and socio economic problems a comparative study showed that global water funds financially outperform ecological and natural resources funds joslin and jepson 2018 water funds currently address watershed conservation and the sustainable water supply in several african and latin american cities for example the upper tana nairobi water fund established in the upper tana watershed supports 95 of the water supply for nairobi city kenya in this watershed the water fund benefits the local communities by implementing farm scale interventions increasing vegetation cover and working to ensure water supply for 11 million people living in nairobi and within the watershed area utnwf 2021 in cape town south africa financing the removal of alien plant invasions through a water fund can potentially increase the water supply by 50 billion liters and restore wetlands within five years stafford et al 2018 similarly investors and ngo alliances have successfully applied the water fund model for quito ecuador thereby managing watersheds for ecosystem conservation and promoting water supply joslin and jepson 2018 this study informed the feasibility analysis for developing an addis ababa water fund https southsouthnorth org addis water fund feasibility project this study evaluates current and future water supply and demand by integrating socio economic conditions such as population growth with hydrological modeling the study also evaluates the potential of existing and proposed water supply projects and nature based solutions in increasing water supply and reservoir sedimentation the study gives insight to the government of addis ababa city by exploring the potential of different water supply scenarios to meet current and future water demand aawsa provided baseline water supply and demand data for the current study this study also uses the soil and water assessment tool swat a physically based empirical hydrological model to estimate reservoir sedimentation and available surface water resources and to identify soil erosion hot spots the hydrological modeling considered the akaki watershed with a particular focus on areas upstream of reservoirs where most of the water supply for addis ababa is located the water demand was estimated considering population growth economic activity and the improvements in residents quality of life 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area addis ababa is located within the akaki watershed a tributary of ethiopia s awash river fig 1 surrounded by the entoto mountains on the north menagesha mountain from the northwest and yerer mountain from the east the watershed has an area of 1445 km2 with an elevation range of 2040 3400 m above sea level because these mountains are upstream of the akaki watershed fig 1 they are an important source of water and the origin of the akaki watershed rivers kebena little akaki and big akaki are the three major rivers that originate from entoto mountain and other highlands fig 1b these rivers flow north to south towards the awash river and are important freshwater sources in the akaki watershed supplying addis ababa forests in the mountains surrounding the city provide a temperature regulating function carbon sequestration and soil erosion reduction woldegerima et al 2017 gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs built to supply water to the city are all found within the upper watershed cultivated areas dominate land use in the watershed followed by addis ababa s developed urban areas fig 1c these cultivated areas occur primarily on vertisol dominated soils with gentle slopes 5 fig 1d and e vertisols have low infiltration rates and are highly erodible vertisols require intensive management to cultivate in low input systems such as in the ethiopian highlands where current farming practices involve planting practices that leave the soils vulnerable to soil erosion astatke et al 2002 volcanic lithologies such as basalts rhyolites and tuff are extensively weathered and broken from the akaki basin s underlying geology these geological features suggest good groundwater storage and movement potential tolera and chung 2021 yifru et al 2022 however note that it is the lower portion of the akaki basin that has high groundwater productivity while minor to poor productivity aquifers characterize areas around the gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs the gefersa i reservoir was built in 1944 to supply clean water to addis ababa adam 1999 subsequently gefersa ii and iii reservoirs built in 1960 and 1966 increased water supply and sediment trapping in the basin while the gefersa ii development was an expansion of the gefersa i reservoir the gefersa iii reservoir was a separate dam constructed about 800 m upstream of the gefersa i and ii reservoirs to trap sediment before it entered the water storage reservoirs the gefersa reservoir system has an area of 130 5 ha and a catchment area of 53 5 km2 the gefersa reservoir system has a water storage capacity of 8 mm3 and supplies 30 000 m3 day of water to addis ababa fdre mowr 2002 the legedadi reservoir commissioned in the 1970 s has a capacity of 50 000 m3 day of water sime 1998 and a 510 ha surface area with a 207 3 km2 catchment area the dire reservoir built in 1998 expanded the legedadi water supply system to meet addis ababa s increasing water demands the dire reservoir has a 165 ha surface area and a catchment area of 77 5 km2 the combined legedadi and dire water supply system has a water storage volume of 120 mm3 86 and 34 mm3 respectively table 1 and supplies 165 000 m3 day to addis ababa city aawsa 2011 the akaki well fields springs and deep wells also serve as groundwater sources for the city fig 1 these groundwater sources supplied more than 75 000 m3 day of water by 2010 aawsa 2011 and significant investments have occurred in groundwater borehole development for example the new akaki well field which supplies 73 000 m3 day of water was commissioned in 2012 aawsa 2012 further developments in spring sources and deep wells have occurred in various parts of the city since 2012 the aawsa report of 2020 showed that the groundwater and surface water sources supplied 599 000 m3 day of water in 2019 aawsa 2020 several studies have conducted focused on the groundwater resources of the akaki basin mengistu et al 2021 tolera et al 2021 yifru et al 2022 mengistu et al 2021 conducted a comprehensive review of research on ethiopia s groundwater resources and found a wide variation in groundwater availability in the country from 2 5 to 47 bcm they identify data scarcity as a significant barrier to quantifying the country s groundwater resources they also highlight the need for coupled surface water and groundwater models tolera et al 2021 used swat to simulate recharge in the little akaki watershed though their estimates did not agree with other modeled estimates found in kebede 2013 demlie et al 2007 or doll and fiedler 2008 the authors used the groundwater recharge simulated from swat in a standalone modflow model tolera et al 2021 yifru et al 2022 implemented a linked swat modflow model but reported limitations in calibration due to poor data availability they did find that their results showed agreement with ayenew et al 2008 and that groundwater discharge and baseflow showed a strong agreement groundwater studies in the region highlight the need for collecting groundwater data so that linked surface water and groundwater models can provide insight into available water resources given the crucial role groundwater may play in supplying addis ababa in the future this current study utilizes groundwater data and proposed plans from aawsa to estimate water supply from groundwater resources in the five scenarios explored 2 2 data swat requires spatial and non spatial data for the initial model set up to discretize the watershed and define hydrological response units hrus the akaki swat model setup used the data listed in table 2 swat used the 30 m digital elevation model dem to estimate slope stream networks subbasin and watershed boundaries the dem showed that a mountain chain enoto mountains characterizes the upper part of the watershed whereas the middle and lower parts are flat with slopes 5 fig 1d basin discretization using the srtm 30 m dem resulted in 64 sub watersheds with an average area of 8 km2 basin discretization using the srtm 30 m dem resulted in 64 sub watersheds with an average area of 8 km2 the delineation process included gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs land cover data for 2016 was generated using landsat 8 operational land imager oli land use classification used a supervised image classification method and maximum likelihood algorithm providing kappa k statistics and overall accuracy of 84 and 82 respectively the classified land use map showed that cultivated land covers 74 of the watershed and developed areas cover 15 fig 1c the remaining land cover is comprised of grazing land forest shrubland waterbody and bare lands soil data were obtained from the africa soil information system afsis which has a spatial resolution of 250 m and consists of up to six layers of soil physical and chemical properties data fig 1d hengl et al 2015 leenaars et al 2014 vÃ¥gen et al 2010 weather data such as rainfall maximum minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity are required to simulate hydrological processes the ethiopian national meteorological services agency provided meteorological data for stations located inside and around the akaki watershed fig 1b these data indicate that the primary rainfall season is summer kiremt which spans june to september and a short rainfall season belg occurs from march to may the long term average annual rainfall of the akaki watershed is 1026 mm and the long term average monthly temperature ranges between 16 c and 19 c december represents the lowest minimum temperature and may represents the highest maximum temperature most of the weather stations used in this study include rainfall and maximum minimum temperature the ministry of water irrigation and energy of ethiopia provided observed monthly streamflow at the akaki gauging station fig 1b for further better quality streamflow and sediment data it is important to generate primary data by installing gauging stations at different parts of the akaki watershed 2 3 swat model swat is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model that can operate at annual monthly and daily time steps designed to be used in large ungauged agricultural basins swat allows users to assess the relative impact of land management decisions on various water quality and quantity parameters arnold et al 2012 1998 neitsch et al 2011 while initially intended for use in the united states the model has been adapted worldwide including in africa the swat model s strength is that it can be set up using readily available global data and then easily refined and developed when local data are available most importantly swat is a nested scale model that allows users to make water quality and quantity changes resulting from land management changes at multiple spatial hru subwatershed watershed and temporal daily monthly annual scales for the akaki watershed the qswat version 1 5 interface was used to parameterize the swat2012 model potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using the penman monteith method and water flow across the sub basins was estimated using the variable routing method swat was set up using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method to estimate surface runoff because the cn method demonstrated successful surface runoff estimation in similar tropical watersheds dile et al 2016 the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method in swat calculates runoff using an empirical water balance relationship q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s where q is the direct runoff mm p is the total rainfall mm and s 1000 cn with cn curve number related to soil and land cover conditions and commonly estimated from published tables the modified universal soil loss equation musle calculates sediment yield in swat at the smallest spatial unit defined in the model the hru the benefit here particularly in data scarce regions is that musle relies on runoff rather than the erosive energy of rainfall sediment yield can be used as a proxy for soil erosion musle is given by sed 11 8 q surf q peak area âru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the sediment yield on a given day metric

cm cusle is the usle cover and management factor pusle is the usle support practice factor lsusle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor scenario analysis is the most basic function of the swat model due to its deterministic nature each successive swat run that uses a given set of inputs will produce the same outputs each time the model runs however the output may change if a user modifies an input such as climate or land management modifying single inputs allows users to isolate the response to that specific change in this way swat is an excellent model for exploring alternative land management scenarios or interventions and how they will modify the water balance swat identifies unique land cover soil and slope combinations to develop the hrus thresholds of 5 land cover 10 soil and 5 slope defined the hrus for the akaki watershed model thresholds identify areas with no or minimal contribution to model outputs simplifying model complexity if the area coverage of a given land cover soil or slope within a sub basin is below a set threshold then it is not considered in the analysis dile et al 2020 the akaki watershed hru development resulted in 634 hrus 2 4 swat cup streamflow and sediment calibration was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour and johnson 2004 swat cup is an interface for swat sensitivity analysis auto calibration and uncertainty analysis that can implement several calibration algorithms sufi2 is an optimization algorithm within swat cup used to estimate uncertainties in model parameters driving variables and conceptual models abbaspour et al 2007 using swat cup the first step was to identify the most sensitive parameters i e parameters with smaller p value and larger t stat abbaspour 2015 through a global sensitivity analysis subsequently the swat model was calibrated and validated using the sufi 2 and the observed streamflow data this study used observed monthly streamflow at the akaki gauging station fig 1b from 1990 to 2004 the observed streamflow data were split into two groups for calibration and validation with 1990 1995 used for calibration and 1998 2004 for validation no observed sediment data were available for the akaki watershed but were available for the nearby melka kuntrie watershed sediment load data for the melka kuntrie watershed were generated based on observed sediment concentration and streamflow data using the load estimator loadest tool runkel et al 2004 the akaki and melka kuntrie watersheds are adjacent and have similar land use soil and topographic characteristics for example like the akaki watershed the elevation in the melka kunture watershed is from 1948 m to 3575 m cultivated land 86 and grazing land 9 dominate the melka kuntrie watershed in the melka kuntrie watershed about 27 of the watershed area is under a slope class of 0 10 38 is under a slope class of 10 20 and 34 is under a slope class of more than 20 tolera et al 2018 transferring sediment related parameters between similar watersheds is a common approach used in modeling cao et al 2006 wale et al 2009 thus sediment load data were transferred from the melka kuntrie loadest model into the akaki swat model to estimate soil erosion in the watershed sediment related parameters were calibrated 1990 1995 and validated 1998 2004 in swat cup using observed generated sediment load data from the adjacent melka kuntrie watershed akaki watershed simulation performance was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias which are standard goodness of fit evaluation criteria in hydrology moriasi et al 2015 the sufi 2 p factor 95ppu and r factor were also used to evaluate model calibration and validation uncertainty abbaspour and johnson 2004 2 5 water demand the study collected the baseline water demand data for addis ababa from two primary sources aawsa 2012 2020 future total water demand was estimated by accounting for population growth and the city s standard per capita domestic water requirement the total population of addis ababa is projected to be 5 86 million and 10 59 million in 2030 and 2050 respectively aawsa 2020 we assumed a recommended 100 liters per person per day as the standard domestic water requirement to calculate water demand projections gleick 1996 howard and bartram 2003 however higher per capita water demands were considered over time to account for increased demand due to improved socio economic and quality of life conditions gleick 1996 an increase in the standard of living and lifestyle results in an increase in water demand for food health care aesthetic uses and miscellaneous domestic uses gleick 1996 the per capita water demand was assumed to increase by 10 in 2020 15 in 2025 20 in 2030 and 30 in 2040 table 6 aawsa 2011 has also considered an increase in per capita water demand over time due to changes in lifestyle and living standards the current water loss of 36 aawsa 2020 was assumed to continue 2 6 water supply aawsa reports provided water supply data from the reservoirs and akaki well fields for 2011 2012 and 2020 from 2005 2010 a total of 599 000 m3 day of water was supplied from reservoirs 225 000 m3 day and groundwater sources 374 000 m3 day to the city aawsa 2012 2020 in 2019 225 000 m3 day of water from reservoirs and 374 000 m3 day of water from groundwater were supplied aawsa 2020 2 7 water supply and demand scenarios five scenarios considered future potential water supply and demand for addis ababa the scenarios were developed based on existing water supply and demand aawsa s planned water supply projects and expert opinion driven swat model simulations scenario 1 baseline scenario this scenario assumes the 2019 water supply as a reference to compare future water supply and demand projections in 2019 reservoirs and groundwater supplied the city with 225 000 m3 day and 374 000 m3 day of water respectively aawsa 2020 scenario 2 optimum use this scenario analyzed near and long term future water supply coverage with the possibility of using the optimum potential capacity of water generated upstream of the existing reservoirs and groundwater sources unlike scenario 1 this scenario considers using the full potential of the reservoirs simulated by the hydrological model reservoir simulation outputs this scenario suggests an expansion of existing reservoirs and the construction of new reservoirs scenario 3 include nature based solutions in the watershed this scenario evaluates how nature based solutions such as afforestation vegetative filter strips and terraces in the reservoirs contributing source sub watersheds may impact water supply and sedimentation rate nature based solutions could trigger a change in average slope length curve number cn usle p p the usle support practice factor and width of filter strip filterw for instance the implementation of physical nature based solutions on 0 10 11 20 and 20 of the land could reduce the average slope length to 17 5 m 13 5 m and 8 m respectively desta et al 2005 hurni et al 2016 at the same time implementing vegetative nature based solutions increases the width of the filter strip filterw and reduces the curve number these measures were represented in the erosion hotspot areas of the watershed see fig 3 in the swat model by modifying curve number cn arnold et al 2012 slope length slsubbsn hurni et al 2016 usle p gebremichael et al 2005 and width of filter strip filterw betrie et al 2011 this scenario represents the reservoirs water supply under nature based solutions together with the existing and planned groundwater development projects scenario 4 full streamflow and groundwater potential this scenario assessed the streamflow potential of the akaki watershed at the watershed outlet together with the existing and planned groundwater development projects to meet the city s water demand through 2050 the watershed streamflow potential was determined using the calibrated and validated swat model and allocated 30 of the streamflow for environmental flow requirements pastor et al 2014 this percentage of water 30 is required to sustain freshwater ecosystems of the watershed and downstream flow scenario 5 planned water supply projects this scenario considers near and long term future 2020 2050 water supply coverage based on assumed water availability reported in aawsa s planned water supply projects the planned water supply projects include the construction of the legedadi phase 2 project gerbi reservoir sibilu reservoir and robi jeda reservoir this scenario also includes aawsa s reported development of groundwater sources to supply 7000 m3 day aawsa 2020 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the swat cup sensitivity analysis revealed several sensitive parameters for streamflow and sediment table 3 evaluation of the model streamflow simulation using the nse r2 and pbias provided 0 70 0 71 and 9 1 respectively during the calibration period supplementary 1 and supplementary 2 during validation the model showed nse r2 and pbias of 0 63 0 64 and 11 1 respectively the monthly simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs also showed reasonable agreement missing only a few streamflow peaks e g 1993 1998 and 1999 similarly the goodness of fit evaluation values indicated more than satisfactory streamflow simulation performance during the validation period uncertainty analysis during the calibration and validation periods showed that 86 and 74 of the observed data were bracketed within the 95ppu respectively indicating acceptable model performance abbaspour 2015 the uncertainty evaluation using the r factor which measures the thickness of the 95ppu also revealed good performance during the calibration and validation periods overall the model evaluation results showed that the calibrated and validated swat model can be used to estimate available water resources in the akaki watershed with a high degree of confidence an evaluation of model calibration for sediment yield simulation showed good performance with nse and pbias values of 0 62 and 8 6 respectively supplementary 3 likewise the model validation provided acceptable performance with nse and pbias of 0 57 and 0 6 respectively although the monthly simulated sediment yield agreed well with the monthly observed sediment yield load estimated in the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph it did not capture the peak sediment yield in 1998 and 1999 supplementary 4 the model also could not capture peak streamflow in these periods affecting sediment yield simulations the inability to capture the peak streamflow and sediment yield may be related to the quality of observed streamflow and sediment load data which are often difficult to measure accurately 3 2 water supply assessment addis ababa s water supply was assessed based on the observed water supply condition and using swat which estimated the potential water supply from the reservoirs based on the baseline 2019 water supply condition addis ababa has a water supply of 599 000 m3 day supplied from reservoirs 225 000 m3 day and groundwater sources 374 000 m3 day table 4 aawsa 2020 legedadi gefersa and dire reservoirs are the primary surface water sources while the akaki wellfields serve as the primary groundwater sources supplying addis ababa using the baseline water supply condition the water supply coverage in addis ababa is only 54 current low coverage indicates there will be increasingly severe water shortages in the future if there are no water supply improvements or new infrastructure projects given population growth rates this limited water supply coverage could trigger multifarious effects on sanitation food health and aesthetic services of the community this study used swat model outputs to assess the monthly and annual potential water availability from gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs swat simulation showed that a higher inflow was observed in the legedadi reservoir 1983 2013 than gefersa 1983 2013 and dire reservoirs 1998 2013 while the inflows to gefersa and dire reservoirs were comparable table 5 and fig 2 in all three reservoirs the highest inflow was recorded in august in which gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs received about 20 75 mm3 68 08 mm3 and 22 48 mm3 of water respectively these reservoirs have been supplying less water than their potential since their commission the upstream part of the gefersa reservoir can provide about 150 274 m3 day fig 2 and table 5 in contrast the water supply reported from the gefersa reservoir is only about 30 137 m3 day aawsa 2012 annually legedadi and dire reservoirs receive about 182 mm3 of water from the upstream area table 5 but aawas 2011 reported that the annual surface water supply from both legedadi and dire reservoirs is only 60 mm3 the gap between water received in the reservoirs and what is used as supply to addis ababa indicates that the upstream areas of the reservoirs have sufficient potential water but that it is not being harnessed effectively therefore there is more water resource potential in the upstream catchments of the reservoirs that could be harnessed through actions like raising reservoir height or adding new reservoirs high siltation significantly reduces the reservoirs storage capacity and lifetime simulations showed that the average annual soil yield in the akaki watershed was between 3 3 and 9 16 tons ha year and the average was 8 tons ha year fig 3 the northwestern central and southern parts of the watershed dominated by cultivated land showed high simulated sediment yield urban areas had lower simulated yield fig 3 the simulated soil yield in the akaki watershed is comparable to estimates reported in other parts of ethiopia for example in the northern part of ethiopia haregeweyn et al 2008 simulated 10 tons ha year sediment yield and duguma et al 2020 simulated 4 3 tons ha year in the guder watershed some studies have reported higher soil erosion estimates for instance tamene et al 2006 reported that the average annual soil erosion in the upstream areas of 11 reservoirs in the semi arid highlands of northern ethiopia was 19 tons ha year soil erosion rates in these watersheds may vary due to differences in climate topography land use and soil types monthly model simulations showed high sediment yield in 1996 and 1999 the highest sediment yields were simulated in july and august when the rainfall and surface runoff generation were peaking fig 4 annual sedimentation in the gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs was 26 970 tons 127 244 tons and 30 715 tons respectively table 5 and fig 5 the highest sedimentation occurred in august and estimates in the gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs were 10 134 tons 65 819 tons and 13 443 tons respectively table 5 similarly other studies e g tarekegn 2012 daba 2017 also reported comparable sediment deposition in the gefersa and legedadi reservoirs for example from 1990 to 1997 daba 2017 estimated the average annual sediment deposition in the gefersa reservoir was 27 288 75 tons an annual sedimentation rate of 32 718 tons was also estimated in the gefersa reservoir dar al omran 2011 sediment deposition reduces the live storage capacity and lifetime of reservoirs for example based on the swat model outputs the legedadi and gefersa reservoirs have been losing about 0 3 of their live storage annually comparable reduced storage capacity has been estimated for legedadi and gefersa reservoirs as reported in dar al omran 2011 swat model outputs revealed significant cumulative sediment deposition from 1983 to 2013 in these reservoirs with about 4 million 0 8 million and 0 5 million tons of sediment deposited in the legedadi gefersa and dire reservoirs respectively fig 6 reservoir sedimentation could be higher because watershed rehabilitation and protection practices to abate soil erosion and provide buffer zones for the reservoirs are limited for example settlements and mining occur in the reservoir catchment areas and the continuous expansion of cultivated land can cause an increase in soil erosion and sediment deposition in the reservoirs the volume of sediment deposition in the legedadi gefersa and dire reservoirs was about 3 034 mm3 0 643 mm3 and 0 378 mm3 respectively from 1983 to 2013 fig 7 during this period sedimentation reduced the storage capacity of legedadi and gefersa reservoirs by 9 3 and 10 29 respectively the different storage capacity reduction rates owing to sedimentation were due to the difference in the size of the reservoirs catchments land use types slope and other biophysical features regardless model results indicate severe sedimentation in the reservoirs that supply water to addis ababa 3 3 water demand assessment ever increasing population growth and economic activity have triggered a substantial increase in addis ababa s water demand for instance in the base period 2019 463 000 m3 day and 347 000 m3 day of water were required to meet the domestic and non domestic water demand respectively aawsa 2020 annually domestic and non domestic water demand in the city was about 296 mm3 in 2019 aawsa 2020 including a 36 water loss total water demand is projected to increase from 1103 000 m3 day in 2019 1676 000 m3 day in 2030 2436 000 m3 day in 2040 and 3528 000 m3 day in 2050 table 6 this analysis does not include water demand for urban agriculture 3 4 water management scenarios using five scenarios we explicitly analyzed water supply demand and plausible water management strategies for addis ababa these scenarios illustrate the impacts of various water supply interventions on water supply these scenarios are based on existing water supply proposed water supply projects and model simulations the results revealed that water supply and water supply coverage differ under the five scenarios 3 5 scenario 1 baseline scenario the baseline scenario is based on the 2019 water supply and the current and future estimated population table 7 presents the existing addis ababa surface water and groundwater sources according to a recent aawsa report aawsa 2020 225 000 m3 day of water from reservoirs and 374 000 m3 day of water from groundwater totaling 599 000 m3 day of water table 7 is supplied to the city the total water demand in the baseline and future is greater than the total water supply in this scenario under the baseline water supply there will be a consistent reduction in water supply coverage for instance water supply coverage ranges from 54 in the base period 2019 to 36 in 2030 25 in 2040 and 17 in 2050 table 7 under the baseline water supply condition this scenario is the worst case because it shows severe water shortage and many water supply related crises if no new water supply projects are realized fig 8 contrary to the water supply condition of this scenario there is a continuous increase in population economic growth and water demand 3 6 scenario 2 optimum use this scenario assumes using the total inflow to the existing reservoirs as simulated by the hydrological model the hydrological model simulation showed that the three reservoirs legedadi dire and gefersa could supply about 649 000 m3 day however only 225 000 m3 day of water is being supplied from existing reservoirs with existing groundwater sources 375 000 m3 year using the optimum potential of the reservoirs can increase the city s water supply both the optimum level of reservoirs and groundwater sources can supply 1044 000 m3 day thus water supply coverage could range from 95 in the base period 2019 to 62 in 2030 43 in 2040 and 30 in 2050 table 7 fig 8 improved water supply coverage can be achieved over scenario 1 using this scenario but there is still a significant water supply shortage in the future under this scenario like scenario 1 this scenario also considers total water demand which is subject to increase in the future table 7 3 7 scenario 3 optimum use with nature based solutions model outputs indicate the release and storage benefits of nature based solutions which could further increase soil moisture and crops growing period nature based solutions upstream of the reservoirs and erosion hot spot areas resulted in significant changes to sedimentation rates for all reservoirs fig 5 and table 8 nature based solutions significantly p 0 05 reduce reservoir sedimentation the effect of nature based solutions is distinct in different reservoirs for instance the physical nature based solution i e terraces resulted in statistically significant p 0 00 sediment reduction in the legedadi and dire reservoirs but an insignificant p 0 27 impact in gefersa reservoir sedimentation vegetative filter strips triggered higher sediment reduction p 0 00 in the gefersa reservoir but showed an insignificant p 0 16 impact on sedimentation for legedadi and dire reservoirs the main benefit of nature based solutions is reducing reservoir sedimentation with a modest change in the monthly reservoir inflow after implementing nature based solutions in the model the primary change related to inflow is increased inflow to the reservoirs during the dry season october november and reduced inflows during the main rainy season july and august this is due to nature based solutions storage and release effects which retain surface runoff during the main rainy season and slowly release in october november nature based solutions such as terraces reduce surface runoff velocity and thus loss of water through direct runoff during the main rainy season whereas vegetative filter strips increase the infiltration rate of excess water during the rainy season oral et al 2020 discuss such benefits of nature based solutions 3 8 scenario 4 use streamflow and groundwater potential this scenario assesses the surface flow potential of the akaki watershed upstream of the delineated outlet and the planned groundwater development projects to meet the city s water demand until 2050 swat showed that about 837 000 m3 day of water could be harvested from the watershed allowing for a 30 environmental flow requirement pastor et al 2014 this flow requirement represents the amount of water needed to sustain freshwater ecosystems and the minimum flow toward the downstream watersheds hence together with planned groundwater developments the surface water potential of the akaki watershed can support the water demand until only 2025 table 8 after that this scenario recommends trans basin water transfer wastewater reclamation and policies that can reduce water losses at various stages 3 9 scenario 5 planned water supply projects in this scenario we consider aawsa s proposed water supply projects each year new wells with a volume of 7000 m3 day will be constructed and added to the water production system from 2020 to 2030 aawsa 2020 in 2022 the legedadi phase 2 project was added to the water production increasing the supply by 86 000 m3 day the aawsa development plan indicated that some of the planned groundwater well development projects are around koyefechie tuludimtu and kilinto condominium sites the south ayat north fanta well field project which can supply 68 000 m3 day is under construction and is 85 complete there are other groundwater supply projects in the sebeta holeta and tefki areas and various parts of addis ababa aawsa 2020 in addition the gerbi reservoir with a volume of 65 700 m3 day the sibilu reservoir with a volume of 385 200 m3 day and the robi jeda reservoir with a volume of 540 000 m3 day will be added to the water production in 2023 2026 and 2029 respectively aawsa 2020 these planned projects are located outside of the akaki watershed which suggests the need for interbasin transfer to meet the growing water demand of the city proposed projects could increase the total water supply from 599 000 m3 day in 2019 644 000 m3 day in 2020 831 000 m3 day in 2025 and 1763 000 m3 day in 2029 if the proposed surface water projects are completed as planned water supply coverage would increase from 54 2019 to 60 2025 to 105 2030 but then begin dropping to 72 2040 and 50 2050 aawsa plans no significant water supply projects from 2029 onwards however groundwater supply shows an insignificant increase from 2020 to 2050 due to the continuous increase in water demand more than the proposed projects will be needed to close the water shortage gap beyond 2035 table 8 in addition the demonstrated water supply coverage can only be realized if the planned projects are fully completed in their respective timeframes and they operate effectively without major setbacks 4 discussion this study analyzed the water resources base ever growing water demand and five water management scenarios designed to meet addis ababa s water demand all scenarios concluded that the city s unprecedented projected population growth and associated improvements in living standards would lead to a significant increase in water demand figure 9 this study illustrates that considering additional supply options and averting system losses particularly from 2035 onwards is necessary or future water demand will overwhelm the existing water supply system the addis ababa government tried to increase water availability from surface sources since the 1940 s when the gefersa dam i ii was built however significant surface water development projects have yet to be implemented in the last two decades the latest development in surface water storage infrastructures is the legedadi dam s expansion through the construction of the dire dam in 1998 recently from 2005 to 2010 s aawsa has been supplying additional water through groundwater development from the akaki well fields even though the city has regularly increased its water supply since the 1970 s the gap between the water supply and demand has widened and addis ababa is already facing water supply challenges the unprecedented population increase and lifestyle improvements have created a demand that outpaces supply poor land use management is increasing soil erosion in the reservoir catchments causing sedimentation and reduced capacity of the reservoirs land use and climate change also exacerbate the gap between water supply and demand groundwater mining companies and government and private industries are depleting and polluting the akaki well fields further complicating water supply issues for instance about 84 50 of the current pumping water levels exceed the sustainable pumping rate muleta and abate 2020 with the existing water supply sources addis ababa s water demand will only be met for some years from 2020 to 2050 unless there are interventions to safeguard water resources and increase supply capacity thus the city government must develop strategies to improve the water supply and water demand management in the near and long term nature based solutions green measures or infrastructure technological solutions grey measures and policy interventions soft measures are non trivial but vital to increasing and sustaining addis ababa s water supply nature based solutions are a panacea that offers the potential to sustain the akaki watershed s hydro ecosystems biodiversity and the natural environment nature based solutions can significantly relieve addis ababa from socio economic environmental and water supply and demand challenges such solutions are found appropriate in different urban areas of the world which face similar challenges to addis ababa oral et al 2020 ramÃ­rez agudelo et al 2020 for instance nature based solutions can improve water availability for more than 700 million people in 100 of the world s largest cities the nature conservancy 2014 nature based solutions like buffer zones afforestation contour farming strip cropping cover crops and vegetative filter strips can sustain and enhance the ecosystem services the akaki watershed provides these solutions have the potential to increase and sustain water supplies investments in nature based solutions are essential to deter some of the critical environmental problems and improve water quantity and quality for addis ababa nature based conservation measures in the legedadi dire and gefersa reservoir watersheds are currently limited dar al omran 2011 however a large area of the akaki watershed primarily cultivated land has excessive soil erosion estifanos 2015 such measures play a crucial role in abating soil erosion reducing nutrient leakage into the freshwater ecosystems and sustaining surface water availability for the reservoirs nature based solutions aligned with government groundwater development programs can enhance recharge and baseflow by attenuating floods by storing and slowly releasing stormwater and increasing the infiltration rate in the watershed the entoto and menagaesha forest ecosystems and their unique topographic features provide essential ecosystem services like releasing clean water to streams sequestering carbon reducing peak streamflow providing fresh air to the city and reducing soil erosion in the highland areas feyissa and gebremariam 2018 woldegerima et al 2017 managing the forests under an integrated nature based management framework will ensure they continue to provide these services integrating downstream water bodies such as abba samuel lake into this nature based solutions framework will protect biodiversity and play a crucial role in water quality management by cleaning polluted water from domestic and commercial industries technological measures that increase water quantity and quality are effective water use which can enhance the water supply of addis ababa for example the water discharged at the akaki watershed outlet could be used as a water supply water harvesting is also indispensable to reducing reliance on groundwater sources and increasing water supply coverage addis ababa has many impervious areas including rooftops roads and buildings so water harvesting is a viable option in many areas the water collected can be used for various purposes with minimal water treatment the city also discharges a large quantity of wastewater which can be another source of water supply currently only a fraction about 10 of the wastewater is collected and treated either in centralized or decentralized systems aawsa 2011 the treated effluent can be reclaimed for reuse if the city s wastewater treatment system is improved such practices are becoming common globally engineering efforts can optimize existing reservoirs optimizing will require hydraulic structures to raise the height of dams or build new dams to harness the potential water resources available policy and institutional approaches that reduce water loss and increase the productivity of water development projects are indispensable substantial water losses 36 due to leakages misuses and other inefficiencies occur during water distribution to customers and trigger a significant gap between the water supply and demand aawsa 2012 policy measures to reduce such water loss can supply water for about 3000 people up to the required standard introducing and maintaining water infrastructure equipment is also needed to reduce actual losses i e physical water losses from the pressurized water distribution system introducing adequate meter readers can help circumvent over and under registration fees and tariff adjustments could significantly reduce losses 5 conclusion in cities like addis ababa water demand is continuously increasing which requires comparable water supply production even though the addis ababa city government has made improvements to increase water supply water demand is increasing disproportionally to supply from both surface water and groundwater sources the current supply system provides only 58 liter capita day of water to the city s inhabitants with the standard domestic water demand for a basic quality of life considered 100 liter capita day the existing water supply sources can only meet the water demand of about 82 of addis ababa s population in the future there is likely to be an increase in unmet water demand even with full exploitation of the potential of the reservoirs 649 000 m3 day there could be a water shortage soon land management improvements in the sub watersheds contributing to the reservoirs and additions to current water supply sources including boreholes and potentially new reservoirs are required to meet projected demands sedimentation climate change land use change and management and other factors can also impact water supply and demand high sediment loads in the watershed can cause a significant reduction in reservoir storage capacity and life span for example improving land management upstream can extend reservoir life in addition the current reservoirs are not fully exploited this points to the need to optimize the reservoir potential through actions like increasing reservoir height and width scouring the reservoirs rivers and canals could increase the reservoir stability reservoir life span and storage capacity future studies should also examine the dynamics between water supply and water demand under global and local drivers such as climate change and predicted land use change upstream of reservoirs it is critical to develop optimal water supply plans to increase water availability and meet water demand in the current and future periods to develop optimal water development plans high quality data such as sediment groundwater and streamflow data are non trivial lack of sediment data from different gauges of the watershed was a limitation of this study which needs to be improved for future research and water development plans besides better spatial density and temporal frequency of streamflow and groundwater measurements should be further strengthened in the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

7723,study region addis ababa capital city of ethiopia addis ababa s surface water reservoirs and groundwater infrastructures are in the akaki watershed of the awash basin study focus this study integrates a hydrological model socioeconomic data and different water management scenarios to investigate the current and future water supply and demand baseline water supply and water demand data are obtained from addis ababa water and sewerage authority the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to simulate reservoir sedimentation and water quantity in the akaki watershed the city s water demand projection is based on the standard public water demand requirement and projected population the study considered five scenarios to assess the gaps between water supply and demand new hydrological insights for the region simulation results showed that the area upstream of the existing reservoirs has the potential to supply 651 452 m3 day of surface water however currently the reservoirs are supplying only 224 658 m3 day of water with an optimistic scenario of planned reservoirs and groundwater boreholes becoming operational by 2029 water supply will only meet demands through 2035 afterwards the gap between water supply and demand will increase due to an increase in population therefore additional water supply projects effective water use and maintaining critical hydrological ecosystem services are required to bridge the gap between water supply and demand graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrological modeling water supply and demand reservoirs sedimentation water management scenarios addis ababa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global land use change is among the best well documented global changes and it has been unprecedented since the 1950 s more natural landscapes were converted into cropland after 1950 than between 1700 and 1850 mea 2005 for instance land use change occurred over 32 of the global land area from 1960 to 2019 winkler et al 2021 natural land cover change is caused by human activities and indirect drivers with about 60 due to direct human actions the remainder is due to indirect drivers such as climate change which triggers vegetation loss in arid and semi arid ecosystems song et al 2018 land use change has caused a rapid transformation of natural ecosystems into human dominated ecosystems such as cropland and urban areas lambin and meyfroidt 2011 mea 2005 urbanization is an unprecedented phenomenon affecting ecosystems throughout the world for example only 30 of the world s population lived in urban areas in the 1950 s however 55 lived in urban areas in 2018 un 2019 this unprecedented urban population growth is projected to continue for decades about 5 17 billion 60 and 6 68 billion 68 of the world population will live in urban areas by 2030 and 2050 respectively un 2019 parallel to urban population growth global urban areas have been expanding and disrupting natural ecosystems angel et al 2011 d amour et al 2017 liu et al 2019 urban areas are projected to increase from 300 000 km2 in 2000 770 000 km2 in 2030 and 1200 000 km2 in 2050 angel et al 2011 urban area expansion triggers multifaceted effects on critical hydrological ecosystem services such as terrestrial net primary productivity provision of fresh water carbon storage climate regulation and flood regulation liu et al 2019 wan et al 2015 zank et al 2016 rapid urbanization climate change and significant lifestyle improvements put immense pressure on the natural environment and urban infrastructure these changes may result in some urban areas becoming challenging places for human habitation and potentially unlivable world bank 2013 world bank 2015 un 2019 for example rapid urbanization and population growth may increase vulnerability to water supply shortages mcdonald et al 2011 the nature conservancy 2014 world bank 2019 mcdonald et al 2011 estimated that about 525 million people in cities currently have no adequate water supply and another 890 million people live in cities with suboptimal water quality population growth estimates in cities over the next two decades indicate that existing water supply capacities require substantial attention to meet growing water supply demands howard 2003 bates et al 2008 world bank 2019 as in the rest of the world rapid urbanization has occurred in ethiopia over the last four decades world bank 2016 terfa et al 2019 people living in ethiopia s urban areas accounted for only 13 69 of the total population in 1994 however by 2007 16 18 of the total population was living in urban areas fdre pcc 2007 the world bank estimates that the urban population in ethiopia may increase from 15 2 million in 2012 42 3 million in 2037 which is a 178 increase world bank 2016 ethiopia s capital addis ababa has experienced immense socio economic and environmental changes over the past several decades its population increased six fold from 1950 to 2007 fdre pcc 2007 and is projected to surpass 5 million in 2037 fdre csa 2013 likewise its urban area has significantly expanded by 186 7 from 1987 to 2017 terfa et al 2019 shawul et al 2019 also reported that addis ababa s urban area increased from 49 km2 in 1974 to more than 343 km2 in 2014 however natural land cover areas have significantly decreased fetene and worku 2013 feyissa and gebremariam 2018 shawul et al 2019 teferi and abraha 2018 in the akaki watershed where addis ababa is located grassland declined from 19 6 in 1974 to 2 5 in 2011 and forest area decreased from 7 1 in 1974 to 5 3 in 2014 shawul et al 2019 the increasing urban population and expanded urban areas in and around addis ababa have increased the city s vulnerability to climate change through risks such as exacerbated flooding birhanu et al 2016 feyissa and gebremariam 2018 teferi and abraha 2018 for example aba samuel lake is one of the largest water bodies in the akaki watershed the lake provides ecosystem services such as fresh water for irrigation flood regulation and pollutant reduction however the area of aba samuel lake has decreased by 43 from 1972 to 2002 kaczynski and rylko 2016 birhanu et al 2016 estimated that flood risk in the city has increased by 25 the decrease in natural vegetation coverage has also resulted in biodiversity loss in the surrounding area fetene and worku 2013 woldegerima et al 2017 forestland in the entoto menagesha and wechecha mountains decreased from 30 in 1973 to 14 5 in 2013 feyissa and gebremariam 2018 and has triggered the loss of biodiversity evenness and density of ecologically and economically essential trees atinafe et al 2020 fetene and worku 2013 deforestation and urban expansion in and around addis ababa have increased surface runoff flooding land surface temperature and decreased groundwater recharge and wetlands extent birhanu et al 2016 kaczynski and rylko 2016 teferi and abraha 2018 worku et al 2021 the expansion of addis ababa and increasing economic activities such as establishing industries at the city s periphery have also caused a decrease in water quality in the akaki river anteneh et al 2018 mengesha et al 2017 anteneh et al 2018 assessed water quality in the legedadi and dire reservoirs within the akaki watershed they used ph turbidity total hardness lead iron and chromium as water quality indicators they reported that most of these indicators did not meet the who minimum water quality standards for drinking water mengesha et al 2017 reported that nitrate phosphate and zinc concentrations were 30 32 and 51 respectively above the acceptable concentration standard in the akaki river domestic and industrial waste dumping from the city into the groundwater recharge and extraction areas results in polluted groundwater resources industries in addis ababa and its surrounding areas e g legedadi sebeta akaki and dukem dump pollutants into groundwater recharge areas without proper treatment worku 2017 muleta and abate 2020 report 13 abandoned wells out of 24 in the akaki well fields due to low water levels and discharge rates suggesting a depleted aquifer providing a municipal water supply to addis ababa began in 1901 15 years after the city s formal establishment in 1886 at the time the primary water sources were kebena and kechene rivers adam 1999 sime 1998 treating water from these rivers started in 1938 after constructing the entoto water treatment plant which has a capacity of 1500 m3 day adam 1999 since 1970 addis ababa s city government has expanded the water supply sources by building additional projects such as the gefersa reservoir legedadi reservoir dire reservoir additional water treatment plants and other well and spring developments adam 1999 sime 1998 most potable water supply 65 is produced from legedadi dire and gefersa reservoirs in comparison the akaki well field supplies the remaining 35 addis ababa water and sewerage authority aawsa 2011 although the addis ababa city government has regularly undertaken efforts to increase water supply to the city the gap between the water supply and demand continues to widen due to population growth lifestyle improvements and groundwater aquifer depletion according to aawsa 2011 the water supply has only met around 50 of the demand since 2005 alemu and dioha 2020 estimated that unmet water demand between 2015 and 2030 may increase by 48 this trend is likely to continue into the near future one cause for the significant gap between the water supply and demand is water loss in the system aawsa 2012 reported that leakages and inefficiencies in the distribution system caused more than a 30 water supply loss climate change and soil erosion leading to reservoir siltation may also exacerbate the existing gap between water supply and demand in addis ababa arsiso et al 2017 estimate that the unmet water demand in addis ababa will be 239 506 m3 day 433 917 m3 day and 1043 095 m3 day in 2030 2035 and 2037 respectively under the intermediate climate change scenario rcp4 5 representative concentration pathway 4 5 and a high population growth rate of 3 3 in low population growth rate of 2 5 and under climate change scenarios of rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 the study showed that the unmet water demand will be 704 876 m3 day and 862 767 m3 day in 2037 respectively arsiso et al 2017 in addition soil erosion has led to reservoir siltation reducing the reservoirs live water storage volume for instance the storage capacity of the legedadi reservoir was reduced by 4 5 from 1979 to 1998 due to soil erosion dar al omran 2011 water funds are public private partnerships that involve a finance mechanism to invest in nature based solutions to protect water quality and quantity gonzÃ¡lez 2021 they are considered an appropriate framework for improving landscape functions while improving water supplies in urban areas to reduce the water supply and environmental and socio economic problems a comparative study showed that global water funds financially outperform ecological and natural resources funds joslin and jepson 2018 water funds currently address watershed conservation and the sustainable water supply in several african and latin american cities for example the upper tana nairobi water fund established in the upper tana watershed supports 95 of the water supply for nairobi city kenya in this watershed the water fund benefits the local communities by implementing farm scale interventions increasing vegetation cover and working to ensure water supply for 11 million people living in nairobi and within the watershed area utnwf 2021 in cape town south africa financing the removal of alien plant invasions through a water fund can potentially increase the water supply by 50 billion liters and restore wetlands within five years stafford et al 2018 similarly investors and ngo alliances have successfully applied the water fund model for quito ecuador thereby managing watersheds for ecosystem conservation and promoting water supply joslin and jepson 2018 this study informed the feasibility analysis for developing an addis ababa water fund https southsouthnorth org addis water fund feasibility project this study evaluates current and future water supply and demand by integrating socio economic conditions such as population growth with hydrological modeling the study also evaluates the potential of existing and proposed water supply projects and nature based solutions in increasing water supply and reservoir sedimentation the study gives insight to the government of addis ababa city by exploring the potential of different water supply scenarios to meet current and future water demand aawsa provided baseline water supply and demand data for the current study this study also uses the soil and water assessment tool swat a physically based empirical hydrological model to estimate reservoir sedimentation and available surface water resources and to identify soil erosion hot spots the hydrological modeling considered the akaki watershed with a particular focus on areas upstream of reservoirs where most of the water supply for addis ababa is located the water demand was estimated considering population growth economic activity and the improvements in residents quality of life 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area addis ababa is located within the akaki watershed a tributary of ethiopia s awash river fig 1 surrounded by the entoto mountains on the north menagesha mountain from the northwest and yerer mountain from the east the watershed has an area of 1445 km2 with an elevation range of 2040 3400 m above sea level because these mountains are upstream of the akaki watershed fig 1 they are an important source of water and the origin of the akaki watershed rivers kebena little akaki and big akaki are the three major rivers that originate from entoto mountain and other highlands fig 1b these rivers flow north to south towards the awash river and are important freshwater sources in the akaki watershed supplying addis ababa forests in the mountains surrounding the city provide a temperature regulating function carbon sequestration and soil erosion reduction woldegerima et al 2017 gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs built to supply water to the city are all found within the upper watershed cultivated areas dominate land use in the watershed followed by addis ababa s developed urban areas fig 1c these cultivated areas occur primarily on vertisol dominated soils with gentle slopes 5 fig 1d and e vertisols have low infiltration rates and are highly erodible vertisols require intensive management to cultivate in low input systems such as in the ethiopian highlands where current farming practices involve planting practices that leave the soils vulnerable to soil erosion astatke et al 2002 volcanic lithologies such as basalts rhyolites and tuff are extensively weathered and broken from the akaki basin s underlying geology these geological features suggest good groundwater storage and movement potential tolera and chung 2021 yifru et al 2022 however note that it is the lower portion of the akaki basin that has high groundwater productivity while minor to poor productivity aquifers characterize areas around the gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs the gefersa i reservoir was built in 1944 to supply clean water to addis ababa adam 1999 subsequently gefersa ii and iii reservoirs built in 1960 and 1966 increased water supply and sediment trapping in the basin while the gefersa ii development was an expansion of the gefersa i reservoir the gefersa iii reservoir was a separate dam constructed about 800 m upstream of the gefersa i and ii reservoirs to trap sediment before it entered the water storage reservoirs the gefersa reservoir system has an area of 130 5 ha and a catchment area of 53 5 km2 the gefersa reservoir system has a water storage capacity of 8 mm3 and supplies 30 000 m3 day of water to addis ababa fdre mowr 2002 the legedadi reservoir commissioned in the 1970 s has a capacity of 50 000 m3 day of water sime 1998 and a 510 ha surface area with a 207 3 km2 catchment area the dire reservoir built in 1998 expanded the legedadi water supply system to meet addis ababa s increasing water demands the dire reservoir has a 165 ha surface area and a catchment area of 77 5 km2 the combined legedadi and dire water supply system has a water storage volume of 120 mm3 86 and 34 mm3 respectively table 1 and supplies 165 000 m3 day to addis ababa city aawsa 2011 the akaki well fields springs and deep wells also serve as groundwater sources for the city fig 1 these groundwater sources supplied more than 75 000 m3 day of water by 2010 aawsa 2011 and significant investments have occurred in groundwater borehole development for example the new akaki well field which supplies 73 000 m3 day of water was commissioned in 2012 aawsa 2012 further developments in spring sources and deep wells have occurred in various parts of the city since 2012 the aawsa report of 2020 showed that the groundwater and surface water sources supplied 599 000 m3 day of water in 2019 aawsa 2020 several studies have conducted focused on the groundwater resources of the akaki basin mengistu et al 2021 tolera et al 2021 yifru et al 2022 mengistu et al 2021 conducted a comprehensive review of research on ethiopia s groundwater resources and found a wide variation in groundwater availability in the country from 2 5 to 47 bcm they identify data scarcity as a significant barrier to quantifying the country s groundwater resources they also highlight the need for coupled surface water and groundwater models tolera et al 2021 used swat to simulate recharge in the little akaki watershed though their estimates did not agree with other modeled estimates found in kebede 2013 demlie et al 2007 or doll and fiedler 2008 the authors used the groundwater recharge simulated from swat in a standalone modflow model tolera et al 2021 yifru et al 2022 implemented a linked swat modflow model but reported limitations in calibration due to poor data availability they did find that their results showed agreement with ayenew et al 2008 and that groundwater discharge and baseflow showed a strong agreement groundwater studies in the region highlight the need for collecting groundwater data so that linked surface water and groundwater models can provide insight into available water resources given the crucial role groundwater may play in supplying addis ababa in the future this current study utilizes groundwater data and proposed plans from aawsa to estimate water supply from groundwater resources in the five scenarios explored 2 2 data swat requires spatial and non spatial data for the initial model set up to discretize the watershed and define hydrological response units hrus the akaki swat model setup used the data listed in table 2 swat used the 30 m digital elevation model dem to estimate slope stream networks subbasin and watershed boundaries the dem showed that a mountain chain enoto mountains characterizes the upper part of the watershed whereas the middle and lower parts are flat with slopes 5 fig 1d basin discretization using the srtm 30 m dem resulted in 64 sub watersheds with an average area of 8 km2 basin discretization using the srtm 30 m dem resulted in 64 sub watersheds with an average area of 8 km2 the delineation process included gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs land cover data for 2016 was generated using landsat 8 operational land imager oli land use classification used a supervised image classification method and maximum likelihood algorithm providing kappa k statistics and overall accuracy of 84 and 82 respectively the classified land use map showed that cultivated land covers 74 of the watershed and developed areas cover 15 fig 1c the remaining land cover is comprised of grazing land forest shrubland waterbody and bare lands soil data were obtained from the africa soil information system afsis which has a spatial resolution of 250 m and consists of up to six layers of soil physical and chemical properties data fig 1d hengl et al 2015 leenaars et al 2014 vÃ¥gen et al 2010 weather data such as rainfall maximum minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity are required to simulate hydrological processes the ethiopian national meteorological services agency provided meteorological data for stations located inside and around the akaki watershed fig 1b these data indicate that the primary rainfall season is summer kiremt which spans june to september and a short rainfall season belg occurs from march to may the long term average annual rainfall of the akaki watershed is 1026 mm and the long term average monthly temperature ranges between 16 c and 19 c december represents the lowest minimum temperature and may represents the highest maximum temperature most of the weather stations used in this study include rainfall and maximum minimum temperature the ministry of water irrigation and energy of ethiopia provided observed monthly streamflow at the akaki gauging station fig 1b for further better quality streamflow and sediment data it is important to generate primary data by installing gauging stations at different parts of the akaki watershed 2 3 swat model swat is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model that can operate at annual monthly and daily time steps designed to be used in large ungauged agricultural basins swat allows users to assess the relative impact of land management decisions on various water quality and quantity parameters arnold et al 2012 1998 neitsch et al 2011 while initially intended for use in the united states the model has been adapted worldwide including in africa the swat model s strength is that it can be set up using readily available global data and then easily refined and developed when local data are available most importantly swat is a nested scale model that allows users to make water quality and quantity changes resulting from land management changes at multiple spatial hru subwatershed watershed and temporal daily monthly annual scales for the akaki watershed the qswat version 1 5 interface was used to parameterize the swat2012 model potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using the penman monteith method and water flow across the sub basins was estimated using the variable routing method swat was set up using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method to estimate surface runoff because the cn method demonstrated successful surface runoff estimation in similar tropical watersheds dile et al 2016 the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method in swat calculates runoff using an empirical water balance relationship q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s where q is the direct runoff mm p is the total rainfall mm and s 1000 cn with cn curve number related to soil and land cover conditions and commonly estimated from published tables the modified universal soil loss equation musle calculates sediment yield in swat at the smallest spatial unit defined in the model the hru the benefit here particularly in data scarce regions is that musle relies on runoff rather than the erosive energy of rainfall sediment yield can be used as a proxy for soil erosion musle is given by sed 11 8 q surf q peak area âru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle ls usle cfrg where sed is the sediment yield on a given day metric

cm cusle is the usle cover and management factor pusle is the usle support practice factor lsusle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor scenario analysis is the most basic function of the swat model due to its deterministic nature each successive swat run that uses a given set of inputs will produce the same outputs each time the model runs however the output may change if a user modifies an input such as climate or land management modifying single inputs allows users to isolate the response to that specific change in this way swat is an excellent model for exploring alternative land management scenarios or interventions and how they will modify the water balance swat identifies unique land cover soil and slope combinations to develop the hrus thresholds of 5 land cover 10 soil and 5 slope defined the hrus for the akaki watershed model thresholds identify areas with no or minimal contribution to model outputs simplifying model complexity if the area coverage of a given land cover soil or slope within a sub basin is below a set threshold then it is not considered in the analysis dile et al 2020 the akaki watershed hru development resulted in 634 hrus 2 4 swat cup streamflow and sediment calibration was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour and johnson 2004 swat cup is an interface for swat sensitivity analysis auto calibration and uncertainty analysis that can implement several calibration algorithms sufi2 is an optimization algorithm within swat cup used to estimate uncertainties in model parameters driving variables and conceptual models abbaspour et al 2007 using swat cup the first step was to identify the most sensitive parameters i e parameters with smaller p value and larger t stat abbaspour 2015 through a global sensitivity analysis subsequently the swat model was calibrated and validated using the sufi 2 and the observed streamflow data this study used observed monthly streamflow at the akaki gauging station fig 1b from 1990 to 2004 the observed streamflow data were split into two groups for calibration and validation with 1990 1995 used for calibration and 1998 2004 for validation no observed sediment data were available for the akaki watershed but were available for the nearby melka kuntrie watershed sediment load data for the melka kuntrie watershed were generated based on observed sediment concentration and streamflow data using the load estimator loadest tool runkel et al 2004 the akaki and melka kuntrie watersheds are adjacent and have similar land use soil and topographic characteristics for example like the akaki watershed the elevation in the melka kunture watershed is from 1948 m to 3575 m cultivated land 86 and grazing land 9 dominate the melka kuntrie watershed in the melka kuntrie watershed about 27 of the watershed area is under a slope class of 0 10 38 is under a slope class of 10 20 and 34 is under a slope class of more than 20 tolera et al 2018 transferring sediment related parameters between similar watersheds is a common approach used in modeling cao et al 2006 wale et al 2009 thus sediment load data were transferred from the melka kuntrie loadest model into the akaki swat model to estimate soil erosion in the watershed sediment related parameters were calibrated 1990 1995 and validated 1998 2004 in swat cup using observed generated sediment load data from the adjacent melka kuntrie watershed akaki watershed simulation performance was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias which are standard goodness of fit evaluation criteria in hydrology moriasi et al 2015 the sufi 2 p factor 95ppu and r factor were also used to evaluate model calibration and validation uncertainty abbaspour and johnson 2004 2 5 water demand the study collected the baseline water demand data for addis ababa from two primary sources aawsa 2012 2020 future total water demand was estimated by accounting for population growth and the city s standard per capita domestic water requirement the total population of addis ababa is projected to be 5 86 million and 10 59 million in 2030 and 2050 respectively aawsa 2020 we assumed a recommended 100 liters per person per day as the standard domestic water requirement to calculate water demand projections gleick 1996 howard and bartram 2003 however higher per capita water demands were considered over time to account for increased demand due to improved socio economic and quality of life conditions gleick 1996 an increase in the standard of living and lifestyle results in an increase in water demand for food health care aesthetic uses and miscellaneous domestic uses gleick 1996 the per capita water demand was assumed to increase by 10 in 2020 15 in 2025 20 in 2030 and 30 in 2040 table 6 aawsa 2011 has also considered an increase in per capita water demand over time due to changes in lifestyle and living standards the current water loss of 36 aawsa 2020 was assumed to continue 2 6 water supply aawsa reports provided water supply data from the reservoirs and akaki well fields for 2011 2012 and 2020 from 2005 2010 a total of 599 000 m3 day of water was supplied from reservoirs 225 000 m3 day and groundwater sources 374 000 m3 day to the city aawsa 2012 2020 in 2019 225 000 m3 day of water from reservoirs and 374 000 m3 day of water from groundwater were supplied aawsa 2020 2 7 water supply and demand scenarios five scenarios considered future potential water supply and demand for addis ababa the scenarios were developed based on existing water supply and demand aawsa s planned water supply projects and expert opinion driven swat model simulations scenario 1 baseline scenario this scenario assumes the 2019 water supply as a reference to compare future water supply and demand projections in 2019 reservoirs and groundwater supplied the city with 225 000 m3 day and 374 000 m3 day of water respectively aawsa 2020 scenario 2 optimum use this scenario analyzed near and long term future water supply coverage with the possibility of using the optimum potential capacity of water generated upstream of the existing reservoirs and groundwater sources unlike scenario 1 this scenario considers using the full potential of the reservoirs simulated by the hydrological model reservoir simulation outputs this scenario suggests an expansion of existing reservoirs and the construction of new reservoirs scenario 3 include nature based solutions in the watershed this scenario evaluates how nature based solutions such as afforestation vegetative filter strips and terraces in the reservoirs contributing source sub watersheds may impact water supply and sedimentation rate nature based solutions could trigger a change in average slope length curve number cn usle p p the usle support practice factor and width of filter strip filterw for instance the implementation of physical nature based solutions on 0 10 11 20 and 20 of the land could reduce the average slope length to 17 5 m 13 5 m and 8 m respectively desta et al 2005 hurni et al 2016 at the same time implementing vegetative nature based solutions increases the width of the filter strip filterw and reduces the curve number these measures were represented in the erosion hotspot areas of the watershed see fig 3 in the swat model by modifying curve number cn arnold et al 2012 slope length slsubbsn hurni et al 2016 usle p gebremichael et al 2005 and width of filter strip filterw betrie et al 2011 this scenario represents the reservoirs water supply under nature based solutions together with the existing and planned groundwater development projects scenario 4 full streamflow and groundwater potential this scenario assessed the streamflow potential of the akaki watershed at the watershed outlet together with the existing and planned groundwater development projects to meet the city s water demand through 2050 the watershed streamflow potential was determined using the calibrated and validated swat model and allocated 30 of the streamflow for environmental flow requirements pastor et al 2014 this percentage of water 30 is required to sustain freshwater ecosystems of the watershed and downstream flow scenario 5 planned water supply projects this scenario considers near and long term future 2020 2050 water supply coverage based on assumed water availability reported in aawsa s planned water supply projects the planned water supply projects include the construction of the legedadi phase 2 project gerbi reservoir sibilu reservoir and robi jeda reservoir this scenario also includes aawsa s reported development of groundwater sources to supply 7000 m3 day aawsa 2020 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the swat cup sensitivity analysis revealed several sensitive parameters for streamflow and sediment table 3 evaluation of the model streamflow simulation using the nse r2 and pbias provided 0 70 0 71 and 9 1 respectively during the calibration period supplementary 1 and supplementary 2 during validation the model showed nse r2 and pbias of 0 63 0 64 and 11 1 respectively the monthly simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs also showed reasonable agreement missing only a few streamflow peaks e g 1993 1998 and 1999 similarly the goodness of fit evaluation values indicated more than satisfactory streamflow simulation performance during the validation period uncertainty analysis during the calibration and validation periods showed that 86 and 74 of the observed data were bracketed within the 95ppu respectively indicating acceptable model performance abbaspour 2015 the uncertainty evaluation using the r factor which measures the thickness of the 95ppu also revealed good performance during the calibration and validation periods overall the model evaluation results showed that the calibrated and validated swat model can be used to estimate available water resources in the akaki watershed with a high degree of confidence an evaluation of model calibration for sediment yield simulation showed good performance with nse and pbias values of 0 62 and 8 6 respectively supplementary 3 likewise the model validation provided acceptable performance with nse and pbias of 0 57 and 0 6 respectively although the monthly simulated sediment yield agreed well with the monthly observed sediment yield load estimated in the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph it did not capture the peak sediment yield in 1998 and 1999 supplementary 4 the model also could not capture peak streamflow in these periods affecting sediment yield simulations the inability to capture the peak streamflow and sediment yield may be related to the quality of observed streamflow and sediment load data which are often difficult to measure accurately 3 2 water supply assessment addis ababa s water supply was assessed based on the observed water supply condition and using swat which estimated the potential water supply from the reservoirs based on the baseline 2019 water supply condition addis ababa has a water supply of 599 000 m3 day supplied from reservoirs 225 000 m3 day and groundwater sources 374 000 m3 day table 4 aawsa 2020 legedadi gefersa and dire reservoirs are the primary surface water sources while the akaki wellfields serve as the primary groundwater sources supplying addis ababa using the baseline water supply condition the water supply coverage in addis ababa is only 54 current low coverage indicates there will be increasingly severe water shortages in the future if there are no water supply improvements or new infrastructure projects given population growth rates this limited water supply coverage could trigger multifarious effects on sanitation food health and aesthetic services of the community this study used swat model outputs to assess the monthly and annual potential water availability from gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs swat simulation showed that a higher inflow was observed in the legedadi reservoir 1983 2013 than gefersa 1983 2013 and dire reservoirs 1998 2013 while the inflows to gefersa and dire reservoirs were comparable table 5 and fig 2 in all three reservoirs the highest inflow was recorded in august in which gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs received about 20 75 mm3 68 08 mm3 and 22 48 mm3 of water respectively these reservoirs have been supplying less water than their potential since their commission the upstream part of the gefersa reservoir can provide about 150 274 m3 day fig 2 and table 5 in contrast the water supply reported from the gefersa reservoir is only about 30 137 m3 day aawsa 2012 annually legedadi and dire reservoirs receive about 182 mm3 of water from the upstream area table 5 but aawas 2011 reported that the annual surface water supply from both legedadi and dire reservoirs is only 60 mm3 the gap between water received in the reservoirs and what is used as supply to addis ababa indicates that the upstream areas of the reservoirs have sufficient potential water but that it is not being harnessed effectively therefore there is more water resource potential in the upstream catchments of the reservoirs that could be harnessed through actions like raising reservoir height or adding new reservoirs high siltation significantly reduces the reservoirs storage capacity and lifetime simulations showed that the average annual soil yield in the akaki watershed was between 3 3 and 9 16 tons ha year and the average was 8 tons ha year fig 3 the northwestern central and southern parts of the watershed dominated by cultivated land showed high simulated sediment yield urban areas had lower simulated yield fig 3 the simulated soil yield in the akaki watershed is comparable to estimates reported in other parts of ethiopia for example in the northern part of ethiopia haregeweyn et al 2008 simulated 10 tons ha year sediment yield and duguma et al 2020 simulated 4 3 tons ha year in the guder watershed some studies have reported higher soil erosion estimates for instance tamene et al 2006 reported that the average annual soil erosion in the upstream areas of 11 reservoirs in the semi arid highlands of northern ethiopia was 19 tons ha year soil erosion rates in these watersheds may vary due to differences in climate topography land use and soil types monthly model simulations showed high sediment yield in 1996 and 1999 the highest sediment yields were simulated in july and august when the rainfall and surface runoff generation were peaking fig 4 annual sedimentation in the gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs was 26 970 tons 127 244 tons and 30 715 tons respectively table 5 and fig 5 the highest sedimentation occurred in august and estimates in the gefersa legedadi and dire reservoirs were 10 134 tons 65 819 tons and 13 443 tons respectively table 5 similarly other studies e g tarekegn 2012 daba 2017 also reported comparable sediment deposition in the gefersa and legedadi reservoirs for example from 1990 to 1997 daba 2017 estimated the average annual sediment deposition in the gefersa reservoir was 27 288 75 tons an annual sedimentation rate of 32 718 tons was also estimated in the gefersa reservoir dar al omran 2011 sediment deposition reduces the live storage capacity and lifetime of reservoirs for example based on the swat model outputs the legedadi and gefersa reservoirs have been losing about 0 3 of their live storage annually comparable reduced storage capacity has been estimated for legedadi and gefersa reservoirs as reported in dar al omran 2011 swat model outputs revealed significant cumulative sediment deposition from 1983 to 2013 in these reservoirs with about 4 million 0 8 million and 0 5 million tons of sediment deposited in the legedadi gefersa and dire reservoirs respectively fig 6 reservoir sedimentation could be higher because watershed rehabilitation and protection practices to abate soil erosion and provide buffer zones for the reservoirs are limited for example settlements and mining occur in the reservoir catchment areas and the continuous expansion of cultivated land can cause an increase in soil erosion and sediment deposition in the reservoirs the volume of sediment deposition in the legedadi gefersa and dire reservoirs was about 3 034 mm3 0 643 mm3 and 0 378 mm3 respectively from 1983 to 2013 fig 7 during this period sedimentation reduced the storage capacity of legedadi and gefersa reservoirs by 9 3 and 10 29 respectively the different storage capacity reduction rates owing to sedimentation were due to the difference in the size of the reservoirs catchments land use types slope and other biophysical features regardless model results indicate severe sedimentation in the reservoirs that supply water to addis ababa 3 3 water demand assessment ever increasing population growth and economic activity have triggered a substantial increase in addis ababa s water demand for instance in the base period 2019 463 000 m3 day and 347 000 m3 day of water were required to meet the domestic and non domestic water demand respectively aawsa 2020 annually domestic and non domestic water demand in the city was about 296 mm3 in 2019 aawsa 2020 including a 36 water loss total water demand is projected to increase from 1103 000 m3 day in 2019 1676 000 m3 day in 2030 2436 000 m3 day in 2040 and 3528 000 m3 day in 2050 table 6 this analysis does not include water demand for urban agriculture 3 4 water management scenarios using five scenarios we explicitly analyzed water supply demand and plausible water management strategies for addis ababa these scenarios illustrate the impacts of various water supply interventions on water supply these scenarios are based on existing water supply proposed water supply projects and model simulations the results revealed that water supply and water supply coverage differ under the five scenarios 3 5 scenario 1 baseline scenario the baseline scenario is based on the 2019 water supply and the current and future estimated population table 7 presents the existing addis ababa surface water and groundwater sources according to a recent aawsa report aawsa 2020 225 000 m3 day of water from reservoirs and 374 000 m3 day of water from groundwater totaling 599 000 m3 day of water table 7 is supplied to the city the total water demand in the baseline and future is greater than the total water supply in this scenario under the baseline water supply there will be a consistent reduction in water supply coverage for instance water supply coverage ranges from 54 in the base period 2019 to 36 in 2030 25 in 2040 and 17 in 2050 table 7 under the baseline water supply condition this scenario is the worst case because it shows severe water shortage and many water supply related crises if no new water supply projects are realized fig 8 contrary to the water supply condition of this scenario there is a continuous increase in population economic growth and water demand 3 6 scenario 2 optimum use this scenario assumes using the total inflow to the existing reservoirs as simulated by the hydrological model the hydrological model simulation showed that the three reservoirs legedadi dire and gefersa could supply about 649 000 m3 day however only 225 000 m3 day of water is being supplied from existing reservoirs with existing groundwater sources 375 000 m3 year using the optimum potential of the reservoirs can increase the city s water supply both the optimum level of reservoirs and groundwater sources can supply 1044 000 m3 day thus water supply coverage could range from 95 in the base period 2019 to 62 in 2030 43 in 2040 and 30 in 2050 table 7 fig 8 improved water supply coverage can be achieved over scenario 1 using this scenario but there is still a significant water supply shortage in the future under this scenario like scenario 1 this scenario also considers total water demand which is subject to increase in the future table 7 3 7 scenario 3 optimum use with nature based solutions model outputs indicate the release and storage benefits of nature based solutions which could further increase soil moisture and crops growing period nature based solutions upstream of the reservoirs and erosion hot spot areas resulted in significant changes to sedimentation rates for all reservoirs fig 5 and table 8 nature based solutions significantly p 0 05 reduce reservoir sedimentation the effect of nature based solutions is distinct in different reservoirs for instance the physical nature based solution i e terraces resulted in statistically significant p 0 00 sediment reduction in the legedadi and dire reservoirs but an insignificant p 0 27 impact in gefersa reservoir sedimentation vegetative filter strips triggered higher sediment reduction p 0 00 in the gefersa reservoir but showed an insignificant p 0 16 impact on sedimentation for legedadi and dire reservoirs the main benefit of nature based solutions is reducing reservoir sedimentation with a modest change in the monthly reservoir inflow after implementing nature based solutions in the model the primary change related to inflow is increased inflow to the reservoirs during the dry season october november and reduced inflows during the main rainy season july and august this is due to nature based solutions storage and release effects which retain surface runoff during the main rainy season and slowly release in october november nature based solutions such as terraces reduce surface runoff velocity and thus loss of water through direct runoff during the main rainy season whereas vegetative filter strips increase the infiltration rate of excess water during the rainy season oral et al 2020 discuss such benefits of nature based solutions 3 8 scenario 4 use streamflow and groundwater potential this scenario assesses the surface flow potential of the akaki watershed upstream of the delineated outlet and the planned groundwater development projects to meet the city s water demand until 2050 swat showed that about 837 000 m3 day of water could be harvested from the watershed allowing for a 30 environmental flow requirement pastor et al 2014 this flow requirement represents the amount of water needed to sustain freshwater ecosystems and the minimum flow toward the downstream watersheds hence together with planned groundwater developments the surface water potential of the akaki watershed can support the water demand until only 2025 table 8 after that this scenario recommends trans basin water transfer wastewater reclamation and policies that can reduce water losses at various stages 3 9 scenario 5 planned water supply projects in this scenario we consider aawsa s proposed water supply projects each year new wells with a volume of 7000 m3 day will be constructed and added to the water production system from 2020 to 2030 aawsa 2020 in 2022 the legedadi phase 2 project was added to the water production increasing the supply by 86 000 m3 day the aawsa development plan indicated that some of the planned groundwater well development projects are around koyefechie tuludimtu and kilinto condominium sites the south ayat north fanta well field project which can supply 68 000 m3 day is under construction and is 85 complete there are other groundwater supply projects in the sebeta holeta and tefki areas and various parts of addis ababa aawsa 2020 in addition the gerbi reservoir with a volume of 65 700 m3 day the sibilu reservoir with a volume of 385 200 m3 day and the robi jeda reservoir with a volume of 540 000 m3 day will be added to the water production in 2023 2026 and 2029 respectively aawsa 2020 these planned projects are located outside of the akaki watershed which suggests the need for interbasin transfer to meet the growing water demand of the city proposed projects could increase the total water supply from 599 000 m3 day in 2019 644 000 m3 day in 2020 831 000 m3 day in 2025 and 1763 000 m3 day in 2029 if the proposed surface water projects are completed as planned water supply coverage would increase from 54 2019 to 60 2025 to 105 2030 but then begin dropping to 72 2040 and 50 2050 aawsa plans no significant water supply projects from 2029 onwards however groundwater supply shows an insignificant increase from 2020 to 2050 due to the continuous increase in water demand more than the proposed projects will be needed to close the water shortage gap beyond 2035 table 8 in addition the demonstrated water supply coverage can only be realized if the planned projects are fully completed in their respective timeframes and they operate effectively without major setbacks 4 discussion this study analyzed the water resources base ever growing water demand and five water management scenarios designed to meet addis ababa s water demand all scenarios concluded that the city s unprecedented projected population growth and associated improvements in living standards would lead to a significant increase in water demand figure 9 this study illustrates that considering additional supply options and averting system losses particularly from 2035 onwards is necessary or future water demand will overwhelm the existing water supply system the addis ababa government tried to increase water availability from surface sources since the 1940 s when the gefersa dam i ii was built however significant surface water development projects have yet to be implemented in the last two decades the latest development in surface water storage infrastructures is the legedadi dam s expansion through the construction of the dire dam in 1998 recently from 2005 to 2010 s aawsa has been supplying additional water through groundwater development from the akaki well fields even though the city has regularly increased its water supply since the 1970 s the gap between the water supply and demand has widened and addis ababa is already facing water supply challenges the unprecedented population increase and lifestyle improvements have created a demand that outpaces supply poor land use management is increasing soil erosion in the reservoir catchments causing sedimentation and reduced capacity of the reservoirs land use and climate change also exacerbate the gap between water supply and demand groundwater mining companies and government and private industries are depleting and polluting the akaki well fields further complicating water supply issues for instance about 84 50 of the current pumping water levels exceed the sustainable pumping rate muleta and abate 2020 with the existing water supply sources addis ababa s water demand will only be met for some years from 2020 to 2050 unless there are interventions to safeguard water resources and increase supply capacity thus the city government must develop strategies to improve the water supply and water demand management in the near and long term nature based solutions green measures or infrastructure technological solutions grey measures and policy interventions soft measures are non trivial but vital to increasing and sustaining addis ababa s water supply nature based solutions are a panacea that offers the potential to sustain the akaki watershed s hydro ecosystems biodiversity and the natural environment nature based solutions can significantly relieve addis ababa from socio economic environmental and water supply and demand challenges such solutions are found appropriate in different urban areas of the world which face similar challenges to addis ababa oral et al 2020 ramÃ­rez agudelo et al 2020 for instance nature based solutions can improve water availability for more than 700 million people in 100 of the world s largest cities the nature conservancy 2014 nature based solutions like buffer zones afforestation contour farming strip cropping cover crops and vegetative filter strips can sustain and enhance the ecosystem services the akaki watershed provides these solutions have the potential to increase and sustain water supplies investments in nature based solutions are essential to deter some of the critical environmental problems and improve water quantity and quality for addis ababa nature based conservation measures in the legedadi dire and gefersa reservoir watersheds are currently limited dar al omran 2011 however a large area of the akaki watershed primarily cultivated land has excessive soil erosion estifanos 2015 such measures play a crucial role in abating soil erosion reducing nutrient leakage into the freshwater ecosystems and sustaining surface water availability for the reservoirs nature based solutions aligned with government groundwater development programs can enhance recharge and baseflow by attenuating floods by storing and slowly releasing stormwater and increasing the infiltration rate in the watershed the entoto and menagaesha forest ecosystems and their unique topographic features provide essential ecosystem services like releasing clean water to streams sequestering carbon reducing peak streamflow providing fresh air to the city and reducing soil erosion in the highland areas feyissa and gebremariam 2018 woldegerima et al 2017 managing the forests under an integrated nature based management framework will ensure they continue to provide these services integrating downstream water bodies such as abba samuel lake into this nature based solutions framework will protect biodiversity and play a crucial role in water quality management by cleaning polluted water from domestic and commercial industries technological measures that increase water quantity and quality are effective water use which can enhance the water supply of addis ababa for example the water discharged at the akaki watershed outlet could be used as a water supply water harvesting is also indispensable to reducing reliance on groundwater sources and increasing water supply coverage addis ababa has many impervious areas including rooftops roads and buildings so water harvesting is a viable option in many areas the water collected can be used for various purposes with minimal water treatment the city also discharges a large quantity of wastewater which can be another source of water supply currently only a fraction about 10 of the wastewater is collected and treated either in centralized or decentralized systems aawsa 2011 the treated effluent can be reclaimed for reuse if the city s wastewater treatment system is improved such practices are becoming common globally engineering efforts can optimize existing reservoirs optimizing will require hydraulic structures to raise the height of dams or build new dams to harness the potential water resources available policy and institutional approaches that reduce water loss and increase the productivity of water development projects are indispensable substantial water losses 36 due to leakages misuses and other inefficiencies occur during water distribution to customers and trigger a significant gap between the water supply and demand aawsa 2012 policy measures to reduce such water loss can supply water for about 3000 people up to the required standard introducing and maintaining water infrastructure equipment is also needed to reduce actual losses i e physical water losses from the pressurized water distribution system introducing adequate meter readers can help circumvent over and under registration fees and tariff adjustments could significantly reduce losses 5 conclusion in cities like addis ababa water demand is continuously increasing which requires comparable water supply production even though the addis ababa city government has made improvements to increase water supply water demand is increasing disproportionally to supply from both surface water and groundwater sources the current supply system provides only 58 liter capita day of water to the city s inhabitants with the standard domestic water demand for a basic quality of life considered 100 liter capita day the existing water supply sources can only meet the water demand of about 82 of addis ababa s population in the future there is likely to be an increase in unmet water demand even with full exploitation of the potential of the reservoirs 649 000 m3 day there could be a water shortage soon land management improvements in the sub watersheds contributing to the reservoirs and additions to current water supply sources including boreholes and potentially new reservoirs are required to meet projected demands sedimentation climate change land use change and management and other factors can also impact water supply and demand high sediment loads in the watershed can cause a significant reduction in reservoir storage capacity and life span for example improving land management upstream can extend reservoir life in addition the current reservoirs are not fully exploited this points to the need to optimize the reservoir potential through actions like increasing reservoir height and width scouring the reservoirs rivers and canals could increase the reservoir stability reservoir life span and storage capacity future studies should also examine the dynamics between water supply and water demand under global and local drivers such as climate change and predicted land use change upstream of reservoirs it is critical to develop optimal water supply plans to increase water availability and meet water demand in the current and future periods to develop optimal water development plans high quality data such as sediment groundwater and streamflow data are non trivial lack of sediment data from different gauges of the watershed was a limitation of this study which needs to be improved for future research and water development plans besides better spatial density and temporal frequency of streamflow and groundwater measurements should be further strengthened in the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

7724,study region in this study we compiled and analyzed the results of previous sediment fingerprinting research that examined the riverbank as one of the sediment sources representing 118 catchments across the globe most of which were located in the uk n 84 the usa n 14 and brazil n 10 gathered studies included catchments ranging from 0 31 to 15 000 km2 and which were predominately agricultural study focus it is essential to understand how riverbanks contribute to total sediment load at the catchment scale if we wish to develop better strategies for managing soil loss therefore the main objective of this study was to assess different fingerprinting tracers quantitatively and analyze the influence of catchment size on riverbank erosion new hydrological insights we found that radionuclide tracers show the most consistent relative sources contributions the share of riverbanks to total sediment loss was in the range of 1 25 at the same time the relative contributions of riverbanks and surface sources for many catchments exceeded 25 and 90 respectively this variability emphasizes the number of factors affecting riverbank erosion however despite this there was a clear shift in contributions from surface sources to riverbanks with increasing catchment size we suggest that in nested catchments there is a need for long term longitudinal monitoring of sediment loads including downstream changes of riverbank erosion graphical abstract ga1 keywords sediment load catchment size sediment fingerprinting riverbank erosion subsurface erosion surface erosion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riverbank erosion is the product of basal erosion resulting from fluvial hydraulics and bank collapse caused by geotechnical variability duan 2005 the erosion rate depends on several factors the cohesion of riverbank materials riverbank geometry hydraulics and the frequency of riverbank failure duan 2005 riverbank erosion and riverbed aggradation increase with bed erodibility and near bank flow velocities which are influenced by non cohesive materials in the winter ice and freezing frequently facilitate the smooth removal of material layers when the river level subsequently rises lawler 1986 riverbank erosion generally occurs after rather than during flood peaks when maximum velocity flows are directed away from the riverbank s outer face the increasing discharge reduces shear stress along the sidewall causing fluvial soil loss riverbank erosion is also promoted by pore and hydrostatic water pressures acting between river rising and drawdown during multipeaked events rinaldi et al 2008 in addition to the basal erosion caused by fluvial hydraulics eroded sediments come from other subsurface sources including ditches gullies and troughs associated with steep farm tracks as well as incised track cuttings into the subsoil previous studies have shown that riverbank erosion has been insufficiently considered and underestimated due to a lack of information which may result in inefficient decisions on remedial actions however the proportions of topsoil and subsoil delivered to and through a channel system vary substantially depending on a range of controls including watershed size and topography climate and hydrology land use e g tilling grazing and forestry and the degree of lateral and longitudinal connectivity in the system fryirs et al 2007 koiter et al 2013 wethered et al 2015 recent studies in temperate regions suggest that subsurface erosion mostly from riverbanks can contribute significant proportions of suspended sediment loads and associated nutrient losses riverbanks sediment supply has been set up to be a major constituent in many catchments with frequently over 50 of the sediment output belmont et al 2011 fox et al 2016 schottler et al 2014 theuring et al 2013 researchers have been more focused on riverbank erosion because they found a shift of the dominant source of sediment from agricultural soil erosion to accelerated erosion of riverbanks driven by increased river discharge rode et al 2018 riverbank erosion contributes sediment to rivers and plays an integral role in water quality river ecology and geomorphological processes florsheim et al 2008 within catchments sediment sinks and stored sediment are important to river habitats still they can also act as ecological stressors because they may contain detrimental substances such as agricultural inputs heavy metals and pesticides kronvang et al 2013 in addition headwater systems are key sediment sources and deliver sediments to downstream reaches gomi et al 2002 the large share of sediment from riverbank erosion affects ecosystems by changing water quality through adsorbed contaminants in fine sediment furthermore sediment sinks e g reservoirs impoundments and ponds can accumulate contaminants which also cause ecological problems for instance overbank sedimentation on floodplains can be a significant phosphorus source walling 1999 the river floodplains are important sinks for accumulation of sediment and associated contaminants mobilized from the catchment upstream consequently sediment erosion can be seen as a significant pollutant that affects infrastructures e g reservoirs and degrades marine ecosystems worldwide liu et al 2017 finally the input of fine sediment often exceeds transport capacity causing problems like streambed clogging which in turn results in reduced hydraulic connectivity and increased ecological degradation hartwig et al 2016 kondolf et al 2006 there are many concerns with traditional approaches for quantifying suspended sediment contributions from surface and subsurface sources these approaches include measuring soil erosion rates using erosion pins and troughs and estimating sediment loads peart and walling 1986 sediment source fingerprinting is increasingly being used as an alternative collins et al 1998b fingerprinting methods have substantial advantages over conventional methods which require on site monitoring of sediment sources owens et al 2016 the sediment source fingerprinting method was first developed by klages and hsieh 1975 and this approach uses a variety of fingerprint tracers e g radionuclides gellis et al 2017 rode et al 2018 geochemical rode et al 2018 spectral brosinsky et al 2014a 2014b environmental dna evrard et al 2019 and compound specific stable isotopes gibbs 2008 upadhayay et al 2020 the successful applicability of the fingerprinting method concerns the choice of different tracers the tracers must differentiate the sediment sources and be conservative during transportation from the source to the downstream sediment sample collins et al 2017 these tracers provide helpful information about sediment sources however compound specific stable isotopes of fatty acids have also been used successfully to discriminate specific crop types of sediment sources blake et al 2012 there is also a recommendation to compare different groups of tracers to identify sediment sources owens et al 2016 however the radionuclide tracers help to disentangle surface and subsurface sources because they are not affected by soil type walling and woodward 1992 however it lacks the quantitative assessment of various sets of fingerprinting properties that need to be addressed to improve the discrimination power of the tracers riverbank erosion is a significant contributor to total sediment loss within catchments source apportionment analysis walling and collins 2005 has indicated that this contribution is around 5 15 on average but can exceed 40 in some catchments another study suggested this percentage could climb as high as 50 duijsings 1987 however these studies were conducted at regional scales and did not account for catchment size only work by lawler et al 1999 has revealed an apparent downstream change in riverbank erosion this finding emerged from research exploring a combination of riverbank erosion mechanisms i e mass failure fluvial erosion and weathering processes these results are the first to signal that the contribution of riverbank erosion to total sediment loss could increase with the catchment area however the relationship between catchment size and the contributions of subsurface and surface sources remains uncharacterized sediment loss from riverbanks and upland areas is shaped by complex interactions between soil erosion and deposition affecting the relative contributions in this study we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that the sediment contribution of riverbanks relative to upland areas increases with increasing catchment size first we compiled and assimilated the results of past studies on fingerprinting research that has explored the contributions of subsurface and surface sources to total sediment loss at the catchment level second the descriptive power of the selected fingerprinting tracers was analyzed third we examined the relationship between catchment size and the relative contributions of riverbank and surface sources to total sediment loss this study describes sediment source fingerprinting section 2 and discusses the results of the gathered global dataset on soil erosion sourcing at the catchment scale sections 3 and 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment source fingerprinting over recent years researchers have greatly expanded their use of fingerprinting to identify sediment sources at the catchment scale fig 1 it is essential to utilize benchmarks tied to the properties of the fingerprinting approach until clear recommendations are established in the international literature in addition to having a high level of discrimination tracers must behave consistently given that they are often evaluated using different statistical tests e g variability ratio range test kruskal wallis test discriminant function analysis and principal component analysis the sediment source fingerprinting approach was first used in the 1970 s by klages and hsieh 1975 who developed a method based on mineralogy and geochemistry e g grain size characterization wall and wilding 1976 also utilized this approach later an assessment of the magnetic properties of sediments was included walling et al 1979 since then there has been a rapid increase in the number of studies employing fingerprinting to identify sediment sources collins et al 2020 owens et al 2016 sediment source fingerprinting was developed to directly determine the sources of primary suspended sediments and their relative contributions to total sediment load within catchments walling and woodward 1995 more recently managers are turning to this method as well collins et al 2017 the managers planning for soil erosion and degradation mitigation measures include multiple stakeholders and decision makers comprising water and landscape authorities reservoir managers water practitioners and farmers the number of studies using sediment source fingerprinting is increasing since more than two decades fig 1 with most research taking place in the uk sediment source fingerprinting is one technique for determining the origin of fine sediments carter et al 2003 collins et al 1997 gellis et al 2019 gruszowski et al 2003 walling et al 2008 walling and woodward 1995 it works best when long term data on sediment dynamics are available notably from bank erosion assessments sediment budgets and other sources devereux et al 2010 sediment source fingerprinting results will also change if sediment dynamics vary over time consequently long term information on sediment sources or temporal variation is valid when evaluating catchment management strategies this approach is quite sensitive to rainfall and the duration of the preceding dry periods as demonstrated by the marked variation in sediment source apportionment among rainfall events and across entire periods in addition the relative uncertainty associated with identifying sources decreases as the tracer number increases poleto et al 2009 a schematic description of the method is provided below fig 2 sediment source fingerprinting offers many advantages over conventional methods and has become the most common direct approach for quantifying sediment contributions at the catchment scale owens et al 2016 2 1 1 tracers in sediment source fingerprinting valuable tracers include fallout radionuclides walling and woodward 1992 mineral magnetism slattery et al 1995 uber et al 2019 spectrocolorimetry uber et al 2019 compound specific stable isotopes reiffarth et al 2019 spectral fingerprinting brosinsky et al 2014a 2014b environmental dna evrard et al 2019 and the effective use of geochemical fingerprints in the case of spatial sediment sources theuring et al 2015 there are also newly introduced tracers for sediment fingerprinting e g the applicability of phytoliths as a quantitative process tracer kraushaar et al 2021 and color based tracing pulley and collins 2022 further detailed descriptions of conservativeness of tracers and their selection can be found in collins et al 2020 when disentangling surface and subsurface sediment sources fallout radionuclides are useful fingerprints since they are unaffected by soil type or lithology allowing them to be used in heterogeneous catchments where other fingerprints may be of limited use walling and woodward 1992 source apportionment among riverbanks agricultural areas forests and roads can be carried out using elemental profiles either with or without 13c and 15n isotopes given that the results seem to remain largely consistent stewart et al 2015 the widespread use of sediment source fingerprinting has been limited because of the cost and effort involved in preparing samples for radionuclide and elemental geochemistry analyses however spectral fingerprints can be used as a rapid and cost effective alternative brosinsky et al 2014b it has been determined that mid infrared mir spectroscopy is fast inexpensive and non destructive when the objective is to identify sediment sources in rural catchments with a view to developing targeted mitigation strategies tiecher et al 2017a mineralogical characteristics goethite and kaolinite content have yielded easy to discriminate results and could be used as fingerprints in research seeking to determine the major sediment contributors in river channels miguel et al 2014 however any physical or chemical tracers must be environmentally stable that is they must not change over the course of transport within the catchment fallout radionuclides geochemical elements and organic matter properties are the most commonly used tracers in conventional methods including the mir spectroscopy based technique a combination of conventional and alternative tracers can be used to improve sediment source apportionment and obtain the best model results collins and walling 2002 2 1 2 mixing model the main objective of the mixing model is to compute the proportional contributions of all sources to suspended sediment loads at the catchment scale which is achieved by minimizing error during this process the following two conditions must be respected 1 contributions must have a value between 0 and 1 2 the sum of all the contributions must equal 1 apportionment results from the sediment mixture combinations that have the highest goodness of fit gof based on the sum of squares of relative error lizaga et al 2020 1 g of 1 1 n i 1 n b i j 1 m Ï j a i j Î´ i where gof is the goodness of fit Î´ i is the value range of tracer i normalized Î± i j is the value of tracer i in sediment source j b i is the value of tracer i in the sediment Ï j is the unknown relative contribution from sediment source j n is the number of tracers used and m is the number of sediment sources used mixing models are computationally challenging to use and thus normally require a fair amount of expertise and familiarity with specific statistical programs free user friendly software r package fingerpro has been developed for users with limited to no experience with sediment source fingerprinting and r lizaga et al 2020 in recent years the programs isosource phillips and gregg 2003 and mixsir moore and semmens 2008 were created for ecological applications other open source software sediment fingerprinting tool or sift has been developed using the r programming language pulley and collins 2018 and is structured to better guide end users in applying the fingerprinting approach collins et al 2017 like sift sed sat sediment source assessment tool gorman sanisaca et al 2017 was created with methodological fundamentals in mind 2 1 3 sediment budget calculation using sediment source fingerprinting sediment budgets generally contain sediment contributions from three primary sources hillslopes gullies and riverbanks which can be quantified by sediment source fingerprinting sediment budgets provide a valuable framework for understanding sediment behavior and fate at large scales and can thus inform management strategies walling and collins 2008 they yield information about sediment mobilization transfer and storage at the catchment scale and reveal the extent of erosion and deposition rates the integrated approach to developing sediment budgets is based on monitoring sediment yield sediment source fingerprinting and using radionuclides to estimate soil erosion and deposition the sediment budget of a catchment consists of three main components first sediment load which corresponds to net erosion in the catchment can be quantified using suspended sediment measurements and turbidity sensors second gross erosion within the catchment can be determined using for example the rusle model or radionuclide tracers third sediment source fingerprinting is used to calculate the fraction of each sediment source a detailed descriptions of these three approach s procedures and data collection are given applied and tested in one study catchment of the upper kaleya catchment in southern zambia walling et al 2001 thus only a brief summary is provided here sediment budgets can be used to calculate valuable metrics like the sediment delivery ratio sdr which expresses the relationship between total erosion and quantities of exported sediments within catchments even if the sdr has certain limitations it can be beneficial walling 1983 for example sdr is inversely related to catchment area and ranges from around 100 in tiny basins 0 1 km2 to less than 10 in larger basins 100 1000 km2 porto et al 2011 sediment budgets can also help to understand the geomorphological development of catchments duijsings 1987 and define water quality targets and land use practices cogle et al 2006 2 2 catchment data analysis 2 2 1 catchment fingerprinting data in this study a sediment source fingerprinting dataset has been gathered and analyzed to explore the contributions of the subsurface e g riverbanks and surface sources to total sediment loss considering studies on 118 catchments across the globe fig 3 a summary of the dataset is given in table 1 while a detailed description is reported in supplementary materials tables s1 and s2 these catchments are located in the uk n 84 usa n 14 brazil n 10 iran n 4 zambia n 1 burkina faso n 1 mongolia n 1 spain n 2 and australia n 1 they range in size from 0 31 to 15 000 km2 and are mainly subject to agricultural usage clearly such research has primarily taken place in the uk 72 of the catchments it has largely been performed by desmond walling university of exeter and researchers coming out of his lab the share of riverbank sediments in the total sediment load was determined from previous studies globally table 1 and fig 3 the identity of the tracers used often in combination was noted catchment elevation was determined using an elevation finder tool and information from the gauge stations located at catchment outlets 2 2 2 calculating upland erosion rates data on water mediated soil erosion are available at the european scale at a resolution level of 100 m calculated using high resolution input datafiles in a modified version of the revised universal soil loss equation rusle panagos et al 2015 this high resolution soil erosion data was used to calculate mean upland erosion rates for individual catchments in the uk first catchment boundaries and related shapefiles were defined using arcmap before extracting upland erosion rates of selected catchments shapefile data were available for 40 uk catchments and were downloaded from the national river flow archive for another 30 uk catchments catchment boundary shapefiles were produced using shuttle radar topography mission srtm global data the arc hydro tools in arcmap were used to delineate catchments automatically using step by step procedures that deploy a set of hydrology tools in sequence shapefiles were produced according to this delineation finally the upland erosion rates of all catchments were extracted using downloaded shapefiles from national river flow archive and the shapefiles produced by delineation of catchments tables s1 and s2 with geoprocessing tool in arcmap the calculated mean values of upland erosion rates were used to characterize surface erosion and sediment delivery for catchments in the uk 2 2 3 classification of dataset as noted above the dataset was heavily biased towards uk catchments consequently different data subsets were established within the dataset with a view to acquiring useful information and benchmarks that could help establish global recommendations the main sediment sources were surfaces i e cropland pastures grasslands urban areas forests and subsurface e g riverbanks ditches gullies troughs in steep farm tracks and incised track cuttings into the subsoil riverbanks were analyzed both as individual sediment sources and in combination with other subsurface sources the fingerprinting studies were mainly divided into two groups based on tracer type one subset from tables s1 and s2 contained studies using radionuclides and all other tracers elemental geochemistry mineral magnetism biogeochemical chemical weathering indices elemental ratios spectrocolorimetric properties and bulk isotopes n 69 catchments the second subset excluded the studies using radionuclides n 42 catchments fig 4 the dataset was also divided into two subsets based on the information regarding the sediment sources the subsurface source subset in general n 118 catchments tables s1 and s2 fig 5 and the riverbank source subset in particular n 78 catchments table s2 we also gathered the uk catchments n 44 from table s1 and s2 where upland erosion rates total sediment yields and subsurface sediment yields were available fig 6 to obtain a general trend of sediment delivery ratio however global recommendations should rely on broader data based on measured sediment load within the catchments the subsurface and riverbank source subsets were then further splitted the subsurface sediment load subset in general across the globe n 67 catchments from tables s1 and s2 fig 7 and the riverbank sediment load subset in particular n 46 catchments from table s2 fig 8 3 results 3 1 tracer use the fingerprinting properties that were used in the collected dataset include radionuclides elemental geochemistry biogeochemical mineral magnetism chemical weathering indices elemental ratios spectrocolorimetric properties and bulk isotopes these properties were selected separately and combined with two or more different sets of properties as composite properties depending on the availability cost and analysis testing of different soil and sediment tracers and the catchment characteristics only elemental geochemistry was utilized in 18 of the 118 catchments and mineral magnetism and radionuclides were the sole tracers used in 1 and 3 catchments respectively at all the other sites the full suite of tracers was employed often in combination the subsurface source contribution relative to surface sources was disentangled into two subsets based on types of tracer properties one subset was with radionuclide properties with other properties and one subset was non radionuclides tracers fig 4 frequently subsurface source apportionment was performed using elemental geochemistry exclusively or in combination with other tracer types 3 2 sediment contributions by surface sources and riverbanks the apportionment data for subsurfaces and surfaces demonstrate the relative roles played by different sources in total sediment loss within catchments table 1 fig 5 although the results ranged widely in the global dataset we generally observed relative contributions of 1 25 from subsurfaces and 75 99 from surface sources in the 78 catchments for which riverbank specific data were available it is clear that riverbanks contribute to a wide range of relative contributions to catchment sediment yield however it is essential to keep in mind that these general patterns do not explicitly account for catchment spatial distribution source type or amount of sediments however they do paint a preliminary picture of the dynamics of various world regions for example there were several catchments across the globe for which riverbank and surface contributions exceeded 25 and 90 respectively however the contribution of riverbanks alone tended to fall in the range of 3 25 and that of surface sources tended to occur in the range of 75 97 which suggests that these could be taken as general values the size of these ranges highlights that many direct and indirect factors may have an impact on the two above mentioned sources of erosion the median percent contribution of riverbanks to sediment yield in the catchment was 24 minimum 3 6 and maximum 93 6 while the median percent contribution of surfaces was 76 minimum 6 45 and maximum 96 4 n 78 catchments consequently on average surfaces made larger contributions than riverbanks to total sediment loads at the catchment scale that said for 18 catchments 23 of the subset riverbanks were larger sources 3 3 riverbank and upland erosion soil erosion is a serious threat to the health of river ecosystems data from the 44 uk catchments illustrate the relative differences in upland erosion rates total sediment yields surface yields and subsurface yields fig 6 for these catchments the median upland erosion rate was 165 t km 2 yr 1 minimum 55 t km 2 yr 1 and maximum 536 t km 2 yr 1 median total sediment yield subsurface surface sources was 16 t km 2 yr 1 minimum 0 27 t km 2 yr 1 and maximum 89 t km 2 yr 1 sediment budgets can be used to estimate the sediment delivery ratio walling and collins 2008 the median value of sediment delivery ratio for uk catchments is 6 9 for the dataset containing subsurface specific sediment yields n 67 catchments median total sediment yield was 23 5 t km 2 yr 1 while the median yields for subsurface and surface sources were 4 29 t km 2 yr 1 and 14 7 t km 2 yr 1 respectively fig 7 the trend of sediment yield from subsurface and surface sources for the uk catchments is similar to the worldwide catchments 3 4 relationship between riverbank sediment load and catchment size one of our key findings is that the duration of riverbank erosion seems to be extended at downstream sites due to tightly linked and simultaneously occurring bank erosion mechanisms that display unique yet overlapping of spatial and temporal dynamics an obvious shift can be seen from surface upland erosion to riverbank channel erosion as catchment size increases fig 8 the relationship of riverbank and surface sediment loads with catchment size shows a significant impact by catchment size both the worldwide and uk datasets show the same considerable shift from surface to riverbank sources highlighting the general nature of this apportionment pattern much of the sediments that erode from surface sources e g arable land grassland forest construction sites and unpaved roads are deposited along river networks and finally at the catchment s downstream sites this pattern serves to decrease the amount of erosion from surface sources as catchment size grows as the latter is associated with larger surface areas for deposition consequently the relative contribution of riverbank sediments climbs 4 discussion the use of elemental geochemistry predominates compared to fallout radionuclides which is currently decreasing the utilization of compound specific stable isotopes has increased over the last decade collins et al 2020 the use of geochemical properties is encouraging in small catchments with homogeneous geology torres astorga et al 2018 geochemical properties also give a unique insights into preferential trapping of sediments in impounding fine silt relative to clay which cannot be estimated by monitoring loads alone until detailed size fractions are available furuichi et al 2016 these properties are most widely used for sediment source tracing due to high discrimination power and to apportion the fine grained sediment sources malhotra et al 2018 if discrimination power of geochemical tracers is high they have the great advantage over radionuclides that a significantly larger number of samples can be analyzed with comparable effort the most common radionuclide tracer appears to be 137cs 97 of usage and it yields very similar results to other radionuclide tracers the outcomes using a different set of tracers often combined give a high possibility of sediment source discrimination however using radionuclides with other tracers shows more consistent relative sources contribution compared to tracers without radionuclide tracers fig 4 therefore these findings show that radionuclide tracers are highly recommended in combination with other set of fingerprinting tracers instead of using them alone the applicability of 137cs is limited due to low proportions of fallout received in areas between 0 and 20 n and 0 20 s the second main challenge using this tracer is the ongoing decay to a concentration of undetectable stage for that reason other tracers may also be included evrard et al 2020 it is recommended to test the applicability of different tracers before investigating the relevance of sediment source fingerprinting for estimating sources contribution at the catchment scale sediment source fingerprinting makes simple distinctions between hillslopes i e sheet and rill erosion and subsurfaces fig 5 there is also a statistical tool which uses a logistic regression methodology developed on a set of independent local variables can be used as one technique to identify the potential eroded areas in a river section varouchakis et al 2016 surface sediments come from diverse forms of land use and subsurface sediments come from the banks of water channels russell et al 2001 slattery et al 1995 catchments with high levels of agricultural land use 74 will display dramatic riverbank erosion because the banks are nearly vertical and devoid of vegetation massoudieh et al 2013 research in a region of mongolia with a dry continental climate found that the sediment contribution of riverbanks was 74 5 and could vary markedly when discharge was high underscoring the protective function of riparian zones theuring et al 2013 indeed in two contrasting catchments steep actively eroding riverbanks made contributions of 40 55 whereas stable vegetated riverbanks made contributions of 1 41 a difference that is important to understanding sediment dynamics walling et al 2008 a study of several catchments in australia found that channel erosion was more significant than hillslope erosion wasson et al 1998 contributing more than surface sources hancock et al 2014 wilkinson et al 2013 and an investigating study in africa also shows that the subsurface source is more important than surface sources manjoro et al 2017 in burkina faso subsurface sources predominantly riverbanks were observed to make unexpectedly high contributions to total sediment loads estimated at 45 and 43 using radionuclides and geochemistry tracers respectively rode et al 2018 a key explanation for this result appears to be the scarcity of riparian vegetation and the lower susceptibility of tropical soils to upland erosion rode et al 2018 the catchments in oklahoma and mississippi wilson et al 2008 and shades creek alabama simon et al 2004 contribute higher surbsurface than surface sources due to low slopes having more chances of deposition accelerated soil erosion can cause soil fertility problems and severe impacts on the environment the selected catchments from the uk subset for which upland erosion rates total sediment yields and subsurface sediment yields were available n 44 are predominantly agriculture and had a mean upland erosion rate of 183 t km 2 yr 1 fig 6 this is very close to the mean arable value of about 127 t km 2 yr 1 in the uk benaud et al 2020 but higher than the suggested tolerable erosion rate in the uk the uk specific tolerable rate of erosion is 100 t km 2 yr 1 with 16 of the arable land exceeding the suggested tolerable range of upland erosion rate the median upland erosion rate from the dataset is lower than the median values given by the soil survey of england and wales ssew which ranges from 30 to 220 t km 2 yr 1 for arable lands evans 1988 and significantly lower than the median value of 520 t km 2 yr 1 for arable land estimated by national 137cs derived survey walling 2008 the sdr ranges from 0 1 to 54 fig 6 there is also a wide range of sediment delivery ratios for cultivated fields at pang and lambourn 68 and 34 respectively but if the total catchment area including all land use classes is considered the overall mean sediment delivery ratio for both catchments is only 1 walling et al 2006 the sdr seems to increase with increasing share from subsurface sources the regression of this relationship was low but significant with r2 0 2 p 0 01 the sediment delivery ratio was significantly higher for the share of catchments n 18 showing a subsurface share of sediment loss higher than 20 compared with the catchments n 23 showing a subsurface share of sediment load of less than 20 we explain this finding with the lower possibility of sediments to deposition if they stem from riverbanks we think that we were only able to determine this weak relationship because many other factors also affect the sediment delivery ratio rivers having less sediment from surface sources increases their capacity to erode more sediment from riverbanks pulley and foster 2017 additionally the transit time for sediment from most surface sources increases with catchment size the latter serves to lower sediment carrying by runoff because it generates more opportunities for sediment to settle down slope might also be a factor in reducing upland erosion with increasing catchment size and could increase the relative contributions of riverbank source caused by mechanisms such as mass failure fluvial erosion and weathering processes the above mentioned shift from surface sources to riverbank source with increasing catchment size fig 8 is shaped by many controlling factors and processes that often occur in combination at downstream sites as highlighted by the range of relative contributions the complex interaction between erosion and deposition affects sediment dynamics associated with riverbanks and surface sources this may impact the balance of contributions from surfaces versus riverbanks to total catchment loads it is important to note that the data used in this study came from catchments below a certain size most were smaller than 3000 kmÂ² hence our findings cannot be extrapolated to larger catchments however the research conducted by lawler et al 1999 on a 3300 kmÂ² catchment suggests that the degree of riverbank erosion might not continuously rise with increasing catchment size thus further studies are needed to explore this question the downstream variability of riverbank sediment sources along a single river system often depends on many factors besides catchment size although this may not be the general recommendation further investigations are needed to see the general trend with specific focus on a single river downstream changes of riverbank source of sediment 5 conclusions our findings highlight the usefulness of different yet oft combined fingerprinting tracers to more accurately distinguish sediment sources elemental geochemistry is the most commonly used approach and is applied either individually or in combination with other tracers the fingerprinting tracers including radionuclides show more consistent relative sediment sources contribution than those without radionuclides therefore the use of radionuclides would be the best option to get outcomes with higher sources discrimination although the use of 137cs is or will become limited due to decay life fingerprinting used in catchments worldwide has revealed that relative sediment contributions tend to be higher from surface sources than riverbanks although these contributions also display a high degree of variability in general our results provide some preliminary information about sediment source dynamics which can be used to estimate sediment delivery ratios here we reviewed available fingerprinting data on erosion from subsurfaces primarily riverbanks and gullies and surfaces hillslopes these data were obtained in various studies employing a range of tracers carried out across the globe the contributions of these sources to the total sediment load within catchments are affected by complex interactions between soil erosion and deposition across the range from headwater streams to larger rivers results showed a shift in sediment contributions from surface sources to riverbanks with increasing catchment size further studies are needed to develop more specific recommendations for single river systems researchers have been paying more and more attention to riverbank erosion rates and mechanisms in recent years this trend has been driven by i an increased understanding of the importance of riverbank sediments in fluvial transport dynamics ii greater use of fingerprinting to study sediment yields soil erosion and soil deposition dynamics iii a rise in channel stabilization studies and iv advances in monitoring techniques it is essential to obtain reliable data on the delivery and transport of sediment in streams and rivers especially soil loss is increasingly recognized as a massive worldwide challenge when managing food security reservoir siltation and ecosystem services fingerprinting can serve this purpose as it helps quantify sediment contributions from different sources providing valuable information that can inform the implementation of efficient management strategies that seek to reduce soil erosion reservoir siltation and ecosystem degradation at the catchment scale ultimately integrated management plans comprising adapted measures for mitigating riverbank erosion could lead to stable flow regimes within catchments and a diminished risk of riverbank collapse they could also yield more sustainable solutions for dealing with riverbank erosion general soil erosion and floods 6 outlook and recommendations it is essential to separate sediment contributions from riverbanks subsurface and surface sources when interpreting the results it is crucial to have information about the study site and catchment characteristics including land use precipitation runoff suspended sediment loads and research design e g number of sources and sediment samples particle size distribution to provide a clear picture of the catchment sediment budget it is essential to know upland erosion rates which can be used to calculate sediment delivery ratios also needed is long term monitoring of turbidity and sediment loads at typical gauge stations reflecting different controlling factors so that variability and distribution patterns can be examined in the context of catchment size and characteristics since most fingerprinting research has taken place in the uk efforts should be made to expand this

7724,study region in this study we compiled and analyzed the results of previous sediment fingerprinting research that examined the riverbank as one of the sediment sources representing 118 catchments across the globe most of which were located in the uk n 84 the usa n 14 and brazil n 10 gathered studies included catchments ranging from 0 31 to 15 000 km2 and which were predominately agricultural study focus it is essential to understand how riverbanks contribute to total sediment load at the catchment scale if we wish to develop better strategies for managing soil loss therefore the main objective of this study was to assess different fingerprinting tracers quantitatively and analyze the influence of catchment size on riverbank erosion new hydrological insights we found that radionuclide tracers show the most consistent relative sources contributions the share of riverbanks to total sediment loss was in the range of 1 25 at the same time the relative contributions of riverbanks and surface sources for many catchments exceeded 25 and 90 respectively this variability emphasizes the number of factors affecting riverbank erosion however despite this there was a clear shift in contributions from surface sources to riverbanks with increasing catchment size we suggest that in nested catchments there is a need for long term longitudinal monitoring of sediment loads including downstream changes of riverbank erosion graphical abstract ga1 keywords sediment load catchment size sediment fingerprinting riverbank erosion subsurface erosion surface erosion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riverbank erosion is the product of basal erosion resulting from fluvial hydraulics and bank collapse caused by geotechnical variability duan 2005 the erosion rate depends on several factors the cohesion of riverbank materials riverbank geometry hydraulics and the frequency of riverbank failure duan 2005 riverbank erosion and riverbed aggradation increase with bed erodibility and near bank flow velocities which are influenced by non cohesive materials in the winter ice and freezing frequently facilitate the smooth removal of material layers when the river level subsequently rises lawler 1986 riverbank erosion generally occurs after rather than during flood peaks when maximum velocity flows are directed away from the riverbank s outer face the increasing discharge reduces shear stress along the sidewall causing fluvial soil loss riverbank erosion is also promoted by pore and hydrostatic water pressures acting between river rising and drawdown during multipeaked events rinaldi et al 2008 in addition to the basal erosion caused by fluvial hydraulics eroded sediments come from other subsurface sources including ditches gullies and troughs associated with steep farm tracks as well as incised track cuttings into the subsoil previous studies have shown that riverbank erosion has been insufficiently considered and underestimated due to a lack of information which may result in inefficient decisions on remedial actions however the proportions of topsoil and subsoil delivered to and through a channel system vary substantially depending on a range of controls including watershed size and topography climate and hydrology land use e g tilling grazing and forestry and the degree of lateral and longitudinal connectivity in the system fryirs et al 2007 koiter et al 2013 wethered et al 2015 recent studies in temperate regions suggest that subsurface erosion mostly from riverbanks can contribute significant proportions of suspended sediment loads and associated nutrient losses riverbanks sediment supply has been set up to be a major constituent in many catchments with frequently over 50 of the sediment output belmont et al 2011 fox et al 2016 schottler et al 2014 theuring et al 2013 researchers have been more focused on riverbank erosion because they found a shift of the dominant source of sediment from agricultural soil erosion to accelerated erosion of riverbanks driven by increased river discharge rode et al 2018 riverbank erosion contributes sediment to rivers and plays an integral role in water quality river ecology and geomorphological processes florsheim et al 2008 within catchments sediment sinks and stored sediment are important to river habitats still they can also act as ecological stressors because they may contain detrimental substances such as agricultural inputs heavy metals and pesticides kronvang et al 2013 in addition headwater systems are key sediment sources and deliver sediments to downstream reaches gomi et al 2002 the large share of sediment from riverbank erosion affects ecosystems by changing water quality through adsorbed contaminants in fine sediment furthermore sediment sinks e g reservoirs impoundments and ponds can accumulate contaminants which also cause ecological problems for instance overbank sedimentation on floodplains can be a significant phosphorus source walling 1999 the river floodplains are important sinks for accumulation of sediment and associated contaminants mobilized from the catchment upstream consequently sediment erosion can be seen as a significant pollutant that affects infrastructures e g reservoirs and degrades marine ecosystems worldwide liu et al 2017 finally the input of fine sediment often exceeds transport capacity causing problems like streambed clogging which in turn results in reduced hydraulic connectivity and increased ecological degradation hartwig et al 2016 kondolf et al 2006 there are many concerns with traditional approaches for quantifying suspended sediment contributions from surface and subsurface sources these approaches include measuring soil erosion rates using erosion pins and troughs and estimating sediment loads peart and walling 1986 sediment source fingerprinting is increasingly being used as an alternative collins et al 1998b fingerprinting methods have substantial advantages over conventional methods which require on site monitoring of sediment sources owens et al 2016 the sediment source fingerprinting method was first developed by klages and hsieh 1975 and this approach uses a variety of fingerprint tracers e g radionuclides gellis et al 2017 rode et al 2018 geochemical rode et al 2018 spectral brosinsky et al 2014a 2014b environmental dna evrard et al 2019 and compound specific stable isotopes gibbs 2008 upadhayay et al 2020 the successful applicability of the fingerprinting method concerns the choice of different tracers the tracers must differentiate the sediment sources and be conservative during transportation from the source to the downstream sediment sample collins et al 2017 these tracers provide helpful information about sediment sources however compound specific stable isotopes of fatty acids have also been used successfully to discriminate specific crop types of sediment sources blake et al 2012 there is also a recommendation to compare different groups of tracers to identify sediment sources owens et al 2016 however the radionuclide tracers help to disentangle surface and subsurface sources because they are not affected by soil type walling and woodward 1992 however it lacks the quantitative assessment of various sets of fingerprinting properties that need to be addressed to improve the discrimination power of the tracers riverbank erosion is a significant contributor to total sediment loss within catchments source apportionment analysis walling and collins 2005 has indicated that this contribution is around 5 15 on average but can exceed 40 in some catchments another study suggested this percentage could climb as high as 50 duijsings 1987 however these studies were conducted at regional scales and did not account for catchment size only work by lawler et al 1999 has revealed an apparent downstream change in riverbank erosion this finding emerged from research exploring a combination of riverbank erosion mechanisms i e mass failure fluvial erosion and weathering processes these results are the first to signal that the contribution of riverbank erosion to total sediment loss could increase with the catchment area however the relationship between catchment size and the contributions of subsurface and surface sources remains uncharacterized sediment loss from riverbanks and upland areas is shaped by complex interactions between soil erosion and deposition affecting the relative contributions in this study we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that the sediment contribution of riverbanks relative to upland areas increases with increasing catchment size first we compiled and assimilated the results of past studies on fingerprinting research that has explored the contributions of subsurface and surface sources to total sediment loss at the catchment level second the descriptive power of the selected fingerprinting tracers was analyzed third we examined the relationship between catchment size and the relative contributions of riverbank and surface sources to total sediment loss this study describes sediment source fingerprinting section 2 and discusses the results of the gathered global dataset on soil erosion sourcing at the catchment scale sections 3 and 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment source fingerprinting over recent years researchers have greatly expanded their use of fingerprinting to identify sediment sources at the catchment scale fig 1 it is essential to utilize benchmarks tied to the properties of the fingerprinting approach until clear recommendations are established in the international literature in addition to having a high level of discrimination tracers must behave consistently given that they are often evaluated using different statistical tests e g variability ratio range test kruskal wallis test discriminant function analysis and principal component analysis the sediment source fingerprinting approach was first used in the 1970 s by klages and hsieh 1975 who developed a method based on mineralogy and geochemistry e g grain size characterization wall and wilding 1976 also utilized this approach later an assessment of the magnetic properties of sediments was included walling et al 1979 since then there has been a rapid increase in the number of studies employing fingerprinting to identify sediment sources collins et al 2020 owens et al 2016 sediment source fingerprinting was developed to directly determine the sources of primary suspended sediments and their relative contributions to total sediment load within catchments walling and woodward 1995 more recently managers are turning to this method as well collins et al 2017 the managers planning for soil erosion and degradation mitigation measures include multiple stakeholders and decision makers comprising water and landscape authorities reservoir managers water practitioners and farmers the number of studies using sediment source fingerprinting is increasing since more than two decades fig 1 with most research taking place in the uk sediment source fingerprinting is one technique for determining the origin of fine sediments carter et al 2003 collins et al 1997 gellis et al 2019 gruszowski et al 2003 walling et al 2008 walling and woodward 1995 it works best when long term data on sediment dynamics are available notably from bank erosion assessments sediment budgets and other sources devereux et al 2010 sediment source fingerprinting results will also change if sediment dynamics vary over time consequently long term information on sediment sources or temporal variation is valid when evaluating catchment management strategies this approach is quite sensitive to rainfall and the duration of the preceding dry periods as demonstrated by the marked variation in sediment source apportionment among rainfall events and across entire periods in addition the relative uncertainty associated with identifying sources decreases as the tracer number increases poleto et al 2009 a schematic description of the method is provided below fig 2 sediment source fingerprinting offers many advantages over conventional methods and has become the most common direct approach for quantifying sediment contributions at the catchment scale owens et al 2016 2 1 1 tracers in sediment source fingerprinting valuable tracers include fallout radionuclides walling and woodward 1992 mineral magnetism slattery et al 1995 uber et al 2019 spectrocolorimetry uber et al 2019 compound specific stable isotopes reiffarth et al 2019 spectral fingerprinting brosinsky et al 2014a 2014b environmental dna evrard et al 2019 and the effective use of geochemical fingerprints in the case of spatial sediment sources theuring et al 2015 there are also newly introduced tracers for sediment fingerprinting e g the applicability of phytoliths as a quantitative process tracer kraushaar et al 2021 and color based tracing pulley and collins 2022 further detailed descriptions of conservativeness of tracers and their selection can be found in collins et al 2020 when disentangling surface and subsurface sediment sources fallout radionuclides are useful fingerprints since they are unaffected by soil type or lithology allowing them to be used in heterogeneous catchments where other fingerprints may be of limited use walling and woodward 1992 source apportionment among riverbanks agricultural areas forests and roads can be carried out using elemental profiles either with or without 13c and 15n isotopes given that the results seem to remain largely consistent stewart et al 2015 the widespread use of sediment source fingerprinting has been limited because of the cost and effort involved in preparing samples for radionuclide and elemental geochemistry analyses however spectral fingerprints can be used as a rapid and cost effective alternative brosinsky et al 2014b it has been determined that mid infrared mir spectroscopy is fast inexpensive and non destructive when the objective is to identify sediment sources in rural catchments with a view to developing targeted mitigation strategies tiecher et al 2017a mineralogical characteristics goethite and kaolinite content have yielded easy to discriminate results and could be used as fingerprints in research seeking to determine the major sediment contributors in river channels miguel et al 2014 however any physical or chemical tracers must be environmentally stable that is they must not change over the course of transport within the catchment fallout radionuclides geochemical elements and organic matter properties are the most commonly used tracers in conventional methods including the mir spectroscopy based technique a combination of conventional and alternative tracers can be used to improve sediment source apportionment and obtain the best model results collins and walling 2002 2 1 2 mixing model the main objective of the mixing model is to compute the proportional contributions of all sources to suspended sediment loads at the catchment scale which is achieved by minimizing error during this process the following two conditions must be respected 1 contributions must have a value between 0 and 1 2 the sum of all the contributions must equal 1 apportionment results from the sediment mixture combinations that have the highest goodness of fit gof based on the sum of squares of relative error lizaga et al 2020 1 g of 1 1 n i 1 n b i j 1 m Ï j a i j Î´ i where gof is the goodness of fit Î´ i is the value range of tracer i normalized Î± i j is the value of tracer i in sediment source j b i is the value of tracer i in the sediment Ï j is the unknown relative contribution from sediment source j n is the number of tracers used and m is the number of sediment sources used mixing models are computationally challenging to use and thus normally require a fair amount of expertise and familiarity with specific statistical programs free user friendly software r package fingerpro has been developed for users with limited to no experience with sediment source fingerprinting and r lizaga et al 2020 in recent years the programs isosource phillips and gregg 2003 and mixsir moore and semmens 2008 were created for ecological applications other open source software sediment fingerprinting tool or sift has been developed using the r programming language pulley and collins 2018 and is structured to better guide end users in applying the fingerprinting approach collins et al 2017 like sift sed sat sediment source assessment tool gorman sanisaca et al 2017 was created with methodological fundamentals in mind 2 1 3 sediment budget calculation using sediment source fingerprinting sediment budgets generally contain sediment contributions from three primary sources hillslopes gullies and riverbanks which can be quantified by sediment source fingerprinting sediment budgets provide a valuable framework for understanding sediment behavior and fate at large scales and can thus inform management strategies walling and collins 2008 they yield information about sediment mobilization transfer and storage at the catchment scale and reveal the extent of erosion and deposition rates the integrated approach to developing sediment budgets is based on monitoring sediment yield sediment source fingerprinting and using radionuclides to estimate soil erosion and deposition the sediment budget of a catchment consists of three main components first sediment load which corresponds to net erosion in the catchment can be quantified using suspended sediment measurements and turbidity sensors second gross erosion within the catchment can be determined using for example the rusle model or radionuclide tracers third sediment source fingerprinting is used to calculate the fraction of each sediment source a detailed descriptions of these three approach s procedures and data collection are given applied and tested in one study catchment of the upper kaleya catchment in southern zambia walling et al 2001 thus only a brief summary is provided here sediment budgets can be used to calculate valuable metrics like the sediment delivery ratio sdr which expresses the relationship between total erosion and quantities of exported sediments within catchments even if the sdr has certain limitations it can be beneficial walling 1983 for example sdr is inversely related to catchment area and ranges from around 100 in tiny basins 0 1 km2 to less than 10 in larger basins 100 1000 km2 porto et al 2011 sediment budgets can also help to understand the geomorphological development of catchments duijsings 1987 and define water quality targets and land use practices cogle et al 2006 2 2 catchment data analysis 2 2 1 catchment fingerprinting data in this study a sediment source fingerprinting dataset has been gathered and analyzed to explore the contributions of the subsurface e g riverbanks and surface sources to total sediment loss considering studies on 118 catchments across the globe fig 3 a summary of the dataset is given in table 1 while a detailed description is reported in supplementary materials tables s1 and s2 these catchments are located in the uk n 84 usa n 14 brazil n 10 iran n 4 zambia n 1 burkina faso n 1 mongolia n 1 spain n 2 and australia n 1 they range in size from 0 31 to 15 000 km2 and are mainly subject to agricultural usage clearly such research has primarily taken place in the uk 72 of the catchments it has largely been performed by desmond walling university of exeter and researchers coming out of his lab the share of riverbank sediments in the total sediment load was determined from previous studies globally table 1 and fig 3 the identity of the tracers used often in combination was noted catchment elevation was determined using an elevation finder tool and information from the gauge stations located at catchment outlets 2 2 2 calculating upland erosion rates data on water mediated soil erosion are available at the european scale at a resolution level of 100 m calculated using high resolution input datafiles in a modified version of the revised universal soil loss equation rusle panagos et al 2015 this high resolution soil erosion data was used to calculate mean upland erosion rates for individual catchments in the uk first catchment boundaries and related shapefiles were defined using arcmap before extracting upland erosion rates of selected catchments shapefile data were available for 40 uk catchments and were downloaded from the national river flow archive for another 30 uk catchments catchment boundary shapefiles were produced using shuttle radar topography mission srtm global data the arc hydro tools in arcmap were used to delineate catchments automatically using step by step procedures that deploy a set of hydrology tools in sequence shapefiles were produced according to this delineation finally the upland erosion rates of all catchments were extracted using downloaded shapefiles from national river flow archive and the shapefiles produced by delineation of catchments tables s1 and s2 with geoprocessing tool in arcmap the calculated mean values of upland erosion rates were used to characterize surface erosion and sediment delivery for catchments in the uk 2 2 3 classification of dataset as noted above the dataset was heavily biased towards uk catchments consequently different data subsets were established within the dataset with a view to acquiring useful information and benchmarks that could help establish global recommendations the main sediment sources were surfaces i e cropland pastures grasslands urban areas forests and subsurface e g riverbanks ditches gullies troughs in steep farm tracks and incised track cuttings into the subsoil riverbanks were analyzed both as individual sediment sources and in combination with other subsurface sources the fingerprinting studies were mainly divided into two groups based on tracer type one subset from tables s1 and s2 contained studies using radionuclides and all other tracers elemental geochemistry mineral magnetism biogeochemical chemical weathering indices elemental ratios spectrocolorimetric properties and bulk isotopes n 69 catchments the second subset excluded the studies using radionuclides n 42 catchments fig 4 the dataset was also divided into two subsets based on the information regarding the sediment sources the subsurface source subset in general n 118 catchments tables s1 and s2 fig 5 and the riverbank source subset in particular n 78 catchments table s2 we also gathered the uk catchments n 44 from table s1 and s2 where upland erosion rates total sediment yields and subsurface sediment yields were available fig 6 to obtain a general trend of sediment delivery ratio however global recommendations should rely on broader data based on measured sediment load within the catchments the subsurface and riverbank source subsets were then further splitted the subsurface sediment load subset in general across the globe n 67 catchments from tables s1 and s2 fig 7 and the riverbank sediment load subset in particular n 46 catchments from table s2 fig 8 3 results 3 1 tracer use the fingerprinting properties that were used in the collected dataset include radionuclides elemental geochemistry biogeochemical mineral magnetism chemical weathering indices elemental ratios spectrocolorimetric properties and bulk isotopes these properties were selected separately and combined with two or more different sets of properties as composite properties depending on the availability cost and analysis testing of different soil and sediment tracers and the catchment characteristics only elemental geochemistry was utilized in 18 of the 118 catchments and mineral magnetism and radionuclides were the sole tracers used in 1 and 3 catchments respectively at all the other sites the full suite of tracers was employed often in combination the subsurface source contribution relative to surface sources was disentangled into two subsets based on types of tracer properties one subset was with radionuclide properties with other properties and one subset was non radionuclides tracers fig 4 frequently subsurface source apportionment was performed using elemental geochemistry exclusively or in combination with other tracer types 3 2 sediment contributions by surface sources and riverbanks the apportionment data for subsurfaces and surfaces demonstrate the relative roles played by different sources in total sediment loss within catchments table 1 fig 5 although the results ranged widely in the global dataset we generally observed relative contributions of 1 25 from subsurfaces and 75 99 from surface sources in the 78 catchments for which riverbank specific data were available it is clear that riverbanks contribute to a wide range of relative contributions to catchment sediment yield however it is essential to keep in mind that these general patterns do not explicitly account for catchment spatial distribution source type or amount of sediments however they do paint a preliminary picture of the dynamics of various world regions for example there were several catchments across the globe for which riverbank and surface contributions exceeded 25 and 90 respectively however the contribution of riverbanks alone tended to fall in the range of 3 25 and that of surface sources tended to occur in the range of 75 97 which suggests that these could be taken as general values the size of these ranges highlights that many direct and indirect factors may have an impact on the two above mentioned sources of erosion the median percent contribution of riverbanks to sediment yield in the catchment was 24 minimum 3 6 and maximum 93 6 while the median percent contribution of surfaces was 76 minimum 6 45 and maximum 96 4 n 78 catchments consequently on average surfaces made larger contributions than riverbanks to total sediment loads at the catchment scale that said for 18 catchments 23 of the subset riverbanks were larger sources 3 3 riverbank and upland erosion soil erosion is a serious threat to the health of river ecosystems data from the 44 uk catchments illustrate the relative differences in upland erosion rates total sediment yields surface yields and subsurface yields fig 6 for these catchments the median upland erosion rate was 165 t km 2 yr 1 minimum 55 t km 2 yr 1 and maximum 536 t km 2 yr 1 median total sediment yield subsurface surface sources was 16 t km 2 yr 1 minimum 0 27 t km 2 yr 1 and maximum 89 t km 2 yr 1 sediment budgets can be used to estimate the sediment delivery ratio walling and collins 2008 the median value of sediment delivery ratio for uk catchments is 6 9 for the dataset containing subsurface specific sediment yields n 67 catchments median total sediment yield was 23 5 t km 2 yr 1 while the median yields for subsurface and surface sources were 4 29 t km 2 yr 1 and 14 7 t km 2 yr 1 respectively fig 7 the trend of sediment yield from subsurface and surface sources for the uk catchments is similar to the worldwide catchments 3 4 relationship between riverbank sediment load and catchment size one of our key findings is that the duration of riverbank erosion seems to be extended at downstream sites due to tightly linked and simultaneously occurring bank erosion mechanisms that display unique yet overlapping of spatial and temporal dynamics an obvious shift can be seen from surface upland erosion to riverbank channel erosion as catchment size increases fig 8 the relationship of riverbank and surface sediment loads with catchment size shows a significant impact by catchment size both the worldwide and uk datasets show the same considerable shift from surface to riverbank sources highlighting the general nature of this apportionment pattern much of the sediments that erode from surface sources e g arable land grassland forest construction sites and unpaved roads are deposited along river networks and finally at the catchment s downstream sites this pattern serves to decrease the amount of erosion from surface sources as catchment size grows as the latter is associated with larger surface areas for deposition consequently the relative contribution of riverbank sediments climbs 4 discussion the use of elemental geochemistry predominates compared to fallout radionuclides which is currently decreasing the utilization of compound specific stable isotopes has increased over the last decade collins et al 2020 the use of geochemical properties is encouraging in small catchments with homogeneous geology torres astorga et al 2018 geochemical properties also give a unique insights into preferential trapping of sediments in impounding fine silt relative to clay which cannot be estimated by monitoring loads alone until detailed size fractions are available furuichi et al 2016 these properties are most widely used for sediment source tracing due to high discrimination power and to apportion the fine grained sediment sources malhotra et al 2018 if discrimination power of geochemical tracers is high they have the great advantage over radionuclides that a significantly larger number of samples can be analyzed with comparable effort the most common radionuclide tracer appears to be 137cs 97 of usage and it yields very similar results to other radionuclide tracers the outcomes using a different set of tracers often combined give a high possibility of sediment source discrimination however using radionuclides with other tracers shows more consistent relative sources contribution compared to tracers without radionuclide tracers fig 4 therefore these findings show that radionuclide tracers are highly recommended in combination with other set of fingerprinting tracers instead of using them alone the applicability of 137cs is limited due to low proportions of fallout received in areas between 0 and 20 n and 0 20 s the second main challenge using this tracer is the ongoing decay to a concentration of undetectable stage for that reason other tracers may also be included evrard et al 2020 it is recommended to test the applicability of different tracers before investigating the relevance of sediment source fingerprinting for estimating sources contribution at the catchment scale sediment source fingerprinting makes simple distinctions between hillslopes i e sheet and rill erosion and subsurfaces fig 5 there is also a statistical tool which uses a logistic regression methodology developed on a set of independent local variables can be used as one technique to identify the potential eroded areas in a river section varouchakis et al 2016 surface sediments come from diverse forms of land use and subsurface sediments come from the banks of water channels russell et al 2001 slattery et al 1995 catchments with high levels of agricultural land use 74 will display dramatic riverbank erosion because the banks are nearly vertical and devoid of vegetation massoudieh et al 2013 research in a region of mongolia with a dry continental climate found that the sediment contribution of riverbanks was 74 5 and could vary markedly when discharge was high underscoring the protective function of riparian zones theuring et al 2013 indeed in two contrasting catchments steep actively eroding riverbanks made contributions of 40 55 whereas stable vegetated riverbanks made contributions of 1 41 a difference that is important to understanding sediment dynamics walling et al 2008 a study of several catchments in australia found that channel erosion was more significant than hillslope erosion wasson et al 1998 contributing more than surface sources hancock et al 2014 wilkinson et al 2013 and an investigating study in africa also shows that the subsurface source is more important than surface sources manjoro et al 2017 in burkina faso subsurface sources predominantly riverbanks were observed to make unexpectedly high contributions to total sediment loads estimated at 45 and 43 using radionuclides and geochemistry tracers respectively rode et al 2018 a key explanation for this result appears to be the scarcity of riparian vegetation and the lower susceptibility of tropical soils to upland erosion rode et al 2018 the catchments in oklahoma and mississippi wilson et al 2008 and shades creek alabama simon et al 2004 contribute higher surbsurface than surface sources due to low slopes having more chances of deposition accelerated soil erosion can cause soil fertility problems and severe impacts on the environment the selected catchments from the uk subset for which upland erosion rates total sediment yields and subsurface sediment yields were available n 44 are predominantly agriculture and had a mean upland erosion rate of 183 t km 2 yr 1 fig 6 this is very close to the mean arable value of about 127 t km 2 yr 1 in the uk benaud et al 2020 but higher than the suggested tolerable erosion rate in the uk the uk specific tolerable rate of erosion is 100 t km 2 yr 1 with 16 of the arable land exceeding the suggested tolerable range of upland erosion rate the median upland erosion rate from the dataset is lower than the median values given by the soil survey of england and wales ssew which ranges from 30 to 220 t km 2 yr 1 for arable lands evans 1988 and significantly lower than the median value of 520 t km 2 yr 1 for arable land estimated by national 137cs derived survey walling 2008 the sdr ranges from 0 1 to 54 fig 6 there is also a wide range of sediment delivery ratios for cultivated fields at pang and lambourn 68 and 34 respectively but if the total catchment area including all land use classes is considered the overall mean sediment delivery ratio for both catchments is only 1 walling et al 2006 the sdr seems to increase with increasing share from subsurface sources the regression of this relationship was low but significant with r2 0 2 p 0 01 the sediment delivery ratio was significantly higher for the share of catchments n 18 showing a subsurface share of sediment loss higher than 20 compared with the catchments n 23 showing a subsurface share of sediment load of less than 20 we explain this finding with the lower possibility of sediments to deposition if they stem from riverbanks we think that we were only able to determine this weak relationship because many other factors also affect the sediment delivery ratio rivers having less sediment from surface sources increases their capacity to erode more sediment from riverbanks pulley and foster 2017 additionally the transit time for sediment from most surface sources increases with catchment size the latter serves to lower sediment carrying by runoff because it generates more opportunities for sediment to settle down slope might also be a factor in reducing upland erosion with increasing catchment size and could increase the relative contributions of riverbank source caused by mechanisms such as mass failure fluvial erosion and weathering processes the above mentioned shift from surface sources to riverbank source with increasing catchment size fig 8 is shaped by many controlling factors and processes that often occur in combination at downstream sites as highlighted by the range of relative contributions the complex interaction between erosion and deposition affects sediment dynamics associated with riverbanks and surface sources this may impact the balance of contributions from surfaces versus riverbanks to total catchment loads it is important to note that the data used in this study came from catchments below a certain size most were smaller than 3000 kmÂ² hence our findings cannot be extrapolated to larger catchments however the research conducted by lawler et al 1999 on a 3300 kmÂ² catchment suggests that the degree of riverbank erosion might not continuously rise with increasing catchment size thus further studies are needed to explore this question the downstream variability of riverbank sediment sources along a single river system often depends on many factors besides catchment size although this may not be the general recommendation further investigations are needed to see the general trend with specific focus on a single river downstream changes of riverbank source of sediment 5 conclusions our findings highlight the usefulness of different yet oft combined fingerprinting tracers to more accurately distinguish sediment sources elemental geochemistry is the most commonly used approach and is applied either individually or in combination with other tracers the fingerprinting tracers including radionuclides show more consistent relative sediment sources contribution than those without radionuclides therefore the use of radionuclides would be the best option to get outcomes with higher sources discrimination although the use of 137cs is or will become limited due to decay life fingerprinting used in catchments worldwide has revealed that relative sediment contributions tend to be higher from surface sources than riverbanks although these contributions also display a high degree of variability in general our results provide some preliminary information about sediment source dynamics which can be used to estimate sediment delivery ratios here we reviewed available fingerprinting data on erosion from subsurfaces primarily riverbanks and gullies and surfaces hillslopes these data were obtained in various studies employing a range of tracers carried out across the globe the contributions of these sources to the total sediment load within catchments are affected by complex interactions between soil erosion and deposition across the range from headwater streams to larger rivers results showed a shift in sediment contributions from surface sources to riverbanks with increasing catchment size further studies are needed to develop more specific recommendations for single river systems researchers have been paying more and more attention to riverbank erosion rates and mechanisms in recent years this trend has been driven by i an increased understanding of the importance of riverbank sediments in fluvial transport dynamics ii greater use of fingerprinting to study sediment yields soil erosion and soil deposition dynamics iii a rise in channel stabilization studies and iv advances in monitoring techniques it is essential to obtain reliable data on the delivery and transport of sediment in streams and rivers especially soil loss is increasingly recognized as a massive worldwide challenge when managing food security reservoir siltation and ecosystem services fingerprinting can serve this purpose as it helps quantify sediment contributions from different sources providing valuable information that can inform the implementation of efficient management strategies that seek to reduce soil erosion reservoir siltation and ecosystem degradation at the catchment scale ultimately integrated management plans comprising adapted measures for mitigating riverbank erosion could lead to stable flow regimes within catchments and a diminished risk of riverbank collapse they could also yield more sustainable solutions for dealing with riverbank erosion general soil erosion and floods 6 outlook and recommendations it is essential to separate sediment contributions from riverbanks subsurface and surface sources when interpreting the results it is crucial to have information about the study site and catchment characteristics including land use precipitation runoff suspended sediment loads and research design e g number of sources and sediment samples particle size distribution to provide a clear picture of the catchment sediment budget it is essential to know upland erosion rates which can be used to calculate sediment delivery ratios also needed is long term monitoring of turbidity and sediment loads at typical gauge stations reflecting different controlling factors so that variability and distribution patterns can be examined in the context of catchment size and characteristics since most fingerprinting research has taken place in the uk efforts should be made to expand this technique elsewhere and deploy inexpensive effective and user friendly tracers credit authorship contribution statement ghulam abbas conceptualization methodology data collection data analysis writing
