13820,produced water can be used as a source of potable water and valuable chemical components pure elements minerals the recovery and beneficial use of emulsified and dissolved hydrocarbons from these brines are not a priority oil removal methods focus on water decontamination without further management of recovered oil in this work biosorption combined with green demulsification is applied to recover paraffinic crude oil from artificial brine soapwort extract at a concentration of 0 5 g l destabilized oil water emulsion allowed 85 95 oil recovery adsorption beds made of sunflower pith were applied to remove dissolved hydrocarbons to enhance sorption capacity the plant material was impregnated with polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic nanosilica the oil removal kinetics on the modified pith followed a pseudo second order model the adsorption isotherm at 20 c was well described by the temkin model while the toth model provided the best fit to experimental data at 40 c the maximum sorption capacities in a two phase oil water system were 3 544 g g and 4 187 g g for the hydrophobized and raw pith respectively the pith filter performed well a maximum oil reduction of 73 in effluent was achieved at 10 cm bed height and 15 ml min flow rate sorbent regeneration studies show that residual oil from spent material can be easily drained and the recovery ratio is up to 68 both bioprocesses biodemulsification and biosorption are effective technologies that can be used to separate oil from oily water keywords produced water biodemulsification biosorption oil recovery filtration 1 introduction oily reservoir brine brought to the surface with oil and gas has long been treated as a waste product the management of this stream included surface discharge and reinjection into disposal wells both these options require advanced and expensive water treatment to obtain good quality water nearly 30 of the energy accumulated in the produced oil or natural gas is expended to reinject the produced water back into the formation 1 oil and gas companies cover the costs of treatment and utilization of these waters without any additional profits the produced water may be re injected into the same formation from where it was obtained to maintain the reservoir pressure and recover of additional oil due to the improved oil recovery the cost of water reinjection is partially paid back in some cases the reservoir brine is discharged directly into the environment or transported to the discharge wells at adjacent non oil bearing formations in all options water needs to be purified to meet environmental regulations and eliminate injectivity decline the cost of such procedure varies from 0 70 to 4 00 2 furtado et al 3 showed the superiority of reinjection over the unproductive discharge based on the example of petrobras fields until 2003 petrobras used to discharge all produced water from its offshore fields in the sea at least 20 km away from the coast according to brazilian environmental regulations oil content in the discharged water should be lower than 20 mg l which means the necessity of deep water purification this limit has no application in the case of its reinjection into the formation the quality requirement of reinjected water depends mainly on formation properties permeability reservoir pressure and each company has its own experience and guidelines in this regard since then pargo and carapeba fields are reinjecting all produced water with success and other fields are planning to follow this path in the us alone up to 98 of produced water is reinjected and only half of it is used to maintain formation pressure and increase recovery of hydrocarbons 4 recently the perception of this stream is changing due to overall water demand it is now considered as an asset a marketable product produced water may be used as a source of both potable water and valuable chemical components in this section some issues related to the recovery of different components will be discussed the concept of recovering dissolved compounds from produced water is not new in 1927 the dow chemical company started to produce iodine from oilfield brine in louisiana 5 commercial recovery of bromine started in 1956 from the smackover formation in the catesville field as a method for extraction of valuable elements from oilfield brines the brine refinery concept was proposed for the first time in 1966 by collins 6 the extraction of rare earth elements and other critical metals na ca k sr mg br ba fe i b mn li has been described in the literature 7 9 grimaldi et al 10 showed that even such a common ingredient as nacl can be useful in the production of soda ash sodium carbonate mavukkandy et al 11 summarized the most common technologies used to recover resources from brine precipitation ion exchange solvent extraction membrane distillation pressure retarded osmosis electrodialysis and adsorption the main conclusion from this review is that some of these methods are expensive and need further improvements but impressive progress has been made in this area there are numerous research papers on the chemical composition of selected brines and the general market conditions specific to elements that occur naturally in reservoir brines 12 13 14 15 the recovery of elements from produced water offers environmental benefits and may partially offset treatment costs of wastewater from oil and gas fields the scarcity of freshwater especially constraints on the supply of freshwater for hydraulic fracturing has attracted public attention to the recovery of a potable water from produced brine the reuse of internal water in oil and gas operations has been practiced for many years ribeiro et al 16 described the properties of water based drilling fluids prepared using wastewater from the brazilian urucu oilfield the marathon oil company demonstrated the beneficial use of produced water for drilling operations in the indian basin field which is located in eddy county new mexico 17 flowback waters from hydraulic fracturing are also more frequently reused in some fields such as marcellus shale usa and changning gas field china 18 where up to 90 of produced flowback is recycled for production intensification produced water may be considered a new source of fresh water for areas in which water is scarce beneficial uses of this stream include crop irrigation livestock consumption aquaculture and hydroponic vegetable culture and industrial processes however as scanlon et al 19 showed the current lack of appropriate regulations and technologies preclude these beneficial uses outside the energy sector of all the components available in formation brine the recovery of hydrocarbons is poorly described there are several different methods of oil removal but the separated oil is often wasted dissolved air flotation combined with flocculation is often applied to separate oil water emulsions gas flotation allows to remove particles as small as 25 μm but it cannot remove dissolved hydrocarbons from water the resulting froth is then added to oily sludge from gravity separators and disposed of as hazardous waste 20 in refineries this byproduct is incinerated in fluidized bed furnaces but the thermal efficiency of this process is poor due to the high water content in the feed gas flotation does not require chemical use and the estimated cost for flotation treatment is 0 60 m3 of produced water 21 some treatment methods assume chemical degradation of hydrocarbons present in water which precludes their further use during advanced chemical oxidation 22 23 and electrochemical 24 and photoelectrocatalytic 25 treatment hydrocarbons are oxidized to co2 and h2o without recovery of the energy stored in these compounds chemical oxidation is well established reliable and requires minimal equipment oxidants like chlorine chlorine dioxide permanganate oxygen and ozone are easy available no pretreatment is required but cost of chemicals may be high 26 the energy consumption and process time are major limitations for electrochemical methods of water treatment their advantages include low sludge production environmental compatibility need of simple equipment no use of chemical additives in the case of photocatalysis although relatively high removal efficiencies have been achieved the process has not yet been applied on an industrial scale similarly biological methods lead to complete decomposition of dissolved organics 27 28 biological methods are preferred due to advantages like simplicity and low cost but their efficiency is limited by water salinity and high oil content technologies for oil and gas produced water treatment are described in detail elsewhere 29 31 application of demulsifiers and filtration are non destructive treatment methods with the highest oil recovery potential yau et al 32 tested the efficiency of 37 demulsifiers cationic non ionic and anionic and found that sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate achieved up to 75 separation performance abdel azim et al 33 showed that sugar based green demulsifiers allow the complete separation of oil from water under favorable conditions similarly chitosan based nonionic surfactants achieve 100 water separation at 45 c 34 the cited works show that the application of biosurfactants is a suitable method of removing all emulsified oil from brine dissolved hydrocarbons may be removed from water into fixed bed adsorption columns raw and modified biomass have been shown to be an efficient sorbent for the removal of oil spills from surface water 35 37 dong et al 38 presented structure filters made of kapok fibers for oil recovery from wastewater this filtrating system demonstrated high sorption capacity 32 31 g of oil g of sorbent and its reusability was confirmed by centrifugation which recovered 80 91 of oil in general sorption filter fillers made from natural fibers are 42 98 efficient in removing oil compounds from water 39 40 41 42 oil recovery from spent adsorption materials depends on the structure of the sorbent and the method of regeneration beshkar et al 43 showed that porous materials like hydrophobic straw soot sponge can be effectively regenerated through a simple mechanical extrusion method when squeezing 44 or draining under vacuum 45 are applied the regenerated sorbents can be reused through several cycles liquid hydrocarbons can also be effectively recovered from spent biosorbent by thermal treatment rajan et al 46 described the conversion of oily fibers to bio oil through a hydrothermal liquefaction process the recovered oil is suitable for low quality fuel usage such as cement kilns and waste incinerators hossain et al 47 promoted the utilization of spent waste adsorbents for value added products such as biofuel soil amendment supplements and cementitious material the aim of this work is to describe the combination of biodemulsification and biosorption for the enhanced recovery of oil from produced water the specific objectives of this work are to investigate the applicability of saponaria officinalis extract as a demulsifier to destabilize oil water emulsion to study the static and dynamic conditions of oil sorption onto raw and modified sunflower pith to study the recovery of adsorbed oil from spent sorbent to evaluate total oil recovery when biodemulsification and biosorption are combined in previous research 48 raw sunflower pith was found to have good oil sorption capacity 12 67 g g and filters made of this material were shown to be suitable for oil water separation the disadvantage of this material is its low selectivity due to its hydrophilicity the pith absorbs water which makes it swell and disturbs the flow through the filters one method of modifying the surface properties of materials is the immobilization of controlled nanoparticles on the material surface in this study polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic nanosilica were used to improve the raw pith s sorption properties by making the surface hydrophobic and increasing the specific area of the sorbent the porous structure of pith allows the recovery of absorbed oil by a simple centrifugation method filter performance is enhanced by using demulsification as a pretreatment to avoid the introduction of new chemicals into water the natural extract from saponaria officinalis was used as green demulsifier for the first time the combination of these bioprocesses was applied the obtained results showed that this novel biotreatment is an effective and sustainable technology for the recovery of additional crude oil from produced water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sunflower stems after harvesting the seeds were cut and dried in the open air for 3 months the inner part of stem the so called pith was mechanically separated from the outer woody layer and ground with a blender to obtain the desired sample

flos mokrsko company for the surface coating a commercial nanosilica produced by plasmachem gmbh was used due to the specification provided by the manufacturer the nanopowder was modified with polydimethylsiloxane and had an average particle size of 14 nm a specific surface area of 100 m2 g bulk density of 0 05 g cm3 and purity 99 8 excluding stabilizers polydimethylsiloxane ethanol 99 8 gc

oil was obtained from polish oil and gas company pgnig sa characteristic properties of the oil are given in table 1 mineral oil standard mixture type a and b for en iso 9377 2 from sigma aldrich was used for gas chromatography calibration 2 2 preparation of hydrophobic pith spraying a hydrophobizing agent under pressure onto the substrate is a fast and efficient method of surface modification in this paper the wettability modifier was prepared by dissolving 10 g of polydimethylsiloxane in 100 ml of n pentane commercial nanosilica was dispersed in ethanol 10 g of nano sio2 per 100 ml and stirred for 30 min at room temperature sunflower fibers 10 g were first covered with 10 ml of pdms solution using a regular atomizer immediately followed by 25 ml of dispersed nano sio2 the resulting product was vigorously stirred and then dried for 6 h at 40 c 2 3 characterization of the raw and fabricated material the specific surface area of the particles was assessed by low temperature nitrogen adsorption measurements performed with an asap 2420 instrument micromeritics inc usa the volume size and distribution of the adsorbent pores was determined using the procedure developed by barret joyner and halenda bjh surface morphology was analyzed with an quanta feg 250 fei ltd brno czech republic scanning electron microscope using an acceleration voltage of 10 kv and magnification ranging from 200 to 30 000 the wettability of the surface was determined by water contact angle measurements using a dsa100 drop shape analysis system krüss germany 2 4 emulsion preparation and demulsification study the crude oil emulsion was prepared by mixing the nacl 3 wt brine with crude oil at a ratio of 1 2 v v using a homogenizer at 5000 rpm for 30 min in a soxhlet extractor 30 g of saponaria officinalis roots was extracted with distilled water for 2 h and the resulted extract was used as a green demulsifier the efficiency of the prepared agent was tested using the standard bottle test method the mixture of emulsion and demulsifier were poured into 30 ml graduated glass tubes and the oil water interface was observed for 24 h during demulsification study the oil water mixture without demulsifier was treated as a reference sample 2 5 sorption properties of pith 2 5 1 sorption equilibrium to determine adsorption isotherms portions 0 25 g of raw and modified pith were placed in 100 ml beakers containing different amounts of crude oil from 50 to 3000 mg at least 10 different concentrations displaced in 50 ml of water at room temperature sorption equilibrium was established after 24 h oily sorbents were removed from the beakers using sieve nets the sorption capacity of the pith qe g of oil g of sorbent was determined using the following equation 1 q e v c o c e m s where co is the initial oil concentration g l ce is the equilibrium oil concentration g l v is the volume of the solution l and ms is the mass of the adsorbent g the residual oil was extracted from the water with 20 ml of n pentane and the polar substances were removed in florisil na2so4 pre columns the concentration of oil in the purified aliquots was determined as the mineral oil index by means of gas chromatography gc according to en iso 9377 2 49 the calibration procedure and the validation method are described elsewhere 49 50 the equilibrium adsorption data was fitted by langmuir freundlich temkin khan and toth models the langmuir model assumes monolayer coverage on a homogeneous surface which can be expressed as the following equation 51 2 q e q l k l c e 1 k l c e where kl is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l g and ql is the maximum adsorption capacity g of oil g of adsorbent the freundlich isotherm allows to describe an adsorption processes that occur on heterogonous surfaces 52 the freundlich model is expressed as follows 3 q e k f c e 1 n where kf is the constant related to the sorption capacity of the adsorbent g g l g n and n is the constant indicative of the intensity of the adsorption the temkin isotherm model takes into account the adsorbate adsorbate interactions the equation is as follows 4 q e r t b t l n a t c e where at is the temkin isotherm constant l g t is the temperature k r is the gas constant j k mol and bt is the constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol the toth isotherm is an empirical modification of the langmuir equation suitable for describing heterogeneous adsorption systems in a wide range of adsorbate concentrations 53 the toth model is represented by the following equation 5 q e q t k t h c e 1 k t h c e v 1 v where qth is the maximum adsorption capacity g g kth is the toth adsorption constant l g ν is the parameter related to the surface heterogeneity the khan isotherm model is widely

the khan constant l g and nk is the khan model exponent the parameters of models were determined using the levenberg marquardt algorithm nonlinear regression rmse root mean square error and chi2 statistical criteria were applied to evaluate the fitness of model predictions to experimental results these criteria were calculated according to the equations 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q e e x p i q e c a l c i 2 8 c h i 2 i 1 n q e e x p i q e c a l c i 2 q e c a l c i where n is the data numbers and qe exp and qe calc are the experimental and simulated values respectively 2 5 2 sorption kinetics sorption kinetics was determined using batch adsorption techniques 1 g of sorbent was placed in a 250 ml beaker containing 50 g of a measuring liquid water or oil the measurement was carried out in static conditions after a specific time of contact from 1 min to 48 h the contents of the beaker were allowed to drip for 10 min on steel sieves 1 mm mesh after the excess liquid had drained completely the remainder was weighed the pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris equations were used to fit the experimental adsorption kinetics data the pseudo first order pfo equation can be expressed as 52 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe g g and qt g g are the amounts of adsorbate adsorbed at equilibrium and at any time t min respectively k1 1 min is the adsorption rate constant the pseudo second order pso kinetic model is given by following formula 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 g g min refers to the adsorption rate constant of pso model 48 the weber and morris model allows to identify the process being the rate determining step equation representing this model is expressed as 11 q t k 3 t 0 5 c i where k3 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant g g min0 5 and ci indicates the thickness of the boundary layer the plot of uptake qt versus the square root of time t0 5 should be linear and pass through the origin if intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling step the obtained parameters maximum sorption capacity and constant rate allow to compare the effectiveness of the tested sorbents and identify the sorption mechanism kinetic parameters and goodness of fit were calculated as previously in section 2 5 1 2 6 laboratory column experiments the feed emulsion with 1 g l of oil content prepared as previously was pumped through a filter column with an internal diameter of 2 2 cm closed at both ends with plugs secured with steel mesh for each filtration run a new portion of emulsion was prepared the filtrate from the bottom of the column was collected in 100 ml doses in glass vessels the oil concentration in the effluent was determined using the gc method the analyses were performed on a hewlett packard 5890 gc usa system with chemstation rev a 10 01 standard software the experimental setup for oily water filtration in a pith packed bed column is shown in fig 1 the modified pith was packed evenly into the column at the desired packing density of 0 118 g cm3 the effect of two operational parameters e g flow rate 10 15 and 30 ml min and column height 2 5 5 and 10 cm on filtrate quality was tested after each filtration run the spent adsorbent was regenerated by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm the separated mixture of water and oil was extracted with 50 ml of n pentane the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen flow and the residual oil was weighted to obtain the value of oil recovery for optimal filtration conditions flow rate of 15 ml min and bed height of 10 cm the biodemusification was applied as pretreatment 2 l of oil water emulsion 1 4 v v was destabilized using soapwort extract at the concentration of 0 5 g l and the resulted 1 l of separated water was subsequently pumped through the fixed bed adsorption column the oil concentration in water after biodemulsification and biosorption was measured as previously all sorption and filtration experiments were performed in triplicate and the average values were used for further calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 emulsion break up using soapwort extract fig 2 a shows the effect of demulsifier dosage on oil separation from the emulsion after 24 h the emulsion separation profiles at 25 and 40 c with and without demulsifier are shown in fig 2b the base case emulsion without any additives was found to be stable after 24 h oil creaming only occurred near the tube bottom and there was no free water sedimentation the oil separation increased at higher demulsifier concentrations maximum oil separation of approximately 95 was achieved at a demulsifier concentration of 0 5 g l a clear layer of water in this case appeared after 2 h and its volume increased with time increasing the demulsifier concentration from 0 5 to 1 g l accelerated the separation process but the overall demulsification effect remained the same saponins extracted from saponaria officinalis roots are water soluble so these compounds are able to adsorb on water droplets dispersed in the oil phase and in this way promote the interfacial surface drainage and enhance the coalescence of water droplets for any concentration of the used demulsifier the separation improved considerably with a temperature increase to 40 c at which complete water sedimentation occurred after 12 h the separated water phase was clear and contained no visible oil droplets therefore it was clear that all the emulsified hydrocarbons had been removed from the water 3 2 textural and morphological characterization of sorbents fig 3 shows the sem images of pristine and modified fibers under low and high magnification the surface of the untreated pith is clean and smooth cylindrical cells are arranged in a honeycomb like pattern which assures good mechanical stability of the material the surfaces of the modified pith are rougher than the original uncoated fiber the sio2 nanoparticles were unevenly deposited and formed a rough micro nanostructure which increased the surface area for oil sorption surface roughness enhances the adhesion of oil droplets to the fibers and further penetration of oil into the sorbent structure this unique bushy structure also prevents oil escaping from the fiber assembly the wettability of both sorbents was evaluated by examining the contact angle of a sessile drop of water on the specimens as shown in fig 4 a and b the raw pith is hydrophilic and the contact angle for water is 73 due to the numerous functional groups hydroxyl carboxylic etc present on the surface the functional groups present in sunflower pith were identified in the previous works 50 54 using infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of the raw pith show the occurrence of a broad band at 3400 cm 1 that can be ascribed to oh stretching absorption bands attributable to the asymmetric and symmetric ch stretching in methyl and methylene groups appear in the region between 2900 and 2850 cm 1 two absorption bands at approximately 1720 and 1620 cm 1 can be attributed to co stretching of carbonyl groups and cc bonds of the aromatic rings respectively for the modified pith a significant decrease of oh group band intensity in the range of 3600 3400 cm 1 was observed the modified material exhibits a water contact angle of 112 crude oil dropped on the surface of the prepared fiber was instantly absorbed which suggests it has superoleophilic properties due to the presence of air filled spaces the pith easily floats on the water consequently when used for spill removal it can be easily collected with a net or skimmer in a two phase oil water system hydrocarbons form the upper layer which naturally facilitates their contact with the sorbent fig 4c f show the behavior of raw and modified pith on the water surface the raw sorbent is very hydrophilic therefore the water can spontaneously imbibe into the pores and push the air out in the form of fine bubbles the modified pith is hydrophobic and oil droplets adhere to its surface more strongly than water which limits water sorption the results of n2 physical adsorption desorption isotherms were used to evaluate the textural properties of the sorbents adsorption isotherms for raw and modified fibers can be classified as type iv according to iupac classification both materials are mesoporous and have a sponge like structure the sorption mechanism depends on the size of the pores 55 the low pressure part of the adsorption isotherm can be used to characterize the microporous structure while the medium and high pressure adsorption data allow analysis of the meso and macroporous structure the parameters of the porous structure calculated according to bet theory are listed in table 2 the modified material shows a specific surface area that is almost three times larger than the unmodified pith this surface expanded due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles which leads to a greater number of active sorption centers and thus increases the capacity of the monolayer the specific surface area of the raw parenchyma is low in comparison to commercially used activated carbons or silica materials the obtained values are typical for plant fibers bartczak 56 reported that the specific surface area of peat sawdust and saw sedge was 1 40 1 17 and 0 61 m2 g respectively using the method developed by barrett joyner and halenda it is possible to determine the volume size and distribution of adsorbent pores the calculated pore volume fraction dv is plotted versus the pore diameters d in fig 5 visible maxima of different intensity in fig 5 mean that the pore size distribution is heterogeneous the sorbents contain meso and macropores which is advantageous for oil sorption i e hydrocarbons of different structures and dimensions 3 3 batch sorption experiments 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics study of sorption kinetics allow to determine the changes in the sorption capacity over time the effects of contact time on oil and water sorption in a single phase system only oil or only water onto raw and modified material are shown in fig 6 a the sorption capacity increases with time and this increase is quite intensive in the initial period after 24 h crude oil sorption reaches the equilibrium in the first stage the amount of adsorbed hydrocarbons is determined mainly by the specific surface area of the sorbent the maximum sorption capacity for crude oil is 17 76 and 19 62 g g for raw and surface coated sorbent respectively the study on water sorption on the sorbents provides an additional information about sorption preferences fig 6c confirms the previous findings regarding the wettability of both materials raw fibers are hydrophilic and absorb water intensively even up to 28 10 g g the hydrophobized material for contact time no longer than 3 h sorbed small amount of water extending the contact time resulted in increasing absorbency for water similar behavior was observed by yin and wang 57 for cellulose fibers coated with oxysilanes at room conditions after the fibers were prefabricated they showed the water contact angle of 139 8 but after 3 h of contacting with water this value dropped below 90 authors concluded that some unreacted hydroxyl groups under the coating can cause capillary rise of water with time parameters of kinetics models were calculated and listed in table 3 the results show a better fit of experimental data to the pseudo second order model eq 10 the chi2 values of the pseudo second order model are higher than those of the pseudo first order model eq 9 for both tested piths the adsorption rate constants k2 see eq 10 for the oil are higher than those for the water the oil adsorption occurs faster due to the hydrophobicity of pith surface sorption of water on the modified pith is hindered hence the k2 value for water is about 10 times lower than for oil analysis of the literature data indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model is more suitable for describing the sorption of oil onto plant fibers kinetic studies on oil spills recovery are summarized in table 4 sorption kinetics may be studied both in a single and two phase systems only oil or oil water mixture the value of the adsorption rate constant k2 strongly depends on sorbent structure and sorption conditions generally the k2 value for oil adsorption is lower in two phase system as the competitive sorption of water occurs sorbents with a highly porous structure and large specific surface area like aerogels exhibit a higher sorption capacity and sorption rate than rough and flat fibers rice husk orange peels the step limiting the rate of the whole process is diffusion either in the boundary layer or intraparticle diffusion this can be assessed by adapting experimental data to the weber morris model fig 6b and d for all tested materials and fluids curves fitted to the plot of qt vs t0 5 eq 11 do not pass through the origin meaning that intraparticle diffusion is not the only step that limits the rate of the process for crude oil sorption on raw pith three linearity ranges in the weber morris model can be distinguished at the beginning of the process diffusion in the film plays a major role as the boundary layer is the greatest obstacle to mass exchange due to its hydrophilic nature after crossing the boundary layer diffusion occurs first in the macropores step 2 and then in the micropores step 3 for hybrid material due to its low free surface energy i e high affinity to sorbate there is no barrier effect around the sorbent particles and adsorption occurs in two steps that is diffusion in macro and micropores respectively the last step where the curve is almost parallel to the x axis suggests that micropore diffusion only slightly increases the sorption capacity according to the weber morris model water sorption on the raw pith is a one step process due to the hydrophilicity of the sorbent and the small size of the sorbate molecules the process occurs intensively first on the surface of the sorbent then without any electrostatic or geometric obstacles the water molecules penetrate deep into the porous structure therefore sorption is not clearly divided into stages in the case of modified fibers in the first stage the resistance of the hydrophobic boundary layer is being overcome in the next stages the pores are filled depending on their size 3 3 2 equilibrium isotherms in order to determine the sorption mechanism selected adsorption equilibrium models were fitted to the equilibrium data an accurate mathematical description of the sorption equilibrium allows for the reliable prediction of adsorption parameters and quantitative comparison of different sorbents in this study langmuir eq 2 freundlich eq 3 toth eq 4 khan eq 6 and temkin eq 4 models were tested to analyse the equilibrium data and the results are shown in table 5 the isotherms fitting to experimental results for modified fibers at 20 and 40 c is also shown in fig 7 the freundlich model is more applicable to describe a sorption at low adsorbate concentration ranges and or dominated by physisorption the rsme values generated for this equation were the highest among all sorption models the fitting curves show considerable deviations from the experimental data points suggesting that the freundlich model is not applicable in describing the sorption of crude oil onto the pith the langmuir model assumes that the adsorbate forms a monolayer and the surface of the adsorbent is energetically uniform for the nanosio2 coated surface of pith these basic assumptions of the langmuir model are not satisfied although the langmuir model is not the most suitable model for the pith the calculated maximum oil sorption capacities fit well to the experimental values the rsme values for the temkin model are less satisfactory than that from langmuir model however the temkin model provides useful information about the types of sorption process the calculated bt values are less than 8 kj mol table 5 indicating that the sorption of oil onto the tested piths was physical in nature the three parameter equations toth and khan fit well to the experimental data as evidenced by the low values of rsme the toth model quite effectively predicts the maximum sorption capacity predicted values are close to experimental values and the parameter v 1 indicates that the sorbent surface is heterogeneous the good fit of this model to the experimental data proves that the sorption mechanism is complex there is a significant difference in the isotherms shape for modified pith at 20 and 40 c at lower temperature the slope of isotherm is sharper and the maximum sorption capacity is attained at lower oil concentration the value of the adsorption constant and thus the intensity of the process regardless of the adopted equilibrium model decreases with temperature this phenomenon is related to complex chemical composition and physicochemical properties of crude oil in this study the paraffinic crude oil was used and at 20 c a crystal structure of waxes started to form the pour point of oil is equal to 16 c but the first crystals appear earlier during the research the oil spilled on the surface of water was immobile and after adding the sorbent the oil quickly adhered to sorbent particles this is an example of so called cooperative sorption where the adsorbate molecules on the surface interact with the free molecules in the solution and facilitate their further sorption 62 66 long chain n alkanes sorbing on the surface of pith make surface more hydrophobic which promotes mechanical interception of subsequent hydrocarbon molecules at elevated temperatures the polar components of oil dissolve in water and paraffin melts thus reducing the uptake of the pith similar effects were observed by cheu et al 67 when the sorption capacity of oil for pineapple leaves decreased by 50 with an increase in temperature up to 40 c at higher temperature the speed of the brownian motion of sorbate molecules increases and probability of oil attachment on sorbent surface is lower in addition the viscosity of oil decreases which makes it easier to dissolve in water similar behavior was observed by sidik et al 68 for modified palm leaves at the temperature of 20 c the equilibrium sorption capacity was about 0 65 g g and at 40 c it was only 0 45 g g 3 3 3 comparison of oil sorption capacity of sunflower pith to published data the equilibrium oil sorption capacity at 20 c equals to 8 144 and 11 807 g g for raw and modified sunflower fibers respectively both materials show a comparable sorption capacity to the carbonized rice husk 6 0 g g 69 sugarcane bagasse 13 27 g g 70 and cotton grass 14 20 g g 71 hydrophobicity and porous structure greatly affect the oil adsorption capacity natural fibers with hydrophilic and rough surface poorly adsorb various oils and organic solvents and the sorption capacities can reach up to 1 39 4 82 g g for hydrophobic aquaphyte salvinia sp and acid treated sawdust respectively 72 73 aerogels and foams exhibit the highest oil capacity ranging from 63 g g for silylated chitosan aerogel 74 up to 150 g g for carbon aerogels 75 the maximum adsorption capacity of both sunflower piths is higher than most of the inorganic adsorbents for example capacity of zeolite modified polystyrene fibers is 9 407 mg g 76 while synthetic zeolites from fly ash can sorb up to 0 86 g g mineral sorbents cannot float on the water surface hence their applicability for oil spills removal is limited synthetic sorbents made of polypropylene polyethylene and polyurethane are most widely applied in commercial applications for example capacity of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride fibers is 9 75 23 61 g g 77 and polypropylene fibrous mats sorb from 6 to 7 5 g g 71 although synthetic adsorbents have better adsorption capacity than raw natural fibers they are expensive and non biodegradable in table 4 the maximum sorption capacities of few other sorbents are reported 3 4 experimental breakthrough curves fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves normalized concentration of oil at the outlet of the column as a function of pumping time for adsorption columns filled with modified sunflower pith the normalized concentration is defined as the ratio of adsorbate concentration in effluent to inlet adsorbate concentration c co the influence of two operational parameters i e flow ratio and bed depth on the effectiveness of hydrocarbon removal was studied the retention of oil in a fixed bed column depends among other factors on the quantity of solid sorbent used e i at constant packing density on the bed depth the quantity of removed oil increases as the bed depth increases because more sorption centers are available for hydrocarbons the short column with height of 2 5 cm is not very effective in oil removing after filtration of 0 5 l of oily water the adsorption bed was fully saturated and the normalized concentration of hydrocarbons in the filtrate was close to one the breakthrough curve was quite steep which means that the process occurred intensively oil droplets coalesced when they flowed through a thin layer of filter and then the larger droplets were washed out of the bed forming a layer of free oil in the filtrate in this way the adsorption bed acts like a coalescing mat and although oil is still present in the filtrate it could be removed more easily at higher bed depth the contact time between sorbent and sorbate is elongated even if the adsorbed oil droplets are released from the material surface it is more likely that they will collide or be intercepted by subsequent sorbent particles further down the column bed with a depth of 10 cm allowed to remove up to 80 of oil similar observations regarding the effect of the bed depth on breakthrough rate were reported by other researchers girish and murty 78 studied the effectiveness of removing phenol from water in beds of lantana camara forest waste in this case the increase in the bed depth from 5 cm to 10 cm increased the breakthrough time from 218 423 min doyle et al 79 reported that an increase in the filter bed volume by 50 resulted in a similar prolongation of its period of usability for removing dichloromethane from water volumetric flow rate is the second operating parameter significantly affecting the efficiency of adsorption in dynamic conditions the filtration velocity determines the mechanism of oil capturing slow pore diffusion dominates at low velocities while under high velocity flow conditions a straining and interception play the main role in commercial water treatment plants velocities of 7 10 m h are usually applied the formation waters are often re injected back into the reservoir periodically and the treatment plant works under higher loads even up to 20 m h increasing the filtration velocity allows to increase the working capacity of the facility without the need to upgrade its infrastructure on the other hand however with an increase in the pumping rate the lifetime of the adsorption bed becomes shorter the separation of two liquids oil and water is more sensitive to changes in the flow rate because oil droplets are easily deformed and the classic sieve effect does not take place during the filtration 41 the combination of biodemulsification and biosorption allowed to reduce oil content in water by 98 after demusifier application the oil content decreased from 168 6 g l to 9 3 g l achieving separation efficiency of 95 the oil concentration in water after the subsequent adsorption in the fixed bed was 2 5 g l the relatively high oil content in filtrate is related to the high initial oil concentration in the feed the recyclability of the modified fibers plays an important role in oil cleanup application in this study the spent sorbent from each filtration run was regenerated by centrifugation the resulting fibers were used repeatedly the oil uptake of reused sorbent in the second filtration cycle was lower by 10 25 the decrease in the oil absorbency is likely caused by the residual oil inside the fibers assembly and irreversible deformation of partial hollow lumens abdullah et al 80 reported similar results for oil recovery from malaysian kapok ceiba pentandra fiber the recovery of oil from modified pith operating at different conditions is shown in table 6 oil recovery is here defined as the ratio of the quantity of oil extracted from spent sorbent to the quantity originally contained in the regenerated bed knowing the initial oil concentration in the feed and the final oil concentration in effluent the sorption capacity of fixed bed can be simply calculated from mass balance for all tested cases the oil recovery is similar around 60 wt the adsorbed oil is captured only on the surface of the pith and does not penetrate its structure hence the recovery is easy both developed materials soapwort extract used as a demulsifier and sunflower pith as a filtration material are suitable to treat different oily wastewaters this kind of byproducts or wastes are generated in many industrial processes such as petroleum refining food processing leather and metal finishing paint manufacturing an effective treatment of these streams allows to recover both oils and potable water the efficiency of such treatment strongly depends on waste composition salinity presence of surfactants hence for each stream the optimal parameters should be individually selected preparation of soapwort extract is extremely easy and includes a simple extraction in hot water soapwort roots are commercially available at a low cost sunflower pith is obtained from agricultural wastes by mechanical cutting and grinding chemicals used for surface modification nanosilica and polydimethylsiloxane are cheap and easy available the modification itself is based on spraying method hence no specific equipment is required in general the whole downstream processing required in order to make these products commercially available is cheap and technically feasible 4 conclusions a novel holistic oil recovery technology involving biodemulsification and biosorption was proposed soapwort extract used as a demulsifier allowed up to 95 of oil to be separated adsorption in fixed bed columns filled with hydrophobized sunflower pith was used as a polishing step to remove the dissolved hydrocarbons the effects of flow rate and column height were assessed using breakthrough curves the obtained results show that 10 ml min feed flowrate and 10 cm bed height at 1 g l initial oil concentration are the optimum conditions for the tested column when simple centrifugation was applied more than 60 of the adsorbed oil was recovered from spent material the combination of two processes i e biodemulsification and biosorption allowed the oil content in the water to be reduced by 98 in this way fixed bed biosorption preceded by emulsion breaking is shown to be a suitable process for treatment of produced water declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13820,produced water can be used as a source of potable water and valuable chemical components pure elements minerals the recovery and beneficial use of emulsified and dissolved hydrocarbons from these brines are not a priority oil removal methods focus on water decontamination without further management of recovered oil in this work biosorption combined with green demulsification is applied to recover paraffinic crude oil from artificial brine soapwort extract at a concentration of 0 5 g l destabilized oil water emulsion allowed 85 95 oil recovery adsorption beds made of sunflower pith were applied to remove dissolved hydrocarbons to enhance sorption capacity the plant material was impregnated with polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic nanosilica the oil removal kinetics on the modified pith followed a pseudo second order model the adsorption isotherm at 20 c was well described by the temkin model while the toth model provided the best fit to experimental data at 40 c the maximum sorption capacities in a two phase oil water system were 3 544 g g and 4 187 g g for the hydrophobized and raw pith respectively the pith filter performed well a maximum oil reduction of 73 in effluent was achieved at 10 cm bed height and 15 ml min flow rate sorbent regeneration studies show that residual oil from spent material can be easily drained and the recovery ratio is up to 68 both bioprocesses biodemulsification and biosorption are effective technologies that can be used to separate oil from oily water keywords produced water biodemulsification biosorption oil recovery filtration 1 introduction oily reservoir brine brought to the surface with oil and gas has long been treated as a waste product the management of this stream included surface discharge and reinjection into disposal wells both these options require advanced and expensive water treatment to obtain good quality water nearly 30 of the energy accumulated in the produced oil or natural gas is expended to reinject the produced water back into the formation 1 oil and gas companies cover the costs of treatment and utilization of these waters without any additional profits the produced water may be re injected into the same formation from where it was obtained to maintain the reservoir pressure and recover of additional oil due to the improved oil recovery the cost of water reinjection is partially paid back in some cases the reservoir brine is discharged directly into the environment or transported to the discharge wells at adjacent non oil bearing formations in all options water needs to be purified to meet environmental regulations and eliminate injectivity decline the cost of such procedure varies from 0 70 to 4 00 2 furtado et al 3 showed the superiority of reinjection over the unproductive discharge based on the example of petrobras fields until 2003 petrobras used to discharge all produced water from its offshore fields in the sea at least 20 km away from the coast according to brazilian environmental regulations oil content in the discharged water should be lower than 20 mg l which means the necessity of deep water purification this limit has no application in the case of its reinjection into the formation the quality requirement of reinjected water depends mainly on formation properties permeability reservoir pressure and each company has its own experience and guidelines in this regard since then pargo and carapeba fields are reinjecting all produced water with success and other fields are planning to follow this path in the us alone up to 98 of produced water is reinjected and only half of it is used to maintain formation pressure and increase recovery of hydrocarbons 4 recently the perception of this stream is changing due to overall water demand it is now considered as an asset a marketable product produced water may be used as a source of both potable water and valuable chemical components in this section some issues related to the recovery of different components will be discussed the concept of recovering dissolved compounds from produced water is not new in 1927 the dow chemical company started to produce iodine from oilfield brine in louisiana 5 commercial recovery of bromine started in 1956 from the smackover formation in the catesville field as a method for extraction of valuable elements from oilfield brines the brine refinery concept was proposed for the first time in 1966 by collins 6 the extraction of rare earth elements and other critical metals na ca k sr mg br ba fe i b mn li has been described in the literature 7 9 grimaldi et al 10 showed that even such a common ingredient as nacl can be useful in the production of soda ash sodium carbonate mavukkandy et al 11 summarized the most common technologies used to recover resources from brine precipitation ion exchange solvent extraction membrane distillation pressure retarded osmosis electrodialysis and adsorption the main conclusion from this review is that some of these methods are expensive and need further improvements but impressive progress has been made in this area there are numerous research papers on the chemical composition of selected brines and the general market conditions specific to elements that occur naturally in reservoir brines 12 13 14 15 the recovery of elements from produced water offers environmental benefits and may partially offset treatment costs of wastewater from oil and gas fields the scarcity of freshwater especially constraints on the supply of freshwater for hydraulic fracturing has attracted public attention to the recovery of a potable water from produced brine the reuse of internal water in oil and gas operations has been practiced for many years ribeiro et al 16 described the properties of water based drilling fluids prepared using wastewater from the brazilian urucu oilfield the marathon oil company demonstrated the beneficial use of produced water for drilling operations in the indian basin field which is located in eddy county new mexico 17 flowback waters from hydraulic fracturing are also more frequently reused in some fields such as marcellus shale usa and changning gas field china 18 where up to 90 of produced flowback is recycled for production intensification produced water may be considered a new source of fresh water for areas in which water is scarce beneficial uses of this stream include crop irrigation livestock consumption aquaculture and hydroponic vegetable culture and industrial processes however as scanlon et al 19 showed the current lack of appropriate regulations and technologies preclude these beneficial uses outside the energy sector of all the components available in formation brine the recovery of hydrocarbons is poorly described there are several different methods of oil removal but the separated oil is often wasted dissolved air flotation combined with flocculation is often applied to separate oil water emulsions gas flotation allows to remove particles as small as 25 μm but it cannot remove dissolved hydrocarbons from water the resulting froth is then added to oily sludge from gravity separators and disposed of as hazardous waste 20 in refineries this byproduct is incinerated in fluidized bed furnaces but the thermal efficiency of this process is poor due to the high water content in the feed gas flotation does not require chemical use and the estimated cost for flotation treatment is 0 60 m3 of produced water 21 some treatment methods assume chemical degradation of hydrocarbons present in water which precludes their further use during advanced chemical oxidation 22 23 and electrochemical 24 and photoelectrocatalytic 25 treatment hydrocarbons are oxidized to co2 and h2o without recovery of the energy stored in these compounds chemical oxidation is well established reliable and requires minimal equipment oxidants like chlorine chlorine dioxide permanganate oxygen and ozone are easy available no pretreatment is required but cost of chemicals may be high 26 the energy consumption and process time are major limitations for electrochemical methods of water treatment their advantages include low sludge production environmental compatibility need of simple equipment no use of chemical additives in the case of photocatalysis although relatively high removal efficiencies have been achieved the process has not yet been applied on an industrial scale similarly biological methods lead to complete decomposition of dissolved organics 27 28 biological methods are preferred due to advantages like simplicity and low cost but their efficiency is limited by water salinity and high oil content technologies for oil and gas produced water treatment are described in detail elsewhere 29 31 application of demulsifiers and filtration are non destructive treatment methods with the highest oil recovery potential yau et al 32 tested the efficiency of 37 demulsifiers cationic non ionic and anionic and found that sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate achieved up to 75 separation performance abdel azim et al 33 showed that sugar based green demulsifiers allow the complete separation of oil from water under favorable conditions similarly chitosan based nonionic surfactants achieve 100 water separation at 45 c 34 the cited works show that the application of biosurfactants is a suitable method of removing all emulsified oil from brine dissolved hydrocarbons may be removed from water into fixed bed adsorption columns raw and modified biomass have been shown to be an efficient sorbent for the removal of oil spills from surface water 35 37 dong et al 38 presented structure filters made of kapok fibers for oil recovery from wastewater this filtrating system demonstrated high sorption capacity 32 31 g of oil g of sorbent and its reusability was confirmed by centrifugation which recovered 80 91 of oil in general sorption filter fillers made from natural fibers are 42 98 efficient in removing oil compounds from water 39 40 41 42 oil recovery from spent adsorption materials depends on the structure of the sorbent and the method of regeneration beshkar et al 43 showed that porous materials like hydrophobic straw soot sponge can be effectively regenerated through a simple mechanical extrusion method when squeezing 44 or draining under vacuum 45 are applied the regenerated sorbents can be reused through several cycles liquid hydrocarbons can also be effectively recovered from spent biosorbent by thermal treatment rajan et al 46 described the conversion of oily fibers to bio oil through a hydrothermal liquefaction process the recovered oil is suitable for low quality fuel usage such as cement kilns and waste incinerators hossain et al 47 promoted the utilization of spent waste adsorbents for value added products such as biofuel soil amendment supplements and cementitious material the aim of this work is to describe the combination of biodemulsification and biosorption for the enhanced recovery of oil from produced water the specific objectives of this work are to investigate the applicability of saponaria officinalis extract as a demulsifier to destabilize oil water emulsion to study the static and dynamic conditions of oil sorption onto raw and modified sunflower pith to study the recovery of adsorbed oil from spent sorbent to evaluate total oil recovery when biodemulsification and biosorption are combined in previous research 48 raw sunflower pith was found to have good oil sorption capacity 12 67 g g and filters made of this material were shown to be suitable for oil water separation the disadvantage of this material is its low selectivity due to its hydrophilicity the pith absorbs water which makes it swell and disturbs the flow through the filters one method of modifying the surface properties of materials is the immobilization of controlled nanoparticles on the material surface in this study polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic nanosilica were used to improve the raw pith s sorption properties by making the surface hydrophobic and increasing the specific area of the sorbent the porous structure of pith allows the recovery of absorbed oil by a simple centrifugation method filter performance is enhanced by using demulsification as a pretreatment to avoid the introduction of new chemicals into water the natural extract from saponaria officinalis was used as green demulsifier for the first time the combination of these bioprocesses was applied the obtained results showed that this novel biotreatment is an effective and sustainable technology for the recovery of additional crude oil from produced water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sunflower stems after harvesting the seeds were cut and dried in the open air for 3 months the inner part of stem the so called pith was mechanically separated from the outer woody layer and ground with a blender to obtain the desired sample size of 1 5 4 0 mm the pieces were washed with distilled water to remove impurities e g dust dyes and were then oven dried at 30 c for 48 h dried roots of saponaria officinalis were purchased from flos mokrsko company for the surface coating a commercial nanosilica produced by plasmachem gmbh was used due to the specification provided by the manufacturer the nanopowder was modified with polydimethylsiloxane and had an average particle size of 14 nm a specific surface area of 100 m2 g bulk density of 0 05 g cm3 and purity 99 8 excluding stabilizers polydimethylsiloxane ethanol 99 8 gc grade n pentane 99 gc and dichloromethane 99 gc were obtained from sigma aldrich while nacl pure came from avantor performance materials poland distilled water was used to prepare all solutions crude oil was obtained from polish oil and gas company pgnig sa characteristic properties of the oil are given in table 1 mineral oil standard mixture type a and b for en iso 9377 2 from sigma aldrich was used for gas chromatography calibration 2 2 preparation of hydrophobic pith spraying a hydrophobizing agent under pressure onto the substrate is a fast and efficient method of surface modification in this paper the wettability modifier was prepared by dissolving 10 g of polydimethylsiloxane in 100 ml of n pentane commercial nanosilica was dispersed in ethanol 10 g of nano sio2 per 100 ml and stirred for 30 min at room temperature sunflower fibers 10 g were first covered with 10 ml of pdms solution using a regular atomizer immediately followed by 25 ml of dispersed nano sio2 the resulting product was vigorously stirred and then dried for 6 h at 40 c 2 3 characterization of the raw and fabricated material the specific surface area of the particles was assessed by low temperature nitrogen adsorption measurements performed with an asap 2420 instrument micromeritics inc usa the volume size and distribution of the adsorbent pores was determined using the procedure developed by barret joyner and halenda bjh surface morphology was analyzed with an quanta feg 250 fei ltd brno czech republic scanning electron microscope using an acceleration voltage of 10 kv and magnification ranging from 200 to 30 000 the wettability of the surface was determined by water contact angle measurements using a dsa100 drop shape analysis system krüss germany 2 4 emulsion preparation and demulsification study the crude oil emulsion was prepared by mixing the nacl 3 wt brine with crude oil at a ratio of 1 2 v v using a homogenizer at 5000 rpm for 30 min in a soxhlet extractor 30 g of saponaria officinalis roots was extracted with distilled water for 2 h and the resulted extract was used as a green demulsifier the efficiency of the prepared agent was tested using the standard bottle test method the mixture of emulsion and demulsifier were poured into 30 ml graduated glass tubes and the oil water interface was observed for 24 h during demulsification study the oil water mixture without demulsifier was treated as a reference sample 2 5 sorption properties of pith 2 5 1 sorption equilibrium to determine adsorption isotherms portions 0 25 g of raw and modified pith were placed in 100 ml beakers containing different amounts of crude oil from 50 to 3000 mg at least 10 different concentrations displaced in 50 ml of water at room temperature sorption equilibrium was established after 24 h oily sorbents were removed from the beakers using sieve nets the sorption capacity of the pith qe g of oil g of sorbent was determined using the following equation 1 q e v c o c e m s where co is the initial oil concentration g l ce is the equilibrium oil concentration g l v is the volume of the solution l and ms is the mass of the adsorbent g the residual oil was extracted from the water with 20 ml of n pentane and the polar substances were removed in florisil na2so4 pre columns the concentration of oil in the purified aliquots was determined as the mineral oil index by means of gas chromatography gc according to en iso 9377 2 49 the calibration procedure and the validation method are described elsewhere 49 50 the equilibrium adsorption data was fitted by langmuir freundlich temkin khan and toth models the langmuir model assumes monolayer coverage on a homogeneous surface which can be expressed as the following equation 51 2 q e q l k l c e 1 k l c e where kl is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l g and ql is the maximum adsorption capacity g of oil g of adsorbent the freundlich isotherm allows to describe an adsorption processes that occur on heterogonous surfaces 52 the freundlich model is expressed as follows 3 q e k f c e 1 n where kf is the constant related to the sorption capacity of the adsorbent g g l g n and n is the constant indicative of the intensity of the adsorption the temkin isotherm model takes into account the adsorbate adsorbate interactions the equation is as follows 4 q e r t b t l n a t c e where at is the temkin isotherm constant l g t is the temperature k r is the gas constant j k mol and bt is the constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol the toth isotherm is an empirical modification of the langmuir equation suitable for describing heterogeneous adsorption systems in a wide range of adsorbate concentrations 53 the toth model is represented by the following equation 5 q e q t k t h c e 1 k t h c e v 1 v where qth is the maximum adsorption capacity g g kth is the toth adsorption constant l g ν is the parameter related to the surface heterogeneity the khan isotherm model is widely

the khan constant l g and nk is the khan model exponent the parameters of models were determined using the levenberg marquardt algorithm nonlinear regression rmse root mean square error and chi2 statistical criteria were applied to evaluate the fitness of model predictions to experimental results these criteria were calculated according to the equations 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q e e x p i q e c a

sorption kinetics was determined using batch adsorption techniques 1 g of sorbent was placed in a 250 ml beaker containing 50 g of a measuring liquid water or oil the measurement was carried out in static conditions after a specific time of contact from 1 min to 48 h the contents of the beaker were allowed to drip for 10 min on steel sieves 1 mm mesh after the excess liquid had drained completely the remainder was weighed the pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris equations were used to fit the experimental adsorption kinetics data the pseudo first order pfo equation can be expressed as 52 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe g g and qt g g are the amounts of adsorbate adsorbed at equilibrium and at any time t min respectively k1 1 min is the adsorption rate constant the pseudo second order pso kinetic model is given by following formula 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 g g min refers to the adsorption rate constant of pso model 48 the weber and morris model allows to identify the process being the rate determining step equation representing this model is expressed as 11 q t k 3 t 0 5 c i where k3 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant g g min0 5 and ci indicates the thickness of the boundary layer the plot of uptake qt versus the square root of time t0 5 should be linear and pass through the origin if intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling step the obtained parameters maximum sorption capacity and constant rate allow to compare the effectiveness of the tested sorbents and identify the sorption mechanism kinetic parameters and goodness of fit were calculated as previously in section 2 5 1 2 6 laboratory column experiments the feed emulsion with 1 g l of oil content prepared as previously was pumped through a filter column with an internal diameter of 2 2 cm closed at both ends with plugs secured with steel mesh for each filtration run a new portion of emulsion was prepared the filtrate from the bottom of the column was collected in 100 ml doses in glass vessels the oil concentration in the effluent was determined using the gc method the analyses were performed on a hewlett packard 5890 gc usa system with chemstation rev a 10 01 standard software the experimental setup for oily water filtration in a pith packed bed column is shown in fig 1 the modified pith was packed evenly into the column at the desired packing density of 0 118 g cm3 the effect of two operational parameters e g flow rate 10 15 and 30 ml min and column height 2 5 5 and 10 cm on filtrate quality was tested after each filtration run the spent adsorbent was regenerated by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm the separated mixture of water and oil was extracted with 50 ml of n pentane the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen flow and the residual oil was weighted to obtain the value of oil recovery for optimal filtration conditions flow rate of 15 ml min and bed height of 10 cm the biodemusification was applied as pretreatment 2 l of oil water emulsion 1 4 v v was destabilized using soapwort extract at the concentration of 0 5 g l and the resulted 1 l of separated water was subsequently pumped through the fixed bed adsorption column the oil concentration in water after biodemulsification and biosorption was measured as previously all sorption and filtration experiments were performed in triplicate and the average values were used for further calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 emulsion break up using soapwort extract fig 2 a shows the effect of demulsifier dosage on oil separation from the emulsion after 24 h the emulsion separation profiles at 25 and 40 c with and without demulsifier are shown in fig 2b the base case emulsion without any additives was found to be stable after 24 h oil creaming only occurred near the tube bottom and there was no free water sedimentation the oil separation increased at higher demulsifier concentrations maximum oil separation of approximately 95 was achieved at a demulsifier concentration of 0 5 g l a clear layer of water in this case appeared after 2 h and its volume increased with time increasing the demulsifier concentration from 0 5 to 1 g l accelerated the separation process but the overall demulsification effect remained the same saponins extracted from saponaria officinalis roots are water soluble so these compounds are able to adsorb on water droplets dispersed in the oil phase and in this way promote the interfacial surface drainage and enhance the coalescence of water droplets for any concentration of the used demulsifier the separation improved considerably with a temperature increase to 40 c at which complete water sedimentation occurred after 12 h the separated water phase was clear and contained no visible oil droplets therefore it was clear that all the emulsified hydrocarbons had been removed from the water 3 2 textural and morphological characterization of sorbents fig 3 shows the sem images of pristine and modified fibers under low and high magnification the surface of the untreated pith is clean and smooth cylindrical cells are arranged in a honeycomb like pattern which assures good mechanical stability of the material the surfaces of the modified pith are rougher than the original uncoated fiber the sio2 nanoparticles were unevenly deposited and formed a rough micro nanostructure which increased the surface area for oil sorption surface roughness enhances the adhesion of oil droplets to the fibers and further penetration of oil into the sorbent structure this unique bushy structure also prevents oil escaping from the fiber assembly the wettability of both sorbents was evaluated by examining the contact angle of a sessile drop of water on the specimens as shown in fig 4 a and b the raw pith is hydrophilic and the contact angle for water is 73 due to the numerous functional groups hydroxyl carboxylic etc present on the surface the functional groups present in sunflower pith were identified in the previous works 50 54 using infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of the raw pith show the occurrence of a broad band at 3400 cm 1 that can be ascribed to oh stretching absorption bands attributable to the asymmetric and symmetric ch stretching in methyl and methylene groups appear in the region between 2900 and 2850 cm 1 two absorption bands at approximately 1720 and 1620 cm 1 can be attributed to co stretching of carbonyl groups and cc bonds of the aromatic rings respectively for the modified pith a significant decrease of oh group band intensity in the range of 3600 3400 cm 1 was observed the modified material exhibits a water contact angle of 112 crude oil dropped on the surface of the prepared fiber was instantly absorbed which suggests it has superoleophilic properties due to the presence of air filled spaces the pith easily floats on the water consequently when used for spill removal it can be easily collected with a net or skimmer in a two phase oil water system hydrocarbons form the upper layer which naturally facilitates their contact with the sorbent fig 4c f show the behavior of raw and modified pith on the water surface the raw sorbent is very hydrophilic therefore the water can spontaneously imbibe into the pores and push the air out in the form of fine bubbles the modified pith is hydrophobic and oil droplets adhere to its surface more strongly than water which limits water sorption the results of n2 physical adsorption desorption isotherms were used to evaluate the textural properties of the sorbents adsorption isotherms for raw and modified fibers can be classified as type iv according to iupac classification both materials are mesoporous and have a sponge like structure the sorption mechanism depends on the size of the pores 55 the low pressure part of the adsorption isotherm can be used to characterize the microporous structure while the medium and high pressure adsorption data allow analysis of the meso and macroporous structure the parameters of the porous structure calculated according to bet theory are listed in table 2 the modified material shows a specific surface area that is almost three times larger than the unmodified pith this surface expanded due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles which leads to a greater number of active sorption centers and thus increases the capacity of the monolayer the specific surface area of the raw parenchyma is low in comparison to commercially used activated carbons or silica materials the obtained values are typical for plant fibers bartczak 56 reported that the specific surface area of peat sawdust and saw sedge was 1 40 1 17 and 0 61 m2 g respectively using the method developed by barrett joyner and halenda it is possible to determine the volume size and distribution of adsorbent pores the calculated pore volume fraction dv is plotted versus the pore diameters d in fig 5 visible maxima of different intensity in fig 5 mean that the pore size distribution is heterogeneous the sorbents contain meso and macropores which is advantageous for oil sorption i e hydrocarbons of different structures and dimensions 3 3 batch sorption experiments 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics study of sorption kinetics allow to determine the changes in the sorption capacity over time the effects of contact time on oil and water sorption in a single phase system only oil or only water onto raw and modified material are shown in fig 6 a the sorption capacity increases with time and this increase is quite intensive in the initial period after 24 h crude oil sorption reaches the equilibrium in the first stage the amount of adsorbed hydrocarbons is determined mainly by the specific surface area of the sorbent the maximum sorption capacity for crude oil is 17 76 and 19 62 g g for raw and surface coated sorbent respectively the study on water sorption on the sorbents provides an additional information about sorption preferences fig 6c confirms the previous findings regarding the wettability of both materials raw fibers are hydrophilic and absorb water intensively even up to 28 10 g g the hydrophobized material for contact time no longer than 3 h sorbed small amount of water extending the contact time resulted in increasing absorbency for water similar behavior was observed by yin and wang 57 for cellulose fibers coated with oxysilanes at room conditions after the fibers were prefabricated they showed the water contact angle of 139 8 but after 3 h of contacting with water this value dropped below 90 authors concluded that some unreacted hydroxyl groups under the coating can cause capillary rise of water with time parameters of kinetics models were calculated and listed in table 3 the results show a better fit of experimental data to the pseudo second order model eq 10 the chi2 values of the pseudo second order model are higher than those of the pseudo first order model eq 9 for both tested piths the adsorption rate constants k2 see eq 10 for the oil are higher than those for the water the oil adsorption occurs faster due to the hydrophobicity of pith surface sorption of water on the modified pith is hindered hence the k2 value for water is about 10 times lower than for oil analysis of the literature data indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model is more suitable for describing the sorption of oil onto plant fibers kinetic studies on oil spills recovery are summarized in table 4 sorption kinetics may be studied both in a single and two phase systems only oil or oil water mixture the value of the adsorption rate constant k2 strongly depends on sorbent structure and sorption conditions generally the k2 value for oil adsorption is lower in two phase system as the competitive sorption of water occurs sorbents with a highly porous structure and large specific surface area like aerogels exhibit a higher sorption capacity and sorption rate than rough and flat fibers rice husk orange peels the step limiting the rate of the whole process is diffusion either in the boundary layer or intraparticle diffusion this can be assessed by adapting experimental data to the weber morris model fig 6b and d for all tested materials and fluids curves fitted to the plot of qt vs t0 5 eq 11 do not pass through the origin meaning that intraparticle diffusion is not the only step that limits the rate of the process for crude oil sorption on raw pith three linearity ranges in the weber morris model can be distinguished at the beginning of the process diffusion in the film plays a major role as the boundary layer is the greatest obstacle to mass exchange due to its hydrophilic nature after crossing the boundary layer diffusion occurs first in the macropores step 2 and then in the micropores step 3 for hybrid material due to its low free surface energy i e high affinity to sorbate there is no barrier effect around the sorbent particles and adsorption occurs in two steps that is diffusion in macro and micropores respectively the last step where the curve is almost parallel to the x axis suggests that micropore diffusion only slightly increases the sorption capacity according to the weber morris model water sorption on the raw pith is a one step process due to the hydrophilicity of the sorbent and the small size of the sorbate molecules the process occurs intensively first on the surface of the sorbent then without any electrostatic or geometric obstacles the water molecules penetrate deep into the porous structure therefore sorption is not clearly divided into stages in the case of modified fibers in the first stage the resistance of the hydrophobic boundary layer is being overcome in the next stages the pores are filled depending on their size 3 3 2 equilibrium isotherms in order to determine the sorption mechanism selected adsorption equilibrium models were fitted to the equilibrium data an accurate mathematical description of the sorption equilibrium allows for the reliable prediction of adsorption parameters and quantitative comparison of different sorbents in this study langmuir eq 2 freundlich eq 3 toth eq 4 khan eq 6 and temkin eq 4 models were tested to analyse the equilibrium data and the results are shown in table 5 the isotherms fitting to experimental results for modified fibers at 20 and 40 c is also shown in fig 7 the freundlich model is more applicable to describe a sorption at low adsorbate concentration ranges and or dominated by physisorption the rsme values generated for this equation were the highest among all sorption models the fitting curves show considerable deviations from the experimental data points suggesting that the freundlich model is not applicable in describing the sorption of crude oil onto the pith the langmuir model assumes that the adsorbate forms a monolayer and the surface of the adsorbent is energetically uniform for the nanosio2 coated surface of pith these basic assumptions of the langmuir model are not satisfied although the langmuir model is not the most suitable model for the pith the calculated maximum oil sorption capacities fit well to the experimental values the rsme values for the temkin model are less satisfactory than that from langmuir model however the temkin model provides useful information about the types of sorption process the calculated bt values are less than 8 kj mol table 5 indicating that the sorption of oil onto the tested piths was physical in nature the three parameter equations toth and khan fit well to the experimental data as evidenced by the low values of rsme the toth model quite effectively predicts the maximum sorption capacity predicted values are close to experimental values and the parameter v 1 indicates that the sorbent surface is heterogeneous the good fit of this model to the experimental data proves that the sorption mechanism is complex there is a significant difference in the isotherms shape for modified pith at 20 and 40 c at lower temperature the slope of isotherm is sharper and the maximum sorption capacity is attained at lower oil concentration the value of the adsorption constant and thus the intensity of the process regardless of the adopted equilibrium model decreases with temperature this phenomenon is related to complex chemical composition and physicochemical properties of crude oil in this study the paraffinic crude oil was used and at 20 c a crystal structure of waxes started to form the pour point of oil is equal to 16 c but the first crystals appear earlier during the research the oil spilled on the surface of water was immobile and after adding the sorbent the oil quickly adhered to sorbent particles this is an example of so called cooperative sorption where the adsorbate molecules on the surface interact with the free molecules in the solution and facilitate their further sorption 62 66 long chain n alkanes sorbing on the surface of pith make surface more hydrophobic which promotes mechanical interception of subsequent hydrocarbon molecules at elevated temperatures the polar components of oil dissolve in water and paraffin melts thus reducing the uptake of the pith similar effects were observed by cheu et al 67 when the sorption capacity of oil for pineapple leaves decreased by 50 with an increase in temperature up to 40 c at higher temperature the speed of the brownian motion of sorbate molecules increases and probability of oil attachment on sorbent surface is lower in addition the viscosity of oil decreases which makes it easier to dissolve in water similar behavior was observed by sidik et al 68 for modified palm leaves at the temperature of 20 c the equilibrium sorption capacity was about 0 65 g g and at 40 c it was only 0 45 g g 3 3 3 comparison of oil sorption capacity of sunflower pith to published data the equilibrium oil sorption capacity at 20 c equals to 8 144 and 11 807 g g for raw and modified sunflower fibers respectively both materials show a comparable sorption capacity to the carbonized rice husk 6 0 g g 69 sugarcane bagasse 13 27 g g 70 and cotton grass 14 20 g g 71 hydrophobicity and porous structure greatly affect the oil adsorption capacity natural fibers with hydrophilic and rough surface poorly adsorb various oils and organic solvents and the sorption capacities can reach up to 1 39 4 82 g g for hydrophobic aquaphyte salvinia sp and acid treated sawdust respectively 72 73 aerogels and foams exhibit the highest oil capacity ranging from 63 g g for silylated chitosan aerogel 74 up to 150 g g for carbon aerogels 75 the maximum adsorption capacity of both sunflower piths is higher than most of the inorganic adsorbents for example capacity of zeolite modified polystyrene fibers is 9 407 mg g 76 while synthetic zeolites from fly ash can sorb up to 0 86 g g mineral sorbents cannot float on the water surface hence their applicability for oil spills removal is limited synthetic sorbents made of polypropylene polyethylene and polyurethane are most widely applied in commercial applications for example capacity of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride fibers is 9 75 23 61 g g 77 and polypropylene fibrous mats sorb from 6 to 7 5 g g 71 although synthetic adsorbents have better adsorption capacity than raw natural fibers they are expensive and non biodegradable in table 4 the maximum sorption capacities of few other sorbents are reported 3 4 experimental breakthrough curves fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves normalized concentration of oil at the outlet of the column as a function of pumping time for adsorption columns filled with modified sunflower pith the normalized concentration is defined as the ratio of adsorbate concentration in effluent to inlet adsorbate concentration c co the influence of two operational parameters i e flow ratio and bed depth on the effectiveness of hydrocarbon removal was studied the retention of oil in a fixed bed column depends among other factors on the quantity of solid sorbent used e i at constant packing density on the bed depth the quantity of removed oil increases as the bed depth increases because more sorption centers are available for hydrocarbons the short column with height of 2 5 cm is not very effective in oil removing after filtration of 0 5 l of oily water the adsorption bed was fully saturated and the normalized concentration of hydrocarbons in the filtrate was close to one the breakthrough curve was quite steep which means that the process occurred intensively oil droplets coalesced when they flowed through a thin layer of filter and then the larger droplets were washed out of the bed forming a layer of free oil in the filtrate in this way the adsorption bed acts like a coalescing mat and although oil is still present in the filtrate it could be removed more easily at higher bed depth the contact time between sorbent and sorbate is elongated even if the adsorbed oil droplets are released from the material surface it is more likely that they will collide or be intercepted by subsequent sorbent particles further down the column bed with a depth of 10 cm allowed to remove up to 80 of oil similar observations regarding the effect of the bed depth on breakthrough rate were reported by other researchers girish and murty 78 studied the effectiveness of removing phenol from water in beds of lantana camara forest waste in this case the increase in the bed depth from 5 cm to 10 cm increased the breakthrough time from 218 423 min doyle et al 79 reported that an increase in the filter bed volume by 50 resulted in a similar prolongation of its period of usability for removing dichloromethane from water volumetric flow rate is the second operating parameter significantly affecting the efficiency of adsorption in dynamic conditions the filtration velocity determines the mechanism of oil capturing slow pore diffusion dominates at low velocities while under high velocity flow conditions a straining and interception play the main role in commercial water treatment plants velocities of 7 10 m h are usually applied the formation waters are often re injected back into the reservoir periodically and the treatment plant works under higher loads even up to 20 m h increasing the filtration velocity allows to increase the working capacity of the facility without the need to upgrade its infrastructure on the other hand however with an increase in the pumping rate the lifetime of the adsorption bed becomes shorter the separation of two liquids oil and water is more sensitive to changes in the flow rate because oil droplets are easily deformed and the classic sieve effect does not take place during the filtration 41 the combination of biodemulsification and biosorption allowed to reduce oil content in water by 98 after demusifier application the oil content decreased from 168 6 g l to 9 3 g l achieving separation efficiency of 95 the oil concentration in water after the subsequent adsorption in the fixed bed was 2 5 g l the relatively high oil content in filtrate is related to the high initial oil concentration in the feed the recyclability of the modified fibers plays an important role in oil cleanup application in this study the spent sorbent from each filtration run was regenerated by centrifugation the resulting fibers were used repeatedly the oil uptake of reused sorbent in the second filtration cycle was lower by 10 25 the decrease in the oil absorbency is likely caused by the residual oil inside the fibers assembly and irreversible deformation of partial hollow lumens abdullah et al 80 reported similar results for oil recovery from malaysian kapok ceiba pentandra fiber the recovery of oil from modified pith operating at different conditions is shown in table 6 oil recovery is here defined as the ratio of the quantity of oil extracted from spent sorbent to the quantity originally contained in the regenerated bed knowing the initial oil concentration in the feed and the final oil concentration in effluent the sorption capacity of fixed bed can be simply calculated from mass balance for all tested cases the oil recovery is similar around 60 wt the adsorbed oil is captured only on the surface of the pith and does not penetrate its structure hence the recovery is easy both developed materials soapwort extract used as a demulsifier and sunflower pith as a filtration material are suitable to treat different oily wastewaters this kind of byproducts or wastes are generated in many industrial processes such as petroleum refining food processing leather and metal finishing paint manufacturing an effective treatment of these streams allows to recover both oils and potable water the efficiency of such treatment strongly depends on waste composition salinity presence of surfactants hence for each stream the optimal parameters should be individually selected preparation of soapwort extract is extremely easy and includes a simple extraction in hot water soapwort roots are commercially available at a low cost sunflower pith is obtained from agricultural wastes by mechanical cutting and grinding chemicals used for surface modification nanosilica and polydimethylsiloxane are cheap and easy available the modification itself is based on spraying method hence no specific equipment is required in general the whole downstream processing required in order to make these products commercially available is cheap and technically feasible 4 conclusions a novel holistic oil recovery technology involving biodemulsification and biosorption was proposed soapwort extract used as a demulsifier allowed up to 95 of oil to be separated adsorption in fixed bed columns filled with hydrophobized sunflower pith was used as a polishing step to remove the dissolved hydrocarbons the effects of flow rate and column height were assessed using breakthrough curves the obtained results show that 10 ml min feed flowrate and 10 cm bed height at 1 g l initial oil concentration are the optimum conditions for the tested column when simple centrifugation was applied more than 60 of the adsorbed oil was recovered from spent material the combination of two processes i e biodemulsification and biosorption allowed the oil content in the water to be reduced by 98 in this way fixed bed biosorption preceded by emulsion breaking is shown to be a suitable process for treatment of produced water declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13821,the remarkable gathering of synthetic fabric pollutants in aquatic and particularly marineenvironment is one of the key reasons that are creating stress on global ecosystems extensive use of synthetic outfits in the modern urban population results in increased synthetic microfibers smfs generation in the environment domestic washing of synthetics textiles are contributing up to 35 of the microfiber pollution in the atmosphere thesepollutantstogether with washing machine effluents are discharged and scattered though out the aquatic environment numerous scientific studies are now reporting the detrimentalimpacts of these contaminants on the aquatic food web and human health management of these synthetic fabric pollutants is highly essential due to their high rate of emission and ubiquitous occurrence in the nature these microfibers after their release into domestic drainages enter the oceans via waste water treatment plant wwtp and river streams micro fiber fleeces are required to be tackled throughout the whole textile lifecycle starting from textile industry to consumer use collaborative approaches should be developed to prevent the pollution at source in future organized advancements are highly desirable including evaluation and management of microfiber release at sources which will reduce the emissions into the environment this paper provides a general idea of the sources transmission routes hazardous effects of microfibers regulation and remediation strategies to deal with this aquatic pollutants environment and precise management measures that are available for remediation of microfiber pollution keywords microfiber aquatic environment transmission pollution remediation 1 introduction synthetic microfibers are tiny plastic threads of various textiles including clothes tyres fishing net cigarette butts floor mats tie and lace having diameter less than 5 mm widely distributed in the environment 1 these pollutants are creating an apprehension because of their considerable involvement to environmental microplastics pollutant these are used to form fabrics ropes household plastic bottles and many more products which are playing a fundamental role in the human life synthetic microfibers are reported in all matrices of the environment including air soil river lake and ocean thus becoming a global issue as anthropogenic waste 2 thegradually increasing deposition of these non biodegradable fiber in marine environment is now considered as a lethal pollutant 1 3 the presence of microfibers their size concentration and composition reported in many seawatersamples in recent scientific studies are listed in table 1 the latest and disquietingcause of marine pollution has been newlyreported and characterized in micro plastic fragments released from domestic sewage polluted by synthetic clothes from domestic washing machine 80 88 89 due to many advantages of synthetic fiber the production and consumption of clothes have enormously been increased by the metropolitan cities over past two three decades 2 these synthetic fibers sf have dominated the natural fibersand captured the apparel industries in the global market due to its strength softness stain resistant and most vital cost factor we all wear various synthetic clothes such as jackets yoga pants socks underwear and blankets every day without thinking about their disposal from the universal production of fabric 60 of synthetic fibers are produced natural fabric accounts for about 30 and 10 accounts for other materials from the total synthetic fabric production only polyester accounts more than 50 of the worldwide fiber market it is estimated that polyester is a dominant synthetic fiber in global fiber market and its production rate has been augmented terrifically from 5 mts in 1980 to 50 mts in 2017 3 asian countries produceapproximately 80 85 of the total global production of synthetic fiber in which china alone contributes 70 of the whole 2 a commercial report released by global apparel fiber consumption survey 2017 estimates that synthetic clothes consumption has been increased approximately 65 worldwide the production and consumption of synthetic fibers are two principal features of the synthetic microfiber pollution in the world it is reported that approximately 20 35 of plastic wastes in the aquatic environment are originated from synthetic clothes 4 these fibers consist of an overpowering fraction of microplastic wastes are found on the seashores around the world 5 the mfparticlesare generated from domestic and commercial laundering abrasion of tyres prohibited land filling wwtps and a very small amount from sea based sources even though primary sources have not been yet investigated it is extensively assumed that household laundry wastewaters are the most important source it is estimated that a single synthetic garment can release mfs approximately 730 000 from a single laundry wash 2 6 rivers are the primary transport pathway for all mishandled mfs these micro pollutants flow downstream and finally discharged into the ocean these types of fibers are now reported in all the matrices of oceans including shoreline surface water and deep sediments tiwari et al 2019 found out that mfs in the seashore of indian coastal ranges from 5 36 mm and pointed out polyester to be the most dominant 7 in a similar report the synthetic mfs were collected from ocean surface water of admiralty bay antarctica ranged from 10 to 22 μm in diameter and were identified with their chemical compositions which are mostly microplastics and smfs 8 sanchez vidal et al 2018 reported microplasticpolymers such as pe pp pa and acrylic with an abundance of 10 70 mfs in 50 ml in the southern european deep sea sediments 9 90 the omnipresence of synthetic microfibers intheatmosphere is of mountingapprehension for human health and atmosphere consistenttechniques are immediatelyrequired for the detection and characterization of these risingmicro pollutants in the environment recently fourier transform infrared ftir and raman spectroscopic techniques are developed for automaticand instant detection of these particles similarly scanning electron microscopy sem was reported for surface morphologycharacterization studies of mfs 34 the presence of synthetic microfibers has already been reported in all kinds of aquatic habitat both in fresh and marine water worldwide mfs haveharmful impact on the ocean as it is the sink of all the sources the effect of these synthetic fibers pollution on marine organisms is still mystifying hence the scientific studies on this pollutant are vigorously increasing among the scientific community in these circumstances to prevent the marine pollution by synthetic microfibers we have to find some imperative approaches assortments of strategies have been implemented such as tools in the wastewater treatment plants membrane filter and microbiological using different type of bacteria and fungi help to remove the mfs from the sources however these techniques are still in premature phase of research with less number of addresses in spite of the truth that fabric pollutants are present globally in rivers lakes and marine waters recentlythese pollutants have been traced as a significant concern in the field of environmental studies the literature review in this field of research have been carried out over the last ten years with an importance on mf pollutants in marine environments fig 1 where the graph representthe research article published on microfiber pollution during last 10 years with the help of sci database this reviewrepresents a wide ranging overview about the sources of synthetic microfiber their transport from point of origin to deposition in aquatic ecosystems and remediation of synthetic mfs in the freshwater and oceanic environment and lastly we discussed the gaps in the information regarding perceptive of the marine synthetic microfibers and proposed several perceptions for future studies 2 sources of marine synthetic microfibers microfibers present in the marine environment are basically a diverse collection of fibers differing in morphology and chemical compositions marine pollution originated by synthetic fibers derived from heterogeneous sources either land based or sea based 88 in this division we have discussed different causes of synthetic microfibers and consider both the direct and indirect pathways through which these micro pollutantsare released into the ocean in some cases fishermen may intentionally dump their gears in the marine environment these are generating a huge amount of mfs during utilization and disposal similarly marine coating paintings on boats and ships to avoid corrosion and fouling releases some fibers to the ocean during manufacture usage and maintenance 4 2 1 land based sources as most of the anthropogenic activities are on the soil it is obvious that the most of the environmental pollutions are land based 84 it is reported that around13 million tons per year of synthetic or plastic waste directly or indirectly reaches into the ocean via water sources out of which asia alone accounts for around 85 of pollution this type of sources are considered as dominant and it is reported that 98 mfs in the marine environment having terrestrial origin and only 2 comes from sea bases sources 4 the detailed information about the land based sources from which mfs are released is in the following sections and schematically represented in fig 2 2 1 1 synthetic textiles as a result of the efficient contribution of domestic and commercial laundering of synthetic textiles or apparels to this ecological problem is of immense significance synthetic microfibers are primarily released into environment during textile fabrication heavy use care and waste disposal 2 these fibrous microfibers which are used in manufacture of garments devoid of any further treatment are considered as primary microfibers whereas secondary mfs are the fragmented fabrics of large primary mfs during handing out in textile and apparel industries 10 mf detaching from synthetic garments and home textiles with sloppy structure including fleece blankets sweaters socks yoga pants towels underwear etc is very usual throughout their lifecycle 11 these fibers released to the wastewaters by the process of mechanical and chemical actions during laundering of synthetic textiles vassilenko et al in 2019 calculated that the average household wastewater in usa and canada emitting 533 millions of mfs via domestic laundering 6 it is reported that one fleece jacket can generate approximately 2000 mfs in a single wash similarly it has been accounted that a regular laundry of 5 6 kilograms of synthetic clothes can release from approximately 6 500 000 mfs the release of synthetic mfs from clothes depend upon the use of detergent factor which is proved by pirc et al 2016 he performed the experiment without involving utilization of detergent and found that the clothes releases about 30 times less fibers as compared to detergent wash 12 the shedding of synthetic textiles depends upon the density factor i e thicker apparel releases more mfs than thinner density cloth it is reported that polyester releases more mfs than nylon with increasing the density 13 2 1 2 abrasion of tyres at present automobile tyres are manufactured by various synthetic polymers including styrene polyester fiber butadiene and halobutyl rubber these automotive tyres are made of synthetic polymer i e 60 of styrene butadiene and other chemical additives with natural rubber 14 synthetic mfs generated by the process of deterioration from automobile tyres is the second largest cause of mf pollution after synthetic textiles these fibers produced on the roads are then washed off through rainwater to the nearest water source via wastewater treatment plant wwtp collected by sewer however the runoff of the road of the metropolitan cities can be spread by the action of air and rainfall to the neighboring soils or water sources 15 it has beenreported that the tyres of approximately 1500 millions of vehicles releasing about 4 million tons of synthetic fibers globally to the environment with per capita emission of 5 kg per year a wide ranging review on commercial data of various countries of globe reported the production of mfs per capita ranging from 0 25 india 2 0 japan to 5 0 kg y 1 usa 16 while identification of environmental sources remains a challenge it is reported that tyre abrasion results in approximately 10 of the total universalquantity of plastic polymers end up in our oceans 96 tyre treads is made up of styrene rubber a precursor of polystyrene and additional components 97 it has been calculated that approximately 503 600 t y 1 of mfs released from tyre wears in the european union and out of which a total of between 52 000 to 136 000 t y 1 can really reach into the water sources 17 materials prepared from synthetic polymers majorly including polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride and car tyre rubber are abundantly present in marine habitat where natural weathering phenomena lead to their fragmentation and release of harmful chemicals 105 tyre abrasion is the most important source of microplasticsin the environment and numerous constituents of tyres are reported to be highly toxic 96 98 hence plummeting the amounts of tyre waste emitted into the environment is extremely anticipated 2 1 3 city dust microfiber particles mainly from waste garments and other discarded fabric have been traced in both indoor and outdoor air samples experiments on dimensions pointed out those microfiber concentrations are elevated in indoors than outdoors in an investigation by dris et al 2017 indoor and outdoor samples collected from paris showed that 60 synthetic microfibers m 3 implicated as a key source 99 another investigation by sundt et al 2014 concluded that airborne synthetic microfiber fleeces in dust settling on undisturbed surfaces of homes in norway and geographical investigation concluded that the quantity of textile fibers deposited on surfaces was same asreleasedfrom laundry discharge 100 city dust is also a major source of microfiber pollutants it comprises of losses during the cleaning of synthetic objects soles of synthetic footwear synthetic cooking apparatus and attrition of infrastructures building coatings artificial turf household dust principally in the urban cities of the globe 20 22 the handling and maintenance of products of above sources is the main basic reason for the generation of mfs but controlling of the individual contribution of these sources is also very significant however collectively these sources account for substantial amount of losses in the country studies 17 4 recent studies havealso reported the probable human health impact from exposure to airborne microfibers 1 5 7 the microfibers having size between 7 15 are more probable to be inhaled along with other city dust 2 1 4 aging and fragmentation of fibers in waters system aging has significant effect on the release of microfibers during washing cycles an investigation on microfiber flees released from domestic laundering of new or aged clothes by hartline et al 2016 reported a significant increase of microfiber amount of 25 more as compared to the new one 92 the report also suggest that there were fraying on the old jackets which is the major cause of increased microfiber release naturally these micro fabric pollutants are exposed to various aging process such as solar ultraviolet rays mechanical abrasion chemical oxidation and biodegradation 93 94 smaller fiber particles can be generated through fragmentation of large fiber particles in the aquatic environment fragmentation is a tedious and slow process depending on several aspects such as light intensity heat oxygen concentration and the characteristics of the fiber material due to the prolong exposure to extreme weather conditions uv light and mechanical abrasions means such as water currents of tides fragmented microfiber particles can be produced several aspects of microfiber release from clothes during domestic laundering shows dependency with clothtype washing cycle detergent used and garment age in a recent alarming investigation from it is stated thaton an average jackets release nearly 2 g of microfibers in singlecleanwhereas the old jackets release almost twice the number of fibers as compared the new once the possible entrance routes of microfibers into the environment are either from primary sources that is less than 5 mm in size produced during manufacturing of the textiles and household laundering and the fragmentation of these larger microfiber particles are considered as secondary source 2 disintegration of these particles after their release into the environment is due to various forces for example degradation in sunlight and scratches lessen larger fiber fragments to smaller these smaller particles are persistent in the environment but cannot be detected easily current researchesare now focusing on todevelop modified enzymes with superiorcapability to disintegrate polymer particles and that can be easily assessed 82 probablecausativefeatures in the connection between samples collected from seashore and yearly production may compriseof fiber type and properties ecologicalimpacts on degradation rate due to the prolong exposure to ultraviolet uv light from the sun extreme weather conditions like high salinity and by mechanical abrasions means such as water currents of tides fragmented microfiber particles can be produced smaller fiber particles are generated through fragmentation of large fiber particles in the aquatic environment it is very significant to have approximation of disintegration rates of the mf particles for forecasting the future environmental condition of our aquatic environment and developing a suitable technique to deal with this problem however after disintegrationthe weathered fiber particle can remainunchangedchemically as polymer chains are broken and oxygen is integrated through oxidation both aging of synthetic fiber particles and weathering can be stimulatedand accelerated by using much higher temperatures than natural weathering 95 the weathering process and subsequent disintegration of large fiber can be done by the influence of uv radiation as suggested by jahnke et al 2017 103 degradation through uv radiation most likely plays the key role additional factors include the saline condition 104 due to loss of physical stability fragmentation of secondary microplastics including synthetic microfibers have a significantly increased surface to volume ratio offering larger surfaces for microbialcolonization and potentially degrade the synthetic polymer 95 3 transmission pathway of microfibers into the environment in metropolitan cities wastewater treatment plants wwtps receives all the domestic waste waters throughout the cities 23 conventional wastewater treatment somehow removes larger primary fibers while high concentrations of mfs are transported into river or ocean via the final wastewater wwtps can be possible source of mfs all types of wastewaters including domestic agricultural and industrial are treated by wwtps of some developed countries while in developing countries these wastewaters are directly released into the rivers or ocean without any management 24 most of the mfs have been removed during the processes of wastewater treatment however in usa and canada metropolitan wastewaters releases around 3 5 quadrillion 35 1015 mfs into the marine environments annually 6 it is estimated that wwtps discharges about 227 million tonnes of mfs every year into the ocean 25 current evaluations have concluded that man made garments supply approximately 36 to the universal liberation of synthetic microfiber to the world oceans thus turned into the chief source of microplastics of the environment this assessment is not unexpected allowing for that synthetic microfibers signify nearly 65 of the yearly universal utilization of fibers that is 70 mt used in the fabric manufacturing in such circumstances it is significant to assess the actual ecological effects of domestic and commercial laundering of synthetic clothes it can be done preliminarily from calculating microplastic fiber particles which are emitted during a wash and recognizing probable constraints of pressure on the discharge 26 27 oceanic pollutants result from dumping off of waste transported directly or indirectly to oceans via domestic sludge and river some of the plastic polymer fragments come from landfills located near water or pollutants those are thrown directly into the oceans 28 29 mfs particles releasing from synthetic fabric regularly enter the oceans through domestic drainage systems along with other wastes 30 33 83 on a daily basis we use many equipments and materials that are made up of synthetic fibers either directly or indirectly dubaish and liebezeitin 2013 reported the liberation of approximately 0 05 waterlogged tiny fleeces from a synthetic garment per washing cycle 31 runoff waste water from household and commercial laundries without any filtration of the sewage water or air are the potential sources of microplastic fibers 12 32 some additional significant contributors of synthetic fleeces are non laundering products such as carpet curtains which are releasing these tiny particles each day 11 21 many scientific studies have been reported the presence of these micro particles in various fresh water streams 34 36 but less information are provided concerning the sources and routes of microfiber particles into the environment the detailed transmission pathway of microfiber particles into the environment is represented in fig 3 current scenario signifies that microfiber transport through river of may increase in the future for many basins it has been calculated that a reduction in exportation of micro fleeces via river water from sources mainly due to proper improvement in sewage treatment synthetic fibers sf are manufactured from chemicals which are originated from petrochemicals hence creating an urbanized fashion business an imperative user of fossil fuel apparel products that are currently present in the manufacturing industries are chiefly consisting of the synthetic fibers universal production of sfs in 2016 was reported around 65 million tonnes and by 2025 this amount is projected to reach 135 million tonnes with an average of 4 annual growth rate considering the pollution caused by the textile industries which embrace the direct throwing discarded garment stock and manufacturing process the blending polymers such as polycotton have the best properties of both fibers with enhanced appear permanence soothe safeguarding cost and easily accessible garments on the other hand the most important disadvantage of blend garments is the non biodegradable nature as it is not all the time likely to reprocess them properly 2 the most potential source of these anthropogenic mf pollutants in the marine pollution is principally due to the washing of synthetic clothes during domestic laundering 1 assessmentof the mf pollution rate by taking discharge quantityinto consideration from point sourcesforecastthat lesserinputs can also results into million metric tons of pollutants in the environment the total mass of micro fleeces which are presentlysuspended on the ocean gyre surface cannot be neglected floating micro particle debris in the aquatic system undergoes fouling that may result in a loss of buoyancy in ocean and fresh water environment if the concentration of the pollutants enhanceadequately buoyant fiber particles will be transferred to deep water depths by the help of water current and ultimately accumulate at the oceanic benthic sediment or remain at the shore 101 microfiber particles are transported and accumulated in the aquatic environment which is influenced by the concentration surface area and dimension of individual fiber particles only small sized fiber pollutants with low concentration polymer particles are transported through water currents from rivers to ocean while the larger particles with high concentration of synthetic polymer are likely preserved in sediments present in aquatic environment 102 87 a recent report by a e schwarz et al 2019 suggested that only larger plastic particles having thick surface prepared from low density polymers are possibly horizontally moved from fresh water to marine system through currents 106 the transfer and distribution of plastic waste between aquatic environments is therefore considered relatively low and buoyant plastic waste in oceans and river originates largely from two different sources in marine system synthetic fibers are regularly broken down to shorter and thinner fibers instead microfibers are mostly adverted by aerial transmission thus reaching the isolated regions of the world 107 4 microfiber pollution and their harmful effects on aquatic organisms pollution due to microfiber particles in the oceanic environment has received extensive awareness worldwide contribution of various sources into microfiber pollution and potentiality of microfibers are depicted in fig 4 in oceans the elevated profusion of these pollutants has been observed in the huge quantity in river junction zones and is accredited to the movement of the deep water currents gathering of mfs in beach sediments has also been noticed universally the greater part of these synthetic fabric fragments in ocean environments initiate from terrestrial environment even though emits from various marine activities like general shipping actions cannot be under estimated 1 89 approximately 1800 microfibers particles per hour are releasing with the waste water treatment plant effluents 1 2 30 based on this evaluation about 95 of the synthetic microfiber wastes will stay behind on terrestrial environment and remaining wastes are discarded into the aquatic environment from various sources consequently it is significant to recognize the incidence destiny and adverse impacts of microfiber in aquatic environment the contributions of various sources of microfiber into the aquatic environment are represented in the table 2 the relation among these synthetic microfiber particles and oceanic organisms were reported in several experiments during sampling 10 37 38 many previous researches have been detected and confirmed the interaction between microfibers and the oceanic biota and inhabitant organisms in recent times apprehension over the ingestion of these microfiber appeared when these tiny particles were found in the gastrointestinal tract of fish species 3 5 38 again in scientific report microfiber debris were also traced in their stomach of lantern fish collected from the mariana islands of philippines sea only some category of microplastic particles can be noticeable through naked eyes but a considerable amount of the fragments cannot be observed the potential foundation of these small particles is associated to the intake of polluted organisms the up taking of these synthetic threads during normal nourishment is highly risky particularly due to the active ingestion of these synthetic polymers with bio film on their surfaces furthermore it will be more harmful as these small particles get deposited in the body of prey and will transmit to the higher trophic level organisms 39 42 a number of laboratory investigations have confirmed that these microfibers are transmitted through the food chain seabirds are also badly affected by ingested particles of microfibers in their tissues and have been used to scrutinize the amount of these pollutants 43 46 in another investigation by setäläet al 2014 through fluorescence microscopic studies the transfer of these synthetic polymer fragments were traced from zooplankton to the shrimp species 47 the fate of polymer particles in organisms after ingestion is potential to accumulate and biomagnifies in food chains the ingestion of synthetic microfibers has also been explored in various investigations mostlyin aquatic species those who inadvertently up take these tiny particles while searching their foods 48 49 and so the bio magnification of microfiber particles is observed in successive trophic level in the food chains investigation concludes that unknowingly ingestion through food is the main expected pathway of exposure for mf particles to living organisms and facilitates the ingestion of these micro particles in aquatic food chains the prevalent allocation and gathering of mfs in the aquatic ecosystems elevated alarming conditions concerning the contact and probable impacts of mfs on oceanic and fresh water biota when these pollutants intermingle with natural environment leads to cause harmful effects on phytoplankton and zooplanktons these organisms may fortuitously or intentionally ingest mf fragments after ingesting the adsorbed contaminant and chemical toxins could be a source of deadly substances inside organism s body the occurrence of microfibers in species utilized for human eating and inhalation of these particles through breathing are two universal disasters that we are facing severely human beings also gets affected by these harmful synthetic pollutants by consumption through municipality water sea salt beer and seafood as reported in recent scientific investigations in view of the fact that people who eat marine organisms as seafood they are more prone consuming micro fleeces with their food the lethal and perilous effects of the mf pollution on aquatic and terrestrial organisms are represented in table 3 many scientific observations reported the maximum contribution of viscose synthetic microfiber that is approximately 57 in the basin of the atlantic ocean as polyester which was the prevailing fibre 18 20 contaminations with microfiber pollutants of all sizes can results in harmful effects which depend on the size of the fiber fragments a recent study on size dependent effects of micro polystyrene particles in the marine copepod tigriopus japonicas was investigated by lee et al 2013 108 he investigated the effects of three sizes of polystyrene ps microbeads 0 05 0 5 and 6 μm diameter on the survival development and fecundity of the copepod tigriopus japonicus using acute and chronic toxicity tests and the results suggest that these micro polystyrene bead have negative effects on marine copepods similarly a recent investigation on chronic microfiber exposure in adult japanese medaka oryziaslatipes was reported by hu et al 2020 109 the experimental results led to conclude that mfs are significantly lethal to fish and type of microfiber is also an essential consideration in its toxicity adverse effects include reduces retardation in growth rate reduction in possible reproductive output of a female individual particularly mf with diameter0 5 to 6 μm diameter lessening of lifespan and extended time of reproduction ingestion ofmicrofiber particles have been examined in a broad range of living organisms particularly planktonsare more affected from the direct ingestion of these micro particles after ingestion these pollutants are accumulate in the digestive organs of the affected organisms then the fragmentation of these microfiber results in production of nano fibers nfs absorbed by phagocytosis stimulate cytotoxicity in lab fed organism micro and nano sized fiber particles can be observed in the guts of all tested organisms 1 91 abundant leftovers are to be addressed for promotingmarine food consumption and protecting human health from adverse effects from microfiber pollution 5 remediation strategiesof microfiber wastes after entering into the aquatic system it is nearly impossible to remove the microfibers out owing to their miniature size water pollution due to these microscopic particles is an emerging subject of distress and requires immediate remediation strategies for elimination of mf pollutants 1 88 remediation techniques to deal with synthetic mfs pollution should focus on the 1 stringent government regulations 2 social awareness programs 3 technology development for efficient removal and remediation proper remediationstrategies for synthetic polymer garbage is highly essential as their quantities in the environment are increasing gradually along with other anthropogenic pollutants like heavy metals 28 39 85 88 products like cora ball guppy filter bag and lint filters have already been developed to tackle these pollutant releasing from house hold washing machine effluents but any of these techniques could not be able to filter these micro particles at a large scale even though a few policies have been implemented by the management agencies to supervise the microplastic quantity but each of the method fails to control large scale pollution unconventional and practical techniques to filter these micro fleeces must be built up for the purpose of cleaning these tiny fibers from river and oceans 49 89 81 86 the pollution of marine environment by microfiber particles is of serious concern not only due to their hazardous impacts on aquatic and terrestrial species but also for theirill association and negative impact on food protection potable water safety and accordingly human health 50 51 39 the available data on the incidence of recognizable microfiber particles is limited the contamination levels are mostly unidentified and the probable effects on predators are inadequately determined sophisticatedanalytical opticaland spectroscopic methods are being examined for the identification and characterization of synthetic microfibers from environmental samples observation through micro ftir imaging of microfiber particles pretreated with h2o2 is an efficient method for the precise recognition of these pollutants in various aquatic samples as suggested by many scientific observations 1 34 79 h2o2 pretreatment can able to remove organic pollutants from the surface of samples synthetic polymers mainly polyester fibers can be characterized and observed using spectroscopic techniques by the combination of raman and infra red techniques the detailed morphological investigation and observation of the surface of individual microfiber particles can be observed using a stereo microscope and scanning electron microscope in an investigation by pirc et al 2016 considerable amount of the microfiber particles released along with the washing machine effluents due to laundering of micro fleece blanket though thestereomicroscopic and scanning electron microscopic study they observed the external appearance and morphological characteristics then they analyzed the polymer composition of mf particles through ftir and investigated the presence of polyester fiber in the sample 12 thedetection of pathways of transmissionof these pollutants is essential for the proper management and solution considering the constraints involved in the entrance and flow of these micro pollutants from aquatic to human tissues and subsequenteffects on their health are precedence research fields which could be surveyed in the upcoming years more ecologically reasonable investigation can offer site specific information on the impacts of these tiny unit pollutants under precise ecological circumstances it is significant that these tiny fiber particles are spotted enormously in the oceanic environment as compared to other plastic micro particles adoption of reliable procedures permits for evaluatingand investigatingthe deadly effects of the pollutants which are of indispensable significance in that hotspot region withextreme abnormality 53 54 the recurrence of the high volume synthetic microfibers on a regular basis is very complicated to manage and their rapid transmissions badly disturb all the global trophic levels control and regulation measures for ensuring negligible infectivity in every habitation all across the world are highly required one of the major facets is to manufacture garments and apparels so that they can be smoothly recycled synthetic microfiber particles can be reused characteristically by cutting into strips melting it down and then by shaping into new fibers however the harmful chemicals that additionally appliedfor getting elasticity or resilience of the final product orusing specific color createshurdles in recycling manufacture of new synthetic polymer particles from disposed plastics can also provide a novel way for clearing up of the synthetic micro pollutants that are already exist in the environment 55 78 cleaning up of polymer particles is a tedious task to do because these are too smallin size diverse in natureand the ecosystems in which they are embedded are very large researchers are continuously investigating novel enzymes derived from fungal or bacterial strain that can degrade certain types of polymers but it is also important to figure out the way how these might be executed without any unforeseen harmful side effects 56 bioremediation of microfibers using microbes can be proved effective only when the environmental conditions allow microbial growth and their activities 19 29 52 marine pollution by these synthetic polymer particles has now become so extensive it is very hard to eliminate manually also the velocities at which these anthropogenic pollutants enter into the environment dominate the rate of removal on the other hand a more potential technique could be employed by using microbes that are able to degrade polymers exploiting microorganisms for this purpose can be proved as a more promising and secure method that will enable in the proper organization of microplastics pollutants without harmful impacts and ultimately support the natural cleaning up of polluted environments 6 conclusion although investigation of microfiber pollution is challenging immediate improvement understanding of their sources transport and their remediation remains restricted due tothe quickadvancement in the field of microplastic and microfiber research there is a requirement of constancy in sampling methodologies that can beemployed to measure micro fleeces in the oceanic environment and mfs having unique characteristics are even more influenced by this as there is a hugedifference between reported microfiberconcentrations in various investigations is often impracticable or need supplementarycomputationby consideringthe assumptions the preponderance of these techniquevariations can be related to i variation in the rangeappliedii the sampling methods iii variation in sample collectionmethods there isan urgent requirement for homogenyin employed techniques due to the exceptional characteristics of these synthetic fiber particles at present we are too much depending on synthetic and cotton synthetic blend clothes thus a suitable system of regulation for evaluating the sum total of the emission from domestic and commercial sources must be established microfiber particles have been traced nearly in every aquatic habitation including fresh ocean water and sediments on sea shore around the world present days employment of sensor techniques for the rapid detection of pollutants as well as diseases has been developed quick advancement of microfiber pollution investigation is required but due to lack of reliability in detection and separation methodologies used to measure these micro pollutants in the environment these methods cannot be applied exclusively the field of microfiber pollution is in its earlier stages and there are numerous unsolved problems the solution to which is requisite to illustrate an apparent depiction of their impact on the aquatic marine flora and fauna future research is mandatory to understand the ecological inference of population growth along with this micro particle pollution in more elaborately and to establish a cost effective and efficient technique to control on site specific pollution in addition more investigation should be required for the employment of potential microbes to remediate these tiny pollutants on the other hand it can be expected that the synthetic microfiber pollution is a hazardous menace to the environment and measures to lessen their contribution towards world s pollution should be developed insinuation of tiny synthetic fiber particles constitutes a very recent modern area of the ecological sciences having specific interest of researchers as microplastic research specifically microfiber pollutants isstill in its early years there are many more unsolved questions the response to which are necessary to assemble on existing and upcoming knowledge again a clearer picture should be developed of their effect on animals particularlyon human however it is observed thatmicrofibersare a danger to the aquatic habitat and measures tocheck their entryinto all types ofaquatic system should be taken urgently declaration of

13821,the remarkable gathering of synthetic fabric pollutants in aquatic and particularly marineenvironment is one of the key reasons that are creating stress on global ecosystems extensive use of synthetic outfits in the modern urban population results in increased synthetic microfibers smfs generation in the environment domestic washing of synthetics textiles are contributing up to 35 of the microfiber pollution in the atmosphere thesepollutantstogether with washing machine effluents are discharged and scattered though out the aquatic environment numerous scientific studies are now reporting the detrimentalimpacts of these contaminants on the aquatic food web and human health management of these synthetic fabric pollutants is highly essential due to their high rate of emission and ubiquitous occurrence in the nature these microfibers after their release into domestic drainages enter the oceans via waste water treatment plant wwtp and river streams micro fiber fleeces are required to be tackled throughout the whole textile lifecycle starting from textile industry to consumer use collaborative approaches should be developed to prevent the pollution at source in future organized advancements are highly desirable including evaluation and management of microfiber release at sources which will reduce the emissions into the environment this paper provides a general idea of the sources transmission routes hazardous effects of microfibers regulation and remediation strategies to deal with this aquatic pollutants environment and precise management measures that are available for remediation of microfiber pollution keywords microfiber aquatic environment transmission pollution remediation 1 introduction synthetic microfibers are tiny plastic threads of various textiles including clothes tyres fishing net cigarette butts floor mats tie and lace having diameter less than 5 mm widely distributed in the environment 1 these pollutants are creating an apprehension because of their considerable involvement to environmental microplastics pollutant these are used to form fabrics ropes household plastic bottles and many more products which are playing a fundamental role in the human life synthetic microfibers are reported in all matrices of the environment including air soil river lake and ocean thus becoming a global issue as anthropogenic waste 2 thegradually increasing deposition of these non biodegradable fiber in marine environment is now considered as a lethal pollutant 1 3 the presence of microfibers their size concentration and composition reported in many seawatersamples in recent scientific studies are listed in table 1 the latest and disquietingcause of marine pollution has been newlyreported and characterized in micro plastic fragments released from domestic sewage polluted by synthetic clothes from domestic washing machine 80 88 89 due to many advantages of synthetic fiber the production and consumption of clothes have enormously been increased by the metropolitan cities over past two three decades 2 these synthetic fibers sf have dominated the natural fibersand captured the apparel industries in the global market due to its strength softness stain resistant and most vital cost factor we all wear various synthetic clothes such as jackets yoga pants socks underwear and blankets every day without thinking about their disposal from the universal production of fabric 60 of synthetic fibers are produced natural fabric accounts for about 30 and 10 accounts for other materials from the total synthetic fabric production only polyester accounts more than 50 of the worldwide fiber market it is estimated that polyester is a dominant synthetic fiber in global fiber market and its production rate has been augmented terrifically from 5 mts in 1980 to 50 mts in 2017 3 asian countries produceapproximately 80 85 of the total global production of synthetic fiber in which china alone contributes 70 of the whole 2 a commercial report released by global apparel fiber consumption survey 2017 estimates that synthetic clothes consumption has been increased approximately 65 worldwide the production and consumption of synthetic fibers are two principal features of the synthetic microfiber pollution in the world it is reported that approximately 20 35 of plastic wastes in the aquatic environment are originated from synthetic clothes 4 these fibers consist of an overpowering fraction of microplastic wastes are found on the seashores around the world 5 the mfparticlesare generated from domestic and commercial laundering abrasion of tyres prohibited land filling wwtps and a very small amount from sea based sources even though primary sources have not been yet investigated it is extensively assumed that household laundry wastewaters are the most important source it is estimated that a single synthetic garment can release mfs approximately 730 000 from a single laundry wash 2 6 rivers are the primary transport pathway for all mishandled mfs these micro pollutants flow downstream and finally discharged into the ocean these types of fibers are now reported in all the matrices of oceans including shoreline surface water and deep sediments tiwari et al 2019 found out that mfs in the seashore of indian coastal ranges from 5 36 mm and pointed out polyester to be the most dominant 7 in a similar report the synthetic mfs were collected from ocean surface water of admiralty bay antarctica ranged from 10 to 22 μm in diameter and were identified with their chemical compositions which are mostly microplastics and smfs 8 sanchez vidal et al 2018 reported microplasticpolymers such as pe pp pa and acrylic with an abundance of 10 70 mfs in 50 ml in the southern european deep sea sediments 9 90 the omnipresence of synthetic microfibers intheatmosphere is of mountingapprehension for human health and atmosphere consistenttechniques are immediatelyrequired for the detection and characterization of these risingmicro pollutants in the environment recently fourier transform infrared ftir and raman spectroscopic techniques are developed for automaticand instant detection of these particles similarly scanning electron microscopy sem was reported for surface morphologycharacterization studies of mfs 34 the presence of synthetic microfibers has already been reported in all kinds of aquatic habitat both in fresh and marine water worldwide mfs haveharmful impact on the ocean as it is the sink of all the sources the effect of these synthetic fibers pollution on marine organisms is still mystifying hence the scientific studies on this pollutant are vigorously increasing among the scientific community in these circumstances to prevent the marine pollution by synthetic microfibers we have to find some imperative approaches assortments of strategies have been implemented such as tools in the wastewater treatment plants membrane filter and microbiological using different type of bacteria and fungi help to remove the mfs from the sources however these techniques are still in premature phase of research with less number of addresses in spite of the truth that fabric pollutants are present globally in rivers lakes and marine waters recentlythese pollutants have been traced as a significant concern in the field of environmental studies the literature review in this field of research have been carried out over the last ten years with an importance on mf pollutants in marine environments fig 1 where the graph representthe research article published on microfiber pollution during last 10 years with the help of sci database this reviewrepresents a wide ranging overview about the sources of synthetic microfiber their transport from point of origin to deposition in aquatic ecosystems and remediation of synthetic mfs in the freshwater and oceanic environment and lastly we discussed the gaps in the information regarding perceptive of the marine synthetic microfibers and proposed several perceptions for future studies 2 sources of marine synthetic microfibers microfibers present in the marine environment are basically a diverse collection of fibers differing in morphology and chemical compositions marine pollution originated by synthetic fibers derived from heterogeneous sources either land based or sea based 88 in this division we have discussed different causes of synthetic microfibers and consider both the direct and indirect pathways through which these micro pollutantsare released into the ocean in some cases fishermen may intentionally dump their gears in the marine environment these are generating a huge amount of mfs during utilization and disposal similarly marine coating paintings on boats and ships to avoid corrosion and fouling releases some fibers to the ocean during manufacture usage and maintenance 4 2 1 land based sources as most of the anthropogenic activities are on the soil it is obvious that the most of the environmental pollutions are land based 84 it is reported that around13 million tons per year of synthetic or plastic waste directly or indirectly reaches into the ocean via water sources out of which asia alone accounts for around 85 of pollution this type of sources are considered as dominant and it is reported that 98 mfs in the marine environment having terrestrial origin and only 2 comes from sea bases sources 4 the detailed information about the land based sources from which mfs are released is in the following sections and schematically represented in fig 2 2 1 1 synthetic textiles as a result of the efficient contribution of domestic and commercial laundering of synthetic textiles or apparels to this ecological problem is of immense significance synthetic microfibers are primarily released into environment during textile fabrication heavy use care and waste disposal 2 these fibrous microfibers which are used in manufacture of garments devoid of any further treatment are considered as primary microfibers whereas secondary mfs are the fragmented fabrics of large primary mfs during handing out in textile and apparel industries 10 mf detaching from synthetic garments and home textiles with sloppy structure including fleece blankets sweaters socks yoga pants towels underwear etc is very usual throughout their lifecycle 11 these fibers released to the wastewaters by the process of mechanical and chemical actions during laundering of synthetic textiles vassilenko et al in 2019 calculated that the average household wastewater in usa and canada emitting 533 millions of mfs via domestic laundering 6 it is reported that one fleece jacket can generate approximately 2000 mfs in a single wash similarly it has been accounted that a regular laundry of 5 6 kilograms of synthetic clothes can release from approximately 6 500 000 mfs the release of synthetic mfs from clothes depend upon the use of detergent factor which is proved by pirc et al 2016 he performed the experiment without involving utilization of detergent and found that the clothes releases about 30 times less fibers as compared to detergent wash 12 the shedding of synthetic textiles depends upon the density factor i e thicker apparel releases more mfs than thinner density cloth it is reported that polyester releases more mfs than nylon with increasing the density 13 2 1 2 abrasion of tyres at present automobile tyres are manufactured by various synthetic polymers including styrene polyester fiber butadiene and halobutyl rubber these automotive tyres are made of synthetic polymer i e 60 of styrene butadiene and other chemical additives with natural rubber 14 synthetic mfs generated by the process of deterioration from automobile tyres is the second largest cause of mf pollution after synthetic textiles these fibers produced on the roads are then washed off through rainwater to the nearest water source via wastewater treatment plant wwtp collected by sewer however the runoff of the road of the metropolitan cities can be spread by the action of air and rainfall to the neighboring soils or water sources 15 it has beenreported that the tyres of approximately 1500 millions of vehicles releasing about 4 million tons of synthetic fibers globally to the environment with per capita emission of 5 kg per year a wide ranging review on commercial data of various countries of globe reported the production of mfs per capita ranging from 0 25 india 2 0 japan to 5 0 kg y 1 usa 16 while identification of environmental sources remains a challenge it is reported that tyre abrasion results in approximately 10 of the total universalquantity of plastic polymers end up in our oceans 96 tyre treads is made up of styrene rubber a precursor of polystyrene and additional components 97 it has been calculated that approximately 503 600 t y 1 of mfs released from tyre wears in the european union and out of which a total of between 52 000 to 136 000 t y 1 can really reach into the water sources 17 materials prepared from synthetic polymers majorly including polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride and car tyre rubber are abundantly present in marine habitat where natural weathering phenomena lead to their fragmentation and release of harmful chemicals 105 tyre abrasion is the most important source of microplasticsin the environment and numerous constituents of tyres are reported to be highly toxic 96 98 hence plummeting the amounts of tyre waste emitted into the environment is extremely anticipated 2 1 3 city dust microfiber particles mainly from waste garments and other discarded fabric have been traced in both indoor and outdoor air samples experiments on dimensions pointed out those microfiber concentrations are elevated in indoors than outdoors in an investigation by dris et al 2017 indoor and outdoor samples collected from paris showed that 60 synthetic microfibers m 3 implicated as a key source 99 another investigation by sundt et al 2014 concluded that airborne synthetic microfiber fleeces in dust settling on undisturbed surfaces of homes in norway and geographical investigation concluded that the quantity of textile fibers deposited on surfaces was same asreleasedfrom laundry discharge 100 city dust is also a major source of microfiber pollutants it comprises of losses during the cleaning of synthetic objects soles of synthetic footwear synthetic cooking apparatus and attrition of infrastructures building coatings artificial turf household dust principally in the urban cities of the globe 20 22 the handling and maintenance of products of above sources is the main basic reason for the generation of mfs but controlling of the individual contribution of these sources is also very significant however collectively these sources account for substantial amount of losses in the country studies 17 4 recent studies havealso reported the probable human health impact from exposure to airborne microfibers 1 5 7 the microfibers having size between 7 15 are more probable to be inhaled along with other city dust 2 1 4 aging and fragmentation of fibers in waters system aging has significant effect on the release of microfibers during washing cycles an investigation on microfiber flees released from domestic laundering of new or aged clothes by hartline et al 2016 reported a significant increase of microfiber amount of 25 more as compared to the new one 92 the report also suggest that there were fraying on the old jackets which is the major cause of increased microfiber release naturally these micro fabric pollutants are exposed to various aging process such as solar ultraviolet rays mechanical abrasion chemical oxidation and biodegradation 93 94 smaller fiber particles can be generated through fragmentation of large fiber particles in the aquatic environment fragmentation is a tedious and slow process depending on several aspects such as light intensity heat oxygen concentration and the characteristics of the fiber material due to the prolong exposure to extreme weather conditions uv light and mechanical abrasions means such as water currents of tides fragmented microfiber particles can be produced several aspects of microfiber release from clothes during domestic laundering shows dependency with clothtype washing cycle detergent used and garment age in a recent alarming investigation from it is stated thaton an average jackets release nearly 2 g of microfibers in singlecleanwhereas the old jackets release almost twice the number of fibers as compared the new once the possible entrance routes of microfibers into the environment are either from primary sources that is less than 5 mm in size produced during manufacturing of the textiles and household laundering and the fragmentation of these larger microfiber particles are considered as secondary source 2 disintegration of these particles after their release into the environment is due to various forces for example degradation in sunlight and scratches lessen larger fiber fragments to smaller these smaller particles are persistent in the environment but cannot be detected easily current researchesare now focusing on todevelop modified enzymes with superiorcapability to disintegrate polymer particles and that can be easily assessed 82 probablecausativefeatures in the connection between samples collected from seashore and yearly production may compriseof fiber type and properties ecologicalimpacts on degradation rate due to the prolong exposure to ultraviolet uv light from the sun extreme weather conditions like high salinity and by mechanical abrasions means such as water currents of tides fragmented microfiber particles can be produced smaller fiber particles are generated through fragmentation of large fiber particles in the aquatic environment it is very significant to have approximation of disintegration rates of the mf particles for forecasting the future environmental condition of our aquatic environment and developing a suitable technique to deal with this problem however after disintegrationthe weathered fiber particle can remainunchangedchemically as polymer chains are broken and oxygen is integrated through oxidation both aging of synthetic fiber particles and weathering can be stimulatedand accelerated by using much higher temperatures than natural weathering 95 the weathering process and subsequent disintegration of large fiber can be done by the influence of uv radiation as suggested by jahnke et al 2017 103 degradation through uv radiation most likely plays the key role additional factors include the saline condition 104 due to loss of physical stability fragmentation of secondary microplastics including synthetic microfibers have a significantly increased surface to volume ratio offering larger surfaces for microbialcolonization and potentially degrade the synthetic polymer 95 3 transmission pathway of microfibers into the environment in metropolitan cities wastewater treatment plants wwtps receives all the domestic waste waters throughout the cities 23 conventional wastewater treatment somehow removes larger primary fibers while high concentrations of mfs are transported into river or ocean via the final wastewater wwtps can be possible source of mfs all types of wastewaters including domestic agricultural and industrial are treated by wwtps of some developed countries while in developing countries these wastewaters are directly released into the rivers or ocean without any management 24 most of the mfs have been removed during the processes of wastewater treatment however in usa and canada metropolitan wastewaters releases around 3 5 quadrillion 35 1015 mfs into the marine environments annually 6 it is estimated that wwtps discharges about 227 million tonnes of mfs every year into the ocean 25 current evaluations have concluded that man made garments supply approximately 36 to the universal liberation of synthetic microfiber to the world oceans thus turned into the chief source of microplastics of the environment this assessment is not unexpected allowing for that synthetic microfibers signify nearly 65 of the yearly universal utilization of fibers that is 70 mt used in the fabric manufacturing in such circumstances it is significant to assess the actual ecological effects of domestic and commercial laundering of synthetic clothes it can be done preliminarily from calculating microplastic fiber particles which are emitted during a wash and recognizing probable constraints of pressure on the discharge 26 27 oceanic pollutants result from dumping off of waste transported directly or indirectly to oceans via domestic sludge and river some of the plastic polymer fragments come from landfills located near water or pollutants those are thrown directly into the oceans 28 29 mfs particles releasing from synthetic fabric regularly enter the oceans through domestic drainage systems along with other wastes 30 33 83 on a daily basis we use many equipments and materials that are made up of synthetic fibers either directly or indirectly dubaish and liebezeitin 2013 reported the liberation of approximately 0 05 waterlogged tiny fleeces from a synthetic garment per washing cycle 31 runoff waste water from household and commercial laundries without any filtration of the sewage water or air are the potential sources of microplastic fibers 12 32 some additional significant contributors of synthetic fleeces are non laundering products such as carpet curtains which are releasing these tiny particles each day 11 21 many scientific studies have been reported the presence of these micro particles in various fresh water streams 34 36 but less information are provided concerning the sources and routes of microfiber particles into the environment the detailed transmission pathway of microfiber particles into the environment is represented in fig 3 current scenario signifies that microfiber transport through river of may increase in the future for many basins it has been calculated that a reduction in exportation of micro fleeces via river water from sources mainly due to proper improvement in sewage treatment synthetic fibers sf are manufactured from chemicals which are originated from petrochemicals hence creating an urbanized fashion business an imperative user of fossil fuel apparel products that are currently present in the manufacturing industries are chiefly consisting of the synthetic fibers universal production of sfs in 2016 was reported around 65 million tonnes and by 2025 this amount is projected to reach 135 million tonnes with an average of 4 annual growth rate considering the pollution caused by the textile industries which embrace the direct throwing discarded garment stock and manufacturing process the blending polymers such as polycotton have the best properties of both fibers with enhanced appear permanence soothe safeguarding cost and easily accessible garments on the other hand the most important disadvantage of blend garments is the non biodegradable nature as it is not all the time likely to reprocess them properly 2 the most potential source of these anthropogenic mf pollutants in the marine pollution is principally due to the washing of synthetic clothes during domestic laundering 1 assessmentof the mf pollution rate by taking discharge quantityinto consideration from point sourcesforecastthat lesserinputs can also results into million metric tons of pollutants in the environment the total mass of micro fleeces which are presentlysuspended on the ocean gyre surface cannot be neglected floating micro particle debris in the aquatic system undergoes fouling that may result in a loss of buoyancy in ocean and fresh water environment if the concentration of the pollutants enhanceadequately buoyant fiber particles will be transferred to deep water depths by the help of water current and ultimately accumulate at the oceanic benthic sediment or remain at the shore 101 microfiber particles are transported and accumulated in the aquatic environment which is influenced by the concentration surface area and dimension of individual fiber particles only small sized fiber pollutants with low concentration polymer particles are transported through water currents from rivers to ocean while the larger particles with high concentration of synthetic polymer are likely preserved in sediments present in aquatic environment 102 87 a recent report by a e schwarz et al 2019 suggested that only larger plastic particles having thick surface prepared from low density polymers are possibly horizontally moved from fresh water to marine system through currents 106 the transfer and distribution of plastic waste between aquatic environments is therefore considered relatively low and buoyant plastic waste in oceans and river originates largely from two different sources in marine system synthetic fibers are regularly broken down to shorter and thinner fibers instead microfibers are mostly adverted by aerial transmission thus reaching the isolated regions of the world 107 4 microfiber pollution and their harmful effects on aquatic organisms pollution due to microfiber particles in the oceanic environment has received extensive awareness worldwide contribution of various sources into microfiber pollution and potentiality of microfibers are depicted in fig 4 in oceans the elevated profusion of these pollutants has been observed in the huge quantity in river junction zones and is accredited to the movement of the deep water currents gathering of mfs in beach sediments has also been noticed universally the greater part of these synthetic fabric fragments in ocean environments initiate from terrestrial environment even though emits from various marine activities like general shipping actions cannot be under estimated 1 89 approximately 1800 microfibers particles per hour are releasing with the waste water treatment plant effluents 1 2 30 based on this evaluation about 95 of the synthetic microfiber wastes will stay behind on terrestrial environment and remaining wastes are discarded into the aquatic environment from various sources consequently it is significant to recognize the incidence destiny and adverse impacts of microfiber in aquatic environment the contributions of various sources of microfiber into the aquatic environment are represented in the table 2 the relation among these synthetic microfiber particles and oceanic organisms were reported in several experiments during sampling 10 37 38 many previous researches have been detected and confirmed the interaction between microfibers and the oceanic biota and inhabitant organisms in recent times apprehension over the ingestion of these microfiber appeared when these tiny particles were found in the gastrointestinal tract of fish species 3 5 38 again in scientific report microfiber debris were also traced in their stomach of lantern fish collected from the mariana islands of philippines sea only some category of microplastic particles can be noticeable through naked eyes but a considerable amount of the fragments cannot be observed the potential foundation of these small particles is associated to the intake of polluted organisms the up taking of these synthetic threads during normal nourishment is highly risky particularly due to the active ingestion of these synthetic polymers with bio film on their surfaces furthermore it will be more harmful as these small particles get deposited in the body of prey and will transmit to the higher trophic level organisms 39 42 a number of laboratory investigations have confirmed that these microfibers are transmitted through the food chain seabirds are also badly affected by ingested particles of microfibers in their tissues and have been used to scrutinize the amount of these pollutants 43 46 in another investigation by setäläet al 2014 through fluorescence microscopic studies the transfer of these synthetic polymer fragments were traced from zooplankton to the shrimp species 47 the fate of polymer particles in organisms after ingestion is potential to accumulate and biomagnifies in food chains the ingestion of synthetic microfibers has also been explored in various investigations mostlyin aquatic species those who inadvertently up take these tiny particles while searching their foods 48 49 and so the bio magnification of microfiber particles is observed in successive trophic level in the food chains investigation concludes that unknowingly ingestion through food is the main expected pathway of exposure for mf particles to living organisms and facilitates the ingestion of these micro particles in aquatic food chains the prevalent allocation and gathering of mfs in the aquatic ecosystems elevated alarming conditions concerning the contact and probable impacts of mfs on oceanic and fresh water biota when these pollutants intermingle with natural environment leads to cause harmful effects on phytoplankton and zooplanktons these organisms may fortuitously or intentionally ingest mf fragments after ingesting the adsorbed contaminant and chemical toxins could be a source of deadly substances inside organism s body the occurrence of microfibers in species utilized for human eating and inhalation of these particles through breathing are two universal disasters that we are facing severely human beings also gets affected by these harmful synthetic pollutants by consumption through municipality water sea salt beer and seafood as reported in recent scientific investigations in view of the fact that people who eat marine organisms as seafood they are more prone consuming micro fleeces with their food the lethal and perilous effects of the mf pollution on aquatic and terrestrial organisms are represented in table 3 many scientific observations reported the maximum contribution of viscose synthetic microfiber that is approximately 57 in the basin of the atlantic ocean as polyester which was the prevailing fibre 18 20 contaminations with microfiber pollutants of all sizes can results in harmful effects which depend on the size of the fiber fragments a recent study on size dependent effects of micro polystyrene particles in the marine copepod tigriopus japonicas was investigated by lee et al 2013 108 he investigated the effects of three sizes of polystyrene ps microbeads 0 05 0 5 and 6 μm diameter on the survival development and fecundity of the copepod tigriopus japonicus using acute and chronic toxicity tests and the results suggest that these micro polystyrene bead have negative effects on marine copepods similarly a recent investigation on chronic microfiber exposure in adult japanese medaka oryziaslatipes was reported by hu et al 2020 109 the experimental results led to conclude that mfs are significantly lethal to fish and type of microfiber is also an essential consideration in its toxicity adverse effects include reduces retardation in growth rate reduction in possible reproductive output of a female individual particularly mf with diameter0 5 to 6 μm diameter lessening of lifespan and extended time of reproduction ingestion ofmicrofiber particles have been examined in a broad range of living organisms particularly planktonsare more affected from the direct ingestion of these micro particles after ingestion these pollutants are accumulate in the

and nano sized fiber particles can be observed in the guts of all tested organisms 1 91 abundant leftovers are to be addressed for promotingmarine food consumption and protecting human health from adverse effects from microfiber pollution 5 remediation strategiesof microfiber wastes after entering into the aquatic system it is nearly impossible to remove the microfibers out owing to their miniature size water pollution due to these microscopic particles is an emerging subject of distress and requires immediate remediation strategies for elimination of mf pollutants 1 88 remediation techniques to deal with synthetic mfs pollution should focus on the 1 stringent government regulations 2 social awareness programs 3 technology development for efficient removal and remediation proper remediationstrategies for synthetic polymer garbage is highly essential as their quantities in the environment are increasing gradually along with other anthropogenic pollutants like heavy metals 28 39 85 88 products like cora ball guppy filter bag and lint filters have already been developed to tackle these pollutant releasing from house hold washing machine effluents but any of these techniques could not be able to filter these micro particles at a large scale even though a few policies have been implemented by the management agencies to supervise the microplastic quantity but each of the method fails to control large scale pollution unconventional and practical techniques to filter these micro fleeces must be built up for the purpose of cleaning these tiny fibers from river and oceans 49 89 81 86 the pollution of marine environment by microfiber particles is of serious concern not only due to their hazardous impacts on aquatic and terrestrial species but also for theirill association and negative impact on food protection potable water safety and accordingly human health 50 51 39 the available data on the incidence of recognizable microfiber particles is limited the contamination levels are mostly unidentified and the probable effects on predators are inadequately determined sophisticatedanalytical opticaland spectroscopic methods are being examined for the identification and characterization of synthetic microfibers from environmental samples observation through micro ftir imaging of microfiber particles pretreated with h2o2 is an efficient method for the precise recognition of these pollutants in various aquatic samples as suggested by many scientific observations 1 34 79 h2o2 pretreatment can able to remove organic pollutants from the surface of samples synthetic polymers mainly polyester fibers can be characterized and observed using spectroscopic techniques by the combination of raman and infra red techniques the detailed morphological investigation and observation of the surface of individual microfiber particles can be observed using a stereo microscope and scanning electron microscope in an investigation by pirc et al 2016 considerable amount of the microfiber particles released along with the washing machine effluents due to laundering of micro fleece blanket though thestereomicroscopic and scanning electron microscopic study they observed the external appearance and morphological characteristics then they analyzed the polymer composition of mf particles through ftir and investigated the presence of polyester fiber in the sample 12 thedetection of pathways of transmissionof these pollutants is essential for the proper management and solution considering the constraints involved in the entrance and flow of these micro pollutants from aquatic to human tissues and subsequenteffects on their health are precedence research fields which could be surveyed in the upcoming years more ecologically reasonable investigation can offer site specific information on the impacts of these tiny unit pollutants under precise ecological circumstances it is significant that these tiny fiber particles are spotted enormously in the oceanic environment as compared to other plastic micro particles adoption of reliable procedures permits for evaluatingand investigatingthe deadly effects of the pollutants which are of indispensable significance in that hotspot region withextreme abnormality 53 54 the recurrence of the high volume synthetic microfibers on a regular basis is very complicated to manage and their rapid transmissions badly disturb all the global trophic levels control and regulation measures for ensuring negligible infectivity in every habitation all across the world are highly required one of the major facets is to manufacture garments and apparels so that they can be smoothly recycled synthetic microfiber particles can be reused characteristically by cutting into strips melting it down and then by shaping into new fibers however the harmful chemicals that additionally appliedfor getting elasticity or resilience of the final product orusing specific color createshurdles in recycling manufacture of new synthetic polymer particles from disposed plastics can also provide a novel way for clearing up of the synthetic micro pollutants that are already exist in the environment 55 78 cleaning up of polymer particles is a tedious task to do because these are too smallin size diverse in natureand the ecosystems in which they are embedded are very large researchers are continuously investigating novel enzymes derived from fungal or bacterial strain that can degrade certain types of polymers but it is also important to figure out the way how these might be executed without any unforeseen harmful side effects 56 bioremediation of microfibers using microbes can be proved effective only when the environmental conditions allow microbial growth and their activities 19 29 52 marine pollution by these synthetic polymer particles has now become so extensive it is very hard to eliminate manually also the velocities at which these anthropogenic pollutants enter into the environment dominate the rate of removal on the other hand a more potential technique could be employed by using microbes that are able to degrade polymers exploiting microorganisms for this purpose can be proved as a more promising and secure method that will enable in the proper organization of microplastics pollutants without harmful impacts and ultimately support the natural cleaning up of polluted environments 6 conclusion although investigation of microfiber pollution is challenging immediate improvement understanding of their sources transport and their remediation remains restricted due tothe quickadvancement in the field of microplastic and microfiber research there is a requirement of constancy in sampling methodologies that can beemployed to measure micro fleeces in the oceanic environment and mfs having unique characteristics are even more influenced by this as there is a hugedifference between reported microfiberconcentrations in various investigations is often impracticable or need supplementarycomputationby consideringthe assumptions the preponderance of these techniquevariations can be related to i variation in the rangeappliedii the sampling methods iii variation in sample collectionmethods there isan urgent requirement for homogenyin employed techniques due to the exceptional characteristics of these synthetic fiber particles at present we are too much depending on synthetic and cotton synthetic blend clothes thus a suitable system of regulation for evaluating the sum total of the emission from domestic and commercial sources must be established microfiber particles have been traced nearly in every aquatic habitation including fresh ocean water and sediments on sea shore around the world present days employment of sensor techniques for the rapid detection of pollutants as well as diseases has been developed quick advancement of microfiber pollution investigation is required but due to lack of reliability in detection and separation methodologies used to measure these micro pollutants in the environment these methods cannot be applied exclusively the field of microfiber pollution is in its earlier stages and there are numerous unsolved problems the solution to which is requisite to illustrate an apparent depiction of their impact on the aquatic marine flora and fauna future research is mandatory to understand the ecological inference of population growth along with this micro particle pollution in more elaborately and to establish a cost effective and efficient technique to control on site specific pollution in addition more investigation should be required for the employment of potential microbes to remediate these tiny pollutants on the other hand it can be expected that the synthetic microfiber pollution is a hazardous menace to the environment and measures to lessen their contribution towards world s pollution should be developed insinuation of tiny synthetic fiber particles constitutes a very recent modern area of the ecological sciences having specific interest of researchers as microplastic research specifically microfiber pollutants isstill in its early years there are many more unsolved questions the response to which are necessary to assemble on existing and upcoming knowledge again a clearer picture should be developed of their effect on animals particularlyon human however it is observed thatmicrofibersare a danger to the aquatic habitat and measures tocheck their entryinto all types ofaquatic system should be taken urgently declaration of

13822,biological activated carbon bac prefiltration is a common method to control fouling in ultrafiltration uf processes bac filter depth is a critical parameter for both design and operation of a prefiltration system here the effect of filter depth on the performance and mechanism of contaminant removal and uf fouling characteristics was investigated the results indicated that contaminants were mostly removed by the upper filter 0 10 cm including organics particles and protein like substances while the deeper filter 10 50 cm removed additional organics which were mostly humic like substances the upper layer intercepted particles which not only reduced the number of particles but also significantly reduced the average particle size the fouling control capability of bac prefiltration was mostly attributed to the upper filter whose function was greater than that of the deeper filter however the primary fouling mechanism did not vary with filter depth in summary during the combined process of bac prefiltration and uf when membrane fouling control is the main objective the filter layer could be set as a thin layer such as 10 cm however when the combined process needs to reduce the concentration of organic matter at the same time a thicker layer is indispensable to achieve the desired performance keywords biological activated carbon filter depth ultrafiltration membrane fouling 1 introduction green water treatment technology is a new direction for drinking water treatment as it is environmentally friendly healthy and economically viable most of the existing drinking water treatment technologies require large amounts of chemical agents such as flocculants and oxidants which affect the physical and chemical characteristics of water 1 ultrafiltration uf is a promising drinking water treatment and a green technology it has been widely applied in recent decades for the removal of particles turbidity microorganisms and pathogens in the treatment of surface water or groundwater to generate drinking water 2 3 however membrane fouling which can affect membrane productivity frequency of cleaning membrane replacement rate energy consumption and overall operation and maintenance costs is still a problem that needs to be alleviated to conduct a combined green process with uf it is necessary for the uf fouling control system to have natural purification characteristics granular media filtration including slow sand filtration rapid sand filtration and granular activated carbon filtration has been used for more than 150 years as a relatively simple and easy to operate process that turns into a biofiltration process after a certain period of time because of the growth of microorganisms 4 biofiltration pretreatment for uf is also a promising chemical free alternative to coagulation pretreatment the biofiltration purification process is similar to the natural self purification process of a water body the advantages of a process that combines biofiltration and uf namely the lack of chemical additives and sludge production and the relatively simple operation could make the combined process particularly attractive for rural or village water treatment systems 5 the combined process has been applied to treat mountain reservoir water river water and secondary effluent zheng et al used a slow sand filter as a pretreatment for a secondary effluent prior to uf and showed that the major foulants biopolymers such as proteins and polysaccharides were removed and thus the flux was improved 6 qu et al conducted a pilot scale hybrid process of biological activated carbon bac prefiltration and uf to obtain potable water in rural areas their results showed that bac pretreatment contributed to the retardation of flux decline and the increase in the stability of the flux in the hybrid process 7 parameter optimization can improve operation effectiveness for specific engineering conditions scholars have done numerous studies on the operation parameters of biofiltration prior to uf including filter material selection filtration rate empty bed contact time ebct and hydraulic loading 8 12 filter depth is another critical parameter that can affect performance of a specific biofiltration system controlled by relevant operating parameters such as filtration rate and ebct but it is a parameter that cannot be replaced by operating parameters filter depth is related to both design and operation and it also affects the overall cost of the combined process zheng et al analyzed contaminant removal in different depths of slow sand filtration but they did not treat their effluent with a subsequent uf step 13 to the best of our knowledge the impact of filter depth on fouling control in a subsequent uf process has not been systematically investigated yet it is indispensable parameter in biofiltration applications in this work bac prefiltration was operated in a stable state to control fouling of the following uf process the organics and particle characteristics of the effluent from different filter depths and the corresponding fouling characteristics were compared to achieve a much clearer understanding of the effects of filter depth on the biofiltration and uf processes the results should be valuable for the design and operation of combined biofiltration and uf water treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental system raw water was prepared to simulate surface water slightly polluted by sewage discharge 14 domestic sewage was added to local beijing china tap water with a volumetric ratio of 3 50 humic acid 2 mg l was also added to the simulated raw water slightly polluted by sewage discharge main water characteristics of the simulated water were as follows nh4 n 1 64 mg l no2 n

filter consisted of a 60 mm inner diameter plexiglas pipe with a height of 1 0 m filled with coal based granular activated carbon ruineng china to a height of 0 5 m sampling ports were placed at intervals of 10 cm along the cylinder for sampling at different heights the filtration rate was set at 1 0 m h with 0 5 h ebct which was operated with slow filtration to reduced maintenance intensity the filter was backwashed once a week and it was operated stably for more than six months so that biomass was accumulated in the activated carbon for acclimation to the water unstirred filtration tests were employed to evaluate the fouling of effluents at different depths the schematic diagram of the uf experiment is shown in fig 1 the stirred cell amicon 8400 millipore usa had a volume of 400 ml and an effective filtration area of 45 cm2 and was connected to an air pressurized solution reservoir the uf process test was performed in dead end mode at room temperature with a constant pressure of 60 kpa during the experiments the permeate flux was recorded using an electronic balance connected to a computer to record weight changes for each uf process a new hydrophilized polyethersulphone uf membrane pall usa with a molecular weight cut off of 100 kda was used prior to each filtration test the membrane was soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h and rinsed thoroughly by ultrapure water to achieve a stable flux for each test 1000 ml of the effluent from different filter depths was conducted into the system and 900 ml of the sample was filtered with the permeate flux automatically recorded by a data acquisition system membrane fouling resistance represent by r m was estimated from eqs 1 2 r m p μ j 0 where p is trans membrane pressure pa μ is fluid viscosity pa s j 0 is the

were determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 puxi china the dissolved organic carbon doc and toc were obtained with a vario toc elementar germany with the non purgeable organic carbon method samples for uv254 and doc measurements were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane before measurement turbidities were measured by a table turbidimeter 2100 n hach usa every sample was measured three times ammonia n and nitrite n were determined by the colorimetric method using a spectrometer t6 puxi china 2 2 2 particle characteristics the average particle size and particle count were measured the size distribution of the particles was measured with a particle analyzer delsanano s beckman coulter usa based on dynamic light scattering dls with a size determination range of 0 6 nm to 7 μm at 25 c the analyses were carried out in triplicate and the average result was shown the particle count was determined with an online particle counter pcx 2200 hach usa the counter could record particle sizes of 2 750 μm and the flow rate was controlled to 100 ml min by adjusting the height of the overflow port before the test of water samples circulating tap water was used for more than 2 h to wash out any particles adhered on the pipe and prevent them from affecting the test results 2 2 3 eem excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem measurements were conducted with a spectrofluorometer f 4500 hitachi japan equipped with a 150 w xenon lamp at an ambient temperature of 25 c a 1 cm quartz cuvette with four optical windows was used emission scans were performed from 220 to 550 nm at 5 nm steps with excitation wavelengths of 220 450 nm at 5 nm intervals the scanning speed was maintained at 1200 nm min the slit widths for excitation and emission were both 5 nm the fluorescence spectrum of milli q water obtained under the same conditions was subtracted from all the spectra to eliminate raman scattering from water and to reduce other background noise according to choo and lee 15 there are four typical fluorescence peaks denoted as a c t1 and t2 commonly observed in natural water and sewage peak a and c which usually appear at 320 350 nm and 230 260 400 500 nm of excitation emission wavelengths respectively are related to humic like substances derived from the plant breakdown peaks t1 and t2 are associated with protein like substances and normally occur at excitation and emission wavelengths of 225 280 nm and 310 340 nm respectively 2 3 modeling for membrane fouling process in order to identify the fouling mechanism changes after bac prefiltration four classic filtration models complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration were used 16 17 the filtration models assumptions were as follows for complete blocking it was assumed that the particles completely blocked the entrance of the pores with a single layer and water could not pass through the blocked pore for standard blocking it was assumed that particles accumulated on the walls of straight cylindrical pores and the decrease in pore volume was proportional to permeate volume intermediate blocking resembled complete blocking but assumed that some particles deposited on the top of the blocked particles for cake filtration it was assumed that particles assembled to form a uniform layer on the membrane surface and the formed layer was permeable equations for the four classic filtration models are listed in table 1 the fouling evolution of raw water and the bac effluent were fitted to the four filtration models according to equations the equation fit with the highest r2 value indicated which model best fit the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 organics removal performance the bac filter was operated stably for more than six months and ammonia removal was stable before the start of the experiment effluents were sampled at different filter depths with a steady filtration rate organics in the samples were monitored to determine the variation of organic matter removal with filter depth as shown in fig 2 at the bottom of the filter 50 cm denpth uv254 toc and doc were 57 4 52 5 and 38 6 lower respectively than the input raw water these results indicated that bac could effectively remove organics with a 50 cm filter with 30 min ebct these results show that bac prefiltration is an effective solution for the removal of organic matter which was mostly owing to the physicochemical adsorption by the activated carbon and biodegradation by the bacteria attached to the carbon particles as shown in fig 2 based on the uv254 suva toc and doc values the organics concentration decreased with the increase of filter depth in a stepwise manner organic removal rate caused by unit depth of filter named as the specific organic removal rate was determined at different filter depths based on the toc and doc measurements as shown in fig 2 b organic contaminants could be removed at any filter depth but most of them were removed by the first 30 cm of the filter the most efficient removal was in the upper layer 0 10 cm removing 48 3 of the toc and 33 9 of the doc although it was only 20 of the filter height the result indicated that organic particles could be largely removed by the upper layer 0 10 cm especially organics represented by toc at greater filter depths such as 30 50 cm the filter could continue to remove organics but with a relatively low efficiency and most of them were dissolved organics represented by humic like substances shown in fig 5 at these greater depths the removal of humic like organics also led to an increase in ph and a decrease of zeta potential the dissolved oxygen in the water samples from different filter depths shown in fig 3 can be used as an indicator of aerobic microbial action the dissolved oxygen in the raw water was 6 13 mg l which decreased to 0 78 mg l after 10 cm of filtration ammonia nitrogen was mostly oxidized to nitrate nitrogen and was stable in the larger filter depths these results indicated that aerobic microbial action mainly occurred in the carbon layer at a depth of 0 10 cm urfer et al found that the amount of biomass decreases with increasing depth and that the greatest level of removal occurs at the top of the biofilter 18 three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy was utilized to identify the chemical composition of organics in the water because of its ability to discriminate among certain classes of organic matter 19 protein like substances peak t1 and t2 and humic like substances peak a and c were found to be dominant in the raw water as shown in fig 4 the intensity reduction of the fluorescence peak between raw water and filtered water indicated a reduction of organics content when the raw water was prefiltered by bac both protein like substances 84 8 removal for t1 63 4 removal for t2 and humic like substances 74 2 removal for a 79 4 removal for c decreased dramatically again demonstrating the ability of the bac process to remove organic substances in the water the intensity of the eem peaks at different filter depths was assembled in fig 5 to show how the organic content changes with filter depth the protein like substances were mostly removed by the upper filter 0 10 cm but were also removed to a much smaller extent at greater filter depths 10 50 cm in the upper filter depth the water was high in dissolved oxygen and aerobic microorganisms were abundant leading to biodegradation of the protein like substances zheng et al observed that the removal of biopolymers took place mainly in the upper filter layer and was related to biological degradation 13 in contrast the humic like substances showed changes with filter depth that differed from those seen with the protein like substances the intensity of the eems peaks of the humic like substances decreased in a stepwise manner the stepwise decrease indicated that humic like substances were removed by the whole filter although the efficiency at greater filter depths was lower than at smaller filter depths humic like substances are mostly low molecular substances with strong hydrophobic characteristics and these substances could be absorbed by the activated carbon despite it being in an anaerobic environment deficient in microorganisms velten et al found that low molecular weight organics could be removed along the entire length of the activated carbon filter 20 this result suggests that a further increase in filter depth could lead to additional removal of humic like organic substances which is an operational approach to achieve low organic concentration in the effluent however the increase of filter depth could lead to a linear increase of ebct and previous research had found that an increase of ebct did not result in a linear decrease in organics 5 3 2 particle removal performance the particle characteristics of effluents at different filter depths were detected by turbidity particle count and average particle size as shown in fig 6 after the bac process the turbidity of its effluent was 59 6 lower than the turbidity of raw water the difference of particle removal in smaller and larger filter depths can be seen in fig 6 a b the upper layer 0 10 cm showed the biggest decrease in turbidity and particle count decreased from 3113 69 to 1312 43 a reduction of 57 9 as the filter depth increased the turbidity was further reduced but the amount of reduction decreased asymptotically in terms of particle size the average size decreased significantly in the smallest filter depth 0 10 cm and then remained almost constant at 400 nm at greater filter depths as shown in fig 6 c the uppermost filter not only caused the greatest decrease in particle count but also had the greatest effect on larger particles 500 nm 3 3 membrane fouling control the influence of bac prefiltration on the fouling of the uf filter can be seen by comparing the fouling resistance changes caused by using effluent from the bac prefilter at different filter depths raw water and the effluent from different depths were passed through the ultrafiltration membrane at an identical pressure and the resulting amount of fouling is shown in fig 7 the membrane resistance increased fastest with the raw water and was alleviated to different degrees by the prefiltered water when the water was filtered by the whole column the fouling resistance was 38 7 lower than raw water showing that the bac process was helpful for fouling control bac prefiltration was demonstrated to be an effective way to alleviate membrane fouling in other studies 7 12 21 despite those studies having different designs and operating parameters effluent water taken from different depths of the prefilter showed a similar resistance increase rate to analyze the contributions of the different filter depths curve fitting of the uf resistance of the effluents was conducted with the uf resistance from the preceding filter depth subtracted out fig 7 b there were significant differences between effluents at different depths the upper filter 0 10 cm showed the best fouling control effect which was greater than the sum of the effects of the lower filters 10 50 cm therefore fouling control of bac prefiltration was mostly attributed to the uppermost filter with the increase of the filter depth the fouling resistance decreased slowly but the amount of fouling control decreased with each increase in filter depth pramanik et al found that bac could control fouling by removal of very high molecular weight substances such as biopolymers by biodegradation and adsorption of those molecules on the biofilm 21 3 4 fouling mechanism characteristics to investigate the fouling mechanism of raw water and the prefiltered water four classic filtration models were applied to analyze the fouling process their representative equations table 1 were fitted to the experimental data and the results of regression analysis are shown in table 2 the r2 values of raw water were 0 802 0 999 0 960 and 0 991 for complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration respectively the results indicated that the fouling mechanism of raw water was mostly due to standard blocking and cake formation allowing for the possibility that intermediate blocking was involved to some extent as well moreover the r2 values of the effluents taken from different filter depths were very close to that of raw water all of the best fitting curves were standard blocking which indicated that raw water and the prefiltered effluent had an identical fouling mechanism although membrane fouling was alleviated by the prefiltration process to different degrees it did not change the fouling mechanism the standard blocking was mostly due to particles smaller than the membrane pores and cake filtration was attributed to large particles that deposited on the membrane surface while the bac process could remove some foulants the residual foulants appeared to determine the fouling mechanism the results were in accordance with masahide et al 16 who found that prefiltration could reduce the rate of membrane resistance of ultrafiltration but did not change the fouling mode 3 5 filter depth optimization filter depth is one of the most important design parameters the optimization of the filter bed depth needs to satisfy the removal of pollutants in raw water and provide membrane fouling control but must also limit the project cost as shown in this experiment when the raw water flowed downwards through the filter column under gravity contaminants were mostly removed by the upper filter 10 cm including organics particles and protein like substances across this depth aerobic microorganisms thrive in the numerous pores and gaps of the bac organic matter in the water was degraded or adsorbed by the microorganisms during the ebct of 6 min passing through the upper filter layer dissolved oxygen in the water rapidly decreased until it reached a stable level indicating that aerobic biodegradation was not dominant at greater filter depths therefore organics removal deeper in the filter 10 50 cm was mostly due to absorption by the bac demonstrated by the almost linear decrease of aromatic compounds observed in the uv254 measurements however the organic removal rate was much lower than that of the upper filter 0 10 cm as for the particulate contaminants most of them were retained by the upper filter demonstrated by the rapid decrease of both particle count and average particle size based on our experiments and analysis the upper filter is very suitable for membrane fouling control the deeper filter 10 50 cm could continue to remove residual organics with a relatively low efficiency and most of them were dissolved humic like substances in summary during the combined process of bac prefiltration and uf especially in the case of prefiltration connected directly to uf without any other pretreatment optimization of filter depth should be based on the organics concentration and fouling control if the organic concentration is acceptable for potable water optimizing the filter depth is primarily driven by membrane fouling control and a relatively thin filter such as 10 cm in this study could achieve a good result however if the organic concentration is relatively higher than in potable water and enhanced organic removal is necessary a deeper filter is needed to remove organic matter and also control membrane fouling 4 conclusion bac prefiltration is usually performed to control the fouling in uf and filter depth is a critical parameter that relates to both design and operation effluents from different filter depths were analyzed to determine their contaminant levels and fouling characteristics the primary conclusions were as follows 1 with the raw water flowing downwards through the filter column contaminants were mostly removed by the upper filter 0 10 cm including organics particles and protein like substances the deeper filters could continue decrease the organics which were mostly humic like substances 2 the upper filter 0 10 cm had the greatest effect on particle removal in terms of both particle count and average particle size 3 fouling control of the bac was mostly due to the upper filter 0 10 cm whose function was greater than the sum of the lower filters 10 50 cm however the fouling mechanism remained the same regardless of filter depth 4 during the combined process of bac prefiltration and uf when membrane fouling control is the main objective the filter layer could be set as a thin layer however when the combined process needs to reduce the concentration of organic matter at the same time a deeper filter is necessary to achieve the desired performance declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r d program of china no 2018yfd1100500 and the national water pollution control and treatment science and technology major project in china 2014zx07406002 we would like to give our sincere thanks to the

uf membrane pall usa with a molecular weight cut off of 100 kda was used prior to each filtration test the membrane was soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h and rinsed thoroughly by ultrapure water to achieve a stable flux for each test 1000 ml of the effluent from different filter depths was conducted into the system and 900 ml of the sample was filtered with the permeate flux automatically

permeate flux m3 m2 s r m is the membrane fouling resistance m 1 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 uv254 doc toc the light absorbance measured at 254 nm uv254 and the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva were determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 puxi china the dissolved organic carbon doc and toc were obtained with a vario toc elementar germany with the non purgeable organic carbon method samples for uv254 and doc measurements were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane before measurement turbidities were measured by a table turbidimeter 2100 n hach usa every sample was measured three times ammonia n and nitrite n were determined by the colorimetric method using a spectrometer t6 puxi china 2 2 2 particle characteristics the average particle size and particle count were measured the size distribution of the particles was measured with a particle analyzer delsanano s beckman coulter usa based on dynamic light scattering dls with a size determination range of 0 6 nm to 7 μm at 25 c the analyses were carried out in triplicate and the average result was shown the particle count was determined with an online particle counter pcx 2200 hach usa the counter could record particle sizes of 2 750 μm and the flow rate was controlled to 100 ml min by adjusting the height of the overflow port before the test of water samples circulating tap water was used for more than 2 h to wash out any particles adhered on the pipe and prevent them from affecting the test results 2 2 3 eem excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem measurements were conducted with a spectrofluorometer f 4500 hitachi japan equipped with a 150 w xenon lamp at an ambient temperature of 25 c a 1 cm quartz cuvette with four optical windows was used emission scans were performed from 220 to 550 nm at 5 nm steps with excitation wavelengths of 220 450 nm at 5 nm intervals the scanning speed was maintained at 1200 nm min the slit widths for excitation and emission were both 5 nm the fluorescence spectrum of milli q water obtained under the same conditions was subtracted from all the spectra to eliminate raman scattering from water and to reduce other background noise according to choo and lee 15 there are four typical fluorescence peaks denoted as a c t1 and t2 commonly observed in natural water and sewage peak a and c which usually appear at 320 350 nm and 230 260 400 500 nm of excitation emission wavelengths respectively are related to humic like substances derived from the plant breakdown peaks t1 and t2 are associated with protein like substances and normally occur at excitation and emission wavelengths of 225 280 nm and 310 340 nm respectively 2 3 modeling for membrane fouling process in order to identify the fouling mechanism changes after bac prefiltration four classic filtration models complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration were used 16 17 the filtration models assumptions were as follows for complete blocking it was assumed that the particles completely blocked the entrance of the pores with a single layer and water could not pass through the blocked pore for standard blocking it was assumed that particles accumulated on the walls of straight cylindrical pores and the decrease in pore volume was proportional to permeate volume intermediate blocking resembled complete blocking but assumed that some particles deposited on the top of the blocked particles for cake filtration it was assumed that particles assembled to form a uniform layer on the membrane surface and the formed layer was permeable equations for the four classic filtration models are listed in table 1 the fouling evolution of raw water and the bac effluent were fitted to the four filtration models according to equations the equation fit with the highest r2 value indicated which model best fit the experimental results 3 results and discussion 3 1 organics removal performance the bac filter was operated stably for more than six months and ammonia removal was stable before the start of the experiment effluents were sampled at different filter depths with a steady filtration rate organics in the samples were monitored to determine the variation of organic matter removal with filter depth as shown in fig 2 at the bottom of the filter 50 cm denpth uv254 toc and doc were 57 4 52 5 and 38 6 lower respectively than the input raw water these results indicated that bac could effectively remove organics with a 50 cm filter with 30 min ebct these results show that bac prefiltration is an effective solution for the removal of organic matter which was mostly owing to the physicochemical adsorption by the activated carbon and biodegradation by the bacteria attached to the carbon particles as shown in fig 2 based on the uv254 suva toc and doc values the organics concentration decreased with the increase of filter depth in a stepwise manner organic removal rate caused by unit depth of filter named as the specific organic removal rate was determined at different filter depths based on the toc and doc measurements as shown in fig 2 b organic contaminants could be removed at any filter depth but most of them were removed by the first 30 cm of the filter the most efficient removal was in the upper layer 0 10 cm removing 48 3 of the toc and 33 9 of the doc although it was only 20 of the filter height the result indicated that organic particles could be largely removed by the upper layer 0 10 cm especially organics represented by toc at greater filter depths such as 30 50 cm the filter could continue to remove organics but with a relatively low efficiency and most of them were dissolved organics represented by humic like substances shown in fig 5 at these greater depths the removal of humic like organics also led to an increase in ph and a decrease of zeta potential the dissolved oxygen in the water samples from different filter depths shown in fig 3 can be used as an indicator of aerobic microbial action the dissolved oxygen in the raw water was 6 13 mg l which decreased to 0 78 mg l after 10 cm of filtration ammonia nitrogen was mostly oxidized to nitrate nitrogen and was stable in the larger filter depths these results indicated that aerobic microbial action mainly occurred in the carbon layer at a depth of 0 10 cm urfer et al found that the amount of biomass decreases with increasing depth and that the greatest level of removal occurs at the top of the biofilter 18 three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy was utilized to identify the chemical composition of organics in the water because of its ability to discriminate among certain classes of organic matter 19 protein like substances peak t1 and t2 and humic like substances peak a and c were found to be dominant in the raw water as shown in fig 4 the intensity reduction of the fluorescence peak between raw water and filtered water indicated a reduction of organics content when the raw water was prefiltered by bac both protein like substances 84 8 removal for t1 63 4 removal for t2 and humic like substances 74 2 removal for a 79 4 removal for c decreased dramatically again demonstrating the ability of the bac process to remove organic substances in the water the intensity of the eem peaks at different filter depths was assembled in fig 5 to show how the organic content changes with filter depth the protein like substances were mostly removed by the upper filter 0 10 cm but were also removed to a much smaller extent at greater filter depths 10 50 cm in the upper filter depth the water was high in dissolved oxygen and aerobic microorganisms were abundant leading to biodegradation of the protein like substances zheng et al observed that the removal of biopolymers took place mainly in the upper filter layer and was related to biological degradation 13 in contrast the humic like substances showed changes with filter depth that differed from those seen with the protein like substances the intensity of the eems peaks of the humic like substances decreased in a stepwise manner the stepwise decrease indicated that humic like substances were removed by the whole filter although the efficiency at greater filter depths was lower than at smaller filter depths humic like substances are mostly low molecular substances with strong hydrophobic characteristics and these substances could be absorbed by the activated carbon despite it being in an anaerobic environment deficient in microorganisms velten et al found that low molecular weight organics could be removed along the entire length of the activated carbon filter 20 this result suggests that a further increase in filter depth could lead to additional removal of humic like organic substances which is an operational approach to achieve low organic concentration in the effluent however the increase of filter depth could lead to a linear increase of ebct and previous research had found that an increase of ebct did not result in a linear decrease in organics 5 3 2 particle removal performance the particle characteristics of effluents at different filter depths were detected by turbidity particle count and average particle size as shown in fig 6 after the bac process the turbidity of its effluent was 59 6 lower than the turbidity of raw water the difference of particle removal in smaller and larger filter depths can be seen in fig 6 a b the upper layer 0 10 cm showed the biggest decrease in turbidity and particle count decreased from 3113 69 to 1312 43 a reduction of 57 9 as the filter depth increased the turbidity was further reduced but the amount of reduction decreased asymptotically in terms of particle size the average size decreased significantly in the smallest filter depth 0 10 cm and then remained almost constant at 400 nm at greater filter depths as shown in fig 6 c the uppermost filter not only caused the greatest decrease in particle count but also had the greatest effect on larger particles 500 nm 3 3 membrane fouling control the influence of bac prefiltration on the fouling of the uf filter can be seen by comparing the fouling resistance changes caused by using effluent from the bac prefilter at different filter depths raw water and the effluent from different depths were passed through the ultrafiltration membrane at an identical pressure and the resulting amount of fouling is shown in fig 7 the membrane resistance increased fastest with the raw water and was alleviated to different degrees by the prefiltered water when the water was filtered by the whole column the fouling resistance was 38 7 lower than raw water showing that the bac process was helpful for fouling control bac prefiltration was demonstrated to be an effective way to alleviate membrane fouling in other studies 7 12 21 despite those studies having different designs and operating parameters effluent water taken from different depths of the prefilter showed a similar resistance increase rate to analyze the contributions of the different filter depths curve fitting of the uf resistance of the effluents was conducted with the uf resistance from the preceding filter depth subtracted out fig 7 b there were significant differences between effluents at different depths the upper filter 0 10 cm showed the best fouling control effect which was greater than the sum of the effects of the lower filters 10 50 cm therefore fouling control of bac prefiltration was mostly attributed to the uppermost filter with the increase of the filter depth the fouling resistance decreased slowly but the amount of fouling control decreased with each increase in filter depth pramanik et al found that bac could control fouling by removal of very high molecular weight substances such as biopolymers by biodegradation and adsorption of those molecules on the biofilm 21 3 4 fouling mechanism characteristics to investigate the fouling mechanism of raw water and the prefiltered water four classic filtration models were applied to analyze the fouling process their representative equations table 1 were fitted to the experimental data and the results of regression analysis are shown in table 2 the r2 values of raw water were 0 802 0 999 0 960 and 0 991 for complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration respectively the results indicated that the fouling mechanism of raw water was mostly due to standard blocking and cake formation allowing for the possibility that intermediate blocking was involved to some extent as well moreover the r2 values of the effluents taken from different filter depths were very close to that of raw water all of the best fitting curves were standard blocking which indicated that raw water and the prefiltered effluent had an identical fouling mechanism although membrane fouling was alleviated by the prefiltration process to different degrees it did not change the fouling mechanism the standard blocking was mostly due to particles smaller than the membrane pores and cake filtration was attributed to large particles that deposited on the membrane surface while the bac process could remove some foulants the residual foulants appeared to determine the fouling mechanism the results were in accordance with masahide et al 16 who found that prefiltration could reduce the rate of membrane resistance of ultrafiltration but did not change the fouling mode 3 5 filter depth optimization filter depth is one of the most important design parameters the optimization of the filter bed depth needs to satisfy the removal of pollutants in raw water and provide membrane fouling control but must also limit the project cost as shown in this experiment when the raw water flowed downwards through the filter column under gravity contaminants were mostly removed by the upper filter 10 cm including organics particles and protein like substances across this depth aerobic microorganisms thrive in the numerous pores and gaps of the bac organic matter in the water was degraded or adsorbed by the microorganisms during the ebct of 6 min passing through the upper filter layer dissolved oxygen in the water rapidly decreased until it reached a stable level indicating that aerobic biodegradation was not dominant at greater filter depths therefore organics removal deeper in the filter 10 50 cm was mostly due to absorption by the bac demonstrated by the almost linear decrease of aromatic compounds observed in the uv254 measurements however the organic removal rate was much lower than that of the upper filter 0 10 cm as for the particulate contaminants most of them were retained by the upper filter demonstrated by the rapid decrease of both particle count and average particle size based on our experiments and analysis the upper filter is very suitable for membrane fouling control the deeper filter 10 50 cm could continue to remove residual organics with a relatively low efficiency and most of them were dissolved humic like substances in summary during the combined process of bac prefiltration and uf especially in the case of prefiltration connected directly to uf without any other pretreatment optimization of filter depth should be based on the organics concentration and fouling control if the organic concentration is acceptable for potable water optimizing the filter depth is primarily driven by membrane fouling control and a relatively thin filter such as 10 cm in this study could achieve a good result however if the organic concentration is relatively higher than in potable water and enhanced organic removal is necessary a deeper filter is needed to remove organic matter and also control membrane fouling 4 conclusion bac prefiltration is usually performed to control the fouling in uf and filter depth is a critical parameter that relates to both design and operation effluents from different filter depths were analyzed to determine their contaminant levels and fouling characteristics the primary conclusions were as follows 1 with the raw water flowing downwards through the filter column contaminants were mostly removed by the upper filter 0 10 cm including organics particles and protein like substances the deeper filters could continue decrease the organics which were mostly humic like substances 2 the upper filter 0 10 cm had the greatest effect on particle removal in terms of both particle count and average particle size 3 fouling control of the bac was mostly due to the upper filter 0 10 cm whose function was greater than the sum of the lower filters 10 50 cm however the fouling mechanism remained the same regardless of filter depth 4 during the combined process of bac prefiltration and uf when membrane fouling control is the main objective the filter layer could be set as a thin layer however when the combined process needs to reduce the concentration of organic matter at the same time a deeper filter is necessary to achieve the desired performance declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r

13823,this study aims at investigating the iron oxidation and filtration performances of a ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr inoculated with a mixed culture of iron oxidizing acidophilic bacteria isolated from a real acid mine drainage amd the cmbr was fed with a synthetic solution containing 1400 mg l fe2 at ph 1 5 2 5 high iron oxidation performances around 97 at hrt range of 48 12 h were observed further decreasing hrt to 6 h led to significant decrease in the fe2 oxidation performances cmbr was operated at varying fluxes significant fouling was not observed provided that flux was 5 lmh or lower the mixed culture was composed of acidiphilium cryptum and alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus in addition to continuous flow experiments in cmbr fe2 oxidation experiments were conducted under batch conditions oxidation kinetics well fitted monod equation with a specific maximum iron oxidation rate and half saturation constant of around 3 35 mg fe2 g vss min and 549 mg l respectively keywords ceramic membrane bioreactor membrane bioreactor acidophilic iron oxidation acid mine drainage 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is generated by sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria due to exposure of sulfur and iron containing minerals to water and air 1 reaction 1 therefore amd has low ph 2 4 high sulfate concentration ranging from 1 to 20 g l and high concentrations of heavy metals 2 discharge of amd to receiving environment without proper treatment leads to significant negative impacts due to its highly toxic nature the formation and the negative impacts of amd may continue for several years even after closure of the mining facility 3 the following reaction describes the oxidation of pyrite 4 1 2fes2 2h2o 7o2 2fe2 4so4 2 4h the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron is illustrated below 4 2 4fe2 4h o2 4 fe3 2h2o acidophilic bacteria such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and acidithiobacillus ferrivorans can biologically oxidize reaction 2 ferrous iron to ferric iron which can further behave as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of pyrite and other sulfide bearing minerals 5 hence metals and sulfate are released in solution and generate amd 6 asta et al 7 investigated changes of mineral concentrations in water and precipitates in the acid drainage of tinto santa rosa abandoned mine spain fe and as concentrations in the downstream decreased substantially due to the oxidation of fe2 and as3 to fe3 and as5 and further precipitation iron precipitated as schwertmannite goethite and jarosite in the amd treatment generally neutralizing agents are added to precipitate the metals however bulky sludge is generated due to high concentration of iron in amd hence oxidation and further precipitation of iron at slightly low phs may decrease the sludge formation in further alkaline precipitation processes 8 after iron oxidation and precipitation at relatively low phs 3 0 4 0 amd may further be treated by sulfate reducing bacteria to recover the valuable heavy metals 9 high fe2 oxidation performance in a bioreactor mainly depends on biomass concentration which can be increased by biomass immobilization using several solid materials such as glass beads activated carbon polyurethane foam and even jarosite 8 10 in addition to amd treatment iron oxidation process may be used commercially for a number of purposes soluble fe3 has a significant oxidation power and may be used for metal extraction and recovery from sulfide bearing minerals 10 11 in bio mining operations iron oxidation step may be separated and the ferric iron is used to extract metals by oxidation hence the generated ferrous iron can be reoxidized to ferric iron by acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria in order to keep ferric iron in solution without precipitation ph is generally kept 2 10 another possible application is the use of ferric iron for the removal of h2s from biogas 12 biological oxidation of fe2 under acidic conditions has been investigated in several studies using varying types of bioreactors including fluidized bed 13 14 packed bed 10 and continuous flow 15 bioreactors in addition to laboratory scale studies pilot scale experiments were also conducted for the treatment of real amd sandström and mattsson 16 investigated iron oxidation of amd in falu copper mine in sweden as pre treatment step for subsequent metal recovery studies were conducted using three 500 l plastic material filled bioreactors connected serially the ferrous iron content and ph in amd varied 0 75 4 4 g l and 1 5 3 1 respectively the maximum oxidation rate was 750 mg l h at 35 c during the study decrease of temperature down to 25 c caused significant decrease in iron oxidation performance in another study iron oxidation was performed in a simulated heap leaching solution using leptospirillum ferriphilum dominated fluidized bed bioreactor fbr at 37 c iron oxidation performance was quite high even at hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h 13 in most of the studies acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was used for the purpose of iron oxidation however several autotrophic mixotrophic and heterotrophic acidophilic species can also oxidize iron at high rates 10 which may be possible when biomass was kept in the bioreactor at high concentrations attach growth bioreactor processes as mentioned above have been used in the literature hence the process performance depends also on the attachment ability of the selected species on the media in recent years studies have shown that membrane bioreactor mbr technology 17 can also be used to keep biomass in the bioreactor at high concentration and by this way biomass not having ability to grow on an attachment media can also be kept in the bioreactor although mbrs were studied extensively for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment its use for biological iron oxidation under acidic conditions is limited 12 environmental conditions during the iron oxidation are quite harsh due to low ph 2 and high iron concentrations recent studies illustrated that ceramic membranes might improve filtration performance and resists harsh environmental conditions due to great stability and integrity of the material 18 19 rowe and johnson 10 compared ferrous iron oxidation performance of different acidophilic species three of them were autotroph while one isolate ferrimicrobium like was heterotroph in packed bed bioreactors they reported that autotrophic ones had low cell yield and increasing biomass concentrations to high levels may require longer time compared to the heterotrophic one hence the use of acidophilic heterotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria may have advantages especially during the start up of the bioreactor 10 although several studies have been conducted on iron oxidation using mostly autotrophic bacteria as discussed above to the best of our knowledge there is no study in the literature on the iron oxidation performance of acidophilic bacteria grown in the presence of organic matter as heterotrophically or mixotrophically in an mbr equipped with ceramic membranes in this context this study aims at evaluating the robustness of a ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr for fe2 oxidation performance of a mix culture isolated from a real amd in the presence of organic matter the cmbr was operated at a moderate temperature of 23 5 2 8 c under varying hrts fluxes phs and feed fe2 concentrations batch experiments were conducted to determine the iron oxidation kinetics which may help to design pilot and real scale processes and to investigate the process feasibility in addition bacterial composition was identified using modern molecular techniques the high throughput sequencing of full 16s gene has become more common in recent years due to the rapid developments in second third generation sequencing technologies such as illumina tru seq illumina mi seq pacific biosciences oxford nanopore technologies sequencing platform these technologies are designed to remove sequencing error and combined with sophisticated denoising algorithms 20 21 therefore it is possible to discriminate among lots of sequence reads that differ by as little as one nucleotide across the entire gene 22 for this purpose the bacterial diversity harbored in the reactor was evaluated using metagenomic approach consisting of dna isolation 16s amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane bioreactor and enrichment of the mixed culture the aerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr was made of plexiglass with the dimensions of 15cm 8cm x 39 cm lxwxh the cmbr had total and active volumes of 4 7 l and 3 0 l respectively ceramic flat sheet microfiltration pore size 0 1 μm membrane with a total filtration area of 0 049 m2 14 5cm 17cm was used throughout the study the ceramic membrane cembrane made of silicon carbide is quite durable due to ph and temperature ranges of 1 13 and 5 60 c respectively the bioreactor was operated with intermittent filtration cycles of 5 min on and 1 min relaxation off the bioreactor was aerated to control the cake formation on the membrane surface and to keep dissolved oxygen concentration 3 mg l two separate pumps were used to operate the bioreactor i e one for feeding and the other one for suction trans membrane pressure tmp was monitored in the permeate line daily the bioreactor was operated at room temperature 23 5 2 8 c for 205 days the mixed culture used for the bioreactor start up was originally isolated from çan coal mine drainage located in the biga peninsula çanakkale turkey 23 the iron oxidizing bacterial culture was grown in batch mode for around one month using the synthetic feed table 1 24 25 containing fe2 25 mm required inorganic nutrients and tryptone soya broth tsb as an organic carbon source the ph of the growth media was adjusted using sulfuric acid to 1 5 2 5 during the batch growth the media was replenished when fe2 concentration decreased to around 10 mg l the continuous cmbr operation was started when the biomass concentration in the batch reactor reached to around 300 mg volatile suspended solids vss l 2 2 continuous operation of ceramic membrane bioreactor the bioreactor was continuously operated using the synthetic media given in table 1 except the days between 93 and 105 when the bioreactor operation was worsened due to operational problems which will be discussed later the feed fe2 concentration was around 1400 mg l the bioreactor was operated in continuous mode for 205 days under varying operational conditions as illustrated in table 2 tsb concentration was kept at 250 mg l except the days between 93 and 127 when tsb concentration was doubled to recover the reactor performance feed orp value averaged around 350 mv throughout the bioreactor operation in the first period of the operation hrt flux and feed ph averaged 24 h 2 55 l m2 h lmh and 2 33 0 3 respectively after observing stable performance in the bioreactor hrt was decreased to 12 h and flux was increased to 5 1 lmh in the second period in the 3rd and 4th periods feed phs were 1 72 and 1 52 respectively but the other parameters were kept constant after day 78 a technical problem in the bioreactor operation occurred which negatively affected bacterial activity and the hrt was increased to 48 h after day 87 during the period 5 permeate fe2 concentration increased significantly due to decreased reactor performance in order to recover the reactor performance and decrease the toxic effect the influent fe2 concentration was decreased in period 6 to around 650 mg l on day 93 then feed concentration was steadily increased back to 1400 mg l on day 106 at the end of period 6 similarly tsb concentration was doubled between days 93 and 127 in order to fasten the bioreactor performance recovery during the period 7 batch tests were performed in the cmbr to generate data for iron oxidation kinetics which will be explained later in the periods 8 9 and 10 hrt was decreased to 24 12 and 6 h respectively the variations of hrt and flux during the bioreactor operation were illustrated in table 2 temperature during the operation of cmbr averaged 23 5 2 8 c during the continuous cmbr operation biomass was not drawn from the bioreactor on purpose except for the routine experiments hence biomass retention time srt may be considered as infinite in the study two ceramic membranes were used not to disrupt the bioreactor operation during the membrane cleaning when the tmp exceeded around 500 mbar the membrane was changed with the chemically cleaned one and the fouled membrane was first physically cleaned under tap water and then kept in 1 m h2so4 solution for 24 h for additional chemical cleaning 2 3 batch operation of the bioreactor for kinetic studies the impact of initial fe2 concentrations 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l on the oxidation rate was evaluated in batch assays which were conducted directly in the cmbr stopping the bioreactor operation temporarily batch assays were conducted during period 7 a part of bioreactor content was filtered and the concentrated feed solution was added to have desirable feed fe2 concentration at the start of the batch assays before and during the batch assays orp values were measured and the batch assays were completed when the orp value reached to the one measured just before the experiment the fe2 concentrations were measured at different time intervals and iron oxidation rates were calculated as mg fe2 l min and mg fe2 g vss min then monod equation was applied to the data in order to model fe2 oxidation kinetics the observed monod model was analytically solved using the polymath educational 6 1 software in order to compare the experimental and model data during the model fit it was assumed that biomass concentration was constant during the batch assays as the initial biomass concentration was around 2 g vss l and the biomass growth during batch assays may be neglected 2 4 bacterial community analyses the culture was collected from the cmbr during periods 7 and 10 table 2 total dnas were extracted using purelink microbial dna purification kit invitrogen thermo scientific and the extracted dnas were controlled by gel doctm xr system with image lab software biorad the total dna was sent to a commercial sequence service bm software consultancy and lab system co ltd ankara turkey and used as a template for 16s rrna amplification amplicon sequencing was practiced by illumina miseq system v3 v4 region on the 16s rrna was targeted and amplified using primer pair for prokaryotes the pcr amplification was performed in mix solutions including pcr mix primers and total dna ampure xp beads were utilized to purify the free primers and primer dimers in the amplicon product index primers were attached the products which were cleaned up ampure xp beads validation step was completed and sequencing was carried out using illumina miseq platform 26 the analyses of the 16s amplicon sequence were performed using qiime2 2019 4 environment 27 illumina miseq platform generated paired end sequences 2 300 bp the control of forward and reverse fastqz sequence files was completed by fastqc which identified the parts of the sequences with low quality for these reads 28 the fastqz files were imported separately the command dada2 was used to filter the quality scores in these readings correct the errors and remove the chimaeras the output files of this command were table files for two readings which were separately generated then these files were merged for further analysis in the last step otu clustering feature tables phylogenetic tree and alignments files were built otu table was generated in qiime2 2019 4 closed reference clustering was carried out of otu sequence variants against the ncbi database all files obtained were visualized by qiime2 view toolbar https view qiime2 org 2 5 analyses the permeate of the cmbr was directly used for the analyses without extra filtration fe2 concentration was measured using a spectrometer by colorimetric ortho phenanthroline method according to standard methods 29 tsb concentration in the permeate was measured as cod using closed reflux method according to standard methods 29 the contribution of fe2 to cod measurement was subtracted considering that 0 14 mg o2 is required for each mg fe2 oxidation reaction 2 in the total fe measurements two different methods were used until day 136 total fe was measured using perkin elmer optima 7000 icp oes optical emission spectrophotometry after day 136 total iron concentration was measured after reducing fe3 to fe2 with ascorbic acid 30 and then measuring fe2 by colorimetric ortho phenanthroline method 29 orp and ph were measured using orp wtw multi 3420 and hach hq40d multimeter respectively suspended solid ss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations were measured according to standard methods 29 the permeate ln fe3 fe2 gave good correlation with orp data not shown similar to 16 hence fe2 concentrations in the permeate of cmbr and batch assays were also predicted using orp and total feed iron concentrations 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of fe2 oxidation performances in cmbr after enrichment of iron oxidizing bacteria in the presence of organic matter the performance of cmbr was evaluated under varying hrt ph and fe2 concentrations table 2 in the first period hrt and fe2 concentrations were 24 h and 1400 mg l the fe2 oxidation performance was quite high as the permeate fe2 concentration averaged 66 12 mg l corresponding to 95 oxidation efficiency fig 1 in the first period the feed and the permeate phs averaged 2 33 and 2 6 respectively fig 2 as illustrated in the reaction 2 fe2 oxidation is an acid consuming reaction which leads to ph increase although jarosite formation which will be discussed later may decrease the ph due to acid generation its formation was not significant in the present study under studied conditions and the permeate ph remained slightly higher than the influent ph orp values were 366 mv and 557 43 mv in the feed and permeate respectively fig 1 due to almost complete iron oxidation permeate cod corresponding to organic matter illustrated that around 70 of the tsb was oxidized during the cmbr operation in the first period ss and vss concentrations averaged 612 350 mgss l and 390 147 mgvss l respectively fig 2 during the first period of operation ss and vss concentrations showed oscillation due to adaptation and then growth of bacteria decreasing hrt in the second period did not adversely affect the reactor performance as fe2 concentration in the permeate averaged around 40 mg l corresponding to over 97 oxidation efficiency similarly cod removal performance increased significantly to 90 as noted previously the fe2 contribution to cod was eliminated subtracting the theoretical oxygen demand of fe2 from the cod measurements in the 3rd period the feed ph was decreased to around 1 72 in order to evaluate the impact of ph on the membrane filtration performance decreasing the feed ph did not affect the cmbr performance as the permeate fe2 averaged around 33 mg l 98 oxidation efficiency the permeate ph increased considerably from 1 72 0 04 to 1 9 0 1 due to acid consumption during bacterial fe2 oxidation according to reaction 2 similarly in the 4th period feed ph was decreased to 1 52 keeping all the other operational parameters constant fe2 oxidation performance stayed quite high 96 oxidation efficiency similar to previous periods hence fe2 oxidation performance was not affected from feed ph between 2 33 and 1 52 fig 1 after day 78 the cmbr could not fed and aerated for a couple of days and its performance decreased appreciably hence in the 5th period permeate fe2 concentration increased to high values and reached 728 mg l on day 85 in order to recover the cmbr performance the bioreactor was not fed on day 86 and then the hrt was increased to 48 h to recover the cmbr performance lastly the bioreactor was fed with tap water with ph 1 5 on day 92 on the 6th period the fe2 concentration in the feed decreased to around 650 mg l until day 100 and then fe2 was steadily increased to around 1250 mg l at feed ph of around 2 0 in this period the bioreactor performance was recovered as the permeate fe2 concentration averaged around 22 mg l fig 1 similarly permeate orp value and organic carbon removal performance averaged around 573 mv and 82 respectively in the 7th period days 106 163 feed fe2 concentration was increased back to 1400 mg l the tsb concentration in the feed was 0 5 g l until day 128 and then decreased back to 0 25 g l in this period the permeate fe2 concentration averaged 51 27 mg l corresponding to over 96 oxidation efficiency the average feed and permeate phs were 1 72 and 1 9 respectively fig 2 between days 156 163 the permeate fe2 and orp averaged 37 11 mg l 97 oxidation efficiency and 614 mv respectively cmbr performance was tested at decreasing hrts of 24 h 12 h and 6 h in periods 8 9 and 10 respectively in the periods 8 and 9 quite high fe2 oxidation performances were observed as the permeate concentrations averaged 12 3 2 mg l and 12 2 5 mg l respectively corresponding to higher than 99 oxidation efficiency similarly permeate orp values were 613 mv and 598 mv in the periods 8 and 9 respectively in the both periods organic matter removal efficiency was around 80 hence the bioreactor performance was quite high even hrt was decreased to 12 h lastly in the period 10 the hrt was decreased to 6 h with the corresponding flux of around 10 lmh the permeate fe2 concentration increased up to higher than 600 mg l and averaged 224 mg l similarly permeate orp value decreased down to around 470 mv when permeate fe2 concentration increased to high values fig 1 although permeate fe2 concentrations decreased below 40 mg l in the last two measurements the reactor performance was not stable hence the fe2 oxidation performance decreased appreciably with decreasing hrt to 6 h the decrease of fe2 oxidation performance at hrt of 6 h was due to exceeding the oxidation capacity of the biomass increasing biomass concentration in the bioreactor combination of biofilm and mbr processes and optimization of operational conditions may increase the oxidation capacity and even filtration performance of the cmbr this is the first study on the use of cmbr for iron oxidation at low phs in the presence of organic matter hence further studies may be needed to increase the oxidation and filtration performances of the process optimizing the bioreactor configuration and operational conditions cmbr oxidized fe2 at high performance down to 12 h of hrt and the average fe2 concentrations in the influent and permeate averaged around 1400 mg l and 12 mg l respectively corresponding to over 99 oxidation efficiency throughout the cmbr operation the feed and the permeate phs were 1 86 0 3 and 2 0 0 4 respectively when high fe2 oxidation performance was attained orp value in permeate increased up to 600 mv therefore cmbr is an effective and novel process for acidophilic iron oxidation and the process may be used in pilot scale first and then in full scale applications especially for amd treatment during the bioreactor operation both influent and total fe concentrations were measured data not shown in the influent total iron was equal to fe2 which was the sole source of iron in the feed throughout the operation excluding period 6 total feed and the permeate iron concentrations averaged 1388 27 mg l and 1382 202 mg l respectively hence at relatively low ph of around 2 0 and at temperature of 23 5 2 8 c iron precipitation may be neglected in the bioreactor which may be important for the membrane filtration performance as discussed below in detail the growth rate and the yield coefficient of acidophilic autotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria were relatively lower compared heterotrophic counterparts 10 hence the use of heterotrophic mixotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria may be advantageous especially for a quick start up of the bioprocess this may also be important for the process recovery after an upset due to relatively higher growth rate of heterotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria in the process the variation of ss and vss concentrations were illustrated in the fig 2 in the first period of the operation both ss and vss concentrations showed oscillations due to adaptation of biomass after 40 days of the operation both ss and vss increased and reached 4088 272 mg ss l and 2175 35 mg vss l respectively on day 74 due to technical problems in the bioreactor operation on day 78 the bioreactor performance decreased appreciably and both ss and vss decreased down to 2673 286 mg l and 998 152 mg l respectively on day 101 then bioreactor performance recovered and both ss and vss increased up to 8680 255 mg l and 3025 50 mg l respectively on day 190 fig 2 the observed yield coefficient was calculated for days 39 74 as 0 018 0 01 mg vss mg fe2 although organic matter may be the main carbon and energy source for bacterial growth in our study yield coefficient was calculated on iron basis just for comparison with the autotropic ones assuming bacterial formula as c5h7o2n 31 the yield coefficient may be expressed as 0 043 0 024 mmol c mmol fe in another study the yield coefficient for leptospirillum ferriphilum was reported as 6 97 109 cells g fe 32 ojumu and petersen 33 reported that the maximum yield of leptospirillum ferriphilum on iron oxidation increased with increasing ph and it was 0 01 mmol c mmol fe at ph 2 in another study the maximum yield of leptospirillum ferrooxidans on fe2 was reported as 0 0074 mmol c mmol fe 34 hence the yield values of autotrophic iron oxidizers were lower than the one calculated in our study due to the presence of organic matter in the medium although high organic matter measured as cod and iron oxidation performances were observed further studies may be needed to reveal whether the culture obtains energy from iron oxidation 3 1 1 filtration performance of cmbr the variations of tmp and flux throughout the operation were presented in the fig 3 in the first period of the operation flux was 2 55 lmh and tmp increased to 205 mbar on day 22 in the 2nd period hrt was decreased to 12 h and flux was increased to 5 1 lmh until period 5 which increased the tmp several times over 400 mbar and chemical membrane cleanings were required the tmp values in the fig 3 showed significant variations depending on the operation conditions i e flux and ph when the flux was below around 5 lmh cmbr was operated for long period of time without chemical cleaning requirement however the increase of flux to 5 1 lmh required regular chemical cleaning due to increased tmps fig 3 the permeate ph may also be important as decreasing permeate ph led to decreased tmp elevation which was deeply discussed below jarosite may form according to the reaction given below 35 and it s accumulation in the bioreactor may decrease fe2 oxidation performance 13 3 3fe3 m 2hso4 6h2o mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 8h in the reaction m refers to k na nh4 ag or h3o jarosite formation may decrease at ph 1 6 1 7 and 35 c 35 in our study jarosite formation may be decreased at temperature of 23 5 2 8 c as its formation decreases with decreasing temperature 36 decreasing feed ph from 2 1 in period 2 to 1 52 in period 4 may have improved the membrane filtration performance as only one chemical cleaning was required after day 66 in the period 4 the permeate phs averaged 2 3 0 1 1 9 0 1 and 1 79 0 2 in the periods 2 3 and 4 respectively in the periods 2 4 the flux was kept constant at 5 1 lmh and the improved filtration performance in the period 4 days 64 78 fig 3 should be due to decreased ph which kept fe in solution although the feed and the permeate total fe concentrations were almost similar as discussed before even small amount of fe containing precipitate jarosite formation may negatively affect the filtration performance which requires further study the filtration flux was decreased to 1 28 lmh for days 87 163 and tmp did not show any increase due to relatively low flux increasing flux to 2 55 lmh between days 164 and 178 did not cause any increase in the tmp however further increasing the flux to 5 1 lmh between days 179 and 193 increased the tmp steadily up to 95 mbar later increasing the flux to 10 2 lmh after day 193 caused tmp increase to quite high values which may be due to exceeding critical flux and the accumulation of foulants on the membrane and or within the pores of the membrane hence cmbr may be operated successfully up to around 5 lmh however further increase in the flux may cause membrane fouling in a short time 3 2 kinetics of iron oxidation after 142 days of operation batch kinetic experiments were conducted directly in the cmbr for this purpose cmbr operation was ceased for maximum 10 h and batch oxidation experiments were conducted at varying initial fe2 concentrations 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l the initial ratios of fe2 biomass in the batch assays ranged between 0 125 and 1 5 mg fe2 mg vss before starting the experiments feed and permeate of the cmbr were stopped until orp value and fe2 concentration in the reactor to reach 630 650 mv and 20 mg l respectively then the bioreactor was supplemented with stock feed solution and the reactor was aerated continuously during the batch tests after feeding the bioreactor with around 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l fe2 orp deceased to 509 492 474 462 and 439 mv respectively the variations of fe2 concentrations for each experiment were presented in the fig 4 it was assumed that when the orp values in the batch assays reached to around 600 mv almost complete fe2 oxidation was achieved under studied conditions hence the time required for almost complete fe2 oxidation were 120 154 276 490 and 540 min for initial fe2 concentrations of 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l respectively when the initial fe2 concentration was 250 mg l iron oxidation almost completed within around 2 h as fe2 decreased to 22 5 mg l for all the tests fe2 concentrations in the reactor were calculated using linear relation between orp and ln fe3 fe2 values the calculated and the measured fe2 concentrations gave good fit for all the batch assays data not shown similar to continuous cmbr operation fig 1 the specific oxidation rates calculated from the batch experiments were illustrated in fig 4 except for the experiment with 1500 mg l initial fe2 the specific oxidation rates increased with increasing initial fe2 concentration the monod model gave reasonable fit to the obtained rates r2 0 89 the predicted monod parameters were given below 1 d s d t q x 2 d s d t q m s x k s s 3 35 s x 549 2 s where ds dt is the fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 l min s is the fe2 concentration as mg l q specific fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 g vss min qm maximum specific fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 g vss min x is biomass concentration as g vss l and ks is half saturation constant as mg fe2 l the initial biomass concentration during the batch experiments were around 2 g vss l the obtained monod model shown in the eq 2 was solved using polymath 6 1 program the developed model nicely predicted the experimental data for all the batch tests hence the developed model may be used to design pilot and full scale processes as far as the authors knowledge this is the first study describing the kinetics of iron oxidizing bacteria in the presence of organic matter especially enriched in cmbr it is known that fe2 inhibits its oxidation at high concentrations özkaya et al 37 reported that fe2 oxidation rate increased up to 4 g l fe2 and substrate inhibition was observed at higher concentrations for l ferriphilum in our study we did not observe any self inhibitory effect which should be due to lower studied concentration range of fe2 as the maximum fe2 concentration in batch assays was 3 g l in the study of özkaya et al 37 much higher maximum specific oxidation rate 2 4 mg mg vs h was obtained with an autotrophic fe2 oxidizing bacteria of l ferriphilum at ph 1 hence kinetics showed great variation depending on the specie and even growth conditions 3 3 bacterial community composition heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria generate higher cell densities with rapid growth due to more free energy generation than lithotrophic autotrophic ones for example free energy generation from ferrous iron oxidation is quite low δg 47 kj mol compared to glucose oxidation δg 2880 kj mol 15 the cmbr was seeded with a mixed iron oxidizing acidophilic culture and operated under varying conditions in the presence of organic matter for 205 days metagenomic approach used to reveal prokaryotic diversity showed that the bacterial content in the cmbr changed during the operation bioinformatic analysis illustrated that the proportions of alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus and acidiphilium cryptum in the bacterial community were 40 and 60 at period 7 and 78 and 22 at period 10 in respective order fig 5 dominant bacterium profile changed depending on the operational conditions of the cmbr acidiphilium cryptum was dominant when hrt was 24 h and tsb was 500 mg l but the population density of alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus increased when tsb concentration decreased to 250 mg l at hrt of 6 h bacterial composition shifts during cmbr operation may be due to decreasing feed organic matter concentration and different hrts applied 38 in the periods 8 and 9 fe2 oxidation performance increased even higher than 99 which may also be related with the community changes i e the proportion of alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus in the mixed culture increased from 40 in period 7 to 78 in period 10 which deserves further study alicyclobacillus species could live in much diversified environments including geothermal spring water and acidic soil 39 the alicyclobacillus species have been reported among ferrous iron oxidizing bacteria 40 in our study the bacterial mix culture including alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus and acidiphilium cryptum were grown in a cmbr under mesophilic condition and up to 99 fe2 oxidation has been performed for acidiphilium cryptum optimal growth occurs at 30 37 c range 15 42 c and at ph 3 0 3 5 range ph 2 0 5 9 41 alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus referring to the ω cycloheptyl fatty acids can form endospore indeed the ph range for growth is 3 0 5 5 optimum ph 3 5 4 5 and the temperature range is 30 55 c 42 4 conclusions cmbr was used for the first time for fe2 oxidation in the presence of organic matter using a mixed culture originated from a real amd the bioreactor showed up to 99 fe2 oxidation performance when hrt 12 h at 1400 mg l fe2 phs 1 5 2 0 and around 24 c cmbr was successfully operated up to 5 lmh fe2 oxidation followed monod kinetics qm 3 35 mg fe2 g vss min and ks 549 mg l in the mixed culture acidiphilium cryptum and alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus were detected by metagenomics approach but their proportions showed variations as a conclusion cmbr inoculated with a mixed iron oxidizing bacteria have potential for

13823,this study aims at investigating the iron oxidation and filtration performances of a ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr inoculated with a mixed culture of iron oxidizing acidophilic bacteria isolated from a real acid mine drainage amd the cmbr was fed with a synthetic solution containing 1400 mg l fe2 at ph 1 5 2 5 high iron oxidation performances around 97 at hrt range of 48 12 h were observed further decreasing hrt to 6 h led to significant decrease in the fe2 oxidation performances cmbr was operated at varying fluxes significant fouling was not observed provided that flux was 5 lmh or lower the mixed culture was composed of acidiphilium cryptum and alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus in addition to continuous flow experiments in cmbr fe2 oxidation experiments were conducted under batch conditions oxidation kinetics well fitted monod equation with a specific maximum iron oxidation rate and half saturation constant of around 3 35 mg fe2 g vss min and 549 mg l respectively keywords ceramic membrane bioreactor membrane bioreactor acidophilic iron oxidation acid mine drainage 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd is generated by sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria due to exposure of sulfur and iron containing minerals to water and air 1 reaction 1 therefore amd has low ph 2 4 high sulfate concentration ranging from 1 to 20 g l and high concentrations of heavy metals 2 discharge of amd to receiving environment without proper treatment leads to significant negative impacts due to its highly toxic nature the formation and the negative impacts of amd may continue for several years even after closure of the mining facility 3 the following reaction describes the oxidation of pyrite 4 1 2fes2 2h2o 7o2 2fe2 4so4 2 4h the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron is illustrated below 4 2 4fe2 4h o2 4 fe3 2h2o acidophilic bacteria such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and acidithiobacillus ferrivorans can biologically oxidize reaction 2 ferrous iron to ferric iron which can further behave as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of pyrite and other sulfide bearing minerals 5 hence metals and sulfate are released in solution and generate amd 6 asta et al 7 investigated changes of mineral concentrations in water and precipitates in the acid drainage of tinto santa rosa abandoned mine spain fe and as concentrations in the downstream decreased substantially due to the oxidation of fe2 and as3 to fe3 and as5 and further precipitation iron precipitated as schwertmannite goethite and jarosite in the amd treatment generally neutralizing agents are added to precipitate the metals however bulky sludge is generated due to high concentration of iron in amd hence oxidation and further precipitation of iron at slightly low phs may decrease the sludge formation in further alkaline precipitation processes 8 after iron oxidation and precipitation at relatively low phs 3 0 4 0 amd may further be treated by sulfate reducing bacteria to recover the valuable heavy metals 9 high fe2 oxidation performance in a bioreactor mainly depends on biomass concentration which can be increased by biomass immobilization using several solid materials such as glass beads activated carbon polyurethane foam and even jarosite 8 10 in addition to amd treatment iron oxidation process may be used commercially for a number of purposes soluble fe3 has a significant oxidation power and may be used for metal extraction and recovery from sulfide bearing minerals 10 11 in bio mining operations iron oxidation step may be separated and the ferric iron is used to extract metals by oxidation hence the generated ferrous iron can be reoxidized to ferric iron by acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria in order to keep ferric iron in solution without precipitation ph is generally kept 2 10 another possible application is the use of ferric iron for the removal of h2s from biogas 12 biological oxidation of fe2 under acidic conditions has been investigated in several studies using varying types of bioreactors including fluidized bed 13 14 packed bed 10 and continuous flow 15 bioreactors in addition to laboratory scale studies pilot scale experiments were also conducted for the treatment of real amd sandström and mattsson 16 investigated iron oxidation of amd in falu copper mine in sweden as pre treatment step for subsequent metal recovery studies were conducted using three 500 l plastic material filled bioreactors connected serially the ferrous iron content and ph in amd varied 0 75 4 4 g l and 1 5 3 1 respectively the maximum oxidation rate was 750 mg l h at 35 c during the study decrease of temperature down to 25 c caused significant decrease in iron oxidation performance in another study iron oxidation was performed in a simulated heap leaching solution using leptospirillum ferriphilum dominated fluidized bed bioreactor fbr at 37 c iron oxidation performance was quite high even at hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h 13 in most of the studies acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was used for the purpose of iron oxidation however several autotrophic mixotrophic and heterotrophic acidophilic species can also oxidize iron at high rates 10 which may be possible when biomass was kept in the bioreactor at high concentrations attach growth bioreactor processes as mentioned above have been used in the literature hence the process performance depends also on the attachment ability of the selected species on the media in recent years studies have shown that membrane bioreactor mbr technology 17 can also be used to keep biomass in the bioreactor at high concentration and by this way biomass not having ability to grow on an attachment media can also be kept in the bioreactor although mbrs were studied extensively for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment its use for biological iron oxidation under acidic conditions is limited 12 environmental conditions during the iron oxidation are quite harsh due to low ph 2 and high iron concentrations recent studies illustrated that ceramic membranes might improve filtration performance and resists harsh environmental conditions due to great stability and integrity of the material 18 19 rowe and johnson 10 compared ferrous iron oxidation performance of different acidophilic species three of them were autotroph while one isolate ferrimicrobium like was heterotroph in packed bed bioreactors they reported that autotrophic ones had low cell yield and increasing biomass concentrations to high levels may require longer time compared to the heterotrophic one hence the use of acidophilic heterotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria may have advantages especially during the start up of the bioreactor 10 although several studies have been conducted on iron oxidation using mostly autotrophic bacteria as discussed above to the best of our knowledge there is no study in the literature on the iron oxidation performance of acidophilic bacteria grown in the presence of organic matter as heterotrophically or mixotrophically in an mbr equipped with ceramic membranes in this context this study aims at evaluating the robustness of a ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr for fe2 oxidation performance of a mix culture isolated from a real amd in the presence of organic matter the cmbr was operated at a moderate temperature of 23 5 2 8 c under varying hrts fluxes phs and feed fe2 concentrations batch experiments were conducted to determine the iron oxidation kinetics which may help to design pilot and real scale processes and to investigate the process feasibility in addition bacterial composition was identified using modern molecular techniques the high throughput sequencing of full 16s gene has become more common in recent years due to the rapid developments in second third generation sequencing technologies such as illumina tru seq illumina mi seq pacific biosciences oxford nanopore technologies sequencing platform these technologies are designed to remove sequencing error and combined with sophisticated denoising algorithms 20 21 therefore it is possible to discriminate among lots of sequence reads that differ by as little as one nucleotide across the entire gene 22 for this purpose the bacterial diversity harbored in the reactor was evaluated using metagenomic approach consisting of dna isolation 16s amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane bioreactor and enrichment of the mixed culture the aerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr was made of plexiglass with the dimensions of 15cm 8cm x 39 cm lxwxh the cmbr had total and active volumes of 4 7 l and 3 0 l respectively ceramic flat sheet microfiltration pore size 0 1 μm membrane with a total filtration area of 0 049 m2 14 5cm 17cm was used throughout the study the ceramic membrane cembrane made of silicon carbide is quite durable due to ph and temperature ranges of 1 13 and 5 60 c respectively the bioreactor was operated with intermittent filtration cycles of 5 min on and 1 min relaxation off the bioreactor was aerated to control the cake formation on the membrane surface and to keep dissolved oxygen concentration 3 mg l two separate pumps were used to operate the bioreactor i e one for feeding and the other one for suction trans membrane pressure tmp was monitored in the permeate line daily the bioreactor was operated at room temperature 23 5 2 8 c for 205 days the mixed culture used for the bioreactor start up was originally isolated from çan coal mine drainage located in the biga peninsula çanakkale turkey 23 the iron oxidizing bacterial culture was grown in batch mode for around one month using the synthetic feed table 1 24 25 containing fe2 25 mm required inorganic nutrients and tryptone soya broth tsb as an organic carbon source the ph of the growth media was adjusted using sulfuric acid to 1 5 2 5 during the batch growth the media was replenished when fe2 concentration decreased to around 10 mg l the continuous cmbr operation was started when the biomass concentration in the batch reactor reached to around 300 mg volatile suspended solids vss l 2 2 continuous operation of ceramic membrane bioreactor the bioreactor was continuously operated using the synthetic media given in table 1 except the days between 93 and 105 when the bioreactor operation was worsened due to operational problems which will be discussed later the feed fe2 concentration was around 1400 mg l the bioreactor was operated in continuous mode for 205 days under varying operational conditions as illustrated in table 2 tsb concentration was kept at 250 mg l except the days between 93 and 127 when tsb concentration was doubled to recover the reactor performance feed orp value averaged around 350 mv throughout the bioreactor operation in the first period of the operation hrt flux and feed ph averaged 24 h 2 55 l m2 h lmh and 2 33 0 3 respectively after observing stable performance in the bioreactor hrt was decreased to 12 h and flux was increased to 5 1 lmh in the second period in the 3rd and 4th periods feed phs were 1 72 and 1 52 respectively but the other parameters were kept constant after day 78 a technical problem in the bioreactor operation occurred which negatively affected bacterial activity and the hrt was increased to 48 h after day 87 during the period 5 permeate fe2 concentration increased significantly due to decreased reactor performance in order to recover the reactor performance and decrease the toxic effect the influent fe2 concentration was decreased in period 6 to around 650 mg l on day 93 then feed concentration was steadily increased back to 1400 mg l on day 106 at the end of period 6 similarly tsb concentration was doubled between days 93 and 127 in order to fasten the bioreactor performance recovery during the period 7 batch tests were performed in the cmbr to generate data for iron oxidation kinetics which will be explained later in the periods 8 9 and 10 hrt was decreased to 24 12 and 6 h respectively the variations of hrt and flux during the bioreactor operation were illustrated in table 2 temperature during the operation of cmbr averaged 23 5 2 8 c during the continuous cmbr operation biomass was not drawn from the bioreactor on purpose except for the routine experiments hence biomass retention time srt may be considered as infinite in the study two ceramic membranes were used not to disrupt the bioreactor operation during the membrane cleaning when the tmp exceeded around 500 mbar the membrane was changed with the chemically cleaned one and the fouled membrane was first physically cleaned under tap water and then kept in 1 m h2so4 solution for 24 h for additional chemical cleaning 2 3 batch operation of the bioreactor for kinetic studies the impact of initial fe2 concentrations 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l on the oxidation rate was evaluated in batch assays which were conducted directly in the cmbr stopping the bioreactor operation temporarily batch assays were conducted during period 7 a part of bioreactor content was filtered and the concentrated feed solution was added to have desirable feed fe2 concentration at the start of the batch assays before and during the batch assays orp values were measured and the batch assays were completed when the orp value reached to the one measured just before the experiment the fe2 concentrations were measured at different time intervals and iron oxidation rates were calculated as mg fe2 l min and mg fe2 g vss min then monod equation was applied to the data in order to model fe2 oxidation kinetics the observed monod model was analytically solved using the polymath educational 6 1 software in order to compare the experimental and model data during the model fit it was assumed that biomass concentration was constant during the batch assays as the initial biomass concentration was around 2 g vss l and the biomass growth during batch assays may be neglected 2 4 bacterial community analyses the culture was collected from the cmbr during periods 7 and 10 table 2 total dnas were extracted using purelink microbial dna purification kit invitrogen thermo scientific and the extracted dnas were controlled by gel doctm xr system with image lab software biorad the total dna was sent to a commercial sequence service bm software consultancy and lab system co ltd ankara turkey and used as a template for 16s rrna amplification amplicon sequencing was practiced by illumina miseq system v3 v4 region on the 16s rrna was targeted and amplified using primer pair for prokaryotes the pcr amplification was performed in mix solutions including pcr mix primers and total dna ampure xp beads were utilized to purify the free primers and primer dimers in the amplicon product index primers were attached the products which were cleaned up ampure xp beads validation step was completed and sequencing was carried out using illumina miseq platform 26 the analyses of the 16s amplicon sequence were performed using qiime2 2019 4 environment 27 illumina miseq platform generated paired end sequences 2 300 bp the control of forward and reverse fastqz sequence files was completed by fastqc which identified the parts of the sequences with low quality for these reads 28 the fastqz files were imported separately the command dada2 was used to filter the quality scores in these readings correct the errors and remove the chimaeras the output files of this command were table files for two readings which were separately generated then these files were merged for further analysis in the last step otu clustering feature tables phylogenetic tree and alignments files were built otu table was generated in qiime2 2019 4 closed reference clustering was carried out of otu sequence variants against the ncbi database all files obtained were visualized by qiime2 view toolbar https view qiime2 org 2 5 analyses the permeate of the cmbr was directly used for the analyses without extra filtration fe2 concentration was measured using a spectrometer by colorimetric ortho phenanthroline method according to standard methods 29 tsb concentration in the permeate was measured as cod using closed reflux method according to standard methods 29 the contribution of fe2 to cod measurement was subtracted considering that 0 14 mg o2 is required for each mg fe2 oxidation reaction 2 in the total fe measurements two different methods were used until day 136 total fe was measured using perkin elmer optima 7000 icp oes optical emission spectrophotometry after day 136 total iron concentration was measured after reducing fe3 to fe2 with ascorbic acid 30 and then measuring fe2 by colorimetric ortho phenanthroline method 29 orp and ph were measured using orp wtw multi 3420 and hach hq40d multimeter respectively suspended solid ss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations were measured according to standard methods 29 the permeate ln fe3 fe2 gave good correlation with orp data not shown similar to 16 hence fe2 concentrations in the permeate of cmbr and batch assays were also predicted using orp and total feed iron concentrations 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of fe2 oxidation performances in cmbr after enrichment of iron oxidizing bacteria in the presence of organic matter the performance of cmbr was evaluated under varying hrt ph and fe2 concentrations table 2 in the first period hrt and fe2 concentrations were 24 h and 1400 mg l the fe2 oxidation performance was quite high as the permeate fe2 concentration averaged 66 12 mg l corresponding to 95 oxidation efficiency fig 1 in the first period the feed and the permeate phs averaged 2 33 and 2 6 respectively fig 2 as illustrated in the reaction 2 fe2 oxidation is an acid consuming reaction which leads to ph increase although jarosite formation which will be discussed later may decrease the ph due to acid generation its formation was not significant in the present study under studied conditions and the permeate ph remained slightly higher than the influent ph orp values were 366 mv and 557 43 mv in the feed and permeate respectively fig 1 due to almost complete iron oxidation permeate cod corresponding to organic matter illustrated that around 70 of the tsb was oxidized during the cmbr operation in the first period ss and vss concentrations averaged 612 350 mgss l and 390 147 mgvss l respectively fig 2 during the first period of operation ss and vss concentrations showed oscillation due to adaptation and then growth of bacteria decreasing hrt in the second period did not adversely affect the reactor performance as fe2 concentration in the permeate averaged around 40 mg l corresponding to over 97 oxidation efficiency similarly cod removal performance increased significantly to 90 as noted previously the fe2 contribution to cod was eliminated subtracting the theoretical oxygen demand of fe2 from the cod measurements in the 3rd period the feed ph was decreased to around 1 72 in order to evaluate the impact of ph on the membrane filtration performance decreasing the feed ph did not affect the cmbr performance as the permeate fe2 averaged around 33 mg l 98 oxidation efficiency the permeate ph increased considerably from 1 72 0 04 to 1 9 0 1 due to acid consumption during bacterial fe2 oxidation according to reaction 2 similarly in the 4th period feed ph was decreased to 1 52 keeping all the other operational parameters constant fe2 oxidation performance stayed quite high 96 oxidation efficiency similar to previous periods hence fe2 oxidation performance was not affected from feed ph between 2 33 and 1 52 fig 1 after day 78 the cmbr could not fed and aerated for a couple of days and its performance decreased appreciably hence in the 5th period permeate fe2 concentration increased to high values and reached 728 mg l on day 85 in order to recover the cmbr performance the bioreactor was not fed on day 86 and then the hrt was increased to 48 h to recover the cmbr performance lastly the bioreactor was fed with tap water with ph 1 5 on day 92 on the 6th period the fe2 concentration in the feed decreased to around 650 mg l until day 100 and then fe2 was steadily increased to around 1250 mg l at feed ph of around 2 0 in this period the bioreactor performance was recovered as the permeate fe2 concentration averaged around 22 mg l fig 1 similarly permeate orp value and organic carbon removal performance averaged around 573 mv and 82 respectively in the 7th period days 106 163 feed fe2 concentration was increased back to 1400 mg l the tsb concentration in the feed was 0 5 g l until day 128 and then decreased back to 0 25 g l in this period the permeate fe2 concentration averaged 51 27 mg l corresponding to over 96 oxidation efficiency the average feed and permeate phs were 1 72 and 1 9 respectively fig 2 between days 156 163 the permeate fe2 and orp averaged 37 11 mg l 97 oxidation efficiency and 614 mv respectively cmbr performance was tested at decreasing hrts of 24 h 12 h and 6 h in periods 8 9 and 10 respectively in the periods 8 and 9 quite high fe2 oxidation performances were observed as the permeate concentrations averaged 12 3 2 mg l and 12 2 5 mg l respectively corresponding to higher than 99 oxidation efficiency similarly permeate orp values were 613 mv and 598 mv in the periods 8 and 9 respectively in the both periods organic matter removal efficiency was around 80 hence the bioreactor performance was quite high even hrt was decreased to 12 h lastly in the period 10 the hrt was decreased to 6 h with the corresponding flux of around 10 lmh the permeate fe2 concentration increased up to higher than 600 mg l and averaged 224 mg l similarly permeate orp value decreased down to around 470 mv when permeate fe2 concentration increased to high values fig 1 although permeate fe2 concentrations decreased below 40 mg l in the last two measurements the reactor performance was not stable hence the fe2 oxidation performance decreased appreciably with decreasing hrt to 6 h the decrease of fe2 oxidation performance at hrt of 6 h was due to exceeding the oxidation capacity of the biomass increasing biomass concentration in the bioreactor combination of biofilm and mbr processes and optimization of operational conditions may increase the oxidation capacity and even filtration performance of the cmbr this is the first study on the use of cmbr for iron oxidation at low phs in the presence of organic matter hence further studies may be needed to increase the oxidation and filtration performances of the process optimizing the bioreactor configuration and operational conditions cmbr oxidized fe2 at high performance down to 12 h of hrt and the average fe2 concentrations in the influent and permeate averaged around 1400 mg l and 12 mg l respectively corresponding to over 99 oxidation efficiency throughout the cmbr operation the feed and the permeate phs were 1 86 0 3 and 2 0 0 4 respectively when high fe2 oxidation performance was attained orp value in permeate increased up to 600 mv therefore cmbr is an effective and novel process for acidophilic iron oxidation and the process may be used in pilot scale first and then in full scale applications especially for amd treatment during the bioreactor operation both influent and total fe concentrations were measured data not shown in the influent total iron was equal to fe2 which was the sole source of iron in the feed throughout the operation excluding period 6 total feed and the permeate iron concentrations averaged 1388 27 mg l and 1382 202 mg l respectively hence at relatively low ph of around 2 0 and at temperature of 23 5 2 8 c iron precipitation may be neglected in the bioreactor which may be important for the membrane filtration performance as discussed below in detail the growth rate and the yield coefficient of acidophilic autotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria were relatively lower compared heterotrophic counterparts 10 hence the use of heterotrophic mixotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria may be advantageous especially for a quick start up of the bioprocess this may also be important for the process recovery after an upset due to relatively higher growth rate of heterotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria in the process the variation of ss and vss concentrations were illustrated in the fig 2 in the first period of the operation both ss and vss concentrations showed oscillations due to adaptation of biomass after 40 days of the operation both ss and vss increased and reached 4088 272 mg ss l and 2175 35 mg vss l respectively on day 74 due to technical problems in the bioreactor operation on day 78 the bioreactor performance decreased appreciably and both ss and vss decreased down to 2673 286 mg l and 998 152 mg l respectively on day 101 then bioreactor performance recovered and both ss and vss increased up to 8680 255 mg l and 3025 50 mg l respectively on day 190 fig 2 the observed yield coefficient was calculated for days 39 74 as 0 018 0 01 mg vss mg fe2 although organic matter may be the main carbon and energy source for bacterial growth in our study yield coefficient was calculated on iron basis just for comparison with the autotropic ones assuming bacterial formula as c5h7o2n 31 the yield coefficient may be expressed as 0 043 0 024 mmol c mmol fe in another study the yield coefficient for leptospirillum ferriphilum was reported as 6 97 109 cells g fe 32 ojumu and petersen 33 reported that the maximum yield of leptospirillum ferriphilum on iron oxidation increased with increasing ph and it was 0 01 mmol c mmol fe at ph 2 in another study the maximum yield of leptospirillum ferrooxidans on fe2 was reported as 0 0074 mmol c mmol fe 34 hence the yield values of autotrophic iron oxidizers were lower than the one calculated in our study due to the presence of organic matter in the medium although high organic matter measured as cod and iron oxidation performances were observed further studies may be needed to reveal whether the culture obtains energy from iron oxidation 3 1 1 filtration performance of cmbr the variations of tmp and flux throughout the operation were presented in the fig 3 in the first period of the operation flux was 2 55 lmh and tmp increased to 205 mbar on day 22 in the 2nd period hrt was decreased to 12 h and flux was increased to 5 1 lmh until period 5 which increased the tmp several times over 400 mbar and chemical membrane cleanings were required the tmp values in the fig 3 showed significant variations depending on the operation conditions i e flux and ph when the flux was below around 5 lmh cmbr was operated for long period of time without chemical cleaning requirement however the increase of flux to 5 1 lmh required regular chemical cleaning due to increased tmps fig 3 the permeate ph may also be important as decreasing permeate ph led to decreased tmp elevation which was deeply discussed below jarosite may form according to the reaction given below 35 and it s accumulation in the bioreactor may decrease fe2 oxidation performance 13 3 3fe3 m 2hso4 6h2o mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 8h in the reaction m refers to k na nh4 ag or h3o jarosite formation may decrease at ph 1 6 1 7 and 35 c 35 in our study jarosite formation may be decreased at temperature of 23 5 2 8 c as its formation decreases with decreasing temperature 36 decreasing feed ph from 2 1 in period 2 to 1 52 in period 4 may have improved the membrane filtration performance as only one chemical cleaning was required after day 66 in the period 4 the permeate phs averaged 2 3 0 1 1 9 0 1 and 1 79 0 2 in the periods 2 3 and 4 respectively in the periods 2 4 the flux was kept constant at 5 1 lmh and the improved filtration performance in the period 4 days 64 78 fig 3 should be due to decreased ph which kept fe in solution although the feed and the permeate total fe concentrations were almost similar as discussed before even small amount of fe containing precipitate jarosite formation may negatively affect the filtration performance which requires further study the filtration flux was decreased to 1 28 lmh for days 87 163 and tmp did not show any increase due to relatively low flux increasing flux to 2 55 lmh between days 164 and 178 did not cause any increase in the tmp however further increasing the flux to 5 1 lmh between days 179 and 193 increased the tmp steadily up to 95 mbar later increasing the flux to 10 2 lmh after day 193 caused tmp increase to quite high values which may be due to exceeding critical flux and the accumulation of foulants on the membrane and or within the pores of the membrane hence cmbr may be operated successfully up to around 5 lmh however further increase in the flux may cause membrane fouling in a short time 3 2 kinetics of iron oxidation after 142 days of operation batch kinetic experiments were conducted directly in the cmbr for this purpose cmbr operation was ceased for maximum 10 h and batch oxidation experiments were conducted at varying initial fe2 concentrations 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l the initial ratios of fe2 biomass in the batch assays ranged between 0 125 and 1 5 mg fe2 mg vss before starting the experiments feed and permeate of the cmbr were stopped until orp value and fe2 concentration in the reactor to reach 630 650 mv and 20 mg l respectively then the bioreactor was supplemented with stock feed solution and the reactor was aerated continuously during the batch tests after feeding the bioreactor with around 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l fe2 orp deceased to 509 492 474 462 and 439 mv respectively the variations of fe2 concentrations for each experiment were presented in the fig 4 it was assumed that when the orp values in the batch assays reached to around 600 mv almost complete fe2 oxidation was achieved under studied conditions hence the time required for almost complete fe2 oxidation were 120 154 276 490 and 540 min for initial fe2 concentrations of 250 500 1000 1500 and 3000 mg l respectively when the initial fe2 concentration was 250 mg l iron oxidation almost completed within around 2 h as fe2 decreased to 22 5 mg l for all the tests fe2 concentrations in the reactor were calculated using linear relation between orp and ln fe3 fe2 values the calculated and the measured fe2 concentrations gave good fit for all the batch assays data not shown similar to continuous cmbr operation fig 1 the specific oxidation rates calculated from the batch experiments were illustrated in fig 4 except for the experiment with 1500 mg l initial fe2 the specific oxidation rates increased with increasing initial fe2 concentration the monod model gave reasonable fit to the obtained rates r2 0 89 the predicted monod parameters were given below 1 d s d t q x 2 d s d t q m s x k s s 3 35 s x 549 2 s where ds dt is the fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 l min s is the fe2 concentration as mg l q specific fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 g vss min qm maximum specific fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 g vss min x is biomass concentration as g vss l and ks is half saturation constant as mg fe2 l the initial biomass concentration during the batch experiments were around 2 g vss l the obtained monod model shown in the eq 2 was solved using polymath 6 1 program the developed model nicely predicted the experimental data for all the batch tests hence the developed model may be used to design pilot and full scale processes as far as the authors knowledge this is the first study describing the kinetics of iron oxidizing bacteria in the presence of organic matter especially enriched in cmbr it is known that fe2 inhibits its oxidation at high concentrations özkaya et al 37 reported that fe2 oxidation rate increased up to 4 g l fe2 and substrate inhibition was observed at higher concentrations for l ferriphilum in our study we did not observe any self inhibitory effect which should be due to lower studied concentration range of fe2 as the maximum fe2 concentration in batch assays was 3 g l in the study of özkaya et al 37 much higher maximum specific oxidation rate 2 4 mg mg vs h was obtained with an autotrophic fe2 oxidizing bacteria of l ferriphilum at ph 1 hence kinetics showed great variation depending on the specie and even growth conditions 3 3 bacterial community composition heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria generate higher cell densities with rapid growth due to more free energy generation than lithotrophic autotrophic ones for example free energy generation from ferrous iron oxidation is quite low δg 47 kj mol compared to glucose oxidation δg 2880 kj mol 15 the cmbr was seeded with a mixed iron oxidizing acidophilic culture and operated under varying conditions in the presence of organic matter for 205 days metagenomic approach used to reveal prokaryotic diversity showed that the bacterial content in the cmbr changed during the operation bioinformatic analysis illustrated that the proportions of alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus and acidiphilium cryptum in the bacterial community were 40 and 60 at period 7 and 78 and 22 at period 10 in respective order fig 5 dominant bacterium profile changed depending on the operational conditions of the cmbr acidiphilium cryptum was dominant when hrt was 24 h and tsb was 500 mg l but the population density of alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus increased when tsb concentration decreased to 250 mg l at hrt of 6 h bacterial composition shifts during cmbr operation may be due to decreasing feed organic matter concentration and different hrts applied 38 in the periods 8 and 9 fe2 oxidation performance increased even higher than 99 which may also be related with the community changes i e the proportion of alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus in the mixed culture increased from 40 in period 7 to 78 in period 10 which deserves further study alicyclobacillus species could live in much diversified environments including geothermal spring water and acidic soil 39 the alicyclobacillus species have been reported among ferrous iron oxidizing bacteria 40 in our study the bacterial mix culture including alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus and acidiphilium cryptum were grown in a cmbr under mesophilic condition and up to 99 fe2 oxidation has been performed for acidiphilium cryptum optimal growth occurs at 30 37 c range 15 42 c and at ph 3 0 3 5 range ph 2 0 5 9 41 alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus referring to the ω cycloheptyl fatty acids can form endospore indeed the ph range for growth is 3 0 5 5 optimum ph 3 5 4 5 and the temperature range is 30 55 c 42 4 conclusions cmbr was used for the first time for fe2 oxidation in the presence of organic matter using a mixed culture originated from a real amd the bioreactor showed up to 99 fe2 oxidation performance when hrt 12 h at 1400 mg l fe2

alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus were detected by metagenomics approach but their proportions showed variations as a conclusion cmbr inoculated with a mixed iron oxidizing bacteria have potential for

13824,immobilized microalgae have been utilized for various bioprocesses that yield biofuels and high value products various alginate solutions ranging from 0 5 to 5 0 were investigated to develop microalgae immobilization technology high intracellular density 3 94 4 89 g cm3 and compressive strength 447 602 g immobilized chlorella vulgaris wu g22 g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 g23 microalgae granules with 3 0 alginate solution could be obtained after 10 days cultivation using textile wastewater in addition effective removal of superfluous biological and chemical pollutants was cultured under mixotrophic conditions for immobilized g22 and g23 using textile wastewater after 7 days efficiencies of nh4 n cod and color removal were all greater than 50 by using immobilized microalgae g23 with static cultivation the present study confirmed that microalgal alginate bio beads granular are one of the alternatives for defeating microalgae harvesting issues in larger scale production where the microalgal cells stick to each other on external surfaces keywords chlorella species textile wastewater immobilization mixotrophic pollutant removal 1 introduction microalgae is a promising replacement for terrestrial crops as biofuels feedstock mainly because of their high growth rates yields higher photosynthetic efficiencies minimal land occupation for plantation and high environmental tolerance they can survive in saline waters and water deficit areas 1 moreover microalgae biomass produces distinctively lower greenhouse gas emission as compared to the conventional first generation biofuels feedstock 2 microalgal biomass can be utilized to produce various biofuels such as biohydrogen biomethane bioethanol and biobutanol through biochemical and thermochemical conversion pathways a cost effective method for feedstock production plays a significant role to commercialize the microalgal biofuel however the organic carbons source and growth medium for microalgae cultivation incurs the basic costs in microalgal biofuel production recently pursuing for a cost effective microalgae culture media source is gaining more attention 3 among many types of cultivation methods mixotrophic culture is an encouraging technology that enhances light utilization and reduces the energy costs for microalgae production 4 different wastewater sources such as dairy wastewater municipal wastewater saline wastewater and brewery wastewater were already examined for biofuel production via mixotrophic culture 5 8 although many types of industrial wastewater were examined understanding on textile industry wastewater for mixotrophic culture remains scarce textile industry is an important traditional industry in the world its effluent typically contains high concentration of organic materials dyes and other nutrients these substances could potentially lead to serious environmental pollution if it is not treated appropriately there are several microalgal species typically adopted for the wastewater treatment such as chlorella scenedesmus and spirulina 9 11 lim et al 12 reported a study on c vulgaris umacc 001 and chlorella cultivation with various concentrations of textile wastewater 20 40 60 80 and 100 it was shown that chlorella sp could grow in the undiluted textile wastewater but the final biomass was lower than that from 20 to 80 concentration textile wastewater furthermore the nh4 n concentration in the textile waste water was lowered by approximately 50 after 12 cultivation days microbial immobilization technology on the other hand refers to the imprisonment of microorganisms in a confined space with conservation of their biological activities thus elevating the cell density promoting subtract exchange and also enabling cell reutilization within the medium canedo lópez et al 10 demonstrated the preeminence of immobilization method where 94 phosphate and 78 ammonium expulsion efficiencies were achieved with immobilized c vulgaris captured in calcium alginate globules as compared to only 59 phosphate and 40 ammonium removal with suspended cells there are several types of polymers commonly used for microalgae immobilization methods these include chitosan alginate and carrageenan 13 16 where alginate bead was identified as a favourable polymer option for use in microalgae immobilization methods 15 17 alginate was first discovered in 1881 it is one of the most abundant natural biosynthetic materials for hydrophilic polysaccharides mainly derived from two major sources of marine plants brown seaweed and bacteria commercially brown algae are the main sources of alginate including laminaria hyperborean ascophyllum modicum and macrocystispyrifera it was reported that alginate could enhance cell survival and growth 17 and showed positive effect on the prepared microalgal chlorella sp cell granules 15 17 moreover it was also demonstrated that immobilized algal cell particles exhibited remarkable ability in removing nutrients 14 18 19 due to the rich microalgae water content the alginate can be biocompatible with biodegradable materials presenting a non toxic and cost effective way of water treatment such attributes are essential for textile wastewater treatment as textile wastewater may contain toxic element that inhibits the microorganism activity de bashan et al 17 reported higher phosphate and ammonium removal using c vulgaris microalgae co immobilized with bacterium azospirillum brasilense in alginate globules as opposed to immobilized c vulgaris cells alone 19 moreover c vulgaris species cells immobilized inside sodium alginate matrix indicated higher nutrient expulsion efficiencies from sewage wastewater this is in contrast with their remotely immobilized counterparts on polyurethane froth 17 meanwhile lau et al 15 observed higher phosphate 99 and ammonium 95 expulsion efficiencies for c vulgaris cells immobilized in alginate globules bringing about 50 phosphate and 50 ammonium expulsion interestingly nannochloropsis sp suspended cells carried out higher phosphorus aggregate removal concerning their immobilized cells inside the calcium alginate granular cells 20 the immobilization technique for textile effluent is limited hence the study on the mixotrophic culture for immobilized microalgal species at various diluted textile wastewater is important to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneously removing textile wastewater pollutants and accumulating lipids in the microalgae biomass in this study the potential of microalgae to assimilate nutrients from textile wastewater was evaluated despite the composition of textile wastewater varying with sources the experimental data obtained from this study can contribute to the new addition for the database of microalgae cultivation via textile wastewater moreover the textile wastewater composition used in this study can also serve as a reference to form synthetic culture medium which can be used to adapt the wastewater treatment in actual textile wastewater plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae collection and algal strain identification seawater samples were collected around taiwan sea coast and stored in sterilized tubes these tubes were isolated in the laboratory within 3 days upon collection to ensure microalgal cell growth walne s medium plates containing raw seawater agar 18 g l and glucose 1 g l were cultured at 30 c for 2 7 days then a single colony was extracted and transferred carefully to a new plate individually isolated chlorella vulgaris wu g22 g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 g23 were cultivated in sterilized textile wastewater to study the microalgae growth and lipids accumulation 2 2 textile wastewater textile wastewater was collected from textile mill in miaoli county taiwan the raw textile wastewater exhibits chemical oxygen demand cod of 4458 mg l ph 10 5 phosphate 22 3 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 28 35 mg l and true color american dye manufacturers institute admi 920 2 3 microalgae immobilization various sodium alginate solution of 0 5 1 0 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 were prepared and sterilized at 110 c for 10 min to investigate the effect of alginate concentration on granular cell strength the sterilized sodium alginate solutions were mixed with the concentrated microalgae solution and then spun with 5400 g at the room temperature ca 25 c mixed sodium alginate and microalgae solution was filled into a syringe and injected into 40 g l cac12 solution to form the immobilized granular cells with ca 4 3 mm diameter the immobilized cells were washed with de ionized di water and then kept at room temperature for 1 day 2 4 experimental design these two microalgae species chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 were grown in a glass tube with 20 ml for 7 days liquid samples were collected every day for microalgae biomass concentration ph colorization nh4 n concentration and microalgae biomass lipid content determination during microalgae growth the detail description of the experimental design is shown as followed 2 4 1 effects of alginate concentration on granular cell the chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 were immobilized with the various sodium alginate solution of 0 5 1 0 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 then the immobilized microalgal granular were grown using raw textile wastewater and adding extra k2hpo4 8 mg l and urea 1 g l to fit the optimal phosphate and nitrogen sources respectively for growing these microalgae the cultivation parameters for these two microalgae were initial ph 8 0 temperature 30 c and light intensity 4300 lx to exponential seed culture growth both aeration and static without aeration conditions were adopted during microalgae cultivation air was sprayed with 2 vvm for aeration 2 4 2 effects of textile wastewater concentration the immobilized chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 with the optimal sodium alginate solution of 3 0 were grown using various dilution ratio no dilution 0 10 20 40 60 80 of the textile wastewater to investigate the effects of the textile wastewater concentration extra k2hpo4 8 mg l and urea 1 g l were also added in this experiment the cultivation parameters for these two microalgae were initial ph 8 0 temperature 30 c and light intensity 4300 lx to exponential seed culture growth both aeration and static without aeration conditions were adopted during microalgae cultivation air was sprayed with 2 vvm for aeration 2 5 analytical methods biomass concentration was determined by measuring the od of each sample at 680 nm od680 with a spectrophotometer genesys 20 thermo a standard curve was plotted to reveal the relationship between the dry cell weights and od values the standard analytical procedures described in our previous study were adopted to determine ph cod and true color 21 for the nh₄ n measurement method 2 ml liquid sample was mixed with 1 ml sodium tungstate 10 and 1 n sulphuric acid then the mixed liquid was centrifuged with 600 g for 10 min the supernatant 0 5 ml was reacted with 2 5 ml the mixing solution of solution 1 phenol 10 g and sodium nitroprusside 50 mg into 1 l di water and solution 2 sodium hydroxide 5 g na2hpo4 12h2o 53 7 g and 10 ml sodium hypochlorite 10 14 cl into 1 l di water at 37 c for 35 min finally the reacted sample was detected nh₄ n concentration was measured by a spectrophotometry with wave length 625 nm scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6700 f jeol tokyo japan was applied to observe the microalgae growth on the surface of immobilized beads the immobilized cell beads were dried on a filter paper before the diameter of beads dp 2r was measured microscopically with a vernier scale micrometer the density of the immobilized cell beads could be calculated using eqs 1 1 ρ p w p v p where wp is the weight of the immobilized cell beads vp are the volumes of the immobilized cell beads the volumes of the immobilized cell beads were calculated using eqs 2 2 v p 1 6 π d p 3 2 6 total lipid extraction and fatty methyl esters and fatty acid analysis extraction and analysis of total lipid fatty methyl esters were based on the methods reported in our previous study 21 3 results 3 1 effects of alginate concentration on physical characteristics of granular cells fig 1 shows that alginate solution concentration of 0 5 led to unsatisfactory granular cell formation as indicated by the irregular cell s shape by increasing the alginate solution concentration to 1 0 the granular cell formation was enhanced but the cell structure remained soft and weak the viscosity of the alginate solution was increased as alginate concentrations was higher than 1 5 high alginate solution viscosity would undesirably lead to blockage in the syringe nonetheless low alginate concentration is not desirable as well it was reported in a previous study that the granules prepared with a lower alginate concentration 2 resulted in irregular in shape and weakened granule strength 22 the particle diameters of the immobilized granular cells were about 4 3 mm in diameter as alginate solution concentration varied from 1 0 to 5 0 higher alginate concentration led to enhanced alginate granule strength as viscosity of the prepared particles increased with an alginate concentration of about 3 5 5 0 granules formation would also take longer time considering these the present alginate concentration for the immobilized microalgae cells was set as 3 0 table 1 shows the granule characteristics for chlorella vulgaris wu g22 g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 g23 immobilized matrix with 3 alginate solution the g22 and g23 granules were prepared as regular shaped granules with a diameter of about 4 3 mm with intra particle cell densities of 2 84 0 03 g cm3 0 0104 0 006 g biomass g beads and 3 58 0 02 g cm3 0 0087 0 003 g biomass g beads respectively the granule strengths were 602 3 63 8 and 447 3 63 6 g respectively after 10 days of cultivation with appropriate medium light intensity and temperature the g22 and g23 granules became deep green and there was no obvious physical change when compared with the initial granules however the intracellular density of the g22 and g23 granules was increased significantly by 3 94 0 04 and 4 89 0 05 g cm3 respectively the g22 and g23 granule strength was also considerably increased by 805 9 11 6 and 781 3 17 9 g respectively fig 2 shows the morphological cross linking state and growth of the g22 and g23 microalgal cell granules before and after cultivation using scanning electron microscopy sem sem photographs in fig 2 shows that immobilized granular cells cultured on the 10th day exhibit denser pore structure larger size higher cells number and higher particle density than 0th day this indicates that the microalgae granular cells internal density after 10th days cultivation was higher than their initial density signifying the formations of internal cross linking of g22 and g23 particles occurs after 10 days fig 3 shows that both immobilized granules and suspended methods biomass in bulk produced noticeable biomass growth from day 0 to day 10 nonetheless immobilized granules exhibited marginally higher growth rate than suspension method from day 0 to day 8 for both g22 and g23 lim et al 12 reported that alginate immobilized chlorella sp and granules are more effective than the chlorella sp suspension cells in waste water removal this is mainly due to microalgae forms bio beads on their surface which can secrete extracellular polymeric substances composed mainly of phospholipids proteins polysaccharides and extracellular dna moieties moreover immobilization technique limits cells activities thus giving rise to their overall metabolism and anabolic activities over the suspension method 12 however the growth rate for suspended method surpassed immobilization for g22 after day 9 and g23 after day 8 respectively this is presumably due to the increased average cell diameter in a confined and limited space that led to very high microalgal density constraining the growth of microalgal 12 microalgae growth can also be reflected by the increased in compressive strengths of g22 and g23 granules with cultivation days as illustrated in fig 4 the compressive strengths of microalgae granular is important during continuously cultivation both g22 and g23 granules which were formed by the immobilization technology in this study could be maintained the granules sharp and kept high compressive strengths 3 2 mixotrophic culture at various textile wastewater concentrations previous study showed that microalgae immobilized cell technology not only promoted nutrients uptake but also achieved cost effective tertiary wastewater treatment 14 as such this study intends to investigate the effects of g22 and g23 immobilized granular cells on nh4 n cod and color removal and lipid accumulation under various textile wastewater concentrations standardizing the textile wastewater treatment process from many textile mills is very complicated where wastewater of different sources has different deep color degree of salinity temperature cod and large ph variation meanwhile when using wastewater to cultivate microalgae it is necessary to consider that the water chromaticity would inhibit light penetration during culture thus concentrated textile wastewater may result in less significant immobilized granule s removal efficiency on the other hand diluting the textile wastewater is cost intensive and it may not be suitable for microalgae growth anymore fig 5 depicts the wastewater treatment performance of the immobilized chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 granules with aeration and without aeration at different dilution ratios in textile wastewater it is shown that ph value for g22 and g23 did not change significantly on the final culture days under aeration and static conditions meanwhile g22 and g23 immobilized granules under both aeration and static conditions almost produce noticeably higher nh4 n removal efficiency than suspended cells except the g23 at lower dilution rate under static conditions similar nh4 n removal performance enhanced nutrient expulsion efficiencies are due to the improved photosynthetic rate of the cells and the ionic interaction between the nutrient particles and the immobilized matrices gels that are anionic in nature carrageenan normally has with the adsorption of cations like ammonium nh4 while cationic gels chitosan promote adsorption of anions like phosphate po4 3 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 with higher efficiencies 23 in addition calcium alginate particles or chitosan gels are especially productive for the removal of po4 3 particles from wastewaters 15 many studies reported microalgae has ability to decolorize and degrade the textile dyes 12 24 the main mechanisms including bioadsorption bioaccumulation biocoagulation and bioconversion were involved in wastewater bioremediation using microalgae 25 our previous study 26 studied the potential mechanism for the textile treatment by the active and nonviable microalgae g23 the active immobilized and suspended g23 obviously have ability to remove the pollutants including nh4 n cod and color compared to the nonviable g23 this result reveal the active microalgae make a significant contribution to nutrient utilization in the textile wastewater whether suspended or immobilized cultivation fig 5b shows that g22 immobilized granules under both aeration and static conditions produce an obviously higher nh4 n removal efficiency than suspended cells in terms of cod removal the wastewater diluted to 0 40 under aeration conditions has higher efficiency 60 than the value ca 50 of the suspended cells no significant difference between immobilized granules and suspended cultures was observed under the static conditions in terms of color removal the immobilized granular cells and suspension cells did not have a significant removal effect under aeration and static conditions in fig 5b the g23 depicts that the ph value did not change significantly on the final culture days under aeration and static conditions nh4 n removal for immobilized granules under aeration was averaging 75 regardless of the level of dilution under the static conditions however nh4 n removal increased progressively from 30 to nearly 90 while the wastewater dilution ratio increased from 10 to 80 the suspended cells and immobilized granules under aeration conditions produced a removal efficiency of averaging 60 for cod removal efficiency under the static conditions the immobilized granular cells have obviously higher removal efficiency than the suspended cells the color removal efficiency was observed to be higher when using 80 diluted textile wastewater under aeration and static conditions the different pollutant removal efficiency between g22 and g23 may be caused by the difference of growth rate and also the mass transformation in microalgae granules higher cod removal in the immobilized granules can be attributed to the enhanced metabolism of microalgae as compared to suspension cells thus consuming more carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and producing more dissolved oxygen in the water as a results 27 fig 6 show total fatty acid methyl ester fame for g22 and g23 under aeration and static conditions overall the total fames content of immobilized granules was greater than the suspended cells meanwhile considerable portion of the fame was c18 and above improved anabolic activity of immobilized granules over the suspended cells inherently elevates the lipid contents waste water dilution 80 generally resulted in lowest lipid contents this is presumably due to the reduction of nutrients as waste water is over diluted 28 29 the aeration culture yield more unsaturated c18 fame than without aeration culture this is due to the without oxygenation in the waste water affected the lipid metabolite in the microalgae cytoplasm to produce lipid as waste water dilution varied from 0 to 80 the yield of c18 0 c18 1 and c16 0 increased noticeably for cultivation with and without aeration this is presumably affected by the cell lipid metabolite cycle 28 29 4 conclusions the performance of wastewater treatment and lipid accumulation using immobilized microalgal alginate bio beads granular were examined in this study the microalgae species viz chlorella vulgaris wu g22 chlorella sp wu g23 were collected and isolated from seawater around taiwan sea coast the immobilized granular cells showed consistently higher microalgal biomass growth over the suspension method from day 0 to day 8 as compared to day 0 the immobilized granular cells showed denser pore structure larger size higher cells number and higher particle density on day 10 the preset research shows that immobilized microalgae of both g22 and g23 with static cultivation resulted in nh4 n cod and color removal efficiencies as high as 90 75 and 60 respectively moreover raw textile wastewater without dilution led to the highest fames accumulation in the microalgae biomass compared to the diluted textile wastewater significant portion of the fame produced was c18 and c20 the immobilized technique produced only slightly higher lipids than suspended method this research shows that immobilized microalgal alginate bio beads granular offers a promising way of removing pollutant in waste water and lipid

13824,immobilized microalgae have been utilized for various bioprocesses that yield biofuels and high value products various alginate solutions ranging from 0 5 to 5 0 were investigated to develop microalgae immobilization technology high intracellular density 3 94 4 89 g cm3 and compressive strength 447 602 g immobilized chlorella vulgaris wu g22 g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 g23 microalgae granules with 3 0 alginate solution could be obtained after 10 days cultivation using textile wastewater in addition effective removal of superfluous biological and chemical pollutants was cultured under mixotrophic conditions for immobilized g22 and g23 using textile wastewater after 7 days efficiencies of nh4 n cod and color removal were all greater than 50 by using immobilized microalgae g23 with static cultivation the present study confirmed that microalgal alginate bio beads granular are one of the alternatives for defeating microalgae harvesting issues in larger scale production where the microalgal cells stick to each other on external surfaces keywords chlorella species textile wastewater immobilization mixotrophic pollutant removal 1 introduction microalgae is a promising replacement for terrestrial crops as biofuels feedstock mainly because of their high growth rates yields higher photosynthetic efficiencies minimal land occupation for plantation and high environmental tolerance they can survive in saline waters and water deficit areas 1 moreover microalgae biomass produces distinctively lower greenhouse gas emission as compared to the conventional first generation biofuels feedstock 2 microalgal biomass can be utilized to produce various biofuels such as biohydrogen biomethane bioethanol and biobutanol through biochemical and thermochemical conversion pathways a cost effective method for feedstock production plays a significant role to commercialize the microalgal biofuel however the organic carbons source and growth medium for microalgae cultivation incurs the basic costs in microalgal biofuel production recently pursuing for a cost effective microalgae culture media source is gaining more attention 3 among many types of cultivation methods mixotrophic culture is an encouraging technology that enhances light utilization and reduces the energy costs for microalgae production 4 different wastewater sources such as dairy wastewater municipal wastewater saline wastewater and brewery wastewater were already examined for biofuel production via mixotrophic culture 5 8 although many types of industrial wastewater were examined understanding on textile industry wastewater for mixotrophic culture remains scarce textile industry is an important traditional industry in the world its effluent typically contains high concentration of organic materials dyes and other nutrients these substances could potentially lead to serious environmental pollution if it is not treated appropriately there are several microalgal species typically adopted for the wastewater treatment such as chlorella scenedesmus and spirulina 9 11 lim et al 12 reported a study on c vulgaris umacc 001 and chlorella cultivation with various concentrations of textile wastewater 20 40 60 80 and 100 it was shown that chlorella sp could grow in the undiluted textile wastewater but the final biomass was lower than that from 20 to 80 concentration textile wastewater furthermore the nh4 n concentration in the textile waste water was lowered by approximately 50 after 12 cultivation days microbial immobilization technology on the other hand refers to the imprisonment of microorganisms in a confined space with conservation of their biological activities thus elevating the cell density promoting subtract exchange and also enabling cell reutilization within the medium canedo lópez et al 10 demonstrated the preeminence of immobilization method where 94 phosphate and 78 ammonium expulsion efficiencies were achieved with immobilized c vulgaris captured in calcium alginate globules as compared to only 59 phosphate and 40 ammonium removal with suspended cells there are several types of polymers commonly used for microalgae immobilization methods these include chitosan alginate and carrageenan 13 16 where alginate bead was identified as a favourable polymer option for use in microalgae immobilization methods 15 17 alginate was first discovered in 1881 it is one of the most abundant natural biosynthetic materials for hydrophilic polysaccharides mainly derived from two major sources of marine plants brown seaweed and bacteria commercially brown algae are the main sources of alginate including laminaria hyperborean ascophyllum modicum and macrocystispyrifera it was reported that alginate could enhance cell survival and growth 17 and showed positive effect on the prepared microalgal chlorella sp cell granules 15 17 moreover it was also demonstrated that immobilized algal cell particles exhibited remarkable ability in removing nutrients 14 18 19 due to the rich microalgae water content the alginate can be biocompatible with biodegradable materials presenting a non toxic and cost effective way of water treatment such attributes are essential for textile wastewater treatment as textile wastewater may contain toxic element that inhibits the microorganism activity de bashan et al 17 reported higher phosphate and ammonium removal using c vulgaris microalgae co immobilized with bacterium azospirillum brasilense in alginate globules as opposed to immobilized c vulgaris cells alone 19 moreover c vulgaris species cells immobilized inside sodium alginate matrix indicated higher nutrient expulsion efficiencies from sewage wastewater this is in contrast with their remotely immobilized counterparts on polyurethane froth 17 meanwhile lau et al 15 observed higher phosphate 99 and ammonium 95 expulsion efficiencies for c vulgaris cells immobilized in alginate globules bringing about 50 phosphate and 50 ammonium expulsion interestingly nannochloropsis sp suspended cells carried out higher phosphorus aggregate removal concerning their immobilized cells inside the calcium alginate granular cells 20 the immobilization technique for textile effluent is limited hence the study on the mixotrophic culture for immobilized microalgal species at various diluted textile wastewater is important to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneously removing textile wastewater pollutants and accumulating lipids in the microalgae biomass in this study the potential of microalgae to assimilate nutrients from textile wastewater was evaluated despite the composition of textile wastewater varying with sources the experimental data obtained from this study can contribute to the new addition for the database of microalgae cultivation via textile wastewater moreover the textile wastewater composition used in this study can also serve as a reference to form synthetic culture medium which can be used to adapt the wastewater treatment in actual textile wastewater plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae collection and algal strain identification seawater samples were collected around taiwan sea coast and stored in sterilized tubes these tubes were isolated in the laboratory within 3 days upon collection to ensure microalgal cell growth walne s medium plates containing raw seawater agar 18 g l and glucose 1 g l were cultured at 30 c for 2 7 days then a single colony was extracted and transferred carefully to a new plate individually isolated chlorella vulgaris wu g22 g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 g23 were cultivated in sterilized textile wastewater to study the microalgae growth and lipids accumulation 2 2 textile wastewater textile wastewater was collected from textile mill in miaoli county taiwan the raw textile wastewater exhibits chemical oxygen demand cod of 4458 mg l ph 10 5 phosphate 22 3 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 28 35 mg l and true color american dye manufacturers institute admi 920 2 3 microalgae immobilization various sodium alginate solution of 0 5 1 0 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 were prepared and sterilized at 110 c for 10 min to investigate the effect of alginate concentration on granular cell strength the sterilized sodium alginate solutions were mixed with the concentrated microalgae solution and then spun with 5400 g at the room temperature ca 25 c mixed sodium alginate and microalgae solution was filled into a syringe and injected into 40 g l cac12 solution to form the immobilized granular cells with ca 4 3 mm diameter the immobilized cells were washed with de ionized di water and then kept at room temperature for 1 day 2 4 experimental design these two microalgae species chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 were grown in a glass tube with 20 ml for 7 days liquid samples were collected every day for microalgae biomass concentration ph colorization nh4 n concentration and microalgae biomass lipid content determination during microalgae growth the detail description of the experimental design is shown as followed 2 4 1 effects of alginate concentration on granular cell the chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 were immobilized with the various sodium alginate solution of 0 5 1 0 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 then the immobilized microalgal granular were grown using raw textile wastewater and adding extra k2hpo4 8 mg l and urea 1 g l to fit the optimal phosphate and nitrogen sources respectively for growing these microalgae the cultivation parameters for these two microalgae were initial ph 8 0 temperature 30 c and light intensity 4300 lx to exponential seed culture growth both aeration and static without aeration conditions were adopted during microalgae cultivation air was sprayed with 2 vvm for aeration 2 4 2 effects of textile wastewater concentration the immobilized chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 with the optimal sodium alginate solution of 3 0 were grown using various dilution ratio no dilution 0 10 20 40 60 80 of the textile wastewater to investigate the effects of the textile wastewater concentration extra k2hpo4 8 mg l and urea 1 g l were also added in this experiment the cultivation parameters for these two microalgae were initial ph 8 0 temperature 30 c and light intensity 4300 lx to exponential seed culture growth both aeration and static without aeration conditions were adopted during microalgae cultivation air was sprayed with 2 vvm for aeration 2 5 analytical methods biomass concentration was determined by measuring the od of each sample at 680 nm od680 with a spectrophotometer genesys 20 thermo a standard curve was plotted to reveal the relationship between the dry cell weights and od values the standard analytical procedures described in our previous study were adopted to determine ph cod and true color 21 for the nh₄ n measurement method 2 ml liquid sample was mixed with 1 ml sodium tungstate 10 and 1 n sulphuric acid then the mixed liquid was centrifuged with 600 g for 10 min the supernatant 0 5 ml was reacted with 2 5 ml the mixing solution of solution 1 phenol 10 g and sodium nitroprusside 50 mg into 1 l di water and solution 2 sodium hydroxide 5 g na2hpo4 12h2o 53 7 g and 10 ml sodium hypochlorite 10 14 cl into 1 l di water at 37 c for 35 min finally the reacted sample was detected nh₄ n concentration was measured by a spectrophotometry with wave length 625 nm scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6700 f jeol tokyo japan was applied to observe the microalgae growth on the surface of immobilized beads the immobilized cell beads were dried on a filter paper before the diameter of beads dp 2r was measured microscopically with a vernier scale micrometer the density of the immobilized cell beads could be calculated using eqs 1 1 ρ p w p v p where wp is the weight of the immobilized cell beads vp are the volumes of the immobilized cell beads the volumes of the immobilized cell beads were calculated using eqs 2 2 v p 1 6 π d p 3 2 6 total lipid extraction and fatty methyl esters and fatty acid analysis extraction and analysis of total lipid fatty methyl esters were based on the methods reported in our previous study 21 3 results 3 1 effects of alginate concentration on physical characteristics of granular cells fig 1 shows that alginate solution concentration of 0 5 led to unsatisfactory granular cell formation as indicated by the irregular cell s shape by increasing the alginate solution concentration to 1 0 the granular cell formation was enhanced but the cell structure remained soft and weak the viscosity of the alginate solution was increased as alginate concentrations was higher than 1 5 high alginate solution viscosity would undesirably lead to blockage in the syringe nonetheless low alginate concentration is not desirable as well it was reported in a previous study that the granules prepared with a lower alginate concentration 2 resulted in irregular in shape and weakened granule strength 22 the particle diameters of the immobilized granular cells were about 4 3 mm in diameter as alginate solution concentration varied from 1 0 to 5 0 higher alginate concentration led to enhanced alginate granule strength as viscosity of the prepared particles increased with an alginate concentration of about 3 5 5 0 granules formation would also take longer time considering these the present alginate concentration for the immobilized microalgae cells was set as 3 0 table 1 shows the granule characteristics for chlorella vulgaris wu g22 g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 g23 immobilized matrix with 3 alginate solution the g22 and g23 granules were prepared as regular shaped granules with a diameter of about 4 3 mm with intra particle cell densities of 2 84 0 03 g cm3 0 0104 0 006 g biomass g beads and 3 58 0 02 g cm3 0 0087 0 003 g biomass g beads respectively the granule strengths were 602 3 63 8 and 447 3 63 6 g respectively after 10 days of cultivation with appropriate medium light intensity and temperature the g22 and g23 granules became deep green and there was no obvious physical change when compared with the initial granules however the intracellular density of the g22 and g23 granules was increased significantly by 3 94 0 04 and 4 89 0 05 g cm3 respectively the g22 and g23 granule strength was also considerably increased by 805 9 11 6 and 781 3 17 9 g respectively fig 2 shows the morphological cross linking state and growth of the g22 and g23 microalgal cell granules before and after cultivation using scanning electron microscopy sem sem photographs in fig 2 shows that immobilized granular cells cultured on the 10th day exhibit denser pore structure larger size higher cells number and higher particle density than 0th day this indicates that the microalgae granular cells internal density after 10th days cultivation was higher than their initial density signifying the formations of internal cross linking of g22 and g23 particles occurs after 10 days fig 3 shows that both immobilized granules and suspended methods biomass in bulk produced noticeable biomass growth from day 0 to day 10 nonetheless immobilized granules exhibited marginally higher growth rate than suspension method from day 0 to day 8 for both g22 and g23 lim et al 12 reported that alginate immobilized chlorella sp and granules are more effective than the chlorella sp suspension cells in waste water removal this is mainly due to microalgae forms bio beads on their surface which can secrete extracellular polymeric substances composed mainly of phospholipids proteins polysaccharides and extracellular dna moieties moreover immobilization technique limits cells activities thus giving rise to their overall metabolism and anabolic activities over the suspension method 12 however the growth rate for suspended method surpassed immobilization for g22 after day 9 and g23 after day 8 respectively this is presumably due to the increased average cell diameter in a confined and limited space that led to very high microalgal density constraining the growth of microalgal 12 microalgae growth can also be reflected by the increased in compressive strengths of g22 and g23 granules with cultivation days as illustrated in fig 4 the compressive strengths of microalgae granular is important during continuously cultivation both g22 and g23 granules which were formed by the immobilization technology in this study could be maintained the granules sharp and kept high compressive strengths 3 2 mixotrophic culture at various textile wastewater concentrations previous study showed that microalgae immobilized cell technology not only promoted nutrients uptake but also achieved cost effective tertiary wastewater treatment 14 as such this study intends to investigate the effects of g22 and g23 immobilized granular cells on nh4 n cod and color removal and lipid accumulation under various textile wastewater concentrations standardizing the textile wastewater treatment process from many textile mills is very complicated where wastewater of different sources has different deep color degree of salinity temperature cod and large ph variation meanwhile when using wastewater to cultivate microalgae it is necessary to consider that the water chromaticity would inhibit light penetration during culture thus concentrated textile wastewater may result in less significant immobilized granule s removal efficiency on the other hand diluting the textile wastewater is cost intensive and it may not be suitable for microalgae growth anymore fig 5 depicts the wastewater treatment performance of the immobilized chlorella vulgaris wu g22 and chlorella sp wu g23 granules with aeration and without aeration at different dilution ratios in textile wastewater it is shown that ph value for g22 and g23 did not change significantly on the final culture days under aeration and static conditions meanwhile g22 and g23 immobilized granules under both aeration and static conditions almost produce noticeably higher nh4 n removal efficiency than suspended cells except the g23 at lower dilution rate under static conditions similar nh4 n removal performance enhanced nutrient expulsion efficiencies are due to the improved photosynthetic rate of the cells and the ionic interaction between the nutrient particles and the immobilized matrices gels that are anionic in nature carrageenan normally has with the adsorption of cations like ammonium nh4 while cationic gels chitosan promote adsorption of anions like phosphate po4 3 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 with higher efficiencies 23 in addition calcium alginate particles or chitosan gels are especially productive for the removal of po4 3 particles from wastewaters 15 many studies reported microalgae has ability to decolorize and degrade the textile dyes 12 24 the main mechanisms including bioadsorption bioaccumulation biocoagulation and bioconversion were involved in wastewater bioremediation using microalgae 25 our previous study 26 studied the potential mechanism for the textile treatment by the active and nonviable microalgae g23 the active immobilized and suspended g23 obviously have ability to remove the pollutants including nh4 n cod and color compared to the nonviable g23 this result reveal the active microalgae make a significant contribution to nutrient utilization in the textile wastewater whether suspended or immobilized cultivation fig 5b shows that g22 immobilized granules under both aeration and static conditions produce an obviously higher nh4 n removal efficiency than suspended cells in terms of cod removal the wastewater diluted to 0 40 under aeration conditions has higher efficiency 60 than the value ca 50 of the suspended cells no significant difference between immobilized granules and suspended cultures was observed under the static conditions in terms of color removal the immobilized granular cells and suspension cells did not have a significant removal effect under aeration and static conditions in fig 5b the g23 depicts that the ph value did not change significantly on the final culture days under aeration and static conditions nh4 n removal for immobilized granules under aeration was averaging 75 regardless of the level of dilution under the static conditions however nh4 n removal increased progressively from 30 to nearly 90 while the wastewater dilution ratio increased from 10 to 80 the suspended cells and immobilized granules under aeration conditions produced a removal efficiency of averaging 60 for cod removal efficiency under the static conditions the immobilized granular cells have obviously higher removal efficiency than the suspended cells the color removal efficiency was observed to be higher when using 80 diluted textile wastewater under aeration and static conditions the different pollutant removal efficiency between g22 and g23 may be caused by the difference of growth rate and also the mass transformation in microalgae granules higher cod removal in the immobilized granules can be attributed to the enhanced metabolism of microalgae as compared to suspension cells thus consuming more carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and producing more dissolved oxygen in the water as a results 27 fig 6 show total fatty acid methyl ester fame for g22 and g23 under aeration and static conditions overall the total fames content of immobilized granules was greater than the suspended cells meanwhile considerable portion of the fame was c18 and above improved anabolic activity of immobilized granules over the suspended cells inherently elevates the lipid contents waste water dilution 80 generally resulted in lowest lipid contents this is presumably due to the reduction of nutrients as waste water is over diluted 28 29 the aeration culture yield more unsaturated c18 fame than without aeration culture this is due to the without oxygenation in the waste water affected the lipid metabolite in the microalgae cytoplasm to produce lipid as waste water dilution varied from 0 to 80 the yield of c18 0 c18 1 and c16 0 increased noticeably for cultivation with and without aeration this is presumably affected by the cell lipid metabolite cycle 28 29 4 conclusions the performance of wastewater treatment and lipid accumulation using immobilized microalgal alginate bio beads granular were examined in this study the microalgae species viz chlorella vulgaris wu g22 chlorella sp wu g23 were collected and isolated from seawater around taiwan sea coast the immobilized granular cells showed consistently higher microalgal biomass growth over the suspension method from day 0 to day 8 as compared to day 0 the immobilized granular cells showed denser pore structure larger size higher cells number and higher particle density on day 10 the preset research shows that immobilized microalgae of both g22 and g23 with static cultivation resulted in nh4 n cod and color removal efficiencies as high as 90 75 and 60 respectively moreover raw textile wastewater without dilution led to the highest fames accumulation in the microalgae biomass compared to the diluted textile wastewater significant portion of the fame produced was c18 and c20 the immobilized technique produced only slightly higher lipids than suspended method this research shows that immobilized microalgal alginate bio beads granular offers a promising way of removing pollutant in waste water and lipid
