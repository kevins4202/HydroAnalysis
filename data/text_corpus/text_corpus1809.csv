9045,soil microorganisms are key drivers of soil nutrient cycling and agroecosystem sustainability despite their critical roles in soil evolution processes the variation of soil microbial communities in cotton fields with different years of practicing mulched drip irrigation remains poorly understood the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of different years of mulched drip irrigation i e ck 11 13 15 and 21 years on soil microbial communities and soil properties in cotton fields in an oasis by using high throughput sequencing of the microbial 16 s its gene the results showed that soil ec decreased significantly after mulched drip irrigation and the lowest value occurred in 21 year treatment decreased by 74 43 soil organic carbon available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium increased significantly with the length of years under mulched drip irrigation the abundance of dominated bacterial phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes and rokubacteria significantly varied among different years of mulched drip irrigation and no significant change was found in soil fungal community at the phyla level the abundance of dominated fungal genera cephalotrichum 21 82 68 96 decreased significantly with irrigation years extension non metric multidimensional scale analyses nmds showed that soil bacterial and fungal communities significantly differed among different treatments p 0 001 the more positive co occurrence relationships of bacteria to fungi and the highest shannon and lowest simpson values were observed in the 13 year mulched drip irrigation the abundance of bacteria and fungi was significantly correlated with soil ec total nitrogen total potassium and soil organic carbon our results indicated that long term mulched drip irrigation affected the structures and interactions of microbial communities in cotton fields by reducing soil salinity and regulating the soil nutrient concentrations and 13 year mulched drip irrigation was capable of enhancing soil microbial diversity in this region keywords agroecosystem soil microorganism drip irrigation cotton production high throughput sequencing data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought and water shortage are key factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture in arid oasis regions zhang et al 2020a zhu et al 2021 mulched drip irrigation which is a technique combining plastic film mulching with drip irrigation has been widely used because of its advantages in maintaining soil moisture increasing the soil temperature decreasing soil salinization and improving yield in arid oasis regions chen et al 2018 dai and dong 2014 therefore mulched drip irrigation has been widely used in agricultural ecosystems of arid and semi arid regions since 2000 abalos et al 2014 garb and friedlander 2014 maraseni et al 2012 soil microorganisms are essential parts of the soil microhabitat wang et al 2019b which significantly result in soil nutrient cycling and ecosystem sustainability in plant soil systems de menezes et al 2017 tao et al 2020 wang et al 2017 soil microbial communities are closely linked with soil properties mendes et al 2015 for instance the soil indicators such as ph soil organic carbon and organic nitrogen are the critical factors determining the distribution of soil microbial communities zhou et al 2017 pan et al 2020 previous research has found that soil properties gradually improved or deteriorated with increasing application years and scale of mulched drip irrigation wang et al 2019a for example the saline alkali cotton fields changed from strongly saline to medium saline soils under long term mulched drip irrigation li et al 2022 and mulched drip irrigation could improve the soil water content and temperature in cotton fields enhancing the soil respiration strength zong et al 2020 and forming a desalinization area within the root zone to alleviate secondary salinization wang et al 2021a yang et al 2020 however the contribution ratio of soil properties to soil microbial changes had an evident difference in different ecosystems especially in the arid oasis ecosystems therefore a better understanding of the responses of soil microbial communities to the application years and scale of mulched drip irrigation in arid oasis regions could explain the mechanism underlying the degradation of oasis soil and help optimize the drip irrigation management measures in cotton fields as an essential irrigation measure in oasis areas mulched drip irrigation could result in the alternation of soil wetting and drying and increasing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil water heat and nutrient distribution which affects the growth of microorganisms wang et al 2021b 2019b some studies showed that mulched drip irrigation enhanced soil nutrient activation borken and matzner 2009 and promoted the growth of soil bacteria actinomycetes and fungi in the topsoil liu and kang 2014 yin and zhang 2022 mulched drip irrigation significantly increased soil bacteria and fungi abundance compared with trench irrigation peng et al 2018 and promoted soil bacterial growth and inhibited fungal growth compared with non film drip irrigation qin et al 2016 however such previous studies mainly focused on the effects of short term 10 years mulched drip irrigation on soil microbial community the influences of long term 10 years mulched drip irrigation remained unknown thereby hindering the understanding of the mechanism underlying the soil microbial dynamics affected by mulched drip irrigation in arid oasis ecosystems manas river basin in xinjiang is located in the typical arid oasis region in northwest china the area had become severely salinized due to excess flood irrigation in the 1970s and 1980s chen et al 2018 mulched drip irrigation was adopted for cotton planting for the first time in 1996 in this area huo et al 2017 li et al 2011 as a result it has become the largest cotton field under mulched drip irrigation in china wang et al 2019b accounting for 78 92 of the national cotton planting area in 2020 according to the cotton production report issued by the national bureau of statistics since mulched drip irrigation has been widely used for decades and will continue to be used in the study region for the foreseeable future it is essential to comprehensively understand the impact of soil microbial community dynamics in response to long term mulched drip irrigation however to the best of our knowledge there is little information on their impact in this study we investigated the effects of different years of mulched drip irrigation i e ck 11 13 15 and 21 years on soil microbial communities and soil properties in cotton fields in an arid oasis agroecosystem we hypothesized that soil microbial community diversity would increase with the increasing drip irrigation years and the changes are caused by the variation of soil physicochemical properties due to extended drip irrigation years during continuous cotton production therefore the objectives of our study were to 1 determine the effect of long term mulched drip irrigation on soil microbial community diversity and composition and 2 discuss the relationships of microbial communities to soil properties in cotton fields over applying time of mulched drip irrigation in arid northwest china our study will provide comprehensive understanding of the impact of long term mulched drip irrigation on soil quality and sustainability in arid oasis areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the paotai township shihezi city xinjiang china 85 33 e 44 48 n 337 m a s l fig 1a b it has an

period and annual average air temperature were 163 d and 6 3 c respectively soil salinity is very common in the study area due to the higher evaporation and the high salinity of groundwater due to the positive role of mulched drip irrigation in reducing soil water evaporation mulched drip irrigation has been widely used since 1996 and soil salinization is gradually alleviated a large number of saline alkali wasteland has been reclamation for cotton production the soil in the experimental site is sandy loam before the cotton cropping the soil bulk density ph and soil salinity at 0 20 cm

irrigation was performed for different years in the experimental site we selected four adjacent typical cotton fields with various years applied mulched drip irrigation i e 11 years 13 years 15 years and 21 years in addition an nearly uncultivated wasteland was selected as the control fig 1b before reclamation all fields were saline alkali wasteland and belonged to the same tributary canal of water conveyance irrigation li et al 2022 after the conversion of saline alkali wasteland to farmland cotton fields basically carried out the same cotton varieties irrigation schedule and fertilization systems wang et al 2019b the specific scheme is shown in table s2 2 3 soil sampling cotton gossypium hirsutum l was sown and mulched with plastic film at a plant density of 1 8 105

and the network visualization was realized by gephi version 0 9 2 3 results 3 1 soil physical and chemical properties mulched drip irrigation significantly affected soil ec soc tn tp tk an ap and ak contents table 1 soil ec decreased significantly with irrigation years increase and the lowest value in 21 year treatment decreased by 74 43 but no significant change in soil ph among different treatments as an important indicator of soil fertility soc content was the highest in the 13 year treatment accounted for 13 61 g kg 1 soil tk and tp contents were the highest in the 11 year treatment was 11 67 and 0 81 g kg 1 respectively soil an ap and ak contents increased significantly with the increase of irrigation years and the highest values were observed in the 21 year treatment was 62 33 15 87 and 281 mg kg 1 respectively 3 2 composition of soil microbial communities the soil bacterial community was divided into 5752 otus in this study the number of soil bacterial sequences and otus in each sample was 26616 41206 and 2190 2849 respectively table 2 the dominant soil bacterial phyla 0 01 were actinobacteria 19 32 35 23 proteobacteria 20 20 35 92 chloroflexi 12 82 24 34 acidobacteria 6 04 15 13 and gemmatimonadetes 3 25 5 83 in all soil samples compared with ck the average relative abundances of actinobacteria and rokubacteria in cotton fields decreased by an average of 20 86 and 54 5 respectively fig s2 at the genus level the dominant bacterial genera were arthrobacter 2 55 13 99 streptomyces 1 68 5 31 and nitrospira 0 73 1 89 in our study fig 2c conversion of wasteland to cotton fields decreased the relative abundance of gaiella by an average of 55 99 but increased the relative abundances of arthrobacter streptomyces and nitrospira the relative abundance of arthrobacter and nitrospira peaked in soils 11 and 13 year treatments before later decreasing fig s2 the soil fungal community was divided into 628 otus in this study the number of soil fungal sequences and otus in each sample was 55456 68014 and 134 212 respectively table 2 these otus were assigned to 10 different fungal phyla the dominant soil fungal phyla 0 01 were ascomycota 84 84 98 72 mortierellomycota 0 77 4 24 and basidiomycota 0 16 4 54 fig 3b and no significant change was found in soil fungal community at the phyla level at the genus level cephalotrichum was the dominant fungal species accounting for 21 82 68 96 fig 3d compared with ck the average relative abundances of cephalotrichum in cotton fields decreased by an average of 43 63 fig s2 however the relative abundance of metarhizium and tetracladium increased significantly with irrigation years extension and the highest abundance was observed in 11 and 13 year treatments respectively 3 3 diversity of soil microbial communities the coverage of soil samples exceeded 96 demonstrating that the sequencing reads were satisfied for subsequent analysis table 2 in bacterial communities the chaol and ace indices were positively related to the application years of drip irrigation fig s1 these indices increased with irrigation years and the highest values were observed in the 15 year treatment table 2 the highest shannon and the lowest simpson indices were found in the 13 year treatment was 6 52 and 0 0052 respectively indicating that the 13 year treatment had higher bacterial diversity than other treatments however soil fungal chaol ace and simpson indices were negatively correlated with drip irrigation years fig s1 chaol and ace decreased sharply with the increase in application time of drip irrigation and the lowest values were observed in the 21 year treatment was 111 and 113 respectively similar to the change of soil bacteria the highest shannon and lowest simpson indices of soil fungi were also observed in the 13 year treatment was 3 12 and 0 123 respectively these results suggested that mulch drip irrigation lowered the richness of soil fungi but increased fungal diversity within 13 years drip irrigation furthermore we confirmed the similarity and difference of microbial communities in all samples by non metric multidimensional scale analysis nmds fig 3 we found that soil microbial communities in the cotton fields with 11 13 15 and 21 year treatments are separated from those in ck additionally the stress values of soil bacterial stress 0 092 and fungal stress 0 077 communities from nmds showed remarkable differences among the different treatments these results showed that mulch drip irrigation years significantly impacted soil microbial communities 3 4 co occurrence network of soil microbial communities in the bacterial fungal symbiosis networks of the cotton fields with ck 11 13 15 and 21 year treatments cotton fields with different mulched drip irrigation years developed networks with similar sizes due to the same number of nodes fig 4 for the bacterial fungal symbiosis networks of the different treatments the number of edges was 6 58 20 03 4 74 14 21 and 4 03 respectively table 3 in addition the average path length was 5 02 2 29 4 56 4 98 and 8 13 respectively the value of the average clustering coefficient and the density fluctuated with the increase in application time of drip irrigation and the highest value was observed in 11 year treatments accounted for 0 791 and 0 106 respectively strikingly the positive link ratios were much higher than the negative ones in all treatments the proportion of positive correlations of soil bacteria fungi was the greatest in 13 year treatment which accounted for 66 98 the proportion of negative correlations of soil bacteria fungi was the highest in the 11 year treatment which accounted for 44 19 moreover the species with dominant weight in the soil bacterial fungal symbiosis network increased from ck to 11 year and then decreased gradually after 15 year treatment fig 4 3 5 relationship between soil microbial communities and soil physicochemical properties rda1 and rda2 axes contributed 49 4 of the total variation between the bacterial community and environmental variables and 52 64 of the total variation between the fungal community and environmental variables by redundancy analysis figs 5a and 5b we found that the bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by soil ec p 0 048 soc p 0 006 tn p 0 001 and tk p 0 031 table s3 according to mantel test the fungal community distribution was significantly affected by soil ec p 0 018 soc p 0 001 tn p 0 001 tk p 0 001 and ak p 0 001 table s3 spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the relationship between the soil properties and soil bacterial community fig 6a our results showed that the relative abundance of ensife was positively correlated with soil ec p 0 024 but negatively correlated with soil tp p 0 007 and tk p 0 001 the relative abundance of gaiella was obviously negatively correlated with soil ec p 0 003 but positively correlated with soil an p 0 001 the relative abundance of arthrobacter was negatively correlated with tp p 0 002 for the fungi community fig 6b the relative abundance of cephalotichum was significantly positively correlated with soc p 0 003 but negatively correlated with tn p 0 016 and ak p 0 028 the soil ec was positively correlated with mortierella p 0 032 trichoderma p 0 007 and talaromyces p 0 041 but negatively correlated with pseudogymnoascus p 0 002 the soc was significantly positively correlated with cephalotichum p 0 003 gamsia p 0 013 and simpson index p 0 013 the soil tn was positively correlated with tetracladium p 0 006 but negatively correlated with gamisa p 0 006 4 discussion 4 1 responses of soil microbial community diversity to cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation we have demonstrated the highest soil bacterial diversity index was observed in cotton field with 13 year mulched drip irrigation still soil bacterial diversity index remained relatively stable after 13 years table 2 suggesting that application years of mulched drip irrigation positively affected soil bacterial diversity in cotton fields zhou et al 2020 and bourceret et al 2016 found that increases of microbial diversity after the reclaimed farmland of wasteland which was in general agreement with our result this was attributed to the fact that 1 13 years of mulched drip irrigation significantly improved the soil physicochemical environment relating to soil bacterial diversity indices the result about responses of soil properties to long term mulched drip irrigation in our above section supported the explanation previous studies have demonstrated that mulched drip irrigation decreased the soil ec li et al 2022 but the application of chemical fertilizers chen et al 2018 and the more input of soil organic materials through litterfall and roots to cotton fields huo et al 2017 increased the concentrations of soil nutrients wang et al 2021b indicated that mulched drip irrigation decreased soil bulk density but increased soil porosity further regulating dry and wet soil areas and optimizing fine root morphology and distribution which is prone to increasing soil microbial diversity however we found that soil fungal chaol ace and simpson indices significantly decreased after 13 year treatment our results are consistent with zong et al 2022 which identified decreasing trends in the richness and diversity of the soil microbial community after 15 years post conversion this may be due to the allelopathic inhibition of cotton root exudates to soil fungi in cotton fields with the increasing years of mulched drip irrigation dai and dong 2014 the long term continuous cropping of cotton increased the concentrations of soil nutrients but was apt to the formation of soil ecological environment of monocultural self toxicity which could be the main factor directly resulting in the decrease of soil fungal diversity indices bourceret et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the long term continuous cropping 2 7 years could negatively influence soil fungal abundance huang et al 2013 and several harmful substances such as agricultural activities pesticides and herbicides producing during monocropping systems could inhibit the survival of soil fungi wang and wang 2017 4 2 responses of soil microbial community composition to cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation the variation of soil dominant phyla and genus of bacteria and fungi was affected by soil type crop type soil moisture and climate condition wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a 2016b our results are similar to those of de vries et al 2018 who found that changes in bacterial communities linked more firmly to soil functioning during recovery than changes in fungal communities actinobacteria could decompose and utilize refractory organic compounds such as cellulose lignin and chitin with higher relative abundances reported under extreme environment conditions wang et al 2019b proteobacteria have ability to degrade polysaccharides which are highly distributed in nutrient rich soil zhang et al 2016a 2016b we found that the relative abundance of actinobacteria decreased and the relative abundance of proteobacteria gradually increased with increasing drip irrigation years which contrary to the findings of wolinska et al 2019 this was likely due to the mulched drip irrigation improved the soil moisture fertilizer gas conditions benefited the growth of proteobacteria at the genera level of the bacterial community conversion of wasteland to cotton fields increased the relative abundances of arthrobacter streptomyces and nitrospira arthrobacter and streptomyces were related to the degradation of organic matter zhang et al 2020b and nitrospira was involved in soil nitrification delmont et al 2018 the changes of the bacterial community were ascribed to the variations of growth characteristics of different bacteria types and the quantity and quality of substrate required for bacteria growth in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation jing et al 2019 our results could support the explanation that the soil salinity significantly decreased and the soc and available nutrients concentrations gradually increased with increasing years of mulched drip irrigation in the above section the results furthermore demonstrated that mulched drip irrigation improved the soil environmental conditions for bacterial growth and thus resulted in changes in the abundance of soil bacterial phyla and genera we showed that application time of mulched drip irrigation did not result in changes in the relative abundance of the fungal community at the phylum level still the relative abundance of the fungal community at the genus level fig 3 vargas gastélum et al 2015 indicated that actinobacteria basidiomycota proteobacteria acidobacteria and gemmatimonadetes are the dominant fungal phyla in the arid agroecosystem which was in general agreement with our result the abundance of dominated fungal genera cephalotrichum 21 82 68 96 decreased significantly with increase in application time of drip irrigation which was attributed to that cephalotrichum is a saprophytic soil fungus banerjee et al 2016 gonzález fernández et al 2010 in addition the higher abundance of cephalotrichum in saline wasteland could be attributed to the higher richness chao1 and ace of fungi in this study the relative abundance of metarhizium mortierella and tetracladium increased with increasing drip irrigation years the changes were ascribed to the increase in crop residues in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation which promoted the participation of soil fungal community in organic degradation and changed the distribution of the dominant fungal community at the genus level furthermore when the external environmental conditions are improved the soil environment will become conducive to the growth of mycelia and provide growing space for other populations resulting in intensified competition among fungi for space resources at the genus level koechli et al 2019 4 3 relationship between the soil bacterial fungal co occurrence network and environmental variables the co occurrence network relationships expressed mutual coexistence and exclusion relationships resulted from external interference between microorganisms banerjee et al 2018 de menezes et al 2017 hu et al 2020 strikingly the ecological network between the soil bacterial and fungal communities have changed in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation the 13 year mulched drip irrigation resulted in more positive co occurrence relationships between bacteria and fungi furthermore we found that the number of positive and negative correlations average clustering coefficient average degree and density fluctuated with increasing drip irrigation years indicating that long term mulched drip irrigation resulted in changes in the relationship of the bacterial communities to fungal communities by variations of soil physicochemical properties due to mulched drip irrigation the results supported the explanation that the fungal and bacterial communities had a remarkable correlation with the soil ec soc and tn content by rda analysis of soil microbial communities and soil physicochemical characteristics fig 5 the result of the spearman correlation analysis fig 6 it also indicated that soil bacteria and fungi might be significantly involved in soil nutrient conversions with increasing drip irrigation years our results are consistent with yang et al 2021 and zong et al 2020 who identified that soil salinity and soc are key factors affecting microbial community composition in the arid agroecosystem of northwest china we observed that soil nutrients soc an ap and ak improved with increasing drip irrigation years because soil salinity decreased annually moreover the effect of soil salinity and soc on the fungal community structure was greater than the bacterial community structure this may be because of that the increase in litter and root residues during cotton growth could promote more soil fungal communities to participate in organic degradation yang et al 2020 although our research revealed the change of soil properties and soil microbial communities in cotton fields over applying time of mulched drip irrigation the specific internal factors causing the variation of soil microbial communities were varied and complex which may require more research for detailed discussion 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to investigate the impact of long term 10 years mulched drip irrigation on soil properties and soil microbial communities in reclaimed abandoned salinized farmland in northwest china the increase in applicaition of drip irrigation have led to a significant decline in soil ec and an increase in soc an ap and ak suggesting that soil salinity has been ameliorated and soil fertility has been improved the ecological network between the soil bacterial and fungal communities have changed in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation and 13 year mulched drip irrigation resulted in more positive co occurrence relationships between bacteria and fungi furthermore the highest shannon and lowest simpson values were observed in the 13 year treatment indicating that 13 year mulched drip irrigation is capable of enhancing soil microbial diversity statistical analysis showed that the effect of long term mulched drip irrigation on the soil microbial community could be attributed to the concentrations of soil ec soc and tn our results demonstrated that long term mulched drip irrigation affected the structures and interactions of microbial communities in cotton fields by reducing soil salinity and regulating the soil nutrient concentrations and 13 year mulched drip irrigation improved not only soil fertility but also soil microbial diversity in this region declaration of competing

availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought and water shortage are key factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture in arid oasis regions zhang et al 2020a zhu et al 2021 mulched drip irrigation which is a technique combining plastic film mulching with drip irrigation has been widely used because of its advantages in maintaining soil moisture increasing the soil temperature decreasing soil salinization and improving yield in arid oasis regions chen et al 2018 dai and dong 2014 therefore mulched drip irrigation has been widely used in agricultural ecosystems of arid and semi arid regions since 2000 abalos et al 2014 garb and friedlander 2014 maraseni et al 2012 soil microorganisms are essential parts of the soil microhabitat wang et al 2019b which significantly result in soil nutrient cycling and ecosystem sustainability in plant soil systems de menezes et al 2017 tao et al 2020 wang et al 2017 soil microbial communities are closely linked with soil properties mendes et al 2015 for instance the soil indicators such as ph soil organic carbon and organic nitrogen are the critical factors determining the distribution of soil microbial communities zhou et al 2017 pan et al 2020 previous research has found that soil properties gradually improved or deteriorated with increasing application years and scale of mulched drip irrigation wang et al 2019a for example the saline alkali cotton fields changed from strongly saline to medium saline soils under long term mulched drip irrigation li et al 2022 and mulched drip irrigation could improve the soil water content and temperature in cotton fields enhancing the soil respiration strength zong et al 2020 and forming a desalinization area within the root zone to alleviate secondary salinization wang et al 2021a yang et al 2020 however the contribution ratio of soil properties to soil microbial changes had an evident difference in different ecosystems especially in the arid oasis ecosystems therefore a better understanding of the responses of soil microbial communities to the application years and scale of mulched drip irrigation in arid oasis regions could explain the mechanism underlying the degradation of oasis soil and help optimize the drip irrigation management measures in cotton fields as an essential irrigation measure in oasis areas mulched drip irrigation could result in the alternation of soil wetting and drying and increasing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil water heat and nutrient distribution which affects the growth of microorganisms wang et al 2021b 2019b some studies showed that mulched drip irrigation enhanced soil nutrient activation borken and matzner 2009 and promoted the growth of soil bacteria actinomycetes and fungi in the topsoil liu and kang 2014 yin and zhang 2022 mulched drip irrigation significantly increased soil bacteria and fungi abundance compared with trench irrigation peng et al 2018 and promoted soil bacterial growth and inhibited fungal growth compared with non film drip irrigation qin et al 2016 however such previous studies mainly focused on the effects of short term 10 years mulched drip irrigation on soil microbial community the influences of long term 10 years mulched drip irrigation remained unknown thereby hindering the understanding of the mechanism underlying the soil microbial dynamics affected by mulched drip irrigation in arid oasis ecosystems manas river basin in xinjiang is located in the typical arid oasis region in northwest china the area had become severely salinized due to excess flood irrigation in the 1970s and 1980s chen et al 2018 mulched drip irrigation was adopted for cotton planting for the first time in 1996 in this area huo et al 2017 li et al 2011 as a result it has become the largest cotton field under mulched drip irrigation in china wang et al 2019b accounting for 78 92 of the national cotton planting area in 2020 according to the cotton production report issued by the national bureau of statistics since mulched drip irrigation has been widely used for decades and will continue to be used in the study region for the foreseeable future it is essential to comprehensively understand the impact of soil microbial community dynamics in response to long term mulched drip irrigation however to the best of our knowledge there is little information on their impact in this study we investigated the effects of different years of mulched drip irrigation i e ck 11 13 15 and 21 years on soil microbial communities and soil properties in cotton fields in an arid oasis agroecosystem we hypothesized that soil microbial community diversity would increase with the increasing drip irrigation years and the changes are caused by the variation of soil physicochemical properties due to extended drip irrigation years during continuous cotton production therefore the objectives of our study were to 1 determine the effect of long term mulched drip irrigation on soil microbial community diversity and composition and 2 discuss the relationships of microbial communities to soil properties in cotton fields over applying time of mulched drip irrigation in arid northwest china our study will provide comprehensive understanding of the impact of long term mulched drip irrigation on soil quality and sustainability in arid oasis areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the paotai township shihezi city xinjiang china 85 33 e 44 48 n 337 m a s l fig 1a b it has an arid continental climate with extremely low precipitation about 206 mm year round on the other hand the annual evaporation rate is relatively high usually over 1000 mm wang et al 2019b the frost free period and annual average air temperature were 163 d and 6 3 c respectively soil salinity is very common in the study area due to the higher evaporation and the high salinity of groundwater due to the positive role of mulched drip irrigation in reducing soil water evaporation mulched drip irrigation has been widely used since 1996 and soil salinization is gradually alleviated a large number of saline alkali wasteland has been reclamation for cotton production the soil in the experimental site is sandy loam before the cotton cropping the soil bulk density ph and soil salinity at 0 20 cm

irrigation was performed for different years in the experimental site we selected four adjacent typical cotton fields with various years applied mulched drip irrigation i e 11 years 13 years 15 years and 21 years in addition an nearly uncultivated wasteland was selected as the control fig 1b before reclamation all fields were saline alkali wasteland and belonged to the same tributary canal of water conveyance irrigation li et al 2022 after the conversion of saline alkali wasteland to farmland cotton fields basically carried out the same cotton varieties irrigation schedule and fertilization systems wang et al 2019b the specific scheme is shown in table s2 2 3 soil sampling cotton gossypium hirsutum l was sown and mulched with plastic film at a plant density of 1 8 105

and the network visualization was realized by gephi version 0 9 2 3 results 3 1 soil physical and chemical properties mulched drip irrigation significantly affected soil ec soc tn tp tk an ap and ak contents table 1 soil ec decreased significantly with irrigation years increase and the lowest value in 21 year treatment decreased by 74 43 but no significant change in soil ph among different treatments as an important indicator of soil fertility soc content was the highest in the 13 year treatment accounted for 13 61 g kg 1 soil tk and tp contents were the highest in the 11 year treatment was 11 67 and 0 81 g kg 1 respectively soil an ap and ak contents increased significantly with the increase of irrigation years and the highest values were observed in the 21 year treatment was 62 33 15 87 and 281 mg kg 1 respectively 3 2 composition of soil microbial communities the soil bacterial community was divided into 5752 otus in this study the number of soil bacterial sequences and otus in each sample was 26616 41206 and 2190 2849 respectively table 2 the dominant soil bacterial phyla 0 01 were actinobacteria 19 32 35 23 proteobacteria 20 20 35 92 chloroflexi 12 82 24 34 acidobacteria 6 04 15 13 and gemmatimonadetes 3 25 5 83 in all soil samples compared with ck the average relative abundances of actinobacteria and rokubacteria in cotton fields decreased by an average of 20 86 and 54 5 respectively fig s2 at the genus level the dominant bacterial genera were arthrobacter 2 55 13 99 streptomyces 1 68 5 31 and nitrospira 0 73 1 89 in our study fig 2c conversion of wasteland to cotton fields decreased the relative abundance of gaiella by an average of 55 99 but increased the relative abundances of arthrobacter streptomyces and nitrospira the relative abundance of arthrobacter and nitrospira peaked in soils 11 and 13 year treatments before later decreasing fig s2 the soil fungal community was divided into 628 otus in this study the number of soil fungal sequences and otus in each sample was 55456 68014 and 134 212 respectively table 2 these otus were assigned to 10 different fungal phyla the dominant soil fungal phyla 0 01 were ascomycota 84 84 98 72 mortierellomycota 0 77 4 24 and basidiomycota 0 16 4 54 fig 3b and no significant change was found in soil fungal community at the phyla level at the genus level cephalotrichum was the dominant fungal species accounting for 21 82 68 96 fig 3d compared with ck the average relative abundances of cephalotrichum in cotton fields decreased by an average of 43 63 fig s2 however the relative abundance of metarhizium and tetracladium increased significantly with irrigation years extension and the highest abundance was observed in 11 and 13 year treatments respectively 3 3 diversity of soil microbial communities the coverage of soil samples exceeded 96 demonstrating that the sequencing reads were satisfied for subsequent analysis table 2 in bacterial communities the chaol and ace indices were positively related to the application years of drip irrigation fig s1 these indices increased with irrigation years and the highest values were observed in the 15 year treatment table 2 the highest shannon and the lowest simpson indices were found in the 13 year treatment was 6 52 and 0 0052 respectively indicating that the 13 year treatment had higher bacterial diversity than other treatments however soil fungal chaol ace and simpson indices were negatively correlated with drip irrigation years fig s1 chaol and ace decreased sharply with the increase in application time of drip irrigation and the lowest values were observed in the 21 year treatment was 111 and 113 respectively similar to the change of soil bacteria the highest shannon and lowest simpson indices of soil fungi were also observed in the 13 year treatment was 3 12 and 0 123 respectively these results suggested that mulch drip irrigation lowered the richness of soil fungi but increased fungal diversity within 13 years drip irrigation furthermore we confirmed the similarity and difference of microbial communities in all samples by non metric multidimensional scale analysis nmds fig 3 we found that soil microbial communities in the cotton fields with 11 13 15 and 21 year treatments are separated from those in ck additionally the stress values of soil bacterial stress 0 092 and fungal stress 0 077 communities from nmds showed remarkable differences among the different treatments these results showed that mulch drip irrigation years significantly impacted soil microbial communities 3 4 co occurrence network of soil microbial communities in the bacterial fungal symbiosis networks of the cotton fields with ck 11 13 15 and 21 year treatments cotton fields with different mulched drip irrigation years developed networks with similar sizes due to the same number of nodes fig 4 for the bacterial fungal symbiosis networks of the different treatments the number of edges was 6 58 20 03 4 74 14 21 and 4 03 respectively table 3 in addition the average path length was 5 02 2 29 4 56 4 98 and 8 13 respectively the value of the average clustering coefficient and the density fluctuated with the increase in application time of drip irrigation and the highest value was observed in 11 year treatments accounted for 0 791 and 0 106 respectively strikingly the positive link ratios were much higher than the negative ones in all treatments the proportion of positive correlations of soil bacteria fungi was the greatest in 13 year treatment which accounted for 66 98 the proportion of negative correlations of soil bacteria fungi was the highest in the 11 year treatment which accounted for 44 19 moreover the species with dominant weight in the soil bacterial fungal symbiosis network increased from ck to 11 year and then decreased gradually after 15 year treatment fig 4 3 5 relationship between soil microbial communities and soil physicochemical properties rda1 and rda2 axes contributed 49 4 of the total variation between the bacterial community and environmental variables and 52 64 of the total variation between the fungal community and environmental variables by redundancy analysis figs 5a and 5b we found that the bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by soil ec p 0 048 soc p 0 006 tn p 0 001 and tk p 0 031 table s3 according to mantel test the fungal community distribution was significantly affected by soil ec p 0 018 soc p 0 001 tn p 0 001 tk p 0 001 and ak p 0 001 table s3 spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the relationship between the soil properties and soil bacterial community fig 6a our results showed that the relative abundance of ensife was positively correlated with soil ec p 0 024 but negatively correlated with soil tp p 0 007 and tk p 0 001 the relative abundance of gaiella was obviously negatively correlated with soil ec p 0 003 but positively correlated with soil an p 0 001 the relative abundance of arthrobacter was negatively correlated with tp p 0 002 for the fungi community fig 6b the relative abundance of cephalotichum was significantly positively correlated with soc p 0 003 but negatively correlated with tn p 0 016 and ak p 0 028 the soil ec was positively correlated with mortierella p 0 032 trichoderma p 0 007 and talaromyces p 0 041 but negatively correlated with pseudogymnoascus p 0 002 the soc was significantly positively correlated with cephalotichum p 0 003 gamsia p 0 013 and simpson index p 0 013 the soil tn was positively correlated with tetracladium p 0 006 but negatively correlated with gamisa p 0 006 4 discussion 4 1 responses of soil microbial community diversity to cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation we have demonstrated the highest soil bacterial diversity index was observed in cotton field with 13 year mulched drip irrigation still soil bacterial diversity index remained relatively stable after 13 years table 2 suggesting that application years of mulched drip irrigation positively affected soil bacterial diversity in cotton fields zhou et al 2020 and bourceret et al 2016 found that increases of microbial diversity after the reclaimed farmland of wasteland which was in general agreement with our result this was attributed to the fact that 1 13 years of mulched drip irrigation significantly improved the soil physicochemical environment relating to soil bacterial diversity indices the result about responses of soil properties to long term mulched drip irrigation in our above section supported the explanation previous studies have demonstrated that mulched drip irrigation decreased the soil ec li et al 2022 but the application of chemical fertilizers chen et al 2018 and the more input of soil organic materials through litterfall and roots to cotton fields huo et al 2017 increased the concentrations of soil nutrients wang et al 2021b indicated that mulched drip irrigation decreased soil bulk density but increased soil porosity further regulating dry and wet soil areas and optimizing fine root morphology and distribution which is prone to increasing soil microbial diversity however we found that soil fungal chaol ace and simpson indices significantly decreased after 13 year treatment our results are consistent with zong et al 2022 which identified decreasing trends in the richness and diversity of the soil microbial community after 15 years post conversion this may be due to the allelopathic inhibition of cotton root exudates to soil fungi in cotton fields with the increasing years of mulched drip irrigation dai and dong 2014 the long term continuous cropping of cotton increased the concentrations of soil nutrients but was apt to the formation of soil ecological environment of monocultural self toxicity which could be the main factor directly resulting in the decrease of soil fungal diversity indices bourceret et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the long term continuous cropping 2 7 years could negatively influence soil fungal abundance huang et al 2013 and several harmful substances such as agricultural activities pesticides and herbicides producing during monocropping systems could inhibit the survival of soil fungi wang and wang 2017 4 2 responses of soil microbial community composition to cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation the variation of soil dominant phyla and genus of bacteria and fungi was affected by soil type crop type soil moisture and climate condition wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a 2016b our results are similar to those of de vries et al 2018 who found that changes in bacterial communities linked more firmly to soil functioning during recovery than changes in fungal communities actinobacteria could decompose and utilize refractory organic compounds such as cellulose lignin and chitin with higher relative abundances reported under extreme environment conditions wang et al 2019b proteobacteria have ability to degrade polysaccharides which are highly distributed in nutrient rich soil zhang et al 2016a 2016b we found that the relative abundance of actinobacteria decreased and the relative abundance of proteobacteria gradually increased with increasing drip irrigation years which contrary to the findings of wolinska et al 2019 this was likely due to the mulched drip irrigation improved the soil moisture fertilizer gas conditions benefited the growth of proteobacteria at the genera level of the bacterial community conversion of wasteland to cotton fields increased the relative abundances of arthrobacter streptomyces and nitrospira arthrobacter and streptomyces were related to the degradation of organic matter zhang et al 2020b and nitrospira was involved in soil nitrification delmont et al 2018 the changes of the bacterial community were ascribed to the variations of growth characteristics of different bacteria types and the quantity and quality of substrate required for bacteria growth in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation jing et al 2019 our results could support the explanation that the soil salinity significantly decreased and the soc and available nutrients concentrations gradually increased with increasing years of mulched drip irrigation in the above section the results furthermore demonstrated that mulched drip irrigation improved the soil environmental conditions for bacterial growth and thus resulted in changes in the abundance of soil bacterial phyla and genera we showed that application time of mulched drip irrigation did not result in changes in the relative abundance of the fungal community at the phylum level still the relative abundance of the fungal community at the genus level fig 3 vargas gastélum et al 2015 indicated that actinobacteria basidiomycota proteobacteria acidobacteria and gemmatimonadetes are the dominant fungal phyla in the arid agroecosystem which was in general agreement with our result the abundance of dominated fungal genera cephalotrichum 21 82 68 96 decreased significantly with increase in application time of drip irrigation which was attributed to that cephalotrichum is a saprophytic soil fungus banerjee et al 2016 gonzález fernández et al 2010 in addition the higher abundance of cephalotrichum in saline wasteland could be attributed to the higher richness chao1 and ace of fungi in this study the relative abundance of metarhizium mortierella and tetracladium increased with increasing drip irrigation years the changes were ascribed to the increase in crop residues in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation which promoted the participation of soil fungal community in organic degradation and changed the distribution of the dominant fungal community at the genus level furthermore when the external environmental conditions are improved the soil environment will become conducive to the growth of mycelia and provide growing space for other populations resulting in intensified competition among fungi for space resources at the genus level koechli et al 2019 4 3 relationship between the soil bacterial fungal co occurrence network and environmental variables the co occurrence network relationships expressed mutual coexistence and exclusion relationships resulted from external interference between microorganisms banerjee et al 2018 de menezes et al 2017 hu et al 2020 strikingly the ecological network between the soil bacterial and fungal communities have changed in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation the 13 year mulched drip irrigation resulted in more positive co occurrence relationships between bacteria and fungi furthermore we found that the number of positive and negative correlations average clustering coefficient average degree and density fluctuated with increasing drip irrigation years indicating that long term mulched drip irrigation resulted in changes in the relationship of the bacterial communities to fungal communities by variations of soil physicochemical properties due to mulched drip irrigation the results supported the explanation that the fungal and bacterial communities had a remarkable correlation with the soil ec soc and tn content by rda analysis of soil microbial communities and soil physicochemical characteristics fig 5 the result of the spearman correlation analysis fig 6 it also indicated that soil bacteria and fungi might be significantly involved in soil nutrient conversions with increasing drip irrigation years our results are consistent with yang et al 2021 and zong et al 2020 who identified that soil salinity and soc are key factors affecting microbial community composition in the arid agroecosystem of northwest china we observed that soil nutrients soc an ap and ak improved with increasing drip irrigation years because soil salinity decreased annually moreover the effect of soil salinity and soc on the fungal community structure was greater than the bacterial community structure this may be because of that the increase in litter and root residues during cotton growth could promote more soil fungal communities to participate in organic degradation yang et al 2020 although our research revealed the change of soil properties and soil microbial communities in cotton fields over applying time of mulched drip irrigation the specific internal factors causing the variation of soil microbial communities were varied and complex which may require more research for detailed discussion 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to investigate the impact of long term 10 years mulched drip irrigation on soil properties and soil microbial communities in reclaimed abandoned salinized farmland in northwest china the increase in applicaition of drip irrigation have led to a significant decline in soil ec and an increase in soc an ap and ak suggesting that soil salinity has been ameliorated and soil fertility has been improved the ecological network between the soil bacterial and fungal communities have changed in cotton fields under long term mulched drip irrigation and 13 year mulched drip irrigation resulted in more positive co occurrence relationships between bacteria and fungi furthermore the highest shannon and lowest simpson values were observed in the 13 year treatment indicating that 13 year mulched drip irrigation is capable of enhancing soil microbial diversity statistical analysis showed that the effect of long term mulched drip irrigation on the soil microbial community could be attributed to the concentrations of soil ec soc and tn our results demonstrated that long term mulched drip irrigation affected the structures and interactions of microbial communities in cotton fields by reducing soil salinity and regulating the soil nutrient concentrations and 13 year mulched drip irrigation improved not only soil fertility but also soil microbial diversity in this region declaration of competing

9046,an experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effect of drainage water recycling dwr on reducing nitrogen n phosphorus p and sediment losses from agricultural fields to downstream surface water bodies the two year study may 2019 april 2021 was conducted at an agricultural field in eastern north carolina u s a a reservoir existed at the site was used to store subsurface drainage and surface runoff water during wet periods and provide supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the crop growing season on average the reservoir retained 14 of received inflow with a higher flow reduction in the dry year 2019 2020 29 than the wet year 2020 2021 8 the hydraulic retention time hrt for the reservoir was 33 8 days for the dry year and 12 4 days for the wet year the reservoir significantly reduced the loadings of n by 47 p by 30 and sediment by 87 nitrogen load reduction was primarily driven by nitrate assimilation the dominant form of n in the reservoir phosphorus load reduction was attributed to orthophosphate assimilation as the reservoir released more particulate p than received reductions in both water flow and species concentration contributed to nutrient load reductions results suggested the removal efficiency of the reservoir would be highest during the summer and early fall months when the reservoir has a smaller water volume due to irrigation longer hrt and warmer temperature this study clearly demonstrated the potential of dwr for significantly reducing n p and sediment losses from agricultural land to receiving surface water further research is needed to investigate the physical chemical and biological processes that occur in the storage reservoir and affect the fate and transport of nutrients and sediment the understanding of these processes will enable optimizing the treatment efficiency of dwr which maximizes the system s benefits and reduces construction cost keywords subsurface drainage subirrigation on farm water storage drainage water reuse supplemental irrigation surface water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural drainage is essential in humid regions for improving crop production on naturally poorly drained lands with shallow groundwater table skaggs et al 1994 it improves soil aeration for healthy crop growth by removing excess soil water in the plant root zone drainage also improves soil trafficability for timely planting and harvesting of crops skaggs et al 1994 in the state of north carolina u s approximately 37 of the cropland 750 000 ha is artificially drained usda nass 2019 agricultural drainage however accelerates the transport of nutrients sediment and pesticides from artificially drained fields to receiving surface water bodies skaggs et al 1994 nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses from drained lands to surface water are the primary causes of algal blooms and eutrophication problems in major surface water bodies in the u s including the gulf of mexico laurent et al 2021 rabalais and turner 2019 the chesapeake bay pan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and the great lakes jarvie et al 2017 smith et al 2015 in north carolina it was estimated that subsurface drainage increased n loss by 6 folds evans et al 1995 while improved surface drainage doubled p loss and increased sediment loss by a factor of 1 6 10 compared to natural conditions skaggs et al 1994 several best management practices bmps have been proposed to reduce nutrients and sediment losses from drained cropland to surface water without adversely affecting crop production among these practices are controlled drainage gilliam et al 1979 helmers et al 2022 y liu et al 2019 skaggs et al 2010 denitrifying bioreactors maxwell et al 2019 schipper et al 2010 and saturated riparian buffers jaynes and isenhart 2014 drainage water recycling dwr is a recent bmp that was proposed to provide a water source for supplemental irrigation for crop production in humid regions while reducing the transport of nutrients and sediment from agricultural fields to downstream surface water dwr systems collect and store subsurface drainage and surface runoff in on farm small reservoirs and use the stored water to irrigate crops during dry periods of the growing season frankenberger et al 2017 hay et al 2021 moursi et al 2022 limited research investigated the water quality impacts of dwr a 5 year study in ontario canada reported that dwr reduced nitrate and total p losses by 41 and 12 respectively compared to free drainage tan et al 2007 tan and zhang 2011 another dwr system installed in ontario canada reduced nitrate losses by 43 68 compared to free drainage drury et al 2009 1996 these studies reported nutrient reduction based on comparing the loads from a field with controlled drainage subirrigation system to a field with a free drainage system nutrient reduction caused by natural treatment processes occurring in the dwr reservoir was not quantified a modeling study by reinhart et al 2019 concluded that dwr would reduce nitrate losses by 24 37 and soluble reactive phosphorus losses by 21 39 in iowa and indiana the simulated nutrient reduction in reinhart et al 2019 was based on how much drainage flow was reduced and captured by the reservoir similar systems which are referred to as tailwater recovery systems twr have been gaining more interest in the southern united states tailwater recovery systems involve capturing and storing surface water runoff rather than subsurface drainage water as in dwr systems and reusing the stored water for irrigation usda nrcs 2014 these systems have been shown to provide water conservation and water quality benefits iseyemi et al 2021 moore et al 2015 omer et al 2018 concentration reduction caused by natural removal processes such as denitrification and settling which occur in the reservoir of the dwr systems has not been adequately investigated hay et al 2021 evaluating and understanding these removal processes is crucial for managing and designing dwr systems to optimize the benefits performance of dwr systems is expected to vary greatly depending on climatic and other site specific conditions thus monitoring and evaluating dwr across a wide range of conditions is necessary hay et al 2021 the main goal of this study was to experimentally investigate the effect of dwr on reducing the transport of nutrients and sediment from a research field site in eastern north carolina to downstream surface water specific objectives were to 1 quantify the effect of dwr on storing and reducing surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow before it reaches the downstream surface water 2 quantify the concentration and load reductions of n p and sediment that were exported from the field and stored in the reservoir before reaching downstream surface water bodies and 3 evaluate the factors that may affect the reduction of n p and sediment loadings in the reservoir this

1 a subsurface drainage system depth 125 cm spacing 18 m was installed at plot 1 11 48 ha to provide drainage during wet periods and subirrigation during dry periods of the growing season plot 2 11 23 ha was non irrigated and drained using shallow open ditches depth 50 cm spacing 60 m during wet periods the reservoir captured and stored subsurface drainage and surface runoff water from the surrounding agricultural land and from a forested land 32 5 ha located upstream of the reservoir the stored water in the reservoir was used to subirrigate the crops grown on plot 1 during the dry periods of the growing season because of surface slope only a portion of the surface runoff from the surrounding agricultural land was routed to the reservoir and the rest was routed to another surface water body based on a land survey the areas of the field contributing surface runoff to the reservoir were estimated to be 5 82 ha for plot 1 and 4 43 ha for plot 2 two control structures were installed at the outlet to control the reservoir s water level and storage capacity fig 2c the reservoir had to be partially drained to enable the installation of the control structures at the beginning of the study period 5 2 2019 each control structure was managed manually by fully raising the gates of the two structures during the growing season to maximize water storage for irrigation by maintaining a water depth of 2 51 m in the reservoir storage capacity 5458 m3 during the non growing season the gate of one of the structures was lowered to maintain a water depth of 2 31 m in the reservoir storage capacity 4686 m3 and allow for a slow release of the water from the reservoir when reservoir water volume exceeded reservoir storage capacity water was released through the control structure into the pungo river irrigation was applied through pumping the water from the reservoir into an 11 4 m3 2500 gallon storage tank to create enough water head for subirrigating the field by gravity a water level control structure with adjustable weir plates was installed at the outlet of the main subsurface drain of plot 1 to adjust the level of the outlet and regulate the rate of drainage flow from the field fig 1 location 3 a smart water management system was connected to the control structure to regulate and trigger drainage and subirrigation based on the water table level at plot 1 bagheri 2022 moursi 2022 the dominant soil type at the field site was altavista fine sandy loam which is moderately well drained soil the field was planted to a two year crop rotation of corn and soybean table sm 1 2 2 experimental site instrumentation and data collection the experimental field site was fully instrumented at the beginning of the 2019 growing season to conduct water nutrients and sediment balances for the storage reservoir hydrologic and water quality data were collected for two years from may 2019 to april 2021 2 2 1 hydrologic data measurement stations were installed at inlet points and outlet point of the reservoir to monitor flow rates and collect water quality samples locations of the reservoir inflow outflow measurement stations are shown in fig 1 surface runoff from plots 1 and 2 was collected using shallow ditches that drained into the reservoir to reduce instrumentation cost surface runoff was measured only at one ditch for each plot and total surface runoff from each plot was estimated based on the drainage area served by each ditch relative to the total area contributing runoff from each plot flow rates at reservoir inlets and outlet points were measured using v notch weirs fig 2 water stages upstream and downstream of each weir were measured using campbell scientific self compensating pressure transducers cs451 flow rate was calculated using the v notch weir equation eq 1 that estimates flow as a function of water stage and weir dimensions kulin and compton 1975 u s bureau of reclamation 2001 1 q 4 28 c e tan θ 2 h 2

measured using a flow meter with pulse output prm woltmann helix style flow rates were estimated and recorded by cr 200x data loggers campbell scientific that were installed at each flow measuring station the time interval of surface runoff and irrigation measurements was 30 min and 60 min for all other measurements precipitation and air temperature were measured using automated hobo tipping bucket rain gauges the automated rain gauges were installed near the reservoir outlet and regularly checked and calibrated using a manual rain gauge the 30 year normal precipitation was retrieved from a nearby weather station for the 1975 2004 period belhaven 3 ne 35 57306 n 76 58472 w the reservoir water level and water temperature were monitored on an hourly basis using a hobo automatic water level data logger installed in a 100 mm diameter pvc perforated pipe the reservoir water level was also monitored manually using a staff gauge to calibrate the hobo data logger water table depths in both plots were measured using hobo automatic water level data loggers installed in 100 mm diameter pvc observation wells midway between tile drains for plot 1 and open ditches for plot 2 flow data of subsurface drainage from plot 1 were lost during the periods 9 12 2019 9 25 2019 14 days and 3 31 2020 6 3 2020 65 days due to instrumentation breakdown a linear regression model was used to estimate the missing subsurface drainage flow data using the water table data as the independent variable with r2 0 86 and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 81 the field water table was below the weir level of the control structure with no subsurface drainage outflow during half of the days with missing data 40 out of 79 days in addition the estimated drainage flow during the period of missing data was 1605 m3 which accounted for only 5 of the total subsurface drainage flow during the study period 32 187 m3 2 2 2 water quality data each flow measurement station was equipped with an automated water quality sampler ws700 global water to collect flow proportional composite samples the samplers were programmed to collect 50 ml water sample in a composite sample bottle 9 5 liter for every specific threshold of flow passing over the v notch weir of each station the flow threshold values were set based on the average flow expected at each measurement station so that the composite sample bottle will not overflow before sample collection the flow threshold values were 3 m3 for surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow 8 m3 for reservoir outflow and 190 m3 for irrigation grab samples were also collected from the reservoir water samples were collected from the field every two weeks and refrigerated at 4 c until laboratory analysis was conducted in total 187 water quality samples were collected and analyzed during the two year study period water samples were analyzed for nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn orthophosphate ortho p total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss concentrations of no3 n nh4 n tkn ortho p and tp were determined using the latchat quikchem flow injection analysis system latchat quikchem 8500 organic nitrogen on was calculated by subtracting nh4 n from tkn total nitrogen tn was calculated by summing no3 n and tkn particulate phosphorus pp was calculated by subtracting ortho p from tp tss was calculated using the dried and filtered weight of the water sample divided by the total volume of the sample the equipment s detection limits were 0 10 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 for n and p species respectively measured concentrations that were below detection limits were set at one half of the detection limit 2 3 reservoir area volume depth relationship a bathymetric survey was conducted for the reservoir using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp to develop an area volume depth relationship for the reservoir water depth measurements were made along twelve transacts perpendicular to the reservoir an emlid rtk gps was used to conduct the survey for the shallow and vegetated areas of the reservoir where the adcp accuracy is low these measurements were used to create an elevation map for the reservoir using arcgis software fig 3 the storage capacity tool in arcgis was used to develop the area volume depth relationship fig 3 the daily water level measurements of the reservoir were then used to estimate the daily water volume and surface area from the relationship curve 2 4 reservoir water nutrient and sediment balances a daily water balance was calculated for the reservoir based on eq 2 2 δ v p q in q ro 1 q ro 2 q drn q irr q out s e where δ v is the change in reservoir water volume during a specific day p is the direct precipitation volume received by the reservoir q in is the inflow water volume from the upstream forested land q ro 1 and q ro 2 are the surface runoff volumes from plots 1 and 2 respectively q drn is the subsurface drainage flow from plot 1 q irr is the irrigation water volume withdrawn from the reservoir q out is the outflow volume released from the reservoir when it reached maximum storage capacity s is seepage losses from the reservoir and

used in eq 2 all the water balance components in eq 3 were measured except seepage and evaporation which were estimated as the residual of the water balance the percent flow reduction to downstream

collected every two weeks the measured concentration of the water sample was used for all days since the last measured concentration the concentration and load reductions achieved by the dwr system

leaving the reservoir via outflow 2 5 hydraulic retention time the hydraulic retention time hrt is defined in this study as the average time that inflow water remains in the reservoir before it is released through the reservoir outlet which depends on the reservoir s storage capacity and inflow rate based on the weather characteristics and timing of growing season at the study site each year of the study period was divided into 3 distinct periods period 1 may august period 2 september december and period 3 january april the reservoir is expected to have the least water volume in period 1 due to irrigation consumption be gradually refilled during period 2 and remain at or near storage capacity during period 3 the hrt was estimated for each period using eq 7 assuming the reservoir is under a steady state condition inflow rate outflow rate 7 hrt v max p q in q ro 1 q ro 2 q drn where hrt is the hydraulic retention time estimated at the appropriate temporal scale day and v max is the reservoir storage capacity m3 2 6 statistical analysis the measured data did not meet the normality assumption according to the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 therefore the non parametric two sample wilcoxon rank test wilcoxon 1945 was used to compare and identify the significance of differences among concentrations and loadings of nutrients and sediment in the inflows and outflow of the reservoir the null hypotheses were no significant change in concentrations and loads between the inflow and outflow of the reservoir the tests were conducted at a 5 level of significance α 0 05 additionally a multivariate linear correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the factors influencing the nutrients and sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir the correlation coefficients between each factor and mass load reduction of each nutrient species and sediment lr eq 6 were quantified the correlation was done between the average of each factor and load reduction in each of the three periods periods 1 2 and 3 of each year total of 6 data points the examined factors were water temperature hrt water volume in the reservoir and water inflow the distributions of these factors were not significantly different from the normal distribution as per the shapiro wilk normality test the pearson product moment correlation coefficients and their statistical significance were determined based on a 5 level of significance pearson 1896 all statistical analyses were implemented using r studio statistical software version 4 0 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation the 30 year normal precipitation was 1163 mm with higher precipitation occurring during summer june august compared to the other seasons 33 table 1 the first year of the study may 2019 april 2020 was relatively dry with 6 6 less precipitation than the long term average the first four months of this year may aug 2019 were substantially dry compared to the long term average the total precipitation during may aug 2019 was 303 mm which was 37 2 less than the long term average of 483 mm this large precipitation deficit was offset by extremely wet conditions in sep 2019 and feb 2020 leading to a relatively small deviation from the annual long term average precipitation in contrast the second year may 2020 april 2021 was wet with precipitation exceeding the long term average by 28 the second year was characterized by two distinct periods jun oct 2020 which was comparable to the long term average followed by nov 2020 feb 2021 which was extremely wet with total precipitation greater than double the long term average 674 mm vs 329 mm 3 2 reservoir water balance most of the water received by the reservoir was in the form of surface runoff from the two agricultural field plots and the upstream forested land 82 table 2 the upstream forested land contributed the largest amount of inflow water to the reservoir 38 while subsurface drainage contributed the least amount of inflow water 14 the reservoir received 2 5 times greater inflow in the wetter year 2020 2021 compared to the inflow received in the drier year 2019 2020 table 2 fig sm 1 over the two year period the reservoir released 86 of the total inflow as outflow from its outlet of the total inflow 5 7 was withdrawn for irrigation 7 5 was lost via evaporation and seepage and 0 8 represented an increase in the water stored in the reservoir more water was captured by the reservoir during 2019 2020 compared to 2020 2021 in 2019 2020 the reservoir released 71 of the total inflow compared to 92 released in 2020 2021 this was in part due to the water storage level at the beginning of the two year study as some of the water stored in the reservoir had to be released for the installation of the control structures at the reservoir outlet at the beginning of the two year study the volume of the water stored in the reservoir was 3044 m3 which represented 56 of the reservoir storage capacity as a result no water was released from the reservoir until sep 2019 fig sm 1 fig 4 additionally seepage and evaporation losses from the reservoir were higher in 2019 2020 than in 2020 2021 evaporation losses in 2019 2020 6828 m3 were almost double the evaporation losses in 2020 2021 3843 m3 based on estimates from a nearby weather station 35 36233 n 76 71629 w seepage losses were driven by the hydraulic head which was influenced by the water level in the reservoir and the groundwater table depth in the surrounding field area seepage loss in 2019 2020 was hypothesized to be higher than in 2020 2021 since the groundwater table was substantially deeper in 2019 2020 creating greater hydraulic gradient that drove more seepage the monthly water volume received by released from the reservoir and the reservoir water level during the study period are shown in fig 4 for both years the reservoir remained at near storage capacity except during the growing season when water was withdrawn for irrigation during both years the reservoir received the highest amount of water in winter and the lowest amount of water in spring this was attributed to the frequent rainfall and low evapotranspiration during the winter months 3 3 hydraulic retention time the average hrt for 2019 2020 33 8 days was almost three times longer than that for 2020 2021 12 4 days with longer hrt values for all 3 periods of 2019 2020 compared to those of 2020 2021 fig 5 in 2019 2020 dry year period 1 had the longest hrt of 57 9 d and period 3 had the shortest hrt of 17 2 d the hrt values in the 2020 2021 wet year were substantially shorter during all three periods compared to 2019 2020 the hrt in 2020 20021 varied between 15 2 d in period 2 and 7 8 d in period 3 it can be implied from these results that the system would have higher nutrient and sediment removal efficiency during the growing season period compared to the rest of the year additionally nutrient and sediment removal efficiency would be higher in 2019 2020 dry year than in 2020 2021 wet year fig 6 3 4 reservoir nitrogen balance 3 4 1 nitrogen in reservoir inflows nitrogen load entered the reservoir via different inflow sources consisted primarily of no3 n 76 with considerably smaller percentages of on 19 and nh4 n 5 table 4 and fig sm 2 subsurface drainage water was the main source of nitrate reaching the reservoir and contributed significantly highest no3 n load 68 of nitrate load compared to other sources the mean annual no3 n load via subsurface drainage flow was 216 kg or 18 8 kg n ha 1 calculated by dividing the load in kg by the source area in ha this nitrate load was within the 1 3 36 8 kg ha 1 nitrate load range reported by poole et al 2018 for a tile drained research field in eastern north carolina the no3 n concentration in subsurface drainage flow was significantly higher 11 65 mg l 1 than no3 n concentration in surface runoff from both agricultural fields plot 1 2 18 mg l 1 plot 2 4 92 mg l 1 and forested land 0 81 mg l 1 fig sm 3 and table 3 nitrate load reaching the reservoir exhibited distinct seasonal variation most of no3 n load entered the reservoir during november march which corresponded to the increase of no3 n leaching via subsurface drainage flow nitrate load during this period accounted for 77 and 56 of total no3 n load entered the reservoir in the first and second years respectively nitrate concentration also showed large temporal variation with higher concentrations during the first year of the study compared to the second year fig sm 3 severely dry weather conditions in year 1 caused major crop yield loss and large residual n at the end of the growing season which subsequently increased nitrate losses from the agricultural fields during the fallow period fig sm 3 nitrate concentration tended to peak after fertilizer applications in each of the two growing seasons of the study for example a rainfall event that occurred four days after fertilizer application in late may 2019 generated surface runoff from plot 2 with no3 n concentration of 48 9 mg l 1 data point not shown in fig sm 3 to better visualize concentration trend and small concentration values another rainfall event that occurred after fertilizer application in early june 2020 generated a spike in no3 n concentration in surface runoff from plot 2 14 3 mg l 1 and subsurface drainage from plot 1 19 1 mg l 1 although flow weighted mean concentration of no3 n in reservoir inflow was significantly higher in year 1 5 05 mg l 1 compared to year 2 2 00 mg l 1 no3 n loads entered the reservoir in both years were comparable 315 and 319 kg respectively this can be attributed to the substantially lower reservoir inflow volume during year 1 66 487 m3 compared to year 2 164 917 m3 the on load entered the reservoir mainly via surface runoff from both the agricultural 53 of on load and forested land 42 table 4 the on concentrations in the surface runoff from both the agricultural and forested land were comparable with no statistically significant difference table 3 unlike nitrate load which was comparable for both years the annual on load that entered the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was 2 8 times greater than the on load in the drier year year 1 this was primarily driven by the variability in annual inflow volume rather on concentration the inflow water in year 2 was 2 5 times greater than inflow water in year 1 unlike flow weighted nitrate concentration which was inversely proportional to inflow water volume the wetter year had slightly higher flow weighted on concentration than the drier year 0 72 mg l 1 in year 2 vs 0 66 mg l 1 in year 1 ammonium concentrations in inflows from all sources were negligible as 73 of water samples had nh4 n concentration below or equal to the detection limit of the laboratory equipment 0 10 mg l 1 3 4 2 nitrogen in water stored in the reservoir reservoir outflow and irrigation during the two year study period 440 2 kg n was released from the reservoir via outflow water and only 37 3 kg n was recycled back to the agricultural fields via irrigation water more n was recycled back to the agricultural fields in the second year table 4 when larger amount of irrigation water was applied compared to the first year table 2 total n load released via outflow water in the wetter year year 2 was more than twice the tn load released in the drier year year 1 table 4 298 1 kg n in year 2 vs 142 1 kg n in year 1 nitrogen load released from the reservoir was mainly in the form of nitrate and on representing 59 and 36 of tn load released from the reservoir respectively nitrate was the dominant form of n released in year 1 representing 68 1 of tn load released in year 2 nitrate still represented the largest percentage of tn load released in that year 55 6 of tn however on release was a major contributor to tn load released in year 2 40 3 of tn the release of n from the reservoir to downstream surface water mainly occurred during november february which was driven by the increase of n entering the reservoir via subsurface drainage flow total n load released from the reservoir during this period accounted for 79 and 58 of tn load released from the reservoir in year 1 and year 2 respectively on average over the two year study period both outflow and irrigation water had less than 1 5 mg l 1 no3 n concentration fig sm 4 however nitrate concentrations in both outflow and irrigation water varied greatly outflow 0 10 5 28 mg l 1 irrigation 0 11 3 49 mg l 1 nitrate concentration in water stored in the reservoir was not significantly different from no3 n concentration in reservoir outflow table 5 in contrast no3 n concentration in irrigation water was significantly higher than no3 n concentration in the reservoir which indicates the presence of concentration gradient in the water column irrigation pump intake was 40 cm above the bottom of the reservoir while the reservoir water samples were collected from the top 50 cm of the water column it should also be mentioned that water samples collected from the reservoir were grab samples representing concentrations at the time of sampling on the other hand the samples collected from all inflow sources irrigation and reservoir outflow were composite samples representing a flow weighted concentration for the time period between sample collections nitrate concentration near the water surface of reservoirs is usually lower since it is consumed more quickly by plankton webb 2017 3 4 3 nitrogen reduction by the reservoir total n load was significantly reduced by the reservoir by 47 391 kg with a larger load reduction in the first year than the second year table 4 and fig 7 the reduction in tn load was primarily driven by the reduction in nitrate loads nitrate load received by the reservoir was reduced by 69 218 2 kg n in year 1 and 48 153 0 kg n in year 2 the reservoir slightly reduced on load in year 1 but released more on in year 2 compared to on load received however none of the differences between on loads received and released by the reservoir were statistically significant table 4 the reservoir was highly efficient in assimilating a large portion of n that entered the reservoir during november february when n input to the reservoir peaked fig 7 as high as 55 of tn load reduction in year 1 and 42 of tn load reduction in year 2 occurred during this period nitrogen recycling back to the agricultural field via irrigation had only marginal contribution to n reduction by the reservoir during the two year study n recycled back to the field via irrigation was 37 3 kg n representing only 4 5 of tn received by the reservoir both flow reduction and concentration reduction contributed to the overall tn load reduction however tn concentration reduction had a greater impact on tn load reduction than the flow reduction in year 1 tn concentration was reduced by 51 and flow was reduced by 29 leading to a 63 reduction in tn load in year 2 tn concentration was reduced by 30 while flow was only reduced by 8 leading to an overall tn load reduction of 33 total n concentration reduction was mainly caused by the reduction of no3 n concentration fig 6 and table 6 the reservoir reduced no3 n concentration by 60 3 01 mg l 1 in year 1 and 45 0 91 mg l 1 in year 2 nitrate concentration in subsurface drainage flow exceeded the usepa drinking water standard of 10 mg l 1 in 18 62 of the 29 collected samples while the maximum no3 n concentration in the reservoir outflow was 5 28 mg l 1 organic n concentration in water released from the reservoir was slightly higher 0 11 mg l 1 than in the water received by the reservoir however this difference was not significant table 6 the on concentration was not reduced in the reservoir since a portion of the inorganic n may have been assimilated by phytoplankton and eventually released from the reservoir in the phytoplankton biomass fairchild and velinsky 2006 3 5 reservoir phosphorus balance 3 5 1 phosphorus in reservoir inflows the tp load 53 kg received by the reservoir consisted primarily of ortho p 67 with a smaller percentage of pp 33 fig sm 5 and table 4 ortho p load reached the reservoir mainly via surface runoff plot 1 35 plot 2 50 forested land 14 of ortho p load while subsurface drainage contribution of ortho p was negligible 1 ortho p concentration was significantly higher in surface runoff from the agricultural fields compared to concentration in inflow from the forested land table 3 fig 8 in both years of the study the reservoir received higher ortho p load during the summer and fall months blue bars in fig 9 when surface runoff occurred following large storm events for example a 301 mm storm event occurred on 9 6 2019 generated 1596 m3 runoff and 3 7 kg ortho p load like no3 n ortho p concentrations in inflow from agricultural fields were higher in year 1 than in year 2 fig sm 6 which could be attributed to leaching of unutilized p fertilizer by the severely water stressed corn in 2019 despite the higher flow weighted mean concentration of ortho p in the reservoir inflow in year 1 0 19 mg l 1 than in year 2 0 03 mg l 1 ortho p loads in both years were similar 17 6 and 17 5 kg respectively due to the lower inflow water volume in year 1 like ortho p most of pp load entered the reservoir via surface runoff 48 of pp load carried by surface runoff from the agricultural fields plot 1 27 plot 2 21 of pp and 43 of pp load entered the reservoir via surface runoff from the forested land concentrations of pp did not differ significantly among all inflow sources table 3 like on the annual pp load entered the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was 2 8 times greater than the pp load in the drier year 1 table 4 3 5 2 phosphorus in water stored in the reservoir reservoir outflow and irrigation during the two year study period 37 kg p was released from the reservoir via outflow water and 4 6 kg p was recycled back to the agricultural fields via irrigation water similar to n more p was recycled back to the agricultural fields in year 2 when larger amount of irrigation water was applied compared to year 1 total p load released from the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was more than twice tp released in the drier year year 1 table 4 based on the two year average the released p load contained more pp 55 of tp than ortho p 45 of tp the tp load released from the reservoir in year 1 contained more ortho p 55 than pp conversely pp represented the larger percentage of tp load released in year 2 58 of tp total p recycled to the field via irrigation was mainly in the ortho p form 63 of tp the release of tp from the reservoir was mainly driven by precipitation amount and intensity for example 46 of tp released from the reservoir in the first year happened in only 10 days 6 16 september 2019 as a result of hurricane dorian that brought 160 mm of precipitation to the field site on average over the two year study period both outflow and irrigation water had less than 0 5 mg l 1 tp concentration outflow 0 08 0 66 mg l 1 irrigation 0 07 0 76 mg l 1 ortho p and tp concentrations were significantly higher in reservoir outflow and irrigation water than in the water stored in the reservoir fig sm 7 and table 5 additionally pp concentration was significantly higher in reservoir outflow than in the water stored in the reservoir 3 5 3 phosphorus reduction by the reservoir the reservoir significantly reduced tp load by 30 16 kg with a higher significant reduction in year 1 51 compared to a non significant reduction in year 2 15 the reduction in tp load was mainly driven by reduction assimilation of ortho p in the reservoir the ortho p load received by the reservoir was reduced by 52 18 4 kg particulate p load released from the reservoir was 14 2 4 kg higher than the load received however the increase was not significant both flow reduction and concentration reduction contributed to the overall tp load reduction in year 1 tp concentration was reduced by 35 and flow was reduced by 29 leading to a 51 reduction in tp load in year 2 tp concentration was reduced by 11 while flow was reduced by 8 leading to an overall tp load reduction of 15 the tp concentration reduction was mainly caused by the reduction of ortho p concentration fig 8 and table 6 over the two year study period the reservoir significantly reduced ortho p concentration by an average of 46 0 07 mg l 1 particulate p concentration in the water released from the reservoir was significantly higher than pp concentration in the water received by the reservoir in year 1 by 42 0 03 mg l 1 however the concentration difference was not significant in year 2 unlike ortho p that remains in the water column and can be assimilated by algae pp settles down leaving the water column to the bed of the reservoir it has been shown that pp concentrations are correlated with the transport of fine sediment in the clay size range stone and mudroch 1989 mcdowell et al 2001 poirier et al 2012 which can be easily entrained and released from the reservoir during large runoff events based on a study conducted on 11 ponds located in southeastern pennsylvania fairchild and velinsky 2006 reported that small ponds can greatly reduce ortho p but they usually export more pp than they receive 3 6 reservoir sediment balance 3 6 1 sediment in reservoir inflows sediment load entered the reservoir primarily via surface runoff from the agricultural land 83 with less contribution from the upstream forested land 17 surface runoff from plot 1 contributed almost two thirds 64 of the total sediment load received by the reservoir which was significantly higher than loads from all other inflow sources sediment loads contributed by surface runoff from plot 2 and upstream forested land were comparable sediment load received by the reservoir in year 2 47 712 kg was almost double the sediment load in year 1 24 369 kg fig sm 8 table 4 as expected tss concentration in surface runoff from the forested land 148 mg l 1 was significantly lower than tss concentration in surface runoff from agricultural field plots surface runoff from plot 1 carried significantly higher tss concentration 751 mgl 1 compared to tss concentration from plot 2 410 mg l 1 fig sm 9 table 3 this can be attributed to the effect of the relatively wetter soil profile at plot 1 because of controlled drainage and subirrigation which raised the field water table level and subsequently increased surface runoff and soil erosion for example consecutive rainfall events 64 mm occurred on june 12 16 2020 produced 58 mm of runoff with 3969 mg l 1 of tss from plot 1 while it only produced 24 mm of runoff with 318 mg l 1 of tss from plot 2 during this period average field water table level was 16 cm below soil surface in plot 1 while it was 30 cm in plot 2 3 6 2 sediment in water stored in the reservoir reservoir outflow and irrigation during the two year study period a total of 9190 kg sediment was released from the reservoir via outflow water sediment load released from the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was nearly three times greater than the sediment load released in the drier year year 1 table 4 the release of sediment from the reservoir was intermittent as it occurred following large and high intensity precipitation events for example 46 of sediment transport in year 1 occurred in february 2020 while 68 of sediment transport in year 2 occurred in july august 2020 fig 11 the tss concentration in reservoir outflow was significantly higher than in the water stored in the reservoir but was not significantly different from tss concentration in irrigation water fig sm 10 table 5 3 6 3 sediment reduction by the reservoir the reservoir significantly reduced sediment load by 87 62 9 mg table 4 although the second year was much wetter than the first year and had shorter hrt the sediment reduction percentage was nearly similar for both years 90 for year 1 and 86 for year 2 the reduction in sediment load was mainly driven by reduction in tss concentration as the reservoir significantly reduced tss concentration by 86 273 mg l 1 over the two year study period fig 10 table 6 the reservoir achieved a significant sediment reduction even when it was nearly full through reducing the inflows velocity and the slow release of water via the reservoir outlet fig 11 another factor that could have contributed to the high sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir is that the ditches carrying surface runoff from the two field plots to the reservoir were distributed along the length of the reservoir fig 1 3 7 factors affecting nitrogen phosphorus and sediment dynamics in the reservoir the mechanisms controlling n assimilation in reservoirs are uptake by plankton and aquatic plants denitrification and deposition jansson et al 1994 saunders and kalff 2001 phosphorus assimilation in reservoirs occurs via uptake of dissolved p by plankton and aquatic plants and deposition of particulate p pettersson 1998 settling is the primary mechanism for reducing sediment load by the reservoir as water carrying sediment enters the reservoir flow velocity decreases and sediment settles leaving the water column and accumulating at the bottom of the reservoir verstraeten 2000 the hrt water temperature water volume in the reservoir and water inflow are expected to influence these mechanisms processes and subsequently affect the nutrient and sediment load reduction by the reservoir the correlations between these four factors and the load reduction of n p and sediment by the reservoir were evaluated table 7 nitrogen phosphorus and sediment load reductions were positively correlated with the reservoir water temperature and hrt and negatively correlated with water inflow to the reservoir and reservoir water volume this would suggest that the removal efficiency of the reservoir would be highest during summer and early fall when the reservoir has a relatively longer hrt due to irrigation withdrawal and warmer temperature this also indicates that the reservoir removal efficiency is strongly linked with the crop water requirements that determine irrigation rate and affect the reservoir water storage reinhart et al 2019 some of the correlation coefficients were not significant despite being considerably high which was likely caused by the small number of data points used in the correlation analysis 6 points the hrt had the major effect on n and sediment load reductions in the reservoir the hrt had a highly significant correlation with the no3 n 0 95 and tn 0 99 and the highest but not significant correlation with tss the longer hrt the more time for the natural treatment processes such as denitrification and settling to occur in the reservoir the reservoir inflow had a significantly negative correlation with the load reduction of no3 n 0 90 and tn 0 85 high flow events increase the resuspension of mineralized organic nutrients on the bottom of the reservoir and release them to the water column the load reductions of the organic species of n and p were significantly correlated with water volume in the reservoir large water volume in the reservoir means less time for the soil particles carrying organic n and p to settle in the reservoir which negatively affects the reservoir removal efficiency the reservoir water temperature had a significantly positive correlation with the load reduction of no3 n 0 85 and nh4 n 0 83 high water temperature increases the growth rate of plankton that quickly depletes dissolved oxygen in the water m liu et al 2019 which stimulates denitrification jansson et al 1994 and increases the uptake of inorganic forms of n and p 4 conclusion this study experimentally investigated the effect of drainage water recycling dwr on reducing downstream nitrogen n phosphorus p and sediment losses from an agricultural field in eastern north carolina water nutrients and sediment balances were conducted over a two year period for the water storage reservoir of the dwr system the following conclusions can be drawn from the study the water storage reservoir of the drainage water recycling system substantially reduced n load by 47 this reduction was primarily attributed to the assimilation of nitrate the dominant form of n in the dwr system the reservoir reduced p load by 30 a less percentage than n reduction but statistically significant while the reservoir was effective in assimilating the dissolved forms of p orthophosphates it was a net source of particulate p causing the total p load reduction to be less than the total n load reduction the reservoir was extremely effective in reducing sediment transport with a two year average reduction of 87 the hydraulic retention time hrt which describes how long the water remains in the storage reservoir was the major factor affecting the nutrients and sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir the nutrients and sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir exhibited seasonal and annual variation the highest nutrient and sediment reductions occurred during summer and early fall when the reservoir had a relatively longer hrt due to irrigation withdrawal and warmer temperature larger reductions of nutrients and sediment occurred during the drier year than the wet year in general this study demonstrated that dwr can substantially reduce nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural landscapes while providing a water source for supplemental irrigation to increase climate resiliency of crop production in the u s southeast while this study expands the limited knowledge on the water quality benefits of dwr systems it was limited by the relatively short experimental period 2 years and the effect of site specific conditions on system performance further research is needed to evaluate the performance of dwr under varying site conditions for longer periods research is also needed to investigate processes and

9046,an experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effect of drainage water recycling dwr on reducing nitrogen n phosphorus p and sediment losses from agricultural fields to downstream surface water bodies the two year study may 2019 april 2021 was conducted at an agricultural field in eastern north carolina u s a a reservoir existed at the site was used to store subsurface drainage and surface runoff water during wet periods and provide supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the crop growing season on average the reservoir retained 14 of received inflow with a higher flow reduction in the dry year 2019 2020 29 than the wet year 2020 2021 8 the hydraulic retention time hrt for the reservoir was 33 8 days for the dry year and 12 4 days for the wet year the reservoir significantly reduced the loadings of n by 47 p by 30 and sediment by 87 nitrogen load reduction was primarily driven by nitrate assimilation the dominant form of n in the reservoir phosphorus load reduction was attributed to orthophosphate assimilation as the reservoir released more particulate p than received reductions in both water flow and species concentration contributed to nutrient load reductions results suggested the removal efficiency of the reservoir would be highest during the summer and early fall months when the reservoir has a smaller water volume due to irrigation longer hrt and warmer temperature this study clearly demonstrated the potential of dwr for significantly reducing n p and sediment losses from agricultural land to receiving surface water further research is needed to investigate the physical chemical and biological processes that occur in the storage reservoir and affect the fate and transport of nutrients and sediment the understanding of these processes will enable optimizing the treatment efficiency of dwr which maximizes the system s benefits and reduces construction cost keywords subsurface drainage subirrigation on farm water storage

improving crop production on naturally poorly drained lands with shallow groundwater table skaggs et al 1994 it improves soil aeration for healthy crop growth by removing excess soil water in the plant root zone drainage also improves soil trafficability for timely planting and harvesting of crops skaggs et al 1994 in the state of north carolina u s approximately 37 of the cropland 750 000 ha is artificially drained usda nass 2019 agricultural drainage however accelerates the transport of nutrients sediment and pesticides from artificially drained fields to receiving surface water bodies skaggs et al 1994 nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses from drained lands to surface water are the primary causes of algal blooms and eutrophication problems in major surface water bodies in the u s including the gulf of mexico laurent et al 2021 rabalais and turner 2019 the chesapeake bay pan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and the great lakes jarvie et al 2017 smith et al 2015 in north carolina it was estimated that subsurface drainage increased n loss by 6 folds evans et al 1995 while improved surface drainage doubled p loss and increased sediment loss by a factor of 1 6 10 compared to natural conditions skaggs et al 1994 several best management practices bmps have been proposed to reduce nutrients and sediment losses from drained cropland to surface water without adversely affecting crop production among these practices are controlled drainage gilliam et al 1979 helmers et al 2022 y liu et al 2019 skaggs et al 2010 denitrifying bioreactors maxwell et al 2019 schipper et al 2010 and saturated riparian buffers jaynes and isenhart 2014 drainage water recycling dwr is a recent bmp that was proposed to provide a water source for supplemental irrigation for crop production in humid regions while reducing the transport of nutrients and sediment from agricultural fields to downstream surface water dwr systems collect and store subsurface drainage and surface runoff in on farm small reservoirs and use the stored water to irrigate crops during dry periods of the growing season frankenberger et al 2017 hay et al 2021 moursi et al 2022 limited research investigated the water quality impacts of dwr a 5 year study in ontario canada reported that dwr reduced nitrate and total p losses by 41 and 12 respectively compared to free drainage tan et al 2007 tan and zhang 2011 another dwr system installed in ontario canada reduced nitrate losses by 43 68 compared to free drainage drury et al 2009 1996 these studies reported nutrient reduction based on comparing the loads from a field with controlled drainage subirrigation system to a field with a free drainage system nutrient reduction caused by natural treatment processes occurring in the dwr reservoir was not quantified a modeling study by reinhart et al 2019 concluded that dwr would reduce nitrate losses by 24 37 and soluble reactive phosphorus losses by 21 39 in iowa and indiana the simulated nutrient reduction in reinhart et al 2019 was based on how much drainage flow was reduced and captured by the reservoir similar systems which are referred to as tailwater recovery systems twr have been gaining more interest in the southern united states tailwater recovery systems involve capturing and storing surface water runoff rather than subsurface drainage water as in dwr systems and reusing the stored water for irrigation usda nrcs 2014 these systems have been shown to provide water conservation and water quality benefits iseyemi et al 2021 moore et al 2015 omer et al 2018 concentration reduction caused by natural removal processes such as denitrification and settling which occur in the reservoir of the dwr systems has not been adequately investigated hay et al 2021 evaluating and understanding these removal processes is crucial for managing and designing dwr systems to optimize the benefits performance of dwr systems is expected to vary greatly depending on climatic and other site specific conditions thus monitoring and evaluating dwr across a wide range of conditions is necessary hay et al 2021 the main goal of this study was to experimentally investigate the effect of dwr on reducing the transport of nutrients and sediment from a research field site in eastern north carolina to downstream surface water specific objectives were to 1 quantify the effect of dwr on storing and reducing surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow before it reaches the downstream surface water 2 quantify the concentration and load reductions of n p and sediment that were exported from the field and stored in the reservoir before reaching downstream surface water bodies and 3 evaluate the factors that may affect the reduction of n p and sediment loadings in the reservoir this paper reports results of two years may 2019 april 2021 of the experimental research 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experimental study was conducted at a privately owned farm in the atlantic coastal plain of the state of north carolina u s 35 29 45 32 n 76 42 56 85 w fig 1 an elongated reservoir existed at the site with a surface area of 0 38 ha 3840 m2 and a depth of 2 51 m at its deepest location which provided a storage capacity of 5458 m3 53 1 acre inch two field plots plot 1 and plot 2 were laid out one on each side of the agricultural land surrounding the reservoir fig 1 a subsurface drainage system depth 125 cm spacing 18 m was installed at plot 1 11 48 ha to provide drainage during wet periods and subirrigation during dry periods of the growing season plot 2 11 23 ha was non irrigated and drained using shallow open ditches depth 50 cm spacing 60 m during wet periods the reservoir captured and stored subsurface drainage and surface runoff water from the surrounding agricultural land and from a forested land 32 5 ha located upstream of the reservoir the stored water in the reservoir was used to subirrigate the crops grown on plot 1 during the dry periods of the growing season because of surface slope only a portion of the surface runoff from the surrounding agricultural land was routed to the reservoir and the rest was routed to another surface water body based on a land survey the areas of the field contributing surface runoff to the reservoir were estimated to be 5 82 ha for plot 1 and 4 43 ha for plot 2 two control structures were installed at the outlet to control the reservoir s water level and storage capacity fig 2c the reservoir had to be partially drained to enable the installation of the control structures at the beginning of the study period 5 2 2019 each control structure was managed manually by fully raising the gates of the two structures during the growing season to maximize water storage for irrigation by maintaining a water depth of 2 51 m in the reservoir storage capacity 5458 m3 during the non growing season the gate of one of the structures was lowered to maintain a water depth of 2 31 m in the reservoir storage capacity 4686 m3 and allow for a slow release of the water from the reservoir when reservoir water volume exceeded reservoir storage capacity water was released through the control structure into the pungo river irrigation was applied through pumping the water from the reservoir into an 11 4 m3 2500 gallon storage tank to create enough water head for subirrigating the field by gravity a water level control structure with adjustable weir plates was installed at the outlet of the main subsurface drain of plot 1 to adjust the level of the outlet and regulate the rate of drainage flow from the field fig 1 location 3 a smart water management system was connected to the control structure to regulate and trigger drainage and subirrigation based on the water table level at plot 1 bagheri 2022 moursi 2022 the dominant soil type at the field site was altavista fine sandy loam which is moderately well drained soil the field was planted to a two year crop rotation of corn and soybean table sm 1 2 2 experimental site instrumentation and data collection the experimental field site was fully instrumented at the beginning of the 2019 growing season to conduct water nutrients and sediment balances for the storage reservoir hydrologic and water quality data were collected for two years from may 2019 to april 2021 2 2 1 hydrologic data measurement stations were installed at inlet points and outlet point of the reservoir to monitor flow rates and collect water quality samples locations of the reservoir inflow outflow measurement stations are shown in fig 1 surface runoff from plots 1 and 2 was collected using shallow ditches that drained into the reservoir to reduce instrumentation cost surface runoff was measured only at one ditch for each plot and total surface runoff from each plot was estimated based on the drainage area served by each ditch relative to the total area contributing runoff from each plot flow rates at reservoir inlets and outlet points were measured using v notch weirs fig 2 water stages upstream and downstream of each weir were measured using campbell scientific self compensating pressure transducers cs451 flow rate was calculated using the v notch weir equation eq 1 that estimates flow as a function of water stage and weir dimensions kulin and compton 1975 u s bureau of reclamation 2001 1 q 4 28 c e tan θ 2 h 2

measured using a flow meter with pulse output prm woltmann helix style flow rates were estimated and recorded by cr 200x data loggers campbell scientific that were installed at each flow measuring station the time interval of surface runoff and irrigation measurements was 30 min and 60 min for all other measurements precipitation and air temperature were measured using automated hobo tipping bucket rain gauges the automated rain gauges were installed near the reservoir outlet and regularly checked and calibrated using a manual rain gauge the 30 year normal precipitation was retrieved from a nearby weather station for the 1975 2004 period belhaven 3 ne 35 57306 n 76 58472 w the reservoir water level and water temperature were monitored on an hourly basis using a hobo automatic water level data logger installed in a 100 mm diameter pvc perforated pipe the reservoir water level was also monitored manually using a staff gauge to calibrate the hobo data logger water table depths in both plots were measured using hobo automatic water level data loggers installed in 100 mm diameter pvc observation wells midway between tile drains for plot 1 and open ditches for plot 2 flow data of subsurface drainage from plot 1 were lost during the periods 9 12 2019 9 25 2019 14 days and 3 31 2020 6 3 2020 65 days due to instrumentation breakdown a linear regression model was used to estimate the missing subsurface drainage flow data using the water table data as the independent variable with r2 0 86 and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 81 the field water table was below the weir level of the control structure with no subsurface drainage outflow during half of the days with missing data 40 out of 79 days in addition the estimated drainage flow during the period of missing data was 1605 m3 which accounted for only 5 of the total subsurface drainage flow during the study period 32 187 m3 2 2 2 water quality data each flow measurement station was equipped with an automated water quality sampler ws700 global water to collect flow proportional composite samples the samplers were programmed to collect 50 ml water sample in a composite sample bottle 9 5 liter for every specific threshold of flow passing over the v notch weir of each station the flow threshold values were set based on the average flow expected at each measurement station so that the composite sample bottle will not overflow before sample collection the flow threshold values were 3 m3 for surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow 8 m3 for reservoir outflow and 190 m3 for irrigation grab samples were also collected from the reservoir water samples were collected from the field every two weeks and refrigerated at 4 c until laboratory analysis was conducted in total 187 water quality samples were collected and analyzed during the two year study period water samples were analyzed for nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn orthophosphate ortho p total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss concentrations of no3 n nh4 n tkn ortho p and tp were determined using the latchat quikchem flow injection analysis system latchat quikchem 8500 organic nitrogen on was calculated by subtracting nh4 n from tkn total nitrogen tn was calculated by summing no3 n and tkn particulate phosphorus pp was calculated by subtracting ortho p from tp tss was calculated using the dried and filtered weight of the water sample divided by the total volume of the sample the equipment s detection limits were 0 10 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 for n and p species respectively measured concentrations that were below detection limits were set at one half of the detection limit 2 3 reservoir area volume depth relationship a bathymetric survey was conducted for the reservoir using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp to develop an area volume depth relationship for the reservoir water depth measurements were made along twelve transacts perpendicular to the reservoir an emlid rtk gps was used to conduct the survey for the shallow and vegetated areas of the reservoir where the adcp accuracy is low these measurements were used to create an elevation map for the reservoir using arcgis software fig 3 the storage capacity tool in arcgis was used to develop the area volume depth relationship fig 3 the daily water level measurements of the reservoir were then used to estimate the daily water volume and surface area from the relationship curve 2 4 reservoir water nutrient and sediment balances a daily water balance was calculated for the reservoir based on eq 2 2 δ v p q in q ro 1 q ro 2 q drn q irr q out s e where δ v is the change in reservoir water volume during a specific day p is the direct precipitation volume received by the reservoir q in is the inflow water volume from the upstream forested land q ro 1 and q ro 2 are the surface runoff volumes from plots 1 and 2 respectively q drn is the subsurface drainage flow from plot 1 q irr is the irrigation water volume withdrawn from the reservoir q out is the outflow volume released from the reservoir when it reached maximum storage capacity s is seepage losses from the reservoir and e is evaporation occurring at the surface area of the reservoir all terms of eq 2 are expressed in m3 d 1 the measured sub daily data were summed over the day to calculate the daily values that were used in eq 2 all the water balance components in eq 3 were measured except seepage and evaporation which were estimated as the residual of the water balance the percent flow reduction to downstream surface water fr achieved by the dwr system was estimated using eq 3 3 fr 1 q out p q in q ro 1 q ro 2 q drn 100 daily nutrient and sediment balances were conducted for each of the n and p species and

nutrient sediment mass load from the upstream forested land l ro 1 and l ro 2 are the nutrient sediment mass loads in the surface runoff from plots 1 and 2 respectively l drn is the nutrient sediment mass load in the subsurface drainage flow from plot 1 l irr is the nutrient sediment mass load leaving the reservoir via irrigation l out is the nutrient sediment mass load leaving the reservoir via outflow all terms of the equation are expressed in kg d 1 nitrogen and phosphorus entering the reservoir via direct precipitation or leaving the reservoir via seepage are assumed small and therefore are not represented in the mass balance eq 4 the daily loads were estimated by multiplying the daily flow volumes by the daily concentration values since the composite water quality samples were collected every two weeks the measured concentration of the water sample was used for all days since the last measured concentration the concentration and load reductions achieved by the dwr system were estimated according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 cr c in c out c in 100 6 lr l in l out l in 100 where cr is the percent concentration reduction c in is the flow weighted average concentration

is the percent nutrient sediment load reduction l in is the summation of the nutrient sediment mass loads entering the reservoir via all water sources and l out is the nutrient sediment mass load leaving the reservoir via outflow 2 5 hydraulic retention time the hydraulic retention time hrt is defined in this study as the average time that inflow water remains in the reservoir before it is released through the reservoir outlet which depends on the reservoir s storage capacity and inflow rate based on the weather characteristics and timing of growing season at the study site each year of the study period was divided into 3 distinct periods period 1 may august period 2 september december and period 3 january april the reservoir is expected to have the least water volume in period 1 due to irrigation consumption be gradually refilled during period 2 and remain at or near storage capacity during period 3 the hrt was estimated for each period using eq 7 assuming the reservoir is under a steady state condition inflow rate outflow rate 7 hrt v max p q in q ro 1 q ro 2 q drn where hrt is the hydraulic retention time estimated at the appropriate temporal scale day and v max is the reservoir storage capacity m3 2 6 statistical analysis the measured data did not meet the normality assumption according to the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 therefore the non parametric two sample wilcoxon rank test wilcoxon 1945 was used to compare and identify the significance of differences among concentrations and loadings of nutrients and sediment in the inflows and outflow of the reservoir the null hypotheses were no significant change in concentrations and loads between the inflow and outflow of the reservoir the tests were conducted at a 5 level of significance α 0 05 additionally a multivariate linear correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the factors influencing the nutrients and sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir the correlation coefficients between each factor and mass load reduction of each nutrient species and sediment lr eq 6 were quantified the correlation was done between the average of each factor and load reduction in each of the three periods periods 1 2 and 3 of each year total of 6 data points the examined factors were water temperature hrt water volume in the reservoir and water inflow the distributions of these factors were not significantly different from the normal distribution as per the shapiro wilk normality test the pearson product moment correlation coefficients and their statistical significance were determined based on a 5 level of significance pearson 1896 all statistical analyses were implemented using r studio statistical software version 4 0 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation the 30 year normal precipitation was 1163 mm with higher precipitation occurring during summer june august compared to the other seasons 33 table 1 the first year of the study may 2019 april 2020 was relatively dry with 6 6 less precipitation than the long term average the first four months of this year may aug 2019 were substantially dry compared to the long term average the total precipitation during may aug 2019 was 303 mm which was 37 2 less than the long term average of 483 mm this large precipitation deficit was offset by extremely wet conditions in sep 2019 and feb 2020 leading to a relatively small deviation from the annual long term average precipitation in contrast the second year may 2020 april 2021 was wet with precipitation exceeding the long term average by 28 the second year was characterized by two distinct periods jun oct 2020 which was comparable to the long term average followed by nov 2020 feb 2021 which was extremely wet with total precipitation greater than double the long term average 674 mm vs 329 mm 3 2 reservoir water balance most of the water received by the reservoir was in the form of surface runoff from the two agricultural field plots and the upstream forested land 82 table 2 the upstream forested land contributed the largest amount of inflow water to the reservoir 38 while subsurface drainage contributed the least amount of inflow water 14 the reservoir received 2 5 times greater inflow in the wetter year 2020 2021 compared to the inflow received in the drier year 2019 2020 table 2 fig sm 1 over the two year period the reservoir released 86 of the total inflow as outflow from its outlet of the total inflow 5 7 was withdrawn for irrigation 7 5 was lost via evaporation and seepage and 0 8 represented an increase in the water stored in the reservoir more water was captured by the reservoir during 2019 2020 compared to 2020 2021 in 2019 2020 the reservoir released 71 of the total inflow compared to 92 released in 2020 2021 this was in part due to the water storage level at the beginning of the two year study as some of the water stored in the reservoir had to be released for the installation of the control structures at the reservoir outlet at the beginning of the two year study the volume of the water stored in the reservoir was 3044 m3 which represented 56 of the reservoir storage capacity as a result no water was released from the reservoir until sep 2019 fig sm 1 fig 4 additionally seepage and evaporation losses from the reservoir were higher in 2019 2020 than in 2020 2021 evaporation losses in 2019 2020 6828 m3 were almost double the evaporation losses in 2020 2021 3843 m3 based on estimates from a nearby weather station 35 36233 n 76 71629 w seepage losses were driven by the hydraulic head which was influenced by the water level in the reservoir and the groundwater table depth in the surrounding field area seepage loss in 2019 2020 was hypothesized to be higher than in 2020 2021 since the groundwater table was substantially deeper in 2019 2020 creating greater hydraulic gradient that drove more seepage the monthly water volume received by released from the reservoir and the reservoir water level during the study period are shown in fig 4 for both years the reservoir remained at near storage capacity except during the growing season when water was withdrawn for irrigation during both years the reservoir received the highest amount of water in winter and the lowest amount of water in spring this was attributed to the frequent rainfall and low evapotranspiration during the winter months 3 3 hydraulic retention time the average hrt for 2019 2020 33 8 days was almost three times longer than that for 2020 2021 12 4 days with longer hrt values for all 3 periods of 2019 2020 compared to those of 2020 2021 fig 5 in 2019 2020 dry year period 1 had the longest hrt of 57 9 d and period 3 had the shortest hrt of 17 2 d the hrt values in the 2020 2021 wet year were substantially shorter during all three periods compared to 2019 2020 the hrt in 2020 20021 varied between 15 2 d in period 2 and 7 8 d in period 3 it can be implied from these results that the system would have higher nutrient and sediment removal efficiency during the growing season period compared to the rest of the year additionally nutrient and sediment removal efficiency would be higher in 2019 2020 dry year than in 2020 2021 wet year fig 6 3 4 reservoir nitrogen balance 3 4 1 nitrogen in reservoir inflows nitrogen load entered the reservoir via different inflow sources consisted primarily of no3 n 76 with considerably smaller percentages of on 19 and nh4 n 5 table 4 and fig sm 2 subsurface drainage water was the main source of nitrate reaching the reservoir and contributed significantly highest no3 n load 68 of nitrate load compared to other sources the mean annual no3 n load via subsurface drainage flow was 216 kg or 18 8 kg n ha 1 calculated by dividing the load in kg by the source area in ha this nitrate load was within the 1 3 36 8 kg ha 1 nitrate load range reported by poole et al 2018 for a tile drained research field in eastern north carolina the no3 n concentration in subsurface drainage flow was significantly higher 11 65 mg l 1 than no3 n concentration in surface runoff from both agricultural fields plot 1 2 18 mg l 1 plot 2 4 92 mg l 1 and forested land 0 81 mg l 1 fig sm 3 and table 3 nitrate load reaching the reservoir exhibited distinct seasonal variation most of no3 n load entered the reservoir during november march which corresponded to the increase of no3 n leaching via subsurface drainage flow nitrate load during this period accounted for 77 and 56 of total no3 n load entered the reservoir in the first and second years respectively nitrate concentration also showed large temporal variation with higher concentrations during the first year of the study compared to the second year fig sm 3 severely dry weather conditions in year 1 caused major crop yield loss and large residual n at the end of the growing season which subsequently increased nitrate losses from the agricultural fields during the fallow period fig sm 3 nitrate concentration tended to peak after fertilizer applications in each of the two growing seasons of the study for example a rainfall event that occurred four days after fertilizer application in late may 2019 generated surface runoff from plot 2 with no3 n concentration of 48 9 mg l 1 data point not shown in fig sm 3 to better visualize concentration trend and small concentration values another rainfall event that occurred after fertilizer application in early june 2020 generated a spike in no3 n concentration in surface runoff from plot 2 14 3 mg l 1 and subsurface drainage from plot 1 19 1 mg l 1 although flow weighted mean concentration of no3 n in reservoir inflow was significantly higher in year 1 5 05 mg l 1 compared to year 2 2 00 mg l 1 no3 n loads entered the reservoir in both years were comparable 315 and 319 kg respectively this can be attributed to the substantially lower reservoir inflow volume during year 1 66 487 m3 compared to year 2 164 917 m3 the on load entered the reservoir mainly via surface runoff from both the agricultural 53 of on load and forested land 42 table 4 the on concentrations in the surface runoff from both the agricultural and forested land were comparable with no statistically significant difference table 3 unlike nitrate load which was comparable for both years the annual on load that entered the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was 2 8 times greater than the on load in the drier year year 1 this was primarily driven by the variability in annual inflow volume rather on concentration the inflow water in year 2 was 2 5 times greater than inflow water in year 1 unlike flow weighted nitrate concentration which was inversely proportional to inflow water volume the wetter year had slightly higher flow weighted on concentration than the drier year 0 72 mg l 1 in year 2 vs 0 66 mg l 1 in year 1 ammonium concentrations in inflows from all sources were negligible as 73 of water samples had nh4 n concentration below or equal to the detection limit of the laboratory equipment 0 10 mg l 1 3 4 2 nitrogen in water stored in the reservoir reservoir outflow and irrigation during the two year study period 440 2 kg n was released from the reservoir via outflow water and only 37 3 kg n was recycled back to the agricultural fields via irrigation water more n was recycled back to the agricultural fields in the second year table 4 when larger amount of irrigation water was applied compared to the first year table 2 total n load released via outflow water in the wetter year year 2 was more than twice the tn load released in the drier year year 1 table 4 298 1 kg n in year 2 vs 142 1 kg n in year 1 nitrogen load released from the reservoir was mainly in the form of nitrate and on representing 59 and 36 of tn load released from the reservoir respectively nitrate was the dominant form of n released in year 1 representing 68 1 of tn load released in year 2 nitrate still represented the largest percentage of tn load released in that year 55 6 of tn however on release was a major contributor to tn load released in year 2 40 3 of tn the release of n from the reservoir to downstream surface water mainly occurred during november february which was driven by the increase of n entering the reservoir via subsurface drainage flow total n load released from the reservoir during this period accounted for 79 and 58 of tn load released from the reservoir in year 1 and year 2 respectively on average over the two year study period both outflow and irrigation water had less than 1 5 mg l 1 no3 n concentration fig sm 4 however nitrate concentrations in both outflow and irrigation water varied greatly outflow 0 10 5 28 mg l 1 irrigation 0 11 3 49 mg l 1 nitrate concentration in water stored in the reservoir was not significantly different from no3 n concentration in reservoir outflow table 5 in contrast no3 n concentration in irrigation water was significantly higher than no3 n concentration in the reservoir which indicates the presence of concentration gradient in the water column irrigation pump intake was 40 cm above the bottom of the reservoir while the reservoir water samples were collected from the top 50 cm of the water column it should also be mentioned that water samples collected from the reservoir were grab samples representing concentrations at the time of sampling on the other hand the samples collected from all inflow sources irrigation and reservoir outflow were composite samples representing a flow weighted concentration for the time period between sample collections nitrate concentration near the water surface of reservoirs is usually lower since it is consumed more quickly by plankton webb 2017 3 4 3 nitrogen reduction by the reservoir total n load was significantly reduced by the reservoir by 47 391 kg with a larger load reduction in the first year than the second year table 4 and fig 7 the reduction in tn load was primarily driven by the reduction in nitrate loads nitrate load received by the reservoir was reduced by 69 218 2 kg n in year 1 and 48 153 0 kg n in year 2 the reservoir slightly reduced on load in year 1 but released more on in year 2 compared to on load received however none of the differences between on loads received and released by the reservoir were statistically significant table 4 the reservoir was highly efficient in assimilating a large portion of n that entered the reservoir during november february when n input to the reservoir peaked fig 7 as high as 55 of tn load reduction in year 1 and 42 of tn load reduction in year 2 occurred during this period nitrogen recycling back to the agricultural field via irrigation had only marginal contribution to n reduction by the reservoir during the two year study n recycled back to the field via irrigation was 37 3 kg n representing only 4 5 of tn received by the reservoir both flow reduction and concentration reduction contributed to the overall tn load reduction however tn concentration reduction had a greater impact on tn load reduction than the flow reduction in year 1 tn concentration was reduced by 51 and flow was reduced by 29 leading to a 63 reduction in tn load in year 2 tn concentration was reduced by 30 while flow was only reduced by 8 leading to an overall tn load reduction of 33 total n concentration reduction was mainly caused by the reduction of no3 n concentration fig 6 and table 6 the reservoir reduced no3 n concentration by 60 3 01 mg l 1 in year 1 and 45 0 91 mg l 1 in year 2 nitrate concentration in subsurface drainage flow exceeded the usepa drinking water standard of 10 mg l 1 in 18 62 of the 29 collected samples while the maximum no3 n concentration in the reservoir outflow was 5 28 mg l 1 organic n concentration in water released from the reservoir was slightly higher 0 11 mg l 1 than in the water received by the reservoir however this difference was not significant table 6 the on concentration was not reduced in the reservoir since a portion of the inorganic n may have been assimilated by phytoplankton and eventually released from the reservoir in the phytoplankton biomass fairchild and velinsky 2006 3 5 reservoir phosphorus balance 3 5 1 phosphorus in reservoir inflows the tp load 53 kg received by the reservoir consisted primarily of ortho p 67 with a smaller percentage of pp 33 fig sm 5 and table 4 ortho p load reached the reservoir mainly via surface runoff plot 1 35 plot 2 50 forested land 14 of ortho p load while subsurface drainage contribution of ortho p was negligible 1 ortho p concentration was significantly higher in surface runoff from the agricultural fields compared to concentration in inflow from the forested land table 3 fig 8 in both years of the study the reservoir received higher ortho p load during the summer and fall months blue bars in fig 9 when surface runoff occurred following large storm events for example a 301 mm storm event occurred on 9 6 2019 generated 1596 m3 runoff and 3 7 kg ortho p load like no3 n ortho p concentrations in inflow from agricultural fields were higher in year 1 than in year 2 fig sm 6 which could be attributed to leaching of unutilized p fertilizer by the severely water stressed corn in 2019 despite the higher flow weighted mean concentration of ortho p in the reservoir inflow in year 1 0 19 mg l 1 than in year 2 0 03 mg l 1 ortho p loads in both years were similar 17 6 and 17 5 kg respectively due to the lower inflow water volume in year 1 like ortho p most of pp load entered the reservoir via surface runoff 48 of pp load carried by surface runoff from the agricultural fields plot 1 27 plot 2 21 of pp and 43 of pp load entered the reservoir via surface runoff from the forested land concentrations of pp did not differ significantly among all inflow sources table 3 like on the annual pp load entered the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was 2 8 times greater than the pp load in the drier year 1 table 4 3 5 2 phosphorus in water stored in the reservoir reservoir outflow and irrigation during the two year study period 37 kg p was released from the reservoir via outflow water and 4 6 kg p was recycled back to the agricultural fields via irrigation water similar to n more p was recycled back to the agricultural fields in year 2 when larger amount of irrigation water was applied compared to year 1 total p load released from the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was more than twice tp released in the drier year year 1 table 4 based on the two year average the released p load contained more pp 55 of tp than ortho p 45 of tp the tp load released from the reservoir in year 1 contained more ortho p 55 than pp conversely pp represented the larger percentage of tp load released in year 2 58 of tp total p recycled to the field via irrigation was mainly in the ortho p form 63 of tp the release of tp from the reservoir was mainly driven by precipitation amount and intensity for example 46 of tp released from the reservoir in the first year happened in only 10 days 6 16 september 2019 as a result of hurricane dorian that brought 160 mm of precipitation to the field site on average over the two year study period both outflow and irrigation water had less than 0 5 mg l 1 tp concentration outflow 0 08 0 66 mg l 1 irrigation 0 07 0 76 mg l 1 ortho p and tp concentrations were significantly higher in reservoir outflow and irrigation water than in the water stored in the reservoir fig sm 7 and table 5 additionally pp concentration was significantly higher in reservoir outflow than in the water stored in the reservoir 3 5 3 phosphorus reduction by the reservoir the reservoir significantly reduced tp load by 30 16 kg with a higher significant reduction in year 1 51 compared to a non significant reduction in year 2 15 the reduction in tp load was mainly driven by reduction assimilation of ortho p in the reservoir the ortho p load received by the reservoir was reduced by 52 18 4 kg particulate p load released from the reservoir was 14 2 4 kg higher than the load received however the increase was not significant both flow reduction and concentration reduction contributed to the overall tp load reduction in year 1 tp concentration was reduced by 35 and flow was reduced by 29 leading to a 51 reduction in tp load in year 2 tp concentration was reduced by 11 while flow was reduced by 8 leading to an overall tp load reduction of 15 the tp concentration reduction was mainly caused by the reduction of ortho p concentration fig 8 and table 6 over the two year study period the reservoir significantly reduced ortho p concentration by an average of 46 0 07 mg l 1 particulate p concentration in the water released from the reservoir was significantly higher than pp concentration in the water received by the reservoir in year 1 by 42 0 03 mg l 1 however the concentration difference was not significant in year 2 unlike ortho p that remains in the water column and can be assimilated by algae pp settles down leaving the water column to the bed of the reservoir it has been shown that pp concentrations are correlated with the transport of fine sediment in the clay size range stone and mudroch 1989 mcdowell et al 2001 poirier et al 2012 which can be easily entrained and released from the reservoir during large runoff events based on a study conducted on 11 ponds located in southeastern pennsylvania fairchild and velinsky 2006 reported that small ponds can greatly reduce ortho p but they usually export more pp than they receive 3 6 reservoir sediment balance 3 6 1 sediment in reservoir inflows sediment load entered the reservoir primarily via surface runoff from the agricultural land 83 with less contribution from the upstream forested land 17 surface runoff from plot 1 contributed almost two thirds 64 of the total sediment load received by the reservoir which was significantly higher than loads from all other inflow sources sediment loads contributed by surface runoff from plot 2 and upstream forested land were comparable sediment load received by the reservoir in year 2 47 712 kg was almost double the sediment load in year 1 24 369 kg fig sm 8 table 4 as expected tss concentration in surface runoff from the forested land 148 mg l 1 was significantly lower than tss concentration in surface runoff from agricultural field plots surface runoff from plot 1 carried significantly higher tss concentration 751 mgl 1 compared to tss concentration from plot 2 410 mg l 1 fig sm 9 table 3 this can be attributed to the effect of the relatively wetter soil profile at plot 1 because of controlled drainage and subirrigation which raised the field water table level and subsequently increased surface runoff and soil erosion for example consecutive rainfall events 64 mm occurred on june 12 16 2020 produced 58 mm of runoff with 3969 mg l 1 of tss from plot 1 while it only produced 24 mm of runoff with 318 mg l 1 of tss from plot 2 during this period average field water table level was 16 cm below soil surface in plot 1 while it was 30 cm in plot 2 3 6 2 sediment in water stored in the reservoir reservoir outflow and irrigation during the two year study period a total of 9190 kg sediment was released from the reservoir via outflow water sediment load released from the reservoir in the wetter year year 2 was nearly three times greater than the sediment load released in the drier year year 1 table 4 the release of sediment from the reservoir was intermittent as it occurred following large and high intensity precipitation events for example 46 of sediment transport in year 1 occurred in february 2020 while 68 of sediment transport in year 2 occurred in july august 2020 fig 11 the tss concentration in reservoir outflow was significantly higher than in the water stored in the reservoir but was not significantly different from tss concentration in irrigation water fig sm 10 table 5 3 6 3 sediment reduction by the reservoir the reservoir significantly reduced sediment load by 87 62 9 mg table 4 although the second year was much wetter than the first year and had shorter hrt the sediment reduction percentage was nearly similar for both years 90 for year 1 and 86 for year 2 the reduction in sediment load was mainly driven by reduction in tss concentration as the reservoir significantly reduced tss concentration by 86 273 mg l 1 over the two year study period fig 10 table 6 the reservoir achieved a significant sediment reduction even when it was nearly full through reducing the inflows velocity and the slow release of water via the reservoir outlet fig 11 another factor that could have contributed to the high sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir is that the ditches carrying surface runoff from the two field plots to the reservoir were distributed along the length of the reservoir fig 1 3 7 factors affecting nitrogen phosphorus and sediment dynamics in the reservoir the mechanisms controlling n assimilation in reservoirs are uptake by plankton and aquatic plants denitrification and deposition jansson et al 1994 saunders and kalff 2001 phosphorus assimilation in reservoirs occurs via uptake of dissolved p by plankton and aquatic plants and deposition of particulate p pettersson 1998 settling is the primary mechanism for reducing sediment load by the reservoir as water carrying sediment enters the reservoir flow velocity decreases and sediment settles leaving the water column and accumulating at the bottom of the reservoir verstraeten 2000 the hrt water temperature water volume in the reservoir and water inflow are expected to influence these mechanisms processes and subsequently affect the nutrient and sediment load reduction by the reservoir the correlations between these four factors and the load reduction of n p and sediment by the reservoir were evaluated table 7 nitrogen phosphorus and sediment load reductions were positively correlated with the reservoir water temperature and hrt and negatively correlated with water inflow to the reservoir and reservoir water volume this would suggest that the removal efficiency of the reservoir would be highest during summer and early fall when the reservoir has a relatively longer hrt due to irrigation withdrawal and warmer temperature this also indicates that the reservoir removal efficiency is strongly linked with the crop water requirements that determine irrigation rate and affect the reservoir water storage reinhart et al 2019 some of the correlation coefficients were not significant despite being considerably high which was likely caused by the small number of data points used in the correlation analysis 6 points the hrt had the major effect on n and sediment load reductions in the reservoir the hrt had a highly significant correlation with the no3 n 0 95 and tn 0 99 and the highest but not significant correlation with tss the longer hrt the more time for the natural treatment processes such as denitrification and settling to occur in the reservoir the reservoir inflow had a significantly negative correlation with the load reduction of no3 n 0 90 and tn 0 85 high flow events increase the resuspension of mineralized organic nutrients on the bottom of the reservoir and release them to the water column the load reductions of the organic species of n and p were significantly correlated with water volume in the reservoir large water volume in the reservoir means less time for the soil particles carrying organic n and p to settle in the reservoir which negatively affects the reservoir removal efficiency the reservoir water temperature had a significantly positive correlation with the load reduction of no3 n 0 85 and nh4 n 0 83 high water temperature increases the growth rate of plankton that quickly depletes dissolved oxygen in the water m liu et al 2019 which stimulates denitrification jansson et al 1994 and increases the uptake of inorganic forms of n and p 4 conclusion this study experimentally investigated the effect of drainage water recycling dwr on reducing downstream nitrogen n phosphorus p and sediment losses from an agricultural field in eastern north carolina water nutrients and sediment balances were conducted over a two year period for the water storage reservoir of the dwr system the following conclusions can be drawn from the study the water storage reservoir of the drainage water recycling system substantially reduced n load by 47 this reduction was primarily attributed to the assimilation of nitrate the dominant form of n in the dwr system the reservoir reduced p load by 30 a less percentage than n reduction but statistically significant while the reservoir was effective in assimilating the dissolved forms of p orthophosphates it was a net source of particulate p causing the total p load reduction to be less than the total n load reduction the reservoir was extremely effective in reducing sediment transport with a two year average reduction of 87 the hydraulic retention time hrt which describes how long the water remains in the storage reservoir was the major factor affecting the nutrients and sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir the nutrients and sediment removal efficiency of the reservoir exhibited seasonal and annual variation the highest nutrient and sediment reductions occurred during summer and early fall when the reservoir had a relatively longer hrt due to irrigation withdrawal and warmer temperature larger reductions of nutrients and sediment occurred during the drier year than the wet year in general this study demonstrated that dwr can substantially reduce nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural landscapes while providing a water source for supplemental irrigation to increase climate resiliency of crop production in the u s southeast while this study expands the limited knowledge on the water quality benefits of dwr systems it was limited by the relatively short experimental period 2 years and the effect of site specific conditions on system performance further research is needed to evaluate the performance of dwr under varying site conditions for longer periods research is also needed to investigate processes and

9047,plant growth regulators pgrs play crucial roles in maize drought tolerance however most of the studies are focused on seedling stage under greenhouse conditions little is known on the effects of grain yields at later growth stage under field environment it is hypothesized that exogenous application of pgrs can increase maize drought tolerance at different growth stages under field conditions here we used alginate oligosaccharide aos and coronatine cor to investigate the effects of these two pgrs on maize drought tolerance in a two year field experiment the results showed that both cor and aos treatments reduced leaf water loss and significantly increased the relative leaf water content by 12 6 and 13 0 thus significantly decreasing superoxide anion accumulation by 49 and 42 in maize seedlings there was no big difference between these two treatments in the seedling stage in the subsequent reproductive growth period although both cor and aos treatments significantly increased leaf photosynthesis and above ground growth including photosynthetic rate by 41 and 33 relative chlorophyll content spad value by 8 0 and 6 5 leaf area by 22 and 15 plant height by 8 3 and 5 9 dry matter accumulation by 23 and 17 respectively under drought conditions the effect of cor was superior to the aos as evidenced by membership function values of cor treatment were 0 12 and 0 08 larger than that of aos treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively ultimately cor and aos treatments significantly increased the grain yields by 21 7 and 16 2 in 2020 22 3 and 15 7 in 2021 respectively under drought conditions path analysis showed both pgrs increased final grain yields by increasing thousand kernel weight tkw while the tkw increase with cor treatment was mainly due to the increase of relative chlorophyll content spad value aos treatment mainly increased dry matter accumulation under drought conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords plant growth regulator photosynthetic rate reproductive growth period grain yield path analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize is one of the world s most widely produced and consumed cereal crops with an annual global production of approximately 1 15 billion tons fao 2018 continued population growth and climate change bring many challenges to maize production brown et al 2019 drought stress one of the major environmental stresses is a potentially major constraint to the production of many crops including maize lu et al 2011 drought stress inhibits maize growth and development maize leaves lose water reduce photosynthesis by closing stomata thereby slowing growth and reducing dry matter accumulation under drought stress conditions shemi et al 2021 drought stress can also disrupt the homeostasis of endogenous hormones and increase the aba content in maize plants chen et al 2022 furthermore drought stress induces lipid peroxidation in maize plants which damages cell membranes and organelles sang et al 2008 therefore improving the drought tolerance of maize through cultivation measures is of great importance to ensure global food security exogenous application of plant growth regulators pgrs can alter the content of endogenous hormones promote or inhibit crop growth and development thereby improving drought resistance currently a number of pgrs have been identified that can improve drought tolerance in plants by reducing leaf water loss and damage increasing root growth and photosynthesis under drought conditions cao et al 2017 xie et al 2017 melatonin an indoleamine which was a typical growth promoter and rooting agent that was induced by drought stress and positively improved the drought resistance of maize seedlings arnao and hernández ruiz 2013 huang et al 2019 combined pre treatments with exogenous methyl jasmonate meja and salicylic acid sa improved the drought resistance of potted maize seedlings by increasing soluble matter and reducing oxidative damage tayyab et al 2020 although there are many studies and types of pgrs on drought tolerance in maize most of them focus on seedling stage under potted or polyethylene glycol peg treated hydroponic conditions for example exogenous applications of 2 3 4 dichlorophenoxy triethylamine dcpta increased organic solutes accumulation and reduced the negative effects of drought stress in maize seedlings under peg treated hydroponic conditions xie et al 2018 spermidine spd a low molecular weight polycationic nitrogenous compound could improve the drought tolerance of potted maize seedlings by protecting the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus under drought stress li et al 2018b however technologies should be applied to agricultural production in a changing world tester and langridge 2010 few studies have shown whether these pgrs treated at the seedling stage can influence later growth stages and final grain yield under field environment coronatine cor is a typical phytotoxin and enhances plant tolerance through immune inducing effects coronatine consists of coronafacic acid cfa and coronamic acid cma where cfa is an analogue of methyl jasmonate and cma is an analogue of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid ethylene precursor uppalapati et al 2005 several studies showed an increase in plant resistance to multiple stresses due to the unique immune inducing effects of cor such as salinity stress osmotic stress and heat stress ceylan et al 2013 xie et al 2008 although many studies have shown that cor improved the drought resistance of various crops there were few studies on the effects of cor on maize drought resistance and all of them were pot experiments at the seedling stage hao et al 2013 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 for instance exogenous application of cor were able to improve the drought tolerance by regulating the water loss in maize seedlings and increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes pod and cat under pot conditions wang et al 2010 yu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to systematically explore the effects of cor on maize drought tolerance especially in the later growth period of maize under field conditions alginate oligosaccharide aos is a degradation product of alginates extracted from marine brown algae which play an important role in growth promotion when it was first discovered such as enhancing cell proliferation and differentiation thus leading to shoot elongation in higher plants yonemoto et al 1993 zhang et al 2020 more studies subsequently demonstrated the ability of aos to promote seed germination root development and yield increase of maize abd el rehim et al 2011 hu et al 2004 furthermore evidence showed that aos increased drought tolerance in a variety of plants zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2013 reported exogenous application of aos increased drought tolerance in wheat by promoting root length fresh weight and relative water content under drought conditions treatment with aos significantly improved the leaf photosynthesis and chlorophyll content of cucumber seedlings under drought conditions which reversed the negative effects of drought stress li et al 2018a however no studies have been conducted on aos to improve drought resistance in maize although a limited number of studies have demonstrated the important roles of cor and aos in drought tolerance at seedling stage few studies have demonstrated the performance of these two pgrs on maize different growth stages under field conditions which is more closely related to actual production in addition investigating the mechanisms of cor and aos on drought tolerance is a guideline for drought resistant cultivation and breeding therefore the objectives of the present study were to i verify the effects of cor and aos on the drought tolerance in maize under field conditions ii detect the positive effect of increased drought tolerance in seedlings for the later stages of reproduction and iii compare the difference in drought tolerance between cor and aos at different growth stages table 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in the field under a rainout shelter in jiyang experimental station of the shandong academy of agricultural sciences 36 58 n 116 58 e 20 m amsl above mean sea level china in 2020 and 2021 the site is characterized by a typical

shelter that prevented rainfall on the crop the roof of the rain shelter was protected from rain but had good light transmission all plots were exposed to natural light to ensure healthy plant growth when the rain shelter was open the rain shelter was closed at night or on rainy days to cover the experimental field fig 1a the rain shelter contains 32 plots the size of each plot is 3 m 3 m 3 m length width depth the plot is hydrologically isolated from each other with cement sheets to a depth of 3 m which can prevent moisture crosstalk between plots and lateral transfer through soil of the total 32 plots 24 plots were used in this trial drip irrigation pipes were laid on all plots before sowing and digital water meter control valves and pipes were used to precisely control the irrigation water fig 1b each plot was planted with six rows including three maize varieties 13 plants per row the row spacing was 50 cm and the plant spacing was 20 cm fertilizer application followed

harvesting in 2020 the experiment was designed in a split split plot design in three replicates with soil moisture as the main plot factor well watered and drought maize varieties as the sub plot

performed when the rswc was 60 and irrigation was performed when the rswc was 40 fig 2 in practice the rswc was measured at shorter intervals when it was close to 40 the rswc was replenished to around

plot was short of water manually controlled the main valve and the valves on the drip irrigation pipes to irrigated a specific plot the control group was well watered throughout the growth period in the two year trial in the drought group irrigation was stopped at the three leaf stage das 21 24 and drought stress was maintained until harvesting pgrs consisted of cor coronatine collected from the centre for crop chemical control college of agriculture china agricultural university with 99 purity a pre screening concentration of 1 µm l 1 works best at the seedling stage and aos alginate oligosaccharides collected from dalian institute of chemical physics chinese academy of sciences with 99 purity a pre screening concentration of 500 ppm works best at the seedling stage with water as control cor and aos were sprayed at the three leaf stage the third leaf with visible ligule at a rate of 6 67 ml per plant 450 l ha 1 under both well watered and drought conditions fig 1c individual plant treatments were performed to ensure that each plant received the pgr treatment to test the broad spectrum biological activities of cor and aos three maize varieties with different drought sensitivity were used in this experiment they were heyu 189 hy189 drought resistant variety fumin 985 fm985 medium sensitive variety and jinong 1205 jn1205 drought sensitive variety they were collected from jilin academy of agricultural sciences which were widely grown varieties and pre screened for drought resistance the sowing data harvesting data and other important growth period data were recorded in table 2 2 4 sampling and measurements 2 4 1 gravimetric soil water content gswc and relative soil water content rswc the gravimetric soil water content was measured before sowing after harvesting and at ten day intervals during growth periods respectively gswc of the first 80 cm was determined by weighing method using a steel soil auger 8 cm in diameter 20 cm drilled at 20 cm depth intervals cai et al 2020 the wet weight w1 of the soil was first weighed on a precision balance and then dried in an oven at 105 c to a constant weight w2 and then the gravimetric soil water content was calculated according to the following formula gswc i n w 1 w 2 w 2 100 where n is the number of sample layers i represents 1st 0 20 cm 2nd 20 40 cm 3rd 40 60 cm 4th 60 80 cm soil layer the relative soil water content rswc was calculated as follows rswc gswc fc where fc is the field capacity of the soil at 40 cm cassel nielsen 1986 in this study the mean field capacity was 27 g h2o 100 g

the leaf base and weighed continuously for 24 h at 2 h intervals in a precision balance with four replicates for each treatment the water loss was calculated according to the following formula wl ti

2 s 1 the pn water use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of pn to tr the relative chlorophyll content of maize ear leaves was measured at the silking stage 68 days after sowing in 2020 and 61 days after sowing in 2021 using a chlorophyll meter model spad 502 minolta camera co ltd osaka japan and expressed as spad value which was highly correlated with the chlorophyll content of the leaf richardson et al 2002 ruiz espinoza et al 2010 each treatment had 10 15 replicate leaves the relative chlorophyll content spad value of the leaf was expressed as the mean of leaf base middle and tip

stage 3 1 1 relative leaf water loss and leaf water content plant leaves are the most sensitive organs to water stress and the lower water loss rate of isolated leaves indicates a better water retention capacity the water loss rate of the lower leaves was faster than that of the upper leaves as in jn1205 the relative water loss of the 3rd 4th and 5th leaves at 24 h were 77 72 and 61 respectively fig 3a the relative water loss of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 at 24 h without pgrs application were 70 68 and 65 means of the three leaves respectively further indicating that hy189 was a drought resistant variety and jn1205 was a drought sensitive variety both cor and aos applications reduced the relative water loss in isolated leaves of the three maize varieties compared with control cor application reduced the relative water loss of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 at 24 h by 6 0 6 6 and 15 0 means of the three leaves respectively and aos application by 8 5 6 7 and 19 0 means of the three leaves respectively leaf dehydration reduced the relative leaf water content and caused leaf wilting under drought stress conditions consistent with the results of leaf water loss the leaf water content of the lower leaves decreased first for example in variety jn1205 the relative water content of the 3rd 4th and 5th leaves were 56 8 64 1 and 69 7 respectively under drought conditions fig 3b under drought conditions cor application significantly increased the leaf relative water content of the 3rd 4th and 5th leaves of jn1205 by 11 3 10 5 and 8 7 respectively and fm985 by 31 5 11 8 and 8 8 respectively compared with drought treatment aos application significantly increased the relative water content of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 11 0 14 5 and 13 5 means of the three leaves respectively compared with drought treatment comparing these two pgrs in terms of relative leaf water content aos increased the relative leaf water content of three varieties by an average of 13 0 and cor by an average of 12 6 under drought conditions thus aos was more effective than cor 3 1 2 leaf superoxide anion accumulation and relative electrical conductivity leaf dehydration caused leaf damage leading to the accumulation of superoxide anion in the leaf and increasing relative electrical conductivity among the three varieties the nbt staining area was larger in jn1205 and smaller in hy189 under drought conditions fig 4 quantitative analysis revealed that both cor and aos applications significantly decreased superoxide anion accumulation in jn1205 and fm985 fig 5a under drought conditions cor application significantly reduced the superoxide anion accumulation of jn1205 and fm985 by 36 0 and 70 2 and the aos by 22 8 and 80 5 respectively compared with drought treatment drought stress increased the relative electrical conductivity of three maize varieties in 2020 drought stress increased the relative electrical conductivity in jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 18 5 17 3 and 40 6 respectively compared with control fig 5b compared with drought treatment in 2020 the spraying of cor significantly decreased the electrical conductivity of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 24 8 44 9 and 29 7 and aos by 21 1 41 8 and 45 9 respectively under drought conditions consistent with the results in 2020 in 2021 cor and aos application significantly decreased the electrical conductivity of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 compared with drought treatment 3 2 effects of cor and aos on maize drought tolerance during the reproductive growth period 3 2 1 maize photosynthetic characteristics maize ear leaf photosynthetic characteristics correlated strongly with grain yield drought stress significantly decreased photosynthetic rate by 81 6 56 6 and 53 4 in 2020 and 63 2 56 5 and 52 5 in 2021 for the varieties jn1205 fm985 and hy189 respectively compared with control fig 6a c aos and cor applications significantly increased the photosynthetic rate of three maize varieties under drought conditions in 2020 the photosynthetic rates of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 were significantly increased by 52 0 62 9 and 46 8 after spraying of cor and by 45 0 36 6 and 42 2 after spraying of aos respectively compared with drought treatment in 2021 cor application significantly increased the photosynthetic rates of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 38 1 16 8 and 31 0 respectively and aos application significantly increased by 20 3 12 5 and 41 3 respectively compared with drought treatment both cor and aos could significantly increase the leaf photosynthetic rate under drought conditions and cor had a better effect plants actively avoid drought stress by closing stomata reducing transpiration and thus increasing water use efficiency under drought conditions compared with control drought stress significantly increased the photosynthetic water use efficiency pn wue of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 56 6 86 6 and 18 2 in 2020 58 0 55 7 and 36 0 in 2021 respectively fig 6b d compared with drought treatment in 2020 cor and aos applications significantly increased photosynthetic water use efficiency by 42 4 and 35 9 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions compared with drought treatment in 2021 cor and aos applications significantly increased photosynthetic water use efficiency by 22 1 and 22 0 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions compared with control cor treatment significantly increased the relative chlorophyll contents spad values of fm985 and hy189 by 8 3 and 6 5 respectively in 2020 and by 7 1 in 2021 for fm985 under well watered conditions exogenous application of aos on spad values was not significant under well watered conditions however both cor and aos applications significantly alleviated the inhibitory effects of drought stress on spad values of maize ear leaves fig 7a b compared with drought treatment in 2020 cor and aos applications significantly increased the spad values by 10 3 and 7 7 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions in 2021 cor and aos applications significantly increased the spad values by 5 7 and 5 3 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions compared with aos treatment under drought stress condition cor treatment was more effective in alleviating drought stress on spad values taken together cor played a better role in photosynthetic characteristics compared to aos at the reproductive growth stage 3 2 2 above ground growth the improvement in photosynthetic capacity contributed to increase above ground biomass in 2020 fig s1 and 2021 fig 8 both cor and aos applications had no significant effect on leaf area under well watered conditions under drought conditions cor application significantly increased the leaf area of the 12th first leaf under the ear leaf 13th ear leaf and 14th first leaf above the ear leaf leaves of jn1205 by 39 6 57 4 and 43 7 respectively compared with drought treatment fig 8a the leaf area of fm985 and hy189 also significantly increased after cor application under drought conditions in two years no significant effect of aos application on jn1205 and fm985 were observed in 2021 however aos application significantly increased the leaf area of the 12th 13th and 14th leaves in 2020 compared with drought treatment fig s1a cor treatment had a better effect on leaf area than aos treatment under drought conditions compared with aos cor increased the leaf area of 12th 13th and 14th leaves of jn1205 by 26 4 27 8 and 28 9 respectively compared with drought treatment in 2021 the plant height and dry matter were significantly increased by 9 9 and 25 5 means of three maize varieties respectively after cor treatment under drought conditions fig 8b c aos application significantly increased the plant height of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 5 1 9 0 and 6 7 respectively under drought conditions compared with drought treatment the dry matter of jn1205 was significantly increased by 34 1 after aos treatment however no significant effect of aos application on dry matter were observed in fm985 and hy189 the trial results in 2020 were similar to those in 2021 with both plant growth regulators notably increasing plant height and dry matter of the three cultivars under drought conditions fig s1b s1c however a comprehensive comparison of the effects of cor and aos on drought tolerance revealed that cor was more effective on improving leaf area plant height and dry matter accumulation for maize plants under drought conditions 3 2 3 yield yield components and crop water productivity in the two year trial moisture w and plant growth regulators p had significant effects on all the yield parameters and variety v had significant effects on ear length bare tip length and tkw table 3 table s1 w p interactions had significant effect on grain yield and w v w p also had significant effects on wpc in 2021 both cor and aos had no significant effect on yield parameters under well watered conditions under drought conditions cor application significantly increased the ear length of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 11 4 13 9 and 14 7 and aos application significantly increased by 14 0 21 0 and 14 5 respectively compared with drought treatment table 3 the kernel numbers were significantly increased by 16 2 and 15 6 means of jn1205 and fm985 after cor and aos treatments ultimately cor and aos applications resulted in a significant yield increase of 22 3 and 15 7 means of the three varieties respectively compared with drought treatment in wpc cor application significantly increased the wpc of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 24 4 25 2 and 17 2 respectively and aos application significantly increased the wpc of jn1205 and fm985 by 18 6 and 18 5 respectively compared with drought treatment overall the inhibitory effect of sensitive variety under drought conditions was greater than that of drought resistant variety both cor and aos treatments had less effect on drought resistant varieties than drought sensitive varieties comparing these two pgrs for drought resistance in grain yields showed that cor treatment was superior to aos treatment the trial results in 2020 are similar to those in 2021 table s1 3 3 comprehensive comparison of cor and aos on maize drought tolerance at different growth stages the membership function analysis was carried out on the drought resistance coefficient of 11 traits in the reproductive growth period the results showed that drought stress had a strong inhibitory effect on maize growth table 4 obvious differences in drought sensitivity were observed among the three maize varieties i e hy189 was a drought resistant variety and jn1205 was a drought sensitive variety 0 44 vs 0 15 in 2020 0 54 vs 0 05 in 2021 cor and aos applications effectively alleviated the inhibitory effect of drought stress and improved the drought tolerance of three maize varieties under drought conditions cor application increased the mfvs of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 0 59 0 58 and 0 42 average of two years respectively and aos application increased by 0 44 0 48 0 38 average of two years respectively on the whole cor and aos had better regulation effect on sensitive cultivar jn1205 which showed a greater increase in mfvs in addition cor was more effective than aos for drought tolerance with mfvs of cor being 0 15 0 10 and 0 04 in three maize varieties greater than those of aos under drought conditions average of two years drought tolerance differences after cor and aos treatments were comprehensively evaluated with mfvs of 11 traits in reproductive growth period the abbreviations used are defined in table 1 there were notable differences in the effects of cor and aos on drought tolerance in maize during the vegetative and reproductive growth periods leaf relative water content and electrical conductivity were used to represent drought tolerance of maize after cor and aos treatments in the vegetative stage and mfvs were used to represent drought tolerance in the reproductive stage fig 9 the results showed that both cor and aos could increase the drought resistance of maize at seedling stage with similar effects however the effect of cor was consistently better than that of aos in the reproductive growth stage indicating that application of cor had a greater effect on maize drought tolerance during reproductive growth period 3 4 quantifying the contribution of cor and aos to maize drought tolerance improving grain yields and qualities are the main goals of agricultural production under drought stress conditions final grain yield is the primary trait for measurement of drought tolerance in maize the correlation matrix shown in fig 10 indicates the correlation and distribution between grain yield a tkw b kn c btl d el e ph f dm g la h spad values i and pn j under well watered and drought conditions the results showed that grain yield was significantly positively correlated with all these variables except btl among all the traits the yield kn correlation had the highest correlation coefficient of up to 0 95 indicating that kn was an important trait reflecting drought tolerance in maize the ranked order of correlation coefficient with yield was kn tkw ph el dm spad pn la therefore except for btl the remaining 8 indicators can be used as the main factor indicators of cor and aos induced yield increase in maize under drought conditions to further evaluate which indicators cor and aos treatments mainly used to alleviate the inhibitory effects of drought stress on maize yield path analysis was performed to assign the direct and indirect effects between yield and 8 biological traits related to yield components tkw kn el above ground growth ph dm la and photosynthetic characteristics spad values pn fig 11 a clear difference in the effects of cor and aos treatments on maize drought tolerance was observed in the figure after cor treatment tkw had the greatest and most positive direct effect on grain yield demonstrating that tkw was the main factor contributing to greater drought tolerance after exogenous application of cor under drought conditions in addition plant height was the second most direct factor affecting yield under drought condition implying that cor played an important role in alleviating the inhibitory effect of drought on plant height the direct effects of kn el and dm on yield is less significant with direct path coefficient values of 0 078 0 161 and 0 141 respectively table s2 further analysis showed that the improvement of tkw was mainly attributed to the relative chlorophyll content spad values with indirect path coefficient value of 0 359 between spad values and tkw similar to the role of cor tkw had the greatest and most positive direct effect on grain yield after aos treatment indicating that aos also partly reversed the inhibitory effects of drought stress on tkw to increase maize drought tolerance however dm was the second most direct factor affecting yield implying that aos treatment was mainly to improve the drought tolerance by promoting the growth of maize under drought conditions ph and kn also had direct effects on yield with direct path coefficient values of 0 202 and 0 234 respectively table s3 the improvement of tkw was mainly attributed to spad values and ph with indirect path coefficient value of 0 386 and 0 305 respectively further analysis showed dm increased maize drought tolerance mainly through la and pn after exogenous application of aos 4 discussion 4 1 cor and aos improved drought tolerance of maize seedlings when drought stress occurs plants will lose water and wilt and produce reactive oxygen species that damages cell membranes farooq et al 2012 moretti et al 2021 wang et al 2022 previous study showed that cor activated antioxidant enzymes and induced proteins to alleviate drought stress ai et al 2008 yu et al 2021 reported cor could increase the drought tolerance of maize seedlings by modulating maize ros homeostasis including increasing h2o2 and o2 in control plants and decreasing in drought plants and reducing leaf water loss under drought conditions reducing leaf water loss under drought stress conditions was an effective way to protect plant cell membranes babu et al 2004 in this study cor treatment significantly reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and protected leaf cell membranes which was mainly attributed to the fact that cor treatment reduced leaf water loss and significantly increased relative leaf water content fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 similarly studies showed that aos treatment could also reduce drought stress damage by increasing leaf water content and reducing peroxide accumulation in many crops li et al 2018a liu et al 2013 consistent with the results of previous studies our study showed that aos treatment significantly increased the relative leaf water content and decreased superoxide anion accumulation and relative electrical conductivity of leaves which protected leaf cell membranes fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 furthermore drought sensitive variety jn1205 was more susceptible to drought stress compared to medium sensitive variety fm985 and drought resistant variety hy189 in this study this may be because drought sensitive varieties are more prone to water loss and oxidative damage under drought conditions which was consistent with the previous results of liu et al 2016 a comprehensive comparison of the effects of cor and aos treatments on drought tolerance among the three varieties showed that the response of the drought resistant variety was less than that of the drought sensitive variety probably because the drought resistant varieties themselves were less inhibited by drought stress however both cor and aos improved the drought resistance of the three varieties and the effects of cor and aos on seedling stage were similar 4 2 the drought tolerance of cor treatment was better than that of aos treatment in the reproductive growth period drought resistant maize seedlings were obtained by spraying cor and aos at the three leaf stage previous studies showed that the induction of long term water stress memory in seedlings could improve the drought tolerance in potato by increasing antioxidant activity and yield ramírez et al 2015 therefore as a typical immune inducer we speculate that the immune inducing effect of cor may be the key to improving maize drought tolerance in the later stages furthermore cor was metabolized slowly in plants and could promote the development of maize root system through long term effects under drought conditions guo et al 2022 cultivating robust seedlings at the seedling stage also helped to increase drought tolerance and yield in reproductive stage rajendran et al 2005 sarangi et al 2015 exogenous application of aos could make seedlings more robust by promoting the growth of stems and roots hu et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 in this study drought stress resulted in a significant reduction of photosynthesis by 61 while photosynthesis decreased by only 45 under drought conditions after spraying cor and decreased by 48 after spraying aos compared with control therefore both cor and aos treatments alleviated the inhibitory effects of drought stress on photosynthesis of three maize varieties under drought conditions in 2020 and 2021 but could not restore them to the levels under well watered conditions fig 6 fig 7 however compared to the effect of aos the photosynthesis and relative chlorophyll contents spad values were higher after cor treatment under drought conditions implying that the effect of cor treatment was superior to that of aos treatment in the reproductive growth period the improvements in photosynthesis contributed to increase above ground growth and yield under drought conditions richards 2000 liu et al 2019 demonstrated a positive correlation between leaf chlorophyll content index cci and above ground biomass agb by optimizing the model after cor and aos treatments the leaf area of 12th 13th and 14th leaves plant height and dry matter accumulation were notably increased under drought conditions in 2020 and 2021 fig 8 fig s1 however both pgrs could only reverse the inhibitory effect of drought stress to a certain extent and did not restore them to the levels under well watered conditions compared to the effect of aos cor treatment had greater leaf area plant height and dry matter accumulation under drought conditions increased photosynthesis and above ground growth contributed greatly to increase final yield mitchell and sheehy 2006 robertson et al 2004 reported that there were strong relationships between grain yield and net above ground biomass at maturity in mungbean in two years of trials both cor and aos had positive effects on ear traits and yield components under drought conditions table 3 table s1 compared with control drought stress resulted in a significant reduction of grain yield by 28 while the yield decreased by only 13 under drought conditions after spraying cor and decreased by 17 after spraying aos the reduction of yield in treatment with cor and aos application were smaller than the treatment without cor and aos application demonstrating the positive effect of cor and aos in improving maize drought tolerance ultimately compared with drought treatment cor application significantly increased the grain yields of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 19 9 31 1 and 14 9 average of two years and aos application significantly increased the grain yields of jn1205 and fm985 by 16 5 and 19 9 average of two years respectively however both cor and aos treatments had less effect on drought resistant varieties than drought sensitive varieties comparing the two pgrs for drought resistance in the reproductive growth period showed that cor was superior to aos 4 3 the difference and common characteristics between cor and aos treatments on maize drought tolerance membership function analysis was used to comprehensively evaluate the similarities and differences between cor and aos treatments on maize drought tolerance yan et al 2020 our results showed that both pgrs increased drought tolerance in maize as demonstrated by the greater membership function values in both years for these three maize varieties under drought conditions this is similar to the previous results showing both cor and aos treatments could improve the drought tolerance of plants hao et al 2013 liu et al 2013 however the impact of positive seedling effects on the later stages of reproduction has always been an open question in the present study although there was little difference between these two pgrs on drought tolerance at seedling stage cor treatment was superior to aos treatment in reproductive period for the three maize varieties in both years table 4 fig 9 compared to aos treatment cor treatment increased the mfvs by 0 12 and 0 08 in 2020 and 2021 means of the three varieties respectively path analysis is a form of multiple regression statistical analysis but has a more interpretive structure grace and bollen 2005 according to path analysis tkw and plant height ph had high positive direct effects on dr grain yield after cor treatment implying that tkw and ph were the main factors contributing to greater drought tolerance after exogenous application of cor under drought conditions fig 11 furthermore the improvement of tkw was mainly attributed to the increase in relative chlorophyll contents spad values demonstrating that cor could increase maize drought tolerance mainly by increasing the relative chlorophyll contents spad values previous results of cor under drought conditions have indicated that cor played a positive role in enhancing chlorophyll content in many crops which is consistent with the results of this study wu et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 2015 after aos treatment the increase in dr grain yield is directly dependent on the increase in tkw and dw implying that aos mainly promoted above ground growth under drought conditions and thus increased maize drought tolerance however ph and kn also have a positive direct effect on dr further analysis showed that the increase in tkw and dw was mainly attributed to aos increasing pn and relative chlorophyll contents spad values under drought conditions these results suggest that the increase in maize drought tolerance after exogenous application of aos appears to be a comprehensive improvement which agree well with those of previously published studies sarangi et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 5 conclusion in the present study exogenous application of cor and aos in maize seedlings significantly enhanced drought tolerance at seedling and reproductive stages under drought conditions in maize seedlings both pgrs significantly reduced leaf water loss and protected cell membranes thereby improving the drought tolerance of maize seedlings but did not restore them to the levels under well watered conditions the improvement in maize seedling laid the foundation for increasing drought tolerance in reproductive growth period thus cor and aos treatments improved the drought tolerance of maize in the reproductive stage by alleviating the inhibitory effects of drought stress on photosynthesis above ground growth and final grain yields however comparing the drought resistance effects of the two pgrs showed that cor treatment was superior to that of aos treatment for improving maize drought tolerance furthermore both pgrs increased final yields by increasing tkw however cor treatment mainly promoted relative chlorophyll contents spad values and aos treatment mainly increased dry matter accumulation under drought conditions the results obtained in the present study proved the positive effects of cor and aos in improving maize drought tolerance and provide a theoretical and empirical basis for the

9047,plant growth regulators pgrs play crucial roles in maize drought tolerance however most of the studies are focused on seedling stage under greenhouse conditions little is known on the effects of grain yields at later growth stage under field environment it is hypothesized that exogenous application of pgrs can increase maize drought tolerance at different growth stages under field conditions here we used alginate oligosaccharide aos and coronatine cor to investigate the effects of these two pgrs on maize drought tolerance in a two year field experiment the results showed that both cor and aos treatments reduced leaf water loss and significantly increased the relative leaf water content by 12 6 and 13 0 thus significantly decreasing superoxide anion accumulation by 49 and 42 in maize seedlings there was no big difference between these two treatments in the seedling stage in the subsequent reproductive growth period although both cor and aos treatments significantly increased leaf photosynthesis and above ground growth including photosynthetic rate by 41 and 33 relative chlorophyll content spad value by 8 0 and 6 5 leaf area by 22 and 15 plant height by 8 3 and 5 9 dry matter accumulation by 23 and 17 respectively under drought conditions the effect of cor was superior to the aos as evidenced by membership function values of cor treatment were 0 12 and 0 08 larger than that of aos treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively ultimately cor and aos treatments significantly increased the grain yields by 21 7 and 16 2 in 2020 22 3 and 15 7 in 2021 respectively under drought conditions path analysis showed both pgrs increased final grain yields by increasing thousand kernel weight tkw while the tkw increase with cor treatment was mainly due to the increase of relative chlorophyll content spad value aos treatment mainly increased dry matter accumulation under drought conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords plant growth regulator photosynthetic rate reproductive

annual global production of approximately 1 15 billion tons fao 2018 continued population growth and climate change bring many challenges to maize production brown et al 2019 drought stress one of the major environmental stresses is a potentially major constraint to the production of many crops including maize lu et al 2011 drought stress inhibits maize growth and development maize leaves lose water reduce photosynthesis by closing stomata thereby slowing growth and reducing dry matter accumulation under drought stress conditions shemi et al 2021 drought stress can also disrupt the homeostasis of endogenous hormones and increase the aba content in maize plants chen et al 2022 furthermore drought stress induces lipid peroxidation in maize plants which damages cell membranes and organelles sang et al 2008 therefore improving the drought tolerance of maize through cultivation measures is of great importance to ensure global food security exogenous application of plant growth regulators pgrs can alter the content of endogenous hormones promote or inhibit crop growth and development thereby improving drought resistance currently a number of pgrs have been identified that can improve drought tolerance in plants by reducing leaf water loss and damage increasing root growth and photosynthesis under drought conditions cao et al 2017 xie et al 2017 melatonin an indoleamine

damage tayyab et al 2020 although there are many studies and types of pgrs on drought tolerance in maize most of them focus on seedling stage under potted or polyethylene glycol peg treated hydroponic conditions for example exogenous applications of 2 3 4 dichlorophenoxy triethylamine dcpta increased organic solutes accumulation and reduced the negative effects of drought stress in maize seedlings under peg treated hydroponic conditions xie et al 2018 spermidine spd a low molecular weight polycationic nitrogenous compound could improve the drought tolerance of potted maize seedlings by protecting the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus under drought stress li et al 2018b however technologies should be applied to agricultural production in a changing world tester and langridge 2010 few studies have shown whether these pgrs treated at the seedling stage can influence later growth stages and final grain yield under field environment coronatine cor is a typical phytotoxin and enhances plant tolerance through immune inducing effects coronatine consists of coronafacic acid cfa and coronamic acid cma where cfa is an analogue of methyl jasmonate and cma is an analogue of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid ethylene precursor uppalapati et al 2005 several studies showed an increase in plant resistance to multiple stresses due to the unique immune inducing effects of cor such as salinity stress osmotic stress and heat stress ceylan et al 2013 xie et al 2008 although many studies have shown that cor improved the drought resistance of various crops there were few studies on the effects of cor on maize drought resistance and all of them were pot experiments at the seedling stage hao et al 2013 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 for instance exogenous application of cor were able to improve the drought tolerance by regulating the water loss in maize seedlings and increasing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes pod and cat under pot conditions wang et al 2010 yu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to systematically explore the effects of cor on maize drought tolerance especially in the later growth period of maize under field conditions alginate oligosaccharide aos is a degradation product of alginates extracted from marine brown algae which play an important role in growth promotion when it was first discovered such as enhancing cell proliferation and differentiation thus leading to shoot elongation in higher plants yonemoto et al 1993 zhang et al 2020 more studies subsequently demonstrated the ability of aos to promote seed germination root development and yield increase of maize abd el rehim et al 2011 hu et al 2004 furthermore evidence showed that aos increased drought tolerance in a variety of plants zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2013 reported exogenous application of aos increased drought tolerance in wheat by promoting root length fresh weight and relative water content under drought conditions treatment with aos significantly improved the leaf photosynthesis and chlorophyll content of cucumber seedlings under drought conditions which reversed the negative effects of drought stress li et al 2018a however no studies have been conducted on aos to improve drought resistance in maize although a limited number of studies have demonstrated the important roles of cor and aos in drought tolerance at seedling stage few studies have demonstrated the performance of these two pgrs on maize different growth stages under field conditions which is more closely related to actual production in addition investigating the mechanisms of cor and aos on drought tolerance is a guideline for drought resistant cultivation and breeding therefore the objectives of the present study were to i verify the effects of cor and aos on the drought tolerance in maize under field conditions ii detect the positive effect of increased drought tolerance in seedlings for the later stages of reproduction and iii compare the difference in drought tolerance between cor and aos at different growth stages table 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in the field under a rainout

performed when the rswc was 60 and irrigation was performed when the rswc was 40 fig 2 in practice the rswc was measured at shorter intervals when it was close to 40 the rswc was replenished to around 50 based on the actual moisture in the soil when it was 40 and recorded the amount of irrigation supplemental irrigation was calculated according to the method described by guo et al 2014 when the plot was short of water manually controlled the main valve and the valves on the drip irrigation pipes to irrigated a specific plot the control group was well watered throughout the growth period in the two year trial in the drought group irrigation was stopped at the three leaf stage das 21 24 and drought stress was maintained until harvesting pgrs consisted of cor coronatine collected from the

days after sowing in 2021 using a chlorophyll meter model spad 502 minolta camera co ltd osaka japan and expressed as spad value which was highly correlated with the chlorophyll content of the leaf richardson et al 2002 ruiz espinoza et al 2010 each treatment had 10 15 replicate leaves the relative chlorophyll content spad value of the leaf was expressed as the mean of leaf base middle and tip

stage 3 1 1 relative leaf water loss and leaf water content plant leaves are the most sensitive organs to water stress and the lower water loss rate of isolated leaves indicates a better water retention capacity the water loss rate of the lower leaves was faster than that of the upper leaves as in jn1205 the relative water loss of the 3rd 4th and 5th leaves at 24 h were 77 72 and 61 respectively fig 3a the relative water loss of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 at 24 h without pgrs application were 70 68 and 65 means of the three leaves respectively further indicating that hy189 was a drought resistant variety and jn1205 was a drought sensitive variety both cor and aos applications reduced the relative water loss in isolated leaves of the three maize varieties compared with control cor application reduced the relative water loss of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 at 24 h by 6 0 6 6 and 15 0 means of the three leaves respectively and aos application by 8 5 6 7 and 19 0 means of the three leaves respectively leaf dehydration reduced the relative leaf water content and caused leaf wilting under drought stress conditions consistent with the results of leaf water loss the leaf water content of the lower leaves decreased first for example in variety jn1205 the relative water content of the 3rd 4th and 5th leaves were 56 8 64 1 and 69 7 respectively under drought conditions fig 3b under drought conditions cor application significantly increased the leaf relative water content of the 3rd 4th and 5th leaves of jn1205 by 11 3 10 5 and 8 7 respectively and fm985 by 31 5 11 8 and 8 8 respectively compared with drought treatment aos application significantly increased the relative water content of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 11 0 14 5 and 13 5 means of the three leaves respectively compared with drought treatment comparing these two pgrs in terms of relative leaf water content aos increased the relative leaf water content of three varieties by an average of 13 0 and cor by an average of 12 6 under drought conditions thus aos was more effective than cor 3 1 2 leaf superoxide anion accumulation and relative electrical conductivity leaf dehydration caused leaf damage leading to the accumulation of superoxide anion in the leaf and increasing relative electrical conductivity among the three varieties the nbt staining area was larger in jn1205 and smaller in hy189 under drought conditions fig 4 quantitative analysis revealed that both cor and aos applications significantly decreased superoxide anion accumulation in jn1205 and fm985 fig 5a under drought conditions cor application significantly reduced the superoxide anion accumulation of jn1205 and fm985 by 36 0 and 70 2 and the aos by 22 8 and 80 5 respectively compared with drought treatment drought stress increased the relative electrical conductivity of three maize varieties in 2020 drought stress increased the relative electrical conductivity in jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 18 5 17 3 and 40 6 respectively compared with control fig 5b compared with drought treatment in 2020 the spraying of cor significantly decreased the electrical conductivity of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 24 8 44 9 and 29 7 and aos by 21 1 41 8 and 45 9 respectively under drought conditions consistent with the results in 2020 in 2021 cor and aos application significantly decreased the electrical conductivity of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 compared with drought treatment 3 2 effects of cor and aos on maize drought tolerance during the reproductive growth period 3 2 1 maize photosynthetic characteristics maize ear leaf photosynthetic characteristics correlated strongly with grain yield drought stress significantly decreased photosynthetic rate by 81 6 56 6 and 53 4 in 2020 and 63 2 56 5 and 52 5 in 2021 for the varieties jn1205 fm985 and hy189 respectively compared with control fig 6a c aos and cor applications significantly increased the photosynthetic rate of three maize varieties under drought conditions in 2020 the photosynthetic rates of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 were significantly increased by 52 0 62 9 and 46 8 after spraying of cor and by 45 0 36 6 and 42 2 after spraying of aos respectively compared with drought treatment in 2021 cor application significantly increased the photosynthetic rates of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 38 1 16 8 and 31 0 respectively and aos application significantly increased by 20 3 12 5 and 41 3 respectively compared with drought treatment both cor and aos could significantly increase the leaf photosynthetic rate under drought conditions and cor had a better effect plants actively avoid drought stress by closing stomata reducing transpiration and thus increasing water use efficiency under drought conditions compared with control drought stress significantly increased the photosynthetic water use efficiency pn wue of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 56 6 86 6 and 18 2 in 2020 58 0 55 7 and 36 0 in 2021 respectively fig 6b d compared with drought treatment in 2020 cor and aos applications significantly increased photosynthetic water use efficiency by 42 4 and 35 9 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions compared with drought treatment in 2021 cor and aos applications significantly increased photosynthetic water use efficiency by 22 1 and 22 0 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions compared with control cor treatment significantly increased the relative chlorophyll contents spad values of fm985 and hy189 by 8 3 and 6 5 respectively in 2020 and by 7 1 in 2021 for fm985 under well watered conditions exogenous application of aos on spad values was not significant under well watered conditions however both cor and aos applications significantly alleviated the inhibitory effects of drought stress on spad values of maize ear leaves fig 7a b compared with drought treatment in 2020 cor and aos applications significantly increased the spad values by 10 3 and 7 7 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions in 2021 cor and aos applications significantly increased the spad values by 5 7 and 5 3 means of three maize varieties respectively under drought conditions compared with aos treatment under drought stress condition cor treatment was more effective in alleviating drought stress on spad values taken together cor played a better role in photosynthetic characteristics compared to aos at the reproductive growth stage 3 2 2 above ground growth the improvement in photosynthetic capacity contributed to increase above ground biomass in 2020 fig s1 and 2021 fig 8 both cor and aos applications had no significant effect on leaf area under well watered conditions under drought conditions cor application significantly increased the leaf area of the 12th first leaf under the ear leaf 13th ear leaf and 14th first leaf above the ear leaf leaves of jn1205 by 39 6 57 4 and 43 7 respectively compared with drought treatment fig 8a the leaf area of fm985 and hy189 also significantly increased after cor application under drought conditions in two years no significant effect of aos application on jn1205 and fm985 were observed in 2021 however aos application significantly increased the leaf area of the 12th 13th and 14th leaves in 2020 compared with drought treatment fig s1a cor treatment had a better effect on leaf area than aos treatment under drought conditions compared with aos cor increased the leaf area of 12th 13th and 14th leaves of jn1205 by 26 4 27 8 and 28 9 respectively compared with drought treatment in 2021 the plant height and dry matter were significantly increased by 9 9 and 25 5 means of three maize varieties respectively after cor treatment under drought conditions fig 8b c aos application significantly increased the plant height of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 5 1 9 0 and 6 7 respectively under drought conditions compared with drought treatment the dry matter of jn1205 was significantly increased by 34 1 after aos treatment however no significant effect of aos application on dry matter were observed in fm985 and hy189 the trial results in 2020 were similar to those in 2021 with both plant growth regulators notably increasing plant height and dry matter of the three cultivars under drought conditions fig s1b s1c however a comprehensive comparison of the effects of cor and aos on drought tolerance revealed that cor was more effective on improving leaf area plant height and dry matter accumulation for maize plants under drought conditions 3 2 3 yield yield components and crop water productivity in the two year trial moisture w and plant growth regulators p had significant effects on all the yield parameters and variety v had significant effects on ear length bare tip length and tkw table 3 table s1 w p interactions had significant effect on grain yield and w v w p also had significant effects on wpc in 2021 both cor and aos had no significant effect on yield parameters under well watered conditions under drought conditions cor application significantly increased the ear length of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 11 4 13 9 and 14 7 and aos application significantly increased by 14 0 21 0 and 14 5 respectively compared with drought treatment table 3 the kernel numbers were significantly increased by 16 2 and 15 6 means of jn1205 and fm985 after cor and aos treatments ultimately cor and aos applications resulted in a significant yield increase of 22 3 and 15 7 means of the three varieties respectively compared with drought treatment in wpc cor application significantly increased the wpc of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 24 4 25 2 and 17 2 respectively and aos application significantly increased the wpc of jn1205 and fm985 by 18 6 and 18 5 respectively compared with drought treatment overall the inhibitory effect of sensitive variety under drought conditions was greater than that of drought resistant variety both cor and aos treatments had less effect on drought resistant varieties than drought sensitive varieties comparing these two pgrs for drought resistance in grain yields showed that cor treatment was superior to aos treatment the trial results in 2020 are similar to those in 2021 table s1 3 3 comprehensive comparison of cor and aos on maize drought tolerance at different growth stages the membership function analysis was carried out on the drought resistance coefficient of 11 traits in the reproductive growth period the results showed that drought stress had a strong inhibitory effect on maize growth table 4 obvious differences in drought sensitivity were observed among the three maize varieties i e hy189 was a drought resistant variety and jn1205 was a drought sensitive variety 0 44 vs 0 15 in 2020 0 54 vs 0 05 in 2021 cor and aos applications effectively alleviated the inhibitory effect of drought stress and improved the drought tolerance of three maize varieties under drought conditions cor application increased the mfvs of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 0 59 0 58 and 0 42 average of two years respectively and aos application increased by 0 44 0 48 0 38 average of two years respectively on the whole cor and aos had better regulation effect on sensitive cultivar jn1205 which showed a greater increase in mfvs in addition cor was more effective than aos for drought tolerance with mfvs of cor being 0 15 0 10 and 0 04 in three maize varieties greater than those of aos under drought conditions average of two years drought tolerance differences after cor and aos treatments were comprehensively evaluated with mfvs of 11 traits in reproductive growth period the abbreviations used are defined in table 1 there were notable differences in the effects of cor and aos on drought tolerance in maize during the vegetative and reproductive growth periods leaf relative water content and electrical conductivity were used to represent drought tolerance of maize after cor and aos treatments in the vegetative stage and mfvs were used to represent drought tolerance in the reproductive stage fig 9 the results showed that both cor and aos could increase the drought resistance of maize at seedling stage with similar effects however the effect of cor was consistently better than that of aos in the reproductive growth stage indicating that application of cor had a greater effect on maize drought tolerance during reproductive growth period 3 4 quantifying the contribution of cor and aos to maize drought tolerance improving grain yields and qualities are the main goals of agricultural production under drought stress conditions final grain yield is the primary trait for measurement of drought tolerance in maize the correlation matrix shown in fig 10 indicates the correlation and distribution between grain yield a tkw b kn c btl d el e ph f dm g la h spad values i and pn j under well watered and drought conditions the results showed that grain yield was significantly positively correlated with all these variables except btl among all the traits the yield kn correlation had the highest correlation coefficient of up to 0 95 indicating that kn was an important trait reflecting drought tolerance in maize the ranked order of correlation coefficient with yield was kn tkw ph el dm spad pn la therefore except for btl the remaining 8 indicators can be used as the main factor indicators of cor and aos induced yield increase in maize under drought conditions to further evaluate which indicators cor and aos treatments mainly used to alleviate the inhibitory effects of drought stress on maize yield path analysis was performed to assign the direct and indirect effects between yield and 8 biological traits related to yield components tkw kn el above ground growth ph dm la and photosynthetic characteristics spad values pn fig 11 a clear difference in the effects of cor and aos treatments on maize drought tolerance was observed in the figure after cor treatment tkw had the greatest and most positive direct effect on grain yield demonstrating that tkw was the main factor contributing to greater drought tolerance after exogenous application of cor under drought conditions in addition plant height was the second most direct factor affecting yield under drought condition implying that cor played an important role in alleviating the inhibitory effect of drought on plant height the direct effects of kn el and dm on yield is less significant with direct path coefficient values of 0 078 0 161 and 0 141 respectively table s2 further analysis showed that the improvement of tkw was mainly attributed to the relative chlorophyll content spad values with indirect path coefficient value of 0 359 between spad values and tkw similar to the role of cor tkw had the greatest and most positive direct effect on grain yield after aos treatment indicating that aos also partly reversed the inhibitory effects of drought stress on tkw to increase maize drought tolerance however dm was the second most direct factor affecting yield implying that aos treatment was mainly to improve the drought tolerance by promoting the growth of maize under drought conditions ph and kn also had direct effects on yield with direct path coefficient values of 0 202 and 0 234 respectively table s3 the improvement of tkw was mainly attributed to spad values and ph with indirect path coefficient value of 0 386 and 0 305 respectively further analysis showed dm increased maize drought tolerance mainly through la and pn after exogenous application of aos 4 discussion 4 1 cor and aos improved drought tolerance of maize seedlings when drought stress occurs plants will lose water and wilt and produce reactive oxygen species that damages cell membranes farooq et al 2012 moretti et al 2021 wang et al 2022 previous study showed that cor activated antioxidant enzymes and induced proteins to alleviate drought stress ai et al 2008 yu et al 2021 reported cor could increase the drought tolerance of maize seedlings by modulating maize ros homeostasis including increasing h2o2 and o2 in control plants and decreasing in drought plants and reducing leaf water loss under drought conditions reducing leaf water loss under drought stress conditions was an effective way to protect plant cell membranes babu et al 2004 in this study cor treatment significantly reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and protected leaf cell membranes which was mainly attributed to the fact that cor treatment reduced leaf water loss and significantly increased relative leaf water content fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 similarly studies showed that aos treatment could also reduce drought stress damage by increasing leaf water content and reducing peroxide accumulation in many crops li et al 2018a liu et al 2013 consistent with the results of previous studies our study showed that aos treatment significantly increased the relative leaf water content and decreased superoxide anion accumulation and relative electrical conductivity of leaves which protected leaf cell membranes fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 furthermore drought sensitive variety jn1205 was more susceptible to drought stress compared to medium sensitive variety fm985 and drought resistant variety hy189 in this study this may be because drought sensitive varieties are more prone to water loss and oxidative damage under drought conditions which was consistent with the previous results of liu et al 2016 a comprehensive comparison of the effects of cor and aos treatments on drought tolerance among the three varieties showed that the response of the drought resistant variety was less than that of the drought sensitive variety probably because the drought resistant varieties themselves were less inhibited by drought stress however both cor and aos improved the drought resistance of the three varieties and the effects of cor and aos on seedling stage were similar 4 2 the drought tolerance of cor treatment was better than that of aos treatment in the reproductive growth period drought resistant maize seedlings were obtained by spraying cor and aos at the three leaf stage previous studies showed that the induction of long term water stress memory in seedlings could improve the drought tolerance in potato by increasing antioxidant activity and yield ramírez et al 2015 therefore as a typical immune inducer we speculate that the immune inducing effect of cor may be the key to improving maize drought tolerance in the later stages furthermore cor was metabolized slowly in plants and could promote the development of maize root system through long term effects under drought conditions guo et al 2022 cultivating robust seedlings at the seedling stage also helped to increase drought tolerance and yield in reproductive stage rajendran et al 2005 sarangi et al 2015 exogenous application of aos could make seedlings more robust by promoting the growth of stems and roots hu et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 in this study drought stress resulted in a significant reduction of photosynthesis by 61 while photosynthesis decreased by only 45 under drought conditions after spraying cor and decreased by 48 after spraying aos compared with control therefore both cor and aos treatments alleviated the inhibitory effects of drought stress on photosynthesis of three maize varieties under drought conditions in 2020 and 2021 but could not restore them to the levels under well watered conditions fig 6 fig 7 however compared to the effect of aos the photosynthesis and relative chlorophyll contents spad values were higher after cor treatment under drought conditions implying that the effect of cor treatment was superior to that of aos treatment in the reproductive growth period the improvements in photosynthesis contributed to increase above ground growth and yield under drought conditions richards 2000 liu et al 2019 demonstrated a positive correlation between leaf chlorophyll content index cci and above ground biomass agb by optimizing the model after cor and aos treatments the leaf area of 12th 13th and 14th leaves plant height and dry matter accumulation were notably increased under drought conditions in 2020 and 2021 fig 8 fig s1 however both pgrs could only reverse the inhibitory effect of drought stress to a certain extent and did not restore them to the levels under well watered conditions compared to the effect of aos cor treatment had greater leaf area plant height and dry matter accumulation under drought conditions increased photosynthesis and above ground growth contributed greatly to increase final yield mitchell and sheehy 2006 robertson et al 2004 reported that there were strong relationships between grain yield and net above ground biomass at maturity in mungbean in two years of trials both cor and aos had positive effects on ear traits and yield components under drought conditions table 3 table s1 compared with control drought stress resulted in a significant reduction of grain yield by 28 while the yield decreased by only 13 under drought conditions after spraying cor and decreased by 17 after spraying aos the reduction of yield in treatment with cor and aos application were smaller than the treatment without cor and aos application demonstrating the positive effect of cor and aos in improving maize drought tolerance ultimately compared with drought treatment cor application significantly increased the grain yields of jn1205 fm985 and hy189 by 19 9 31 1 and 14 9 average of two years and aos application significantly increased the grain yields of jn1205 and fm985 by 16 5 and 19 9 average of two years respectively however both cor and aos treatments had less effect on drought resistant varieties than drought sensitive varieties comparing the two pgrs for drought resistance in the reproductive growth period showed that cor was superior to aos 4 3 the difference and common characteristics between cor and aos treatments on maize drought tolerance membership function analysis was used to comprehensively evaluate the similarities and differences between cor and aos treatments on maize drought tolerance yan et al 2020 our results showed that both pgrs increased drought tolerance in maize as demonstrated by the greater membership function values in both years for these three maize varieties under drought conditions this is similar to the previous results showing both cor and aos treatments could improve the drought tolerance of plants hao et al 2013 liu et al 2013 however the impact of positive seedling effects on the later stages of reproduction has always been an open question in the present study although there was little difference between these two pgrs on drought tolerance at seedling stage cor treatment was superior to aos treatment in reproductive period for the three maize varieties in both years table 4 fig 9 compared to aos treatment cor treatment increased the mfvs by 0 12 and 0 08 in 2020 and 2021 means of the three varieties respectively path analysis is a form of multiple regression statistical analysis but has a more interpretive structure grace and bollen 2005 according to path analysis tkw and plant height ph had high positive direct effects on dr grain yield after cor treatment implying that tkw and ph were the main factors contributing to greater drought tolerance after exogenous application of cor under drought conditions fig 11 furthermore the improvement of tkw was mainly attributed to the increase in relative chlorophyll contents spad values demonstrating that cor could increase maize drought tolerance mainly by increasing the relative chlorophyll contents spad values previous results of cor under drought conditions have indicated that cor played a positive role in enhancing chlorophyll content in many crops which is consistent with the results of this study wu et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 2015 after aos treatment the increase in dr grain yield is directly dependent on the increase in tkw and dw implying that aos mainly promoted above ground growth under drought conditions and thus increased maize drought tolerance however ph and kn also have a positive direct effect on dr further analysis showed that the increase in tkw and dw was mainly attributed to aos increasing pn and relative chlorophyll contents spad values under drought conditions these results suggest that the increase in maize drought tolerance after exogenous application of aos appears to be a comprehensive improvement which agree well with those of previously published studies sarangi et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 5 conclusion in the present study exogenous application of cor and aos in maize seedlings significantly enhanced drought tolerance at seedling and reproductive stages under drought conditions in maize seedlings both pgrs significantly reduced leaf water loss and protected cell membranes thereby improving the drought tolerance of maize seedlings but did not restore them to the levels under well watered conditions the improvement in maize seedling laid the foundation for increasing drought tolerance in reproductive growth period thus cor and aos treatments improved the drought tolerance of maize in the reproductive stage by alleviating the inhibitory effects of drought stress on photosynthesis above ground growth and final grain yields however comparing the drought resistance effects of the two pgrs showed that cor treatment was superior to that of aos treatment for improving maize drought tolerance furthermore both pgrs increased final yields by increasing tkw however cor treatment mainly promoted relative chlorophyll contents spad values and aos treatment mainly increased dry matter accumulation under drought conditions the results obtained in the present study proved the positive effects of cor and aos in improving maize drought tolerance and provide a theoretical and empirical basis for the

9048,in the context of global climate change changes in precipitation and temperature conditions especially the increasing frequency of extreme climate events have a severe impact on agricultural production predicting climate change and adjusting planting structures over time are critical to sustainable agricultural development in this study the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 and soil and water assessment tool swat models were used to simulate the future climate and runoff in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin mhr then the mopso and nsga ii were used to plan future planting structures the results showed that the temperature and precipitation in the mhr showed an increasing trend by the 2070 s the temperature was projected to increase by more than 2 c under ssp245 while that under ssp585 was more than 4 c the annual mean precipitation was projected to increase but the distribution was uneven and the increased precipitation was mainly concentrated in spring and autumn under the interaction of temperature and precipitation the runoff of the heihe river will increase in the future especially under ssp585 and the runoff of the heihe river is projected to reach 2 48 billion m³ a in the 2070 s crop water demand was projected to increase with temperature and crop irrigation water demand would increase by 14 4 in the 2070 s under ssp245 planting vegetables helps to improve agricultural economic benefits and carbon sinks but to control soil erosion the area of vegetables is best kept at approximately 16 fertilizers and agricultural films are the primary carbon sources in agricultural production activities in mhr accounting for more than 60 of the total carbon this study suggests promoting sustainable agricultural development by improving irrigation efficiency using low carbon fertilizers controlling soil erosion and gradually expanding the vegetable planting area with a considered ecological environment keywords cmip6 multi objective climate change agricultural planning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 climate change agriculture plays an irreplaceable role in meeting the growing global demand for food and maintaining social stability godfray et al 2010 zalles et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a however agricultural production activities are being hit by climate change which will significantly affect agricultural production zhang et al 2022a the current intensive agrarian production methods are relatively vulnerable to the impact of climate change and adaptation measures are urgently needed zhang et al 2022a some studies have shown that proper planning of land and water resources can help agriculture adapt to climate change singh et al 2016 kalbali et al 2021 therefore predicting the impact of future climate change on agriculture and rational planning of soil and water resources are crucial for agricultural production garcía vila and fereres 2012 for agricultural planning under climate change there have been some studies such as fereidoon and koch 2018 using the hadgem2 es climate model combined with intelligent optimization algorithms to optimize agricultural planting structures sabbaghi et al 2020 planned future agricultural planting structures based on the hadcm3 and cgcm3t63 models kalbali et al 2021 used the weather generator lars wg to simulate future climate change and combined it with positive mathematical programming to study the adaptation strategies of agriculture to climate change abdi dehkordi et al 2017 used the hadcm3 model combined with genetic algorithms to optimize future agricultural structures the above studies incorporated climate change scenarios into agricultural planning extending the scope of agricultural planning however the above studies only used weather generators or earlier versions of cmip models and did not screen cmip models which may increase uncertainty in climate predictions monerie et al 2017 bağçaci et al 2021 some studies have shown that the climate of the heihe river basin tends to be warmer and more humidified sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a while climate warming and increased precipitation have opposite effects on agricultural production which creates greater uncertainty for future agricultural planning thus it is critical to assess the performance of climate models based on these considerations this study selected four coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models with reference to existing studies and further evaluated the performance of the models the new generation of models better controls uncertainty and can better predict climate change hamed et al 2022 try et al 2022 hydrological modeling is an important step in converting climate variables into available water resources currently black box models chen et al 2021 conceptual hydrological models zhao et al 2021 and distributed and semi distributed hydrological models wallace et al 2017 that are based on parameters such as meteorological data have been widely used among them the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model that can take into account the influence of meteorological factors soil and land use types and can be used in many fields arnold et al 1998 zhang et al 2016b such as runoff simulation li and fang 2021a water resource exploitation fereidoon and koch 2018 and ecological protection jimeno sáez et al 2022 compared with the conceptual hydrological model and the black box model this model considers more factors affecting runoff and is more reliable therefore this study uses it to simulate future runoff and the simulated runoff for agricultural planning 1 2 agricultural multi objective planning agricultural planning is a complex issue that requires resources such as land and water in agriculture to be allocated according to established goals li and guo 2014 cheng et al 2017 there have been some studies in the past such as galán martín et al 2015 that aim to maximize the economic benefits of farmers using multistage linear programming methods to optimize agricultural planting structures zhang et al 2018a used an inexact robust two stage mixed integer linear programming approach for crop area planning with the goal of maximizing system revenue zuo et al 2021 used a scenario based type 2 fuzzy interval programming approach to agricultural planning to maximize economic benefits however most of the above studies focus on maximizing economic benefits and lack consideration of multiple objectives in agricultural planning raju and kumar 1999 niu et al 2019 such as soil erosion and nitrogen emission control in addition agricultural production is an important source of carbon emissions however a large number of studies in the past ignored the carbon sources and carbon sinks in agricultural production pratibha et al 2016 yue and guo 2021 given this lack of information this study incorporated objectives such as soil erosion total nitrogen control and carbon emissions into the agricultural planning framework which makes it more instructive in management for agricultural multi objective programming problems previous studies have used a variety of solving methods mosleh et al 2017 najafabadi et al 2019 these include linear programming models soentoro et al 2018 multi objective linear fractional programming niu et al 2019 distributed interval nonlinear multi objective programming approaches tang et al 2019 random boundary intervals li et al 2019b and interval linear multi objective fractional optimization models zhang et al 2022b the above methods have made many contributions to the solution of agricultural multi objective problems however these methods all transform the multi objective problem into a single objective problem according to the set target weight only one unique solution can be obtained at a time which is cumbersome and has significant limitations han et al 2021 in contrast bioinspired intelligent optimization algorithms can more efficiently solve multi objective problems with multiple constraints and provide a large number of feasible solutions which are helpful for practical decision making combined with specific problems zhang et al 2022c the method has been widely used in land use planning zhou et al 2015 energy deployment hatamkhani and moridi 2019 and other fields showing strong performance but few studies have used it for agricultural planning sajith et al 2022 mopso and nsga ii are two classic intelligent optimization algorithms in contrast mopso tends to fall into local optimal solutions when solving while nsga ii is not suitable for high dimensional multi objective programming problems han et al 2021 based on the above analysis this study uses both mopso and nsga ii for agricultural planning and chooses the best solution the middle reaches of the heihe river mhr are located in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest china and is an important grain producing and seed production base as an important industry agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 80 of the total local water consumption but the utilization rate of water resources is low zhao et al 2010 wang et al 2021b on the other hand the development of industry has intensified water use competition cai et al 2022 and water resources have become a major constraint on local agricultural production chai et al 2014 yin et al 2017 in addition the study area belongs to the traditional agricultural oasis area and the ecological environment is very fragile moreover the study area is located at the junction of deserts and has a special geographical location the intensification of the local water conflict will affect the ecological security pattern in china therefore the agricultural planning of the study area should not only focus on economic benefits but also set multiple objectives several studies have considered the conflicts and trade offs of multiple objectives in agricultural planning such as campana et al 2018 and li et al 2020a considering the food water energy nexus and gordon et al 2010 considering the water ecosystem agricultural framework however these studies did not consider climate change scenarios in contrast some studies considered climate change scenarios but ignored multiple objectives in agricultural planning sabbaghi et al 2020 kalbali et al 2021 although li et al 2021b and chen et al 2022 combined the two their study area is a plain agricultural area with good ecological conditions and has limited guiding significance for ecologically fragile agricultural oasis areas in view of the above analysis it is of great significance to carry out agricultural multi objective planning in the middle reaches of the heihe river under climate change scenarios based on water resources but such studies have not yet been conducted 1 3 summary and goals in view of the above analysis this study found that there are still the following shortcomings in agricultural planning under climate change 1 most studies lack the analysis of the applicability of climate models in specific regions 2 the multi objective solving methods used in most studies are to transform the multi objective problem into a single objective problem and the efficiency of these algorithms is not very high and 3 few studies have coupled climate change with multi objective planning especially in the ecologically fragile oasis agricultural area represented by the heihe agricultural area in view of this this study combined the evaluated cmip6 model with the swat model to determine the amount of water available in the study area and built an agricultural planning model with the goal of increasing economic benefits water efficiency and carbon sinks and reducing farmland soil and total nitrogen losses the model was solved by combining mopso and nsga ii the main objectives of this study are to 1 screen out the cmip6 model suitable for the heihe river basin and predict future climate change in the study area 2 incorporate ecological environmental and socioeconomic factors into planning issues and construct a new multi objective planning framework to guide agricultural activities and 3 preplan the planting structures of the study area in combination with climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mhr 98 00 100 55 e 38 50 40 00 n is a typical arid and semiarid region in northwest china bounded by yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge fig 1 the annual mean precipitation is less than 200 mm and the annual mean evaporation is more than 1000 mm jiang et al 2020 the heihe river originating from the qilian mountains is the primary water supply source of the mhr zou et al 2020 as one of the vital grain production bases in northwest china the mhr produces more than one million tons of crops each year agricultural activities alone consume most of the water resources in the entire basin liu et al 2022 with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization the contradiction of local water use has become increasingly prominent thus it is urgent to ensure the safety of the agricultural water supply bao and fang 2007 jiang et al 2020 2 2 data collection and processing four cmip6 models were selected based on previous studies table 1 guo et al 2021 monthly and daily data including maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation were downloaded from the cmip6 website https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 the monthly data were used for the comparison verification and screening of the cmip6 models the daily data were used for the subsequent modeling work the data were preprocessed by steps including the nc file to raster raster clipping and extraction due to the few meteorological stations in the heihe river basin it was challenging to represent its overall climate status so this study selected the cmads data www cmads org to represent the observed values the data contain daily maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation the period is from 2008 to 2018 cadas data can be directly used in the swat model and its reliability has been recognized by previous studies meng et al 2016 2019 gao et al 2020 the soil properties were obtained from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations http www fao org the dem and land use types were collected from the resource and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn agricultural planning needs to comprehensively consider many factors including crop prices crop costs crop physiological parameters and planting area these data can be obtained from relevant websites and previous studies zhang et al 2009 2021 li et al 2019a niu et al 2019 wu et al 2022 table 2 2 3 cmip6 model screening and correction as global scale climate models cmip6 models have significant errors in local areas stevens and bony 2013 song et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to select a model suitable for the study area in this study the meteorological data of the baseline period 2008 2018 were used as the reference the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias pbias the normalized root mean square error nrmse the modified index of agreement md and the kling gupta efficiency kge were used as evaluation indices of cmip6 models and the calculation formulas are as follows 1 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 p bias p o o 3 nr mse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 o max o min 4 md 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n p i o o i o 5 kge 1 1 α 2 1 β 2 1 γ 2 where o and p represent the cmads data and the output data of the cmip6 model respectively α β and γ represent the ratio of the pearson correlation coefficient deviation and coefficient of variation of the two groups of data respectively after calculating each model index this study used topsis to synthesize the results of the above indexes and constructed an index to evaluate the overall performances of the models the calculation formulas are as follows 6 d i j 1 m w j z j z ij 2 7 d i j 1 m w j z i j z j 2 8 c i d i d i d i where w j represents the weight of indicator j z ij represents the standardized score of model i on indicator j z j represents the highest score of all models on indicator j z j represents the lowest score of all models on indicator j d i represents the distance between model i and the optimal solution d i represent the distance between model i and the worst solution c i is the final score of model i finally the most suitable model for the study area was screened according to c i bias correction helps reduce the uncertainty of the cmip6 model classic bias correction methods include multiple linear regression delta change and quantile mapping qm among them qm can correct the deviation between cmip6 data and meteorological observations by matching the empirical cumulative distribution function cannon et al 2015 fang et al 2015 and it is widely used due to its simple nonparametric configuration and efficient correction of the mean standard deviation and quantile bias song et al 2021 therefore qm was chosen as the bias correction method in this study which was implemented by the qmap package in r and the formula is as follows 9 y f obs 1 f cmip 6 x where f obs 1 is the inverse cdf corresponding to y and f cmip 6 is the cdf of the cmip6 2 4 runoff simulation and correction to ensure the reliability of the swat model it is necessary to correct the output according to the actual runoff at the hydrological station limited by data availability this study selected the discharge of the yingluoxia hydrological station as the reference for runoff correction during the baseline period swat cup was used as the correction tool for swat output the correction method was the sufi 2 algorithm which is widely used due to its advantages in time calibration and uncertainty control liang et al 2021b finally the runoff correction effect was evaluated by r2 pbias and nse the calculation formulas are as follows 10 r 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim q obs i q obs i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 q obs i q obs 2 11 pbias q sim q obs q obs 100 12 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where q sim represents the monthly mean runoff simulated by the swat model q obs represents the monthly mean runoff measured by the hydrological station finally the cmip6 data was imported into the corrected swat model to predict the runoff of the heihe river in the future 2 5 agricultural multi

problem solving this study used mopso and nsga ii algorithms to solve agricultural planning problems and the algorithms were implemented using the mopso and mco packages in r language after using these algorithms to obtain a series of pareto optimal solutions the linear weighted sum method was used to convert the multi objective problem into a single objective problem and an optimal solution was obtained the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method are two classical methods for determining the weight of objectives the analytic hierarchy process is too subjective and the entropy weight method often ignores some small changes in parameters bowen 1990 so this study used the improved entropy weight method zhang 2017 and the analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weight of each target and then performed a weighted summation of the weights obtained by the two methods to obtain a comprehensive weight wu et al 2022 finally the weights of the five targets were set to 0 39 0 17 0 1 0 17 and 0 17 the calculation formulas are as follows 24 w m w ahp 1 m w ew where wahp and wew are the weights calculated by analytic hierarchy process and improved entropy weight method respectively m is a weight of wahp and wew w is the final weight 3 results 3 1 screening and calibration of cmip6 models to obtain reasonable predictions of future climate change in mhr four models including ec earth3 gfdl esm4 bcc csm2 mr and ipsl cm6a lr were selected in this study r2 nrmse pbias kge and md were used to evaluate the climate simulation performances of the four cmip6 models as shown in fig 2 the r2 of ec earth3 is slightly worse than that of gfdl esm4 on the minimum temperature simulation nevertheless it performs best on the remaining indicators fig 2a gfdl esm4 outperforms the other models in all indicators for the maximum temperature simulation fig 2b in the precipitation simulation ec earth3 and gfdl esm4 are better than the other models among them ec earth3 is better than gfdl esm4 in md nrmse and pbias while gfdl esm4 is better than ec earth3 in r2 and kge fig 2c in conclusion ec earth3 and gfdl esm4 significantly outperformed bcc csm2 mr and ipsl cm6a lr in the simulation of minimum maximum temperature and precipitation according to the topsis score ec earth3 performs best in the simulation of precipitation and minimum temperature in contrast gfdl esm4 performs best for simulating the maximum temperature fig 2d since ec earth3 has the highest spatial resolution among these models table 1 this study used it for the simulation of heihe runoff and the modeling of planting structure optimization in the previous step this study compared the performance of the four models however due to the limitation of objective factors such as resolution even the best performing models still fall short in the reliability of climate simulations to ensure the reliability of cmip6 data the qm method was used to correct the ec earth3 model data as shown in fig s1 ec earth3 overestimated the minimum temperature in january august and december and underestimated it in the remaining months before correction fig s1a for maximum temperature the model overestimated in january june september and december fig s1b in the precipitation simulations ec earth3 was overestimated in all months especially in august with abundant precipitation fig s1c after correction the simulated and observed values of ec earth3 for temperature were almost identical the precipitation was consistent with the observed value in other months except for september fig s1 the results showed that the qm method is suitable for correcting cmip6 data 3 2 baseline runoff simulation and correction after obtaining reliable climate data this study used swat to simulate future water resources under various scenarios in the study area before running the simulation it is necessary to correct the swat based on the cmads data in the swat model the runoff of the yingluoxia hydrological station was used as a reference 2008 was set as the warm up period 2009 2011 was selected as the calibration period and 2012 2018 was selected as the validation period then swat cup was further used to calibrate the runoff after calibration the swat model showed great performance in runoff simulation the nse is 0 85 r2 is 0 87 and pbias is only 1 7 which could meet the accuracy requirements of future runoff simulations fig s2 3 3 changes in temperature precipitation and runoff to explore future climate change the precipitation changes under various ssp scenarios were simulated fig 3a b c under all scenarios the future precipitation in the mhr was projected to change compared with the baseline period but the trends of precipitation in different scenarios were distinct the precipitation variation under ssp126 would remain stable and the change in annual mean precipitation would be small relative to the baseline period under ssp245 and ssp585 the precipitation changes would be far more severe than those under ssp126 the annual mean precipitation under the ssp245 scenario was projected to continue to increase with an increase of 55 8 mm relative to the baseline period by the 2070 s the precipitation under ssp585 was projected to show apparent fluctuations and the annual mean precipitation would first decrease and then increase after reaching a high value in the 2030 s after exploring future changes in precipitation this study further explored future changes in minimum temperature fig 3d e f and maximum temperature fig 3g h i under ssp126 the annual mean minimum temperature would increase at the beginning but would decrease after the 2050 s the annual mean minimum temperature was projected to increase continuously under ssp245 and ssp585 in general the difference in the warming effect under the three ssp scenarios is not significant before the 2050 s then the difference in the warming effect between the scenarios would increase significantly the annual mean minimum temperature under ssp585 was projected to increase by more than 4 c in the 2070 s relative to the baseline period much higher than 2 c under ssp245 the warming effect would be the most obvious from january to march and june to september the maximum temperature changes were basically the same as the minimum temperature but the degree of temperature increase would not be as high as the minimum temperature after exploring future climate change under different ssp scenarios the swat model was used to simulate the future runoff of the heihe river under each ssp scenario in this study as shown in fig 4 the annual variation in the runoff of the heihe river was projected to be basically the same under each scenario and the maximum runoff would be concentrated from june to september fig 4a b c this study further analyzed the runoff under each ssp scenario in the future the results showed that the runoff change of the heihe river was projected to remain relatively stable under ssp126 under ssp245 the runoff of the heihe river was projected to increase at the beginning and then stabilize from the 2030 s to the 2070 s it would remain stable after reaching a high value of 2 38 billion m³ a in the 2050 s under ssp585 the runoff of the heihe river would show a trend of first decreasing and then increasing after the 2030 s fig 4d 3 4 mop model validation before using the mop model to allocate future agricultural water and soil resources based on climate and water resource data it is necessary to verify the reliability of the model based on this consideration this study chose 2018 as the reference year readjusted the planting structures in the mhr based on relevant parameters and compared them with the actual planting structures as shown in fig s3 the area of corn in gz decreased and the vegetable planting area increased after model optimization under the condition that the total area of the selected crops remained unchanged fig s3a except for wheat which showed an increase the area of the remaining crops in lz decreased the areas of vegetables and corn decreased significantly fig s3b the planting area of the four crops in gt increased significantly but the percentage of corn decreased fig s3c in general the percentage of vegetables in the planting structures increased and the percentage of corn decreased fig s3 after optimization when the agricultural planting area remained unchanged the agricultural net carbon sink was basically unchanged the agricultural net profit increased by 5 5 the farmland soil loss decreased by 6 and the total nitrogen emissions from the farmland decreased by 3 3 indicating that the model can be used in the study area fig s4 3 5 adjustment of agricultural water and soil resources after evaluating the reliability of the mop model this study obtained the optimal future irrigation amount by running the mop model based on the climatic conditions and water availability under different climate scenarios fig 5 s5 s6 as shown in fig 5 fig s5 and fig s6 the percentages of irrigation water allocated to crops were projected to be mostly consistent under different scenarios among them the irrigation of corn was projected to require the largest amount of water and accounted for more than 80 of the total irrigation water in gz and lz the irrigation amount of vegetables is second in gz and gt the irrigation amount of vegetables was second only to corn and accounted for 12 the irrigation amount required for wheat is relatively small and the percentage of irrigation amount in gz and lz is less than 5 the area of potatoes is small so the irrigation amount is negligible compared to the other three crops fig 5 s5 s6 under all ssp scenarios the total irrigation water volume showed an increasing trend however different scenarios were projected to have distinct growth degrees the total irrigation water volume would not change much under ssp126 which would only increase by 1 2 from the 2030 s to the 2070 s while the irrigation water volume under ssp245 would increase by 14 4 fig 5 s5 s6 after obtaining the optimal future irrigation amount to further determine the planting structures in the future the mop model was used to plan the optimal area of wheat corn vegetables and potatoes under each ssp scenario as shown in fig 6 fig s7 and fig s8 compared with the current area the total area of selected crops will expand by nearly 10 in the future nevertheless the percentage of each crop under different scenarios would not be very different the advantage of maize is the most obvious accounting for 70 75 of the total area in all scenarios followed by vegetables around 16 and wheat and potatoes 8 14 fig 6 s7 s8 3 6 carbon sources sinks composition agricultural activities play an important role in the carbon cycle so after optimizing the allocation of agricultural water and soil resources the net carbon sink in the mhr under each ssp scenario was further analyzed in this study as shown in fig 7 the difference in the agricultural net carbon sink in the mhr between different ssp scenarios is slight and the maximum value would be only 17 higher than the minimum value fig 7c fertilizers agricultural films and groundwater extraction were the most crucial carbon sources contributing more than 80 of carbon emissions fig 7b the carbon sink of various crops showed that maize would have the most significant carbon sink followed by vegetables while wheat and potatoes would have less carbon sink less than 10 fig 7a 4 discussion 4 1 future climate change this study compared the climate simulation performance of ec earth3 gfdl esm4 bcc csm2 mr and ipsl cm6a lr with ec earth3 overall performing the best overall on this basis this study further corrected the bias of ec earth3 data to obtain prediction data for future climate the results showed that the temperature would increase by 1 2 c and the precipitation would increase by 10 40 mm relative to the baseline period in the mid 21st century under each scenario and the heihe river basin would become warmer and wetter in the future which is consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2016a zou et al 2020 this phenomenon is related to the northward shift of the east asian monsoon and the enhancement of the hydrological cycle in northwest china under global warming lan et al 2004 shi et al 2007 the degree of temperature rise in different periods in the future would not wholly conform to the law of ssp585 ssp245 ssp126 fig 3 some previous studies have pointed out that the cmip6 model may ignore the impact of energy conservation and emission reduction policies before the mid 21st century which would have a significant deviation from the actual situation in the future wang et al 2021a the degrees of warming of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 are not significantly different during this period but the difference between the three climate scenarios becomes significant after 2050 zhang et al 2015 there is significant uncertainty in cmip6 s temperature prediction before the mid 21st century which explains why ssp126 has more pronounced warming than ssp585 before the mid 21st century fu et al 2019 li et al 2020b after the mid 21st century the rise in temperature was projected to continue under ssp245 and ssp585 while the temperature would decrease under ssp126 which is related to the changes in atmospheric co2 concentration under the low emission scenario the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere was projected to decrease after the 2050 s while it would continue to rise under the medium and high emission scenarios rogelj et al 2012 you et al 2014 which would lead to a temperature drop directly after the 2050 s under ssp126 compared with the baseline period the annual precipitation in the mhr would increase under different future climate scenarios but the precipitation was projected to increase steadily in spring and autumn while the increase in summer precipitation would be less than that in spring and autumn and show more uncertainty yang et al 2019 fig 3a in this study precipitation in august was projected to decrease related to the enhanced summer land to ocean moisture gradient under the background of climate warming which would enhance land water loss and lead to drier land liang and zhang 2021a future runoff is mainly determined by temperature and precipitation and generally increased precipitation would increase river runoff while increased temperature would reduce runoff by increasing surface evapotranspiration zheng et al 2018 li et al 2020b however inconsistent phenomena were found in this study for example the temperature increase under the ssp126 scenario would be higher than that under the ssp245 scenario in the 2030 s and the precipitation increase would be slightly less than that under the ssp245 scenario nevertheless the simulation showed that the runoff under ssp126 is greater than that under ssp245 fig 4d the reason for this phenomenon is that the runoff of the heihe river mainly comes from the high altitude area of the qilian mountains on the one hand the increase in temperature can promote the increase in glacier meltwater on the other hand it can lead to changes in the active layer of permafrost in the high altitude area of the qilian mountains increasing the soil water storage and then leading to increased runoff which could reverse the runoff cutting effect of increased temperature lyon et al 2009 wang et al 2010 2015 rogger et al 2017 the relationship between runoff and climate change is complex and temperature and precipitation have different effects on runoff in different periods wang et al 2015 which may need to be further explored 4 2 agricultural planning and advice based on the results of the cmip6 and swat models the planting structures in mhr were adjusted by using the mop model the results showed that the total agricultural area in the mhr would increase by 3 11 under each climate scenario fig 6 s7 s8 which is related to the increase in future runoff under each ssp scenario the runoff of the heihe river was projected to vary by 10 20 relative to the average runoff in the baseline period of the heihe river which would increase fig 4 which may be sufficient to meet the water demand for agricultural expansion the continuous expansion of the agricultural area in the mhr would conflict with the expansion of urban land since the economic benefits of built up land are often higher than those of farmland the expansion of agricultural areas would inevitably encroach on some ecological land so rationally expanding agricultural land is crucial jiang et al 2020 the agricultural area was projected to expand but the percentage of the area of each crop would not change much the reason for this is that on the one hand this study imposed reasonable constraints in the model according to the actual planting structures of mhr in the historical period so the area of crops output by the model is kept within a reasonable range on the other hand the deficit irrigation of crops is allowed in this model which endows the model with a certain flexibility such that it can achieve the overall optimal agricultural structures through deficit irrigation within a specific range ignoring small shortages of water resources under the constraints set in the model the crops are best grown in gz and gt rather than in lz fig s3 which indicates that the limitation of food security on planting benefits can be largely adjusted by adjusting crop spatial patterns to offset niu et al 2019 under different ssp scenarios even if the total planting area does not change much the total water demand for agricultural irrigation in the mhr is projected to increase over time fig 5 s5 s6 nevertheless the degree of increase would be different under different scenarios among them the change in ssp126 would be small while the irrigation water requirement would increase significantly under ssp245 and ssp585 because of the warming of the climate the evapotranspiration of crops increases resulting in an increase in water requirements however the temperature increase would be limited under ssp126 so there would only be a slight increase in water demand continued increases in agricultural water requirements would affect crop yields to some extent so it is necessary to adopt more advanced irrigation technology to reduce the consumption of irrigation water tanasijevic et al 2014 cooper et al 2022 in addition climate warming would affect the growing season of crops and increase the risk of pests and diseases which could lead to a decline in the yield of some crops tanasijevic et al 2014 da silva et al 2015 tonnang et al 2022 when these factors are considered the potential harm of climate change to agriculture may be more serious in addition the optimal planting percentage of vegetables in the agricultural area in the mhr given by the model under each ssp scenario was projected to be maintained at approximately 16 fig 6 s7 s8 even lower than 18 in 2020 this contradicts the status quo of the growing area of vegetable cultivation shown in the statistical yearbook in recent years www zhangye gov cn tjj ztzl tjsj which is attributable to model adjustments to control soil erosion usually when the water supply can meet the demand vegetables are often favored by farmers because of their higher planting benefits nevertheless the continuous expansion of vegetable areas is not conducive to soil and water conservation in farmland niu et al 2019 the dataset of the soil erosion statistics table in the qilian mountain heihe national key water and soil erosion prevention area showed that the land where soil erosion has occurred in the mhr which is the main agricultural area in the heihe river basin accounts for nearly 40 of the total land area http www ncdc ac cn while the proportion in minle and sunan both in zhangye is less than 20 indicating that agricultural activities have a significant impact on soil erosion in the study area and there is an urgent need to address soil erosion in farmland this study further analyzed the carbon sink of agricultural activities in the study area generally the more sufficient irrigation water there is the higher the agricultural yield and crop carbon sink wu et al 2022 in this study the net carbon accumulation of crops in the mhr would be the lowest under ssp245 in the 2030 s corresponding to the minimum heihe river runoff under this scenario however the carbon sink would not fully conform to this rule due to the complex conflict between different objectives in the model figs 4d 7c fertilizers and agricultural films would be the main carbon sources in agrarian activities in the mhr fig 7b therefore reducing the use of agricultural films and using low carbon fertilizers or organic fertilizers is of great significance for controlling carbon emissions su et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 maize has the most significant carbon sink which is related to its acreage vegetables can mature faster than corn and have higher annual yields although the area of vegetables cannot be compared with that of corn the annual carbon sink of vegetables per unit area is higher than that of corn so the total carbon sink of vegetables in the study area is similar to that of corn fig 7a therefore expanding the vegetable planting area has positive significance for improving the agricultural carbon sink in addition although the carbon sink of crops would eventually return to the environment through consumption and microbial decomposition the proportion returned to the environment depends on the processing methods and usage routes of subsequent crops thus improving the carbon sink of crops still has positive implications withey et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 4 3 limitations and prospects of this study although this study uses the cmip6 model the swat model and the mop model to plan future agricultural areas in the mhr there are still some deficiencies in this study since some socioeconomic data are influenced by government policies to a large extent it is difficult to predict their future changes so this study did not consider the competition for water use among different sectors in addition because the spatial distribution map of crops in the study area is difficult to obtain this study cannot obtain the spatial distribution map of crops after agricultural planning to solve these problems in the following study more socioeconomic data will be collected to try to predict the future water consumption of different sectors and obtain the spatial distribution of crops through the processing of remote sensing data combined with the spatial adaptability of crops to obtain spatial distribution maps of crops after optimization 5 conclusions based on the prediction of the future climate in the study area this study established a multi objective agricultural planning model suitable for the arid and semiarid regions of china this study showed that the future climate in the study area would develop toward a warm and humidified climate under the combined effect of temperature and precipitation the evapotranspiration of crops would increase and the demand for irrigation water for crops in the future is more urgent even under the ssp245 scenario the demand for irrigation water was expected to increase by 14 4 relative to the baseline period by the 2070 s the forecast results showed that future precipitation is likely to be concentrated in spring and autumn rather than summer when crops grow quickly which would make agricultural water scarcer the increase in vegetable planting is beneficial to improving the economic benefits of agriculture and can increase carbon sinks in the study area however to control soil erosion the proportion of vegetables should not exceed 16 the use of chemical fertilizers and agricultural plastic film is the main carbon source for local agricultural activities accounting for more than 60 of the total carbon emissions this study proposes to use more advanced irrigation technology to reduce the loss of water build more water storage and transfer facilities to meet the water shortage in the growing season of crops and take deficit irrigation measures if necessary to increase economic benefits the government should pay increased attention to the control of soil erosion in farmland and gradually expand the planting area of vegetables to reduce carbon emissions from farmland the use of agricultural films and chemical fertilizers should be controlled or lower carbon films and chemical fertilizers should be used this study extends agricultural planning research by combining climate change scenarios with agricultural multi objective planning and applying them to ecologically fragile oasis agricultural areas it can provide a reference for agricultural planning in arid and semiarid areas in northwest china and other similar areas and is of great significance to improving agricultural efficiency and promoting sustainable

9048,in the context of global climate change changes in precipitation and temperature conditions especially the increasing frequency of extreme climate events have a severe impact on agricultural production predicting climate change and adjusting planting structures over time are critical to sustainable agricultural development in this study the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 and soil and water assessment tool swat models were used to simulate the future climate and runoff in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin mhr then the mopso and nsga ii were used to plan future planting structures the results showed that the temperature and precipitation in the mhr showed an increasing trend by the 2070 s the temperature was projected to increase by more than 2 c under ssp245 while that under ssp585 was more than 4 c the annual mean precipitation was projected to increase but the distribution was uneven and the increased precipitation was mainly concentrated in spring and autumn under the interaction of temperature and precipitation the runoff of the heihe river will increase in the future especially under ssp585 and the runoff of the heihe river is projected to reach 2 48 billion m³ a in the 2070 s crop water demand was projected to increase with temperature and crop irrigation water demand would increase by 14 4 in the 2070 s under ssp245 planting vegetables helps to improve agricultural economic benefits and carbon sinks but to control soil erosion the area of vegetables is best kept at approximately 16 fertilizers and agricultural films are the primary carbon sources in agricultural production activities in mhr accounting for more than 60 of the total carbon this study suggests promoting sustainable agricultural development by improving irrigation efficiency using low carbon fertilizers controlling soil erosion and gradually expanding the vegetable planting area with a considered ecological environment keywords cmip6 multi objective climate change agricultural planning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 climate change agriculture plays an irreplaceable role in meeting the growing global demand for food and maintaining social stability godfray et al 2010 zalles et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a however agricultural production activities are being hit by climate change which will significantly affect agricultural production zhang et al 2022a the current intensive agrarian production methods are relatively vulnerable to the impact of climate change and adaptation measures are urgently needed zhang et al 2022a some studies have shown that proper planning of land and water resources can help agriculture adapt to climate change singh et al 2016 kalbali et al 2021 therefore predicting the impact of future climate change on agriculture and rational planning of soil and water resources are crucial for agricultural production garcía vila and fereres 2012 for agricultural planning under climate change there have been some studies such as fereidoon and koch 2018 using the hadgem2 es climate model combined with intelligent optimization algorithms to optimize agricultural planting structures sabbaghi et al 2020 planned future agricultural planting structures based on the hadcm3 and cgcm3t63 models kalbali et al 2021 used the weather generator lars wg to simulate future climate change and combined it with positive mathematical programming to study the adaptation strategies of agriculture to climate change abdi dehkordi et al 2017 used the hadcm3 model combined with genetic algorithms to optimize future agricultural structures the above studies incorporated climate change scenarios into agricultural planning extending the scope of agricultural planning however the above studies only used weather generators or earlier versions of cmip models and did not screen cmip models which may increase uncertainty in climate predictions monerie et al 2017 bağçaci et al 2021 some studies have shown that the climate of the heihe river basin tends to be warmer and more humidified sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a while climate warming and increased precipitation have opposite effects on agricultural production which creates greater uncertainty for future agricultural planning thus it is critical to assess the performance of climate models based on these considerations this study selected four coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models with reference to existing studies and further evaluated the performance of the models the new generation of models better controls uncertainty and can better predict climate change hamed et al 2022 try et al 2022 hydrological modeling is an important step in converting climate variables into available water resources currently black box models chen et al 2021 conceptual hydrological models zhao et al 2021 and distributed and semi distributed hydrological models wallace et al 2017 that are based on parameters such as meteorological data have been widely used among them the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model that can take into account the influence of meteorological factors soil and land use types and can be used in many fields arnold et al 1998 zhang et al 2016b such as runoff simulation li and fang 2021a water resource exploitation fereidoon and koch 2018 and ecological protection jimeno sáez et al 2022 compared with the conceptual hydrological model and the black box model this model considers more factors affecting runoff and is more reliable therefore this study uses it to simulate future runoff and the simulated runoff for agricultural planning 1 2 agricultural multi objective planning agricultural planning is a complex issue that requires resources such as land and water in agriculture to be allocated according to established goals li and guo 2014 cheng et al 2017 there have been some studies in the past such as galán martín et al 2015 that aim to maximize the economic benefits of farmers using multistage linear programming methods to optimize agricultural planting structures zhang et al 2018a used an inexact robust two stage mixed integer linear programming approach for crop area planning with the goal of maximizing system revenue zuo et al 2021 used a scenario based type 2 fuzzy interval programming approach to agricultural planning to maximize economic benefits however most of the above studies focus on maximizing economic benefits and lack consideration of multiple objectives in agricultural planning raju and kumar 1999 niu et al 2019 such as soil erosion and nitrogen emission control in addition agricultural production is an important source of carbon emissions however a large number of studies in the past ignored the carbon sources and carbon sinks in agricultural production pratibha et al 2016 yue and guo 2021 given this lack of information this study incorporated objectives such as soil erosion total nitrogen control and carbon emissions into the agricultural planning framework which makes it more instructive in management for agricultural multi objective programming problems previous studies have used a variety of solving methods mosleh et al 2017 najafabadi et al 2019 these include linear programming models soentoro et al 2018 multi objective linear fractional programming niu et al 2019 distributed interval nonlinear multi objective programming approaches tang et al 2019 random boundary intervals li et al 2019b and interval linear multi objective fractional optimization models zhang et al 2022b the above methods have made many contributions to the solution of agricultural multi objective problems however these methods all transform the multi objective problem into a single objective problem according to the set target weight only one unique solution can be obtained at a time which is cumbersome and has significant limitations han et al 2021 in contrast bioinspired intelligent optimization algorithms can more efficiently solve multi objective problems with multiple constraints and provide a large number of feasible solutions which are helpful for practical decision making combined with specific problems zhang et al 2022c the method has been widely used in land use planning zhou et al 2015 energy deployment hatamkhani and moridi 2019 and other fields showing strong performance but few studies have used it for agricultural planning sajith et al 2022 mopso and nsga ii are two classic intelligent optimization algorithms in contrast mopso tends to fall into local optimal solutions when solving while nsga ii is not suitable for high dimensional multi objective programming problems han et al 2021 based on the above analysis this study uses both mopso and nsga ii for agricultural planning and chooses the best solution the middle reaches of the heihe river mhr are located in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest china and is an important grain producing and seed production base as an important industry agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 80 of the total local water consumption but the utilization rate of water resources is low zhao et al 2010 wang et al 2021b on the other hand the development of industry has intensified water use competition cai et al 2022 and water resources have become a major constraint on local agricultural production chai et al 2014 yin et al 2017 in addition the study area belongs to the traditional agricultural oasis area and the ecological environment is very fragile moreover the study area is located at the junction of deserts and has a special geographical location the intensification of the local water conflict will affect the ecological security pattern in china therefore the agricultural planning of the study area should not only focus on economic benefits but also set multiple objectives several studies have considered the conflicts and trade offs of multiple objectives in agricultural planning such as campana et al 2018 and li et al 2020a considering the food water energy nexus and gordon et al 2010 considering the water ecosystem agricultural framework however these studies did not consider climate change scenarios in contrast some studies considered climate change scenarios but ignored multiple objectives in agricultural planning sabbaghi et al 2020 kalbali et al 2021 although li et al 2021b and chen et al 2022 combined the two their study area is a plain agricultural area with good ecological conditions and has limited guiding significance for ecologically fragile agricultural oasis areas in view of the above analysis it is of great significance to carry out agricultural multi objective planning in the middle reaches of the heihe river under climate change scenarios based on water resources but such studies have not yet been conducted 1 3 summary and goals in view of the above analysis this study found that there are still the following shortcomings in agricultural planning under climate change 1 most studies lack the analysis of the applicability of climate models in specific regions 2 the multi objective solving methods used in most studies are to transform the multi objective problem into a single objective problem and the efficiency of these algorithms is not very high and 3 few studies have coupled climate change with multi objective planning especially in the ecologically fragile oasis agricultural area represented by the heihe agricultural area in view of this this study combined the evaluated cmip6 model with the swat model to determine the amount of water available in the study area and built an agricultural planning model with the goal of increasing economic benefits water efficiency and carbon sinks and reducing farmland soil and total nitrogen losses the model was solved by combining mopso and nsga ii the main objectives of this study are to 1 screen out the cmip6 model suitable for the heihe river basin and predict future climate change in the study area 2 incorporate ecological environmental and socioeconomic factors into planning issues and construct a new multi objective planning framework to guide agricultural activities and 3 preplan the planting structures of the study area in combination with climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mhr 98 00 100 55 e 38 50 40 00 n is a typical arid and semiarid region in northwest china bounded by yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge fig 1 the annual mean precipitation is less than 200 mm and the annual mean evaporation is more than 1000 mm jiang et al 2020 the heihe river originating from the qilian mountains is the primary water supply source of the mhr zou et al 2020 as one of the vital grain production bases in northwest china the mhr produces more than one million tons of crops each year agricultural activities alone consume most of the water resources in the entire basin liu et al 2022 with the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization the contradiction of local water use has become increasingly prominent thus it is urgent to ensure the safety of the agricultural water supply bao and fang 2007 jiang et al 2020 2 2 data collection and processing four cmip6 models were selected based on previous studies table 1 guo et al 2021 monthly and daily data including maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation were downloaded from the cmip6 website https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 the monthly data were used for the comparison verification and screening of the cmip6 models the daily data were used for the subsequent modeling work the data were preprocessed by steps including the nc file to raster raster clipping and extraction due to the few meteorological stations in the heihe river basin it was challenging to represent its overall climate status so this study selected the cmads data www cmads org to represent the observed values the data contain daily maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation the period is from 2008 to 2018 cadas data can be directly used in the swat model and its reliability has been recognized by previous studies meng et al 2016 2019 gao et al 2020 the soil properties were obtained from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations http www fao org the dem and land use types were collected from the resource and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn agricultural planning needs to comprehensively consider many factors including crop prices crop costs crop physiological parameters and planting area these data can be obtained from relevant websites and previous studies zhang et al 2009 2021 li et al 2019a niu et al 2019 wu et al 2022 table 2 2 3 cmip6 model screening and correction as global scale climate models cmip6 models have significant errors in local areas stevens and bony 2013 song et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to select a model suitable for the study area in this study the meteorological data of the baseline period 2008 2018 were used as the reference the coefficient of determination r2 the percent bias pbias the normalized root mean square error nrmse the modified index of agreement md and the kling gupta efficiency kge were used as evaluation indices of cmip6 models and the calculation formulas are as follows 1 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 p bias p o o 3 nr mse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 o max o min 4 md 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n p i o o i o 5 kge 1 1 α 2 1 β 2 1 γ 2 where o and p represent the cmads data and the output data of the cmip6 model respectively α β and γ represent the ratio of the pearson correlation coefficient deviation and coefficient of variation of the two groups of data respectively after calculating each model index this study used topsis to synthesize the results of the above indexes and constructed an index to evaluate the overall performances of the models the calculation formulas are as follows 6 d i j 1 m w j z j z ij 2 7 d i j 1 m w j z i j z j 2 8 c i d i d i d i where w j represents the weight of indicator j z ij represents the standardized score of model i on indicator j z j represents the highest score of all models on indicator j z j represents the lowest score of all models on indicator j d i represents the distance between model i and the optimal solution d i represent the distance between model i and the worst solution c i is the final score of model i finally the most suitable model for the study area was screened according to c i bias correction helps reduce the uncertainty of the cmip6 model classic bias correction methods include multiple linear regression delta change and quantile mapping qm among them qm can correct the deviation between cmip6 data and meteorological observations by matching the empirical cumulative distribution function cannon et al 2015 fang et al 2015 and it is widely used due to its simple nonparametric configuration and efficient correction of the mean standard deviation and quantile bias song et al 2021 therefore qm was chosen as the bias correction method in this study which was implemented by the qmap package in r and the formula is as follows 9 y f obs 1 f cmip 6 x where f obs 1 is the inverse cdf corresponding to y and f cmip 6 is the cdf of the cmip6 2 4 runoff simulation and correction to ensure the reliability of the swat model it is necessary to correct the output according

baseline period swat cup was used as the correction tool for swat output the correction method was the sufi 2 algorithm which is widely used due to its advantages in time calibration and uncertainty

problem solving this study used mopso and nsga ii algorithms to solve agricultural planning problems and the algorithms were implemented using the mopso and mco packages in r language after using these algorithms to obtain a series of pareto optimal solutions the linear weighted sum method was used to convert the multi objective problem into a single objective problem and an optimal solution was obtained the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method are two classical methods for determining the weight of objectives the analytic hierarchy process is too subjective and the entropy weight method often ignores some small changes in parameters bowen 1990 so this study used the improved entropy weight method zhang 2017 and the analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weight of each target and then performed a weighted summation of the weights obtained by the two methods to obtain a comprehensive weight wu et al 2022 finally the weights of the five targets were set

models including ec earth3 gfdl esm4 bcc csm2 mr and ipsl cm6a lr were selected in this study r2 nrmse pbias kge and md were used to evaluate the climate simulation performances of the four cmip6 models as shown in fig 2 the r2 of ec earth3 is slightly worse than that of gfdl esm4 on the minimum temperature simulation nevertheless it performs best on the remaining indicators fig 2a gfdl esm4 outperforms the other models in all indicators for the maximum temperature simulation fig 2b in the precipitation simulation ec earth3 and gfdl esm4 are better than the other models among them ec earth3 is better than gfdl esm4 in md nrmse and pbias while gfdl esm4 is better than ec earth3 in r2 and kge fig 2c in conclusion ec earth3 and gfdl esm4 significantly outperformed bcc csm2 mr and ipsl cm6a lr in the simulation of minimum maximum temperature and precipitation according to the topsis score ec earth3 performs best in the simulation of precipitation and minimum temperature in contrast gfdl esm4 performs best for simulating the maximum temperature fig 2d since ec earth3 has the highest spatial resolution among these models table 1 this study used it for the simulation of heihe runoff and the modeling of planting structure optimization in the previous step this study compared the performance of the four models however due to the limitation of objective factors such as resolution even the best performing models still fall short in the reliability of climate simulations to ensure the reliability of cmip6 data the qm method was used to correct the ec earth3 model data as shown in fig s1 ec earth3 overestimated the minimum temperature in january august and december and underestimated it in the remaining months before correction fig s1a for maximum temperature the model overestimated in january june september and december fig s1b in the precipitation simulations ec earth3 was overestimated in all months especially in august with abundant precipitation fig s1c after correction the simulated and observed values of ec earth3 for temperature were almost identical the precipitation was consistent with the observed value in other months except for september fig s1 the results showed that the qm method is suitable for correcting cmip6 data 3 2 baseline runoff simulation and correction after obtaining reliable climate data this study used swat to simulate future water resources under various scenarios in the study area before running the simulation it is necessary to correct the swat based on the cmads data in the swat model the runoff of the yingluoxia hydrological station was used as a reference 2008 was set as the warm up period 2009 2011 was selected as the calibration period and 2012 2018 was selected as the validation period then swat cup was further used to calibrate the runoff after calibration the swat model showed great performance in runoff simulation the nse is 0 85 r2 is 0 87 and pbias is only 1 7 which could meet the accuracy requirements of future runoff simulations fig s2 3 3 changes in temperature precipitation and runoff to explore future climate change the precipitation changes under various ssp scenarios were simulated fig 3a b c under all scenarios the future precipitation in the mhr was projected to change compared with the baseline period but the trends of precipitation in different scenarios were distinct the precipitation variation under ssp126 would remain stable and the change in annual mean precipitation would be small relative to the baseline period under ssp245 and ssp585 the precipitation changes would be far more severe than those under ssp126 the annual mean precipitation under the ssp245 scenario was projected to continue to increase with an increase of 55 8 mm relative to the baseline period by the 2070 s the precipitation under ssp585 was projected to show apparent fluctuations and the annual mean precipitation would first decrease and then increase after reaching a high value in the 2030 s after exploring future changes in precipitation this study further explored future changes in minimum temperature fig 3d e f and maximum temperature fig 3g h i under ssp126 the annual mean minimum temperature would increase at the beginning but would decrease after the 2050 s the annual mean minimum temperature was projected to increase continuously under ssp245 and ssp585 in general the difference in the warming effect under the three ssp scenarios is not significant before the 2050 s then the difference in the warming effect between the scenarios would increase significantly the annual mean minimum temperature under ssp585 was projected to increase by more than 4 c in the 2070 s relative to the baseline period much higher than 2 c under ssp245 the warming effect would be the most obvious from january to march and june to september the maximum temperature changes were basically the same as the minimum temperature but the degree of temperature increase would not be as high as the minimum temperature after exploring future climate change under different ssp scenarios the swat model was used to simulate the future runoff of the heihe river under each ssp scenario in this study as shown in fig 4 the annual variation in the runoff of the heihe river was projected to be basically the same under each scenario and the maximum runoff would be concentrated from june to september fig 4a b c this study further analyzed the runoff under each ssp scenario in the future the results showed that the runoff change of the heihe river was projected to remain relatively stable under ssp126 under ssp245 the runoff of the heihe river was projected to increase at the beginning and then stabilize from the 2030 s to the 2070 s it would remain stable after reaching a high value of 2 38 billion m³ a in the 2050 s under ssp585 the runoff of the heihe river would show a trend of first decreasing and then increasing after the 2030 s fig 4d 3 4 mop model validation before using the mop model to allocate future agricultural water and soil resources based on climate and water resource data it is necessary to verify the reliability of the model based on this consideration this study chose 2018 as the reference year readjusted the planting structures in the mhr based on relevant parameters and compared them with the actual planting structures as shown in fig s3 the area of corn in gz decreased and the vegetable planting area increased after model optimization under the condition that the total area of the selected crops remained unchanged fig s3a except for wheat which showed an increase the area of the remaining crops in lz decreased the areas of vegetables and corn decreased significantly fig s3b the planting area of the four crops in gt increased significantly but the percentage of corn decreased fig s3c in general the percentage of vegetables in the planting structures increased and the percentage of corn decreased fig s3 after optimization when the agricultural planting area remained unchanged the agricultural net carbon sink was basically unchanged the agricultural net profit increased by 5 5 the farmland soil loss decreased by 6 and the total nitrogen emissions from the farmland decreased by 3 3 indicating that the model can be used in the study area fig s4 3 5 adjustment of agricultural water and soil resources after evaluating the reliability of the mop model this study obtained the optimal future irrigation amount by running the mop model based on the climatic conditions and water availability under different climate scenarios fig 5 s5 s6 as shown in fig 5 fig s5 and fig s6 the percentages of irrigation water allocated to crops were projected to be mostly consistent under different scenarios among them the irrigation of corn was projected to require the largest amount of water and accounted for more than 80 of the total irrigation water in gz and lz the irrigation amount of vegetables is second in gz and gt the irrigation amount of vegetables was second only to corn and accounted for 12 the irrigation amount required for wheat is relatively small and the percentage of irrigation amount in gz and lz is less than 5 the area of potatoes is small so the irrigation amount is negligible compared to the other three crops fig 5 s5 s6 under all ssp scenarios the total irrigation water volume showed an increasing trend however different scenarios were projected to have distinct growth degrees the total irrigation water volume would not change much under ssp126 which would only increase by 1 2 from the 2030 s to the 2070 s while the irrigation water volume under ssp245 would increase by 14 4 fig 5 s5 s6 after obtaining the optimal future irrigation amount to further determine the planting structures in the future the mop model was used to plan the optimal area of wheat corn vegetables and potatoes under each ssp scenario as shown in fig 6 fig s7 and fig s8 compared with the current area the total area of selected crops will expand by nearly 10 in the future nevertheless the percentage of each crop under different scenarios would not be very different the advantage of maize is the most obvious accounting for 70 75 of the total area in all scenarios followed by vegetables around 16 and wheat and potatoes 8 14 fig 6 s7 s8 3 6 carbon sources sinks composition agricultural activities play an important role in the carbon cycle so after optimizing the allocation of agricultural water and soil resources the net carbon sink in the mhr under each ssp scenario was further analyzed in this study as shown in fig 7 the difference in the agricultural net carbon sink in the mhr between different ssp scenarios is slight and the maximum value would be only 17 higher than the minimum value fig 7c fertilizers agricultural films and groundwater extraction were the most crucial carbon sources contributing more than 80 of carbon emissions fig 7b the carbon sink of various crops showed that maize would have the most significant carbon sink followed by vegetables while wheat and potatoes would have less carbon sink less than 10 fig 7a 4 discussion 4 1 future climate change this study compared the climate simulation performance of ec earth3 gfdl esm4 bcc csm2 mr and ipsl cm6a lr with ec earth3 overall performing the best overall on this basis this study further corrected the bias of ec earth3 data to obtain prediction data for future climate the results showed that the temperature would increase by 1 2 c and the precipitation would increase by 10 40 mm relative to the baseline period in the mid 21st century under each scenario and the heihe river basin would become warmer and wetter in the future which is consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2016a zou et al 2020 this phenomenon is related to the northward shift of the east asian monsoon and the enhancement of the hydrological cycle in northwest china under global warming lan et al 2004 shi et al 2007 the degree of temperature rise in different periods in the future would not wholly conform to the law of ssp585 ssp245 ssp126 fig 3 some previous studies have pointed out that the cmip6 model may ignore the impact of energy conservation and emission reduction policies before the mid 21st century which would have a significant deviation from the actual situation in the future wang et al 2021a the degrees of warming of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 are not significantly different during this period but the difference between the three climate scenarios becomes significant after 2050 zhang et al 2015 there is significant uncertainty in cmip6 s temperature prediction before the mid 21st century which explains why ssp126 has more pronounced warming than ssp585 before the mid 21st century fu et al 2019 li et al 2020b after the mid 21st century the rise in temperature was projected to continue under ssp245 and ssp585 while the temperature would decrease under ssp126 which is related to the changes in atmospheric co2 concentration under the low emission scenario the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere was projected to decrease after the 2050 s while it would continue to rise under the medium and high emission scenarios rogelj et al 2012 you et al 2014 which would lead to a temperature drop directly after the 2050 s under ssp126 compared with the baseline period the annual precipitation in the mhr would increase under different future climate scenarios but the precipitation was projected to increase steadily in spring and autumn while the increase in summer precipitation would be less than that in spring and autumn and show more uncertainty yang et al 2019 fig 3a in this study precipitation in august was projected to decrease related to the enhanced summer land to ocean moisture gradient under the background of climate warming which would enhance land water loss and lead to drier land liang and zhang 2021a future runoff is mainly determined by temperature and precipitation and generally increased precipitation would increase river runoff while increased temperature would reduce runoff by increasing surface evapotranspiration zheng et al 2018 li et al 2020b however inconsistent phenomena were found in this study for example the temperature increase under the ssp126 scenario would be higher than that under the ssp245 scenario in the 2030 s and the precipitation increase would be slightly less than that under the ssp245 scenario nevertheless the simulation showed that the runoff under ssp126 is greater than that under ssp245 fig 4d the reason for this phenomenon is that the runoff of the heihe river mainly comes from the high altitude area of the qilian mountains on the one hand the increase in temperature can promote the increase in glacier meltwater on the other hand it can lead to changes in the active layer of permafrost in the high altitude area of the qilian mountains increasing the soil water storage and then leading to increased runoff which could reverse the runoff cutting effect of increased temperature lyon et al 2009 wang et al 2010 2015 rogger et al 2017 the relationship between runoff and climate change is complex and temperature and precipitation have different effects on runoff in different periods wang et al 2015 which may need to be further explored 4 2 agricultural planning and advice based on the results of the cmip6 and swat models the planting structures in mhr were adjusted by using the mop model the results showed that the total agricultural area in the mhr would increase by 3 11 under each climate scenario fig 6 s7 s8 which is related to the increase in future runoff under each ssp scenario the runoff of the heihe river was projected to vary by 10 20 relative to the average runoff in the baseline period of the heihe river which would increase fig 4 which may be sufficient to meet the water demand for agricultural expansion the continuous expansion of the agricultural area in the mhr would conflict with the expansion of urban land since the economic benefits of built up land are often higher than those of farmland the expansion of agricultural areas would inevitably encroach on some ecological land so rationally expanding agricultural land is crucial jiang et al 2020 the agricultural area was projected to expand but the percentage of the area of each crop would not change much the reason for this is that on the one hand this study imposed reasonable constraints in the model according to the actual planting structures of mhr in the historical period so the area of crops output by the model is kept within a reasonable range on the other hand the deficit irrigation of crops is allowed in this model which endows the model with a certain flexibility such that it can achieve the overall optimal agricultural structures through deficit irrigation within a specific range ignoring small shortages of water resources under the constraints set in the model the crops are best grown in gz and gt rather than in lz fig s3 which indicates that the limitation of food security on planting benefits can be largely adjusted by adjusting crop spatial patterns to offset niu et al 2019 under different ssp scenarios even if the total planting area does not change much the total water demand for agricultural irrigation in the mhr is projected to increase over time fig 5 s5 s6 nevertheless the degree of increase would be different under different scenarios among them the change in ssp126 would be small while the irrigation water requirement would increase significantly under ssp245 and ssp585 because of the warming of the climate the evapotranspiration of crops increases resulting in an increase in water requirements however the temperature increase would be limited under ssp126 so there would only be a slight increase in water demand continued increases in agricultural water requirements would affect crop yields to some extent so it is necessary to adopt more advanced irrigation technology to reduce the consumption of irrigation water tanasijevic et al 2014 cooper et al 2022 in addition climate warming would affect the growing season of crops and increase the risk of pests and diseases which could lead to a decline in the yield of some crops tanasijevic et al 2014 da silva et al 2015 tonnang et al 2022 when these factors are considered the potential harm of climate change to agriculture may be more serious in addition the optimal planting percentage of vegetables in the agricultural area in the mhr given by the model under each ssp scenario was projected to be maintained at approximately 16 fig 6 s7 s8 even lower than 18 in 2020 this contradicts the status quo of the growing area of vegetable cultivation shown in the statistical yearbook in recent years www zhangye gov cn tjj ztzl tjsj which is attributable to model adjustments to control soil erosion usually when the water supply can meet the demand vegetables are often favored by farmers because of their higher planting benefits nevertheless the continuous expansion of vegetable areas is not conducive to soil and water conservation in farmland niu et al 2019 the dataset of the soil erosion statistics table in the qilian mountain heihe national key water and soil erosion prevention area showed that the land where soil erosion has occurred in the mhr which is the main agricultural area in the heihe river basin accounts for nearly 40 of the total land area http www ncdc ac cn while the proportion in minle and sunan both in zhangye is less than 20 indicating that agricultural activities have a significant impact on soil erosion in the study area and there is an urgent need to address soil erosion in farmland this study further analyzed the carbon sink of agricultural activities in the study area generally the more sufficient irrigation water there is the higher the agricultural yield and crop carbon sink wu et al 2022 in this study the net carbon accumulation of crops in the mhr would be the lowest under ssp245 in the 2030 s corresponding to the minimum heihe river runoff under this scenario however the carbon sink would not fully conform to this rule due to the complex conflict between different objectives in the model figs 4d 7c fertilizers and agricultural films would be the main carbon sources in agrarian activities in the mhr fig 7b therefore reducing the use of agricultural films and using low carbon fertilizers or organic fertilizers is of great significance for controlling carbon emissions su et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 maize has the most significant carbon sink which is related to its acreage vegetables can mature faster than corn and have higher annual yields although the area of vegetables cannot be compared with that of corn the annual carbon sink of vegetables per unit area is higher than that of corn so the total carbon sink of vegetables in the study area is similar to that of corn fig 7a therefore expanding the vegetable planting area has positive significance for improving the agricultural carbon sink in addition although the carbon sink of crops would eventually return to the environment through consumption and microbial decomposition the proportion returned to the environment depends on the processing methods and usage routes of subsequent crops thus improving the carbon sink of crops still has positive implications withey et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 4 3 limitations and prospects of this study although this study uses the cmip6 model the swat model and the mop model to plan future agricultural areas in the mhr there are still some deficiencies in this study since some socioeconomic data are influenced by government policies to a large extent it is difficult to predict their future changes so this study did not consider the competition for water use among different sectors in addition because the spatial distribution map of crops in the study area is difficult to obtain this study cannot obtain the spatial distribution map of crops after agricultural planning to solve these problems in the following study more socioeconomic data will be collected to try to predict the future water consumption of different sectors and obtain the spatial distribution of crops through the processing of remote sensing data combined with the spatial adaptability of crops to obtain spatial distribution maps of crops after optimization 5 conclusions based on the prediction of the future climate in the study area this study established a multi objective agricultural planning model suitable for the arid and semiarid regions of china this study showed that the future climate in the study area would develop toward a warm and humidified climate under the combined effect of temperature and precipitation the evapotranspiration of crops would increase and the demand for irrigation water for crops in the future is more urgent even under the ssp245 scenario the demand for irrigation water was expected to increase by 14 4 relative to the baseline period by the 2070 s the forecast results showed that future precipitation is likely to be concentrated in spring and autumn rather than summer when crops grow quickly which would make agricultural water scarcer the increase in vegetable planting is beneficial to improving the economic benefits of agriculture and can increase carbon sinks in the study area however to control soil erosion the proportion of vegetables should not exceed 16 the use of chemical fertilizers and agricultural plastic film is the main carbon source for local agricultural activities accounting for more than 60 of the total carbon emissions this study proposes to use more advanced irrigation technology to reduce the loss of water build more water storage and transfer facilities to meet the water shortage in the growing season of crops and take deficit irrigation measures if necessary to increase economic benefits the government should pay increased attention to the control of soil erosion in farmland and gradually expand the planting area of vegetables to reduce carbon emissions from farmland the use of agricultural films and chemical fertilizers should be controlled or lower carbon films and chemical fertilizers should be used this study extends agricultural planning research by combining climate change scenarios with agricultural multi objective planning and applying them to ecologically fragile oasis agricultural areas it can provide a reference for agricultural planning in arid and semiarid areas in northwest china and other similar areas and is of great significance to improving agricultural efficiency and promoting sustainable

9049,quantifying groundwater extraction and understanding the factors that affect groundwater extraction are critical for improving water productivity and effectively managing groundwater resources groundwater extraction for cattle grazing is particularly poorly quantified and understood despite groundwater being an important water source in many grazing regions globally to address this knowledge gap a world first voluntary program of bore well metering in the surat basin queensland australia collected extraction data for 54 bores that are used fully or partially for cattle grazing data on factors potentially affecting extraction were gathered for each bore through landholder interviews and government database searches multiple regression analysis examined 18 variables and found strong evidence that 5 factors influence annual extraction from the metered bores cattle numbers bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure and annual rainfall together these factors explained more than 78 of the variance of the annual extraction estimates the results provide the basis for generalising extraction estimates to bores without meters in the same region and indicate the priority variables to explore in other regions the results also provide evidence of the importance of cattle breed and water storage infrastructure in improving water efficiency graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater extraction metering stock and domestic cattle grazing water use surat basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 reliance on groundwater for cattle grazing agriculture is the largest water consuming industry worldwide with over a third of agricultural water being used to produce animal livestock products heinke et al 2020 the production of beef is the most water intensive of the animal products with most water consumption used to grow pasture or feed and a small component between 4 and 8 for drinking and other services such as cooling gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 barsotti et al 2022 concluded that although drinking water intake is typically a small proportion of total water use in beef cattle grazing systems because drinking water is sourced from potentially limited water sources it should be quantified and considered in developing solutions for efficient water use in many climates the water demand of cattle is met by rainfall and associated water in pasture and surface runoff however in drought prone areas such as semi arid parts of the united states of america south america and australia groundwater is an important source of water for cattle grazing as it is largely unaffected by variations in surface hydrology dieter et al 2018 o keefe et al 2011 oecd 2015 although water consumption by cattle for drinking may seem small on a global scale mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 it can represent a significant component of extraction at a regional scale o keefe et al 2011 for example in the great artesian basin gab in queensland australia cattle grazing is the main land use and groundwater extraction to support it including drinking water for cattle and domestic use is estimated to represent 50 of the total water extraction dawe 2020 1 2 importance of understanding the factors driving groundwater extraction for cattle grazing pressure on global freshwater resources is

as evaporation and seepage losses from dams or channels and leaks from supply pipelines baillie 2008 lathuillière et al 2019 ridoutt et al 2012 singh et al 2020 are other factors which may influence groundwater extraction for cattle grazing 1 4 study objectives while there have been studies that have quantitatively assessed the factors that affect water consumption by cattle in feedlots ahlberg et al 2018 brew et al 2011 winchester and morris 1956 and from off stream watering points malan et al 2020 review of the literature has not identified any studies that have quantitatively evaluated the factors affecting groundwater extraction for cattle grazing this gap is likely to be related to the lack of available metered use data for stock bores worldwide molle and closas 2021 oecd 2015 results from a voluntary program of metering of 54 bores on cattle grazing properties in the surat basin queensland rochford et al 2022 provide a unique opportunity to address this this metering program is the only one of its kind worldwide and involved the collection of high resolution groundwater extraction data between 2015 and 2021 in addition to participants providing data on factors potentially influencing groundwater extraction through interviews in 2019 2020 and 2021 rochford et al 2022 the aim of this paper is to investigate the factors driving groundwater extraction for cattle grazing in semi arid regions using the surat basin as a case study specifically the objectives are to 1 characterise spatial and temporal variation in annual groundwater extraction within the study area 2 quantitatively identify factors influencing annual groundwater extraction from metered bores and 3 identify uncertainties in the analysis and what further research could be done to address them the research will help the agricultural sector to improve water efficiency and develop strategies to cope with water scarcity and climate change and will support groundwater resource managers in improving groundwater extraction estimates and hence aid sustainable management of groundwater resources 2 methods and data 2 1 case study area the surat cma 160 000 km2 is the queensland government s area of interest for assessing and managing cumulative impacts to groundwater resources associated with expanding coal seam gas and coal mining operations fig 1 a parts of the area form part of the great artesian basin ransley and smerdon 2012 a nationally significant water resource asset that supports economic activity groundwater dependent ecosystems and cultural heritage ordens et al 2020 the hydrogeology hydrology and land use of the surat cma are described in detail by ogia 2016 2019 and summarised by rochford et al 2022 in this paper only key background information necessary for interpreting the results here presented is provided the basin is a multilayered hydrogeological complex comprising alternating bands of higher permeability sandstones and lower permeability mudstones and siltstones overlain by alluvial sediments and volcanics there are eight main units used as water supply aquifers the agriculture sector is the dominant user of groundwater in the surat cma with groundwater the only reliable source of water for many graziers cattle grazing is the dominant land use approximately 70 of the surat cma and generally occurs on large properties 1810 ha on average but may be up to 50 000 ha many of which are remote from townships and not connected to town water there are an estimated 18 840 stock and domestic bores within the case study area fig 1a stock and domestic bores are used to water livestock for normal household purposes including potable supply and to water a garden around the homestead rainfall and runoff in the surat cma are highly variable and consequently many of the rivers and streams in the area are ephemeral the climate is sub tropical with high rates of evaporation fig 1b and most rainfall occurring in the summer months fig 1c average total annual rainfall for metered properties in the surat cma ranges from 285 to 1320 millimetres per year mm a 1 our metering program was undertaken during average rainfall years 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and dry rainfall years 2018 2019 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 where a rainfall year is from 1 july to 30 june to align with water years for groundwater management 1 july to 30 june fig 1b 2 2 groundwater extraction metering program of the 18 840 stock and domestic bores in the surat cma ogia 2019 less than 0 1 are metered several studies have highlighted the need for more targeted metering to validate extraction estimates and reduce uncertainties keir et al 2019 kent et al 2020 singh et al 2020 to address this a program of voluntary metering of groundwater extractions from stock and domestic bores was implemented in the surat cma from december 2015 to may 2021 over the course of the program 54 stock and domestic bores on cattle grazing properties spread throughout the surat cma were metered bores were selected for metering to represent the range of conditions in the study area including climate and source aquifer which varied based on location in the study area property size bore depth pump type power source and business size and ownership the properties selected for metering were also diverse in terms of farming system irrigated mixed crop livestock system vs non irrigated mixed crop livestock system vs cattle grazing system grazing strategy continuous vs set stocking vs rotational vs tactical availability of surface water sources bore operation and water storage infrastructure the selection process is further discussed in rochford et al 2022 many bore owners opted to participate in the program on a confidential basis due to privacy concerns and as such data presented in this paper are de identified and the locations of monitoring sites are not disclosed agreements with 12 participants have allowed data for 21 bores to be shared data were collected using ultrasonic time transit flow meters which clamp to the outside of the bore discharge pipe and digital data loggers to record high resolution time series of groundwater extraction field visits were conducted approximately annually to download data from the meters and conduct maintenance checks on the meters rochford et al 2022 provide details of the metering program 2 3 collection of data on the potential factors influencing groundwater extraction 2 3 1 analytical disaggregation of groundwater extraction to guide data collection within the study area stock and domestic bores are authorised under the queensland water act 2000 to provide water for grazing stock for household purposes and to water a garden not exceeding 0 5 ha other purposes may be authorised in some cases e g for dust suppression for gas field operations landholders in the study area also used water from stock and domestic bores for weed spraying water taken from a stock and domestic bore without a licence

from a bore may be restricted by supply limitations sl related to bore construction target formation for the bore pump capacity and distribution system capacity details of each of these components are in table 1 including their potential explanatory variables 2 3 2 landholder interviews the site visits in april and may 2019 august 2020 and may 2021 included semi structured interviews with bore owners or property managers for 42 bores the purpose of the interviews was to gather quantitative and qualitative data to inform analysis of the factors influencing groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use where face to face interviews were not possible telephone interviews were conducted the interviews included using property maps compiled using publicly available data and pre planned open and closed questions to guide the conversation but discussions were kept open enough to allow landholders to discuss other matters they considered important following approaches in comparable studies in other countries o keeffe et al 2016 the data collected included bore purpose cattle breed cattle numbers accessing water from the bore paddocks with access to bore water and the availability of other water sources the data provided were for the period since the previous survey the survey sheets used during the interviews in 2019 2020 and 2021 are included in supplementary material a a summary of the data gathered through the interviews is provided in table 2 2 3 3 other data sources the data gathered through the metering program and interviews were supplemented with data from publicly available sources as listed in table 3 2 4 data analysis the data analysis used multiple linear regression to identify the explanatory variables that were both statistically significant and consistent with knowledge from literature review and the interviews data and statistical analyses were undertaken using rstudio 4 1 1 rstudio team 2021 with packages mass 7 3 54 venables and ripley 2002 and glmnet 4 1 4 friedman et al 2010 analysis was undertaken at the bore scale as opposed to aggregating bores to property or grid scale this was done to increase data availability and because analysis at the bore scale is more relevant for aquifer management in this area as bores may tap different formations within a property 2 4 1 metered extraction data to create a dataset useful for analysis it was necessary to review the quality of the metered data and post process the data to remove anomalous readings or statistically impute missing values the data were then aggregated from the original sub daily time step typically hourly to an annual water year 1 july to 30 june time step where groundwater extraction data were missing for more than a third of days in a water year the data were excluded from the analysis where fewer data were missing in a water year average daily groundwater extraction for that year was used to infill after post processing to remove spurious data and infill data gaps groundwater extraction data were available for 48 stock and domestic bores over 161 annual water year periods the period of metered extraction data available for each bore varied from one to five water years the approach used to post process the extraction data is detailed in rochford et al 2022 2 4 2 selection of the candidate explanatory variables candidate explanatory variables for the data analysis table 4 were selected for each component of groundwater extraction in table 1 based on knowledge from literature review and the interviews cattle numbers were expressed as adult equivalents aes using interview data on cattle numbers accessing groundwater from each bore cattle breed weight age and breeding status ae is a standard measure of cattle grazing loads in northern australia the methodology for calculating ae was developed by mclean and blakely 2014 and calculates the energy demand of cattle based on animal specific variables the calculated energy demand is expressed relative to the energy demand of the ae standard unit which is a 450 kg bos taurus steer at maintenance the whole herd model developed by mclean and blakely 2014 was used to estimate average ae for each property during each water year none of the metered properties held licences to access surface water all properties had small farm dams that collect runoff however some properties also had other water sources that could be accessed for stock and domestic purposes including permanent surface water sources such as spring fed streams waterholes or dams large dams that collect runoff semi permanent surface water sources such as semi permanent streams and waterholes or melon holes small depressions in the landscape that collect water after rain where multiple water sources were available at the property the most permanent source that could be accessed by cattle was attributed to the property as the main other water source root zone soil moisture was used as an indicator of pasture quality with higher root zone soil moisture considered indicative of better pasture quality and the presence or absence of exclusion fences was used as an indicator of potential water consumption by native and feral animals type of water storage infrastructure was used to assess whether evaporative and or seepage losses may be factors as evaporative losses may be expected from open dams turkey s nests and open tanks and seepage losses may be expected from turkey s nests the metered bores were recorded as either sub artesian artesian ceased to flow artesian condition unknown or flowing artesian with controlled flow and had piped distribution the bores recorded as artesian ceased to flow and artesian condition unknown were grouped together with the flowing artesian bores as they were assessed to have relatively higher pressures than sub artesian bores there were no uncontrolled flowing artesian bores or open bore drains on metered properties water quality was excluded from the analysis due to insufficient data bore yield was omitted for the same reason although associated variables aquifer pressure and transmissivity were included distribution pipework channel losses dpl such as leaking headworks pipes or tanks and operational losses opl such as over pumping were also excluded as only limited data were provided through the interviews 2 4 3 univariate analysis a preliminary exploration of the factors contributing to the spatial and temporal variation in annual groundwater extraction at the bore scale was undertaken by plotting key variables against groundwater extraction megalitres per bore and groundwater extraction per head megalitres per adult equivalent ml ae 1 supplemented by statistical tests the strength of these relationships were used to prioritise the variable selection in the subsequent multiple regression section 2 4 6 chatterjee and hadi 2012 efroymson 1960 hastie et al 2009 the statistical tests included linear regression modelling for continuous and discrete variables and one way analysis of variance anova fisher 1992 with a tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test tukey 1949 for categorical variables prior to statistical testing data were assessed for normal distribution using residual plots a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 of extraction and extraction per head was applied to maximise normality of the residuals for statistical analysis 2 4 4 multicollinearity multicollinearity was assessed for continuous and discrete variables before modelling using pearson s correlation coefficients schober et al 2018 where variables were highly correlated with one another 0 75 the least correlated with groundwater extraction was excluded from the multiple regression analysis all other variables were added to the multiple regression as potential explanatory variables in the order guided by the univariate analysis variance inflation factors vifs were used to assess correlation for categorical variables after modelling and where vif 5 one of the variables was removed from the analysis chatterjee and hadi 2012 2 4 5 interactions to assess whether interaction terms might be important to include in multiple regression potential interactions between variables were assessed using interaction plots hastie et al 2009 together with statistical testing the statistical tests included linear regression modelling for continuous and discrete variables and two way anova fisher 1992 yates 1934 for categorical variables prior to statistical testing data were assessed for normal distribution using residual plots a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 of extraction was applied to maximise normality of the residuals for statistical analysis selected interactions were included in the multiple regression analysis based on the findings of the interviews interaction plots and statistical tests 2 4 6 multiple regression a multiple linear regression model was fitted using stepwise selection involving a combination of forward and backward selections efroymson 1960 the purpose of the model was not prediction rather the purpose was statistical testing to identify significant explanatory variables prior to modelling data were assessed for normality using residual plots a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 of extraction was applied to maximise normality of the residuals for statistical analysis modelling was undertaken using rstudio 4 1 1 with package glmnet version 4 1 4 all variables and the selected interactions were included in the model starting with the variables identified as most significant based on p values through the univariate analysis chatterjee and hadi 2012 hastie et al 2009 a target p value of 0 05 was used for the regression with variables and interactions between variables removed where p 0 05 the results of the stepwise selection were compared with those of a lasso least absolute shrinkage and subset selection operator regression tibshirani 1996 to test sensitivity to the regression approach lasso is useful for variable selection where parsimony is an objective hastie et al 2015 and is often considered more reliable than stepwise regression and all subsets variable selection for datasets with many parameters and small sample sizes dahlgren 2010 before analysis all continuous and discrete variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation leave one out cross validation was undertaken to find the optimal value of the regularisation parameter lambda and to evaluate prediction error cross validation is a resampling method that uses different portions of the data over multiple iterations to test the model s ability to predict the data that was not used in estimating it lambda 1se the value of lambda that gives the most regularized model such that the cross validated error is within one standard error of the minimum was selected in preference to lambda min the value of lambda that gives the minimum cross validated error to provide for parsimony hastie et al 2015 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal variation in annual groundwater extraction volumes 3 1 1 bore scale variation in annual groundwater extraction annual groundwater extraction from metered bores ranged from 0 2 to 24 6 megalitres per water year ml a 1 during the monitoring period fig 2 the measurements show significant variation in the annual volume of groundwater extracted at different bores in addition there was inter annual variation in volumes extracted at some bores while extraction was relatively stable year to year at other bores noting differences in the number of years of available metered extraction data 3 1 2 regional scale variation in annual groundwater extraction there was no evidence of a difference in annual groundwater extraction during the monitoring period at a regional scale i e averaging over all metered bores in the surat cma p 0 86 with median extraction per bore ranging between 4 0 and 5 1 ml a 1 over the five water years fig 2 3 2 bore scale univariate analysis 3 2 1 consumptive use the metered bores were all used to provide drinking water to grazing cattle for beef production with some bores also used for domestic purposes watering a garden and other purposes including weed spraying and dust suppression mean annual groundwater extraction for stock bores was 3 9 ml a 1 compared with 6 9 ml a 1 for bores used for stock and domestic purposes 8 0 ml a 1 for bores used for stock domestic and garden purposes and 7 1 ml a 1 for bores used for stock and other purposes including weed spraying and dust suppression fig 3 a statistical analysis indicates strong evidence of differences between bores used only for stock and bores used for stock domestic and garden p 0 001 and bores used only for stock and bores used for stock and other purposes p 0 006 there is weaker evidence of a difference between bores used only for stock and those used for stock and domestic p 0 3 linear regression modelling indicated strong evidence of a relationship between annual groundwater extraction and cattle numbers p 0 001 groundwater extraction from stock and domestic bores increased with cattle number by approximately 0 0053 ml a 1 ae 1 fig 3b there was no difference in annual extraction per bore for properties that were breeding compared with properties that were backgrounding p 0 96 however properties that were both breeding and backgrounding had higher extraction than properties that were solely breeding p 0 004 or backgrounding p 0 015 these data are not presented in the figures annual groundwater extraction per head was lower for properties with bos indicus cattle compared to properties with bos taurus p 0 004 and cross breed p 0 05 cattle fig 4 a higher extraction per head was recorded where set stocking was the grazing strategy compared to where rotational grazing p 0 03 or tactical grazing p 0 003 was used data for stock bores indicates groundwater extraction per head of cattle is generally less than 0 015 ml a 1 ae 1 but may be up to 0 025 ml a 1 ae 1 fig 4b linear regression modelling indicated a relationship between annual rainfall and annual groundwater extraction per head p 0 05 with groundwater extraction declining by approximately 0 001 ml a 1 ae 1for every 100 mm increase in annual rainfall fig 4 c there was also evidence that water consumption rates increased with annual evaporation p 0 11 and average daily maximum air temperature p 0 07 statistical analysis indicated no evidence of a difference in annual groundwater extraction per head of cattle during the monitoring period based on the availability of other water sources fig 4d linear regression modelling indicated a relationship between annual groundwater extraction per head and root zone soil moisture p 0 07 with extraction decreasing by approximately 0 005 ml a 1 ae 1 for every 10 increase in root zone soil moisture during the monitoring period water extraction rates per head were lower for cattle with access to cultivation as a source of feed than cattle that did not have access to cultivation p 0 001 fig 4e 3 2 2 losses the bores distributing to closed tanks had the lowest median extraction rate per head of the three type of water storages fig 4 f however the statistical significance of the differences was low p 0 98 3 2 3 supply limitations statistical analysis indicates strong evidence of a difference in annual extraction for sub artesian bores compared to flowing artesian bores with controlled flow and bores that were previously artesian but have ceased to flow fig 5a p 0 001 no evidence of a difference in annual extraction was observed for bores tapping formations across the four higher classes of transmissivity 10 20 50 and 300 m d 1 and the statistical significance of the two way differences with bores accessing groundwater from the lowest class of transmissivity 2 m d 1 was variable p 0 001 0 24 0 08 and 0 61 the results indicate a significant difference in annual groundwater extraction for windmill bores compared to bores with other types of pumps p 0 001 and suggest there may be a difference in extraction for solar bores compared to electric bores and flowing artesian bores p 0 18 fig 5b there was weak evidence of a difference in annual groundwater extraction based on the bore operation manual timer or float p 0 18 3 3 multicollinearity assessment of multicollinearity found that property area was highly correlated with head of cattle r2 0 91 and root zone soil moisture and annual evaporation were highly correlated with annual rainfall r2 0 78 and 0 76 respectively property area root zone soil moisture and annual evaporation were excluded from multiple regression analysis pump type was removed from analysis due to collinearity with bore purpose vif 9 8 3 4 interactions statistical testing indicated that head of cattle had interactions with bore purpose and annual rainfall as well as factors that influence how much groundwater cattle drink cattle breed grazing strategy daily maximum air temperature root zone soil moisture use of cultivation as a source of feed and availability of other water sources and factors with the potential to limit supply aquifer pressure aquifer transmissivity pump type and bore operation this means that the effect of cattle numbers on groundwater extraction depends on these variables which is intuitive interview results suggested potential interactions between annual rainfall and bore purpose the availability of other water sources use of cultivation as a source of feed and type of cattle operation however these were not found to be significant in the data analysis p 0 15 interactions between categorical variables were difficult to assess as limited data were available for some categories the interaction between head of cattle and bore purpose is shown in fig 6 a for stock bores annual groundwater extraction during the monitoring period increased by approximately 0 0039 ml ae 1 whereas for bores used for stock domestic garden and other purposes annual extraction increased by 0 007 ml ae 1 the linear regression model for stock bores suggests an average loss through evaporation seepage distribution pipework and operational losses of 1 4 ml a 1 although this may vary depending on property size the difference between the two models suggests groundwater extraction for domestic garden and other purposes ranges between 1 0 ml a 1 at properties with low cattle numbers 100 ae and 8 8 ml a 1 at properties with high cattle numbers 2400 ae assuming an average loss of 1 4 ml a 1 the interaction between head of cattle and annual rainfall category is shown in fig 6b the increase in groundwater extraction with head of cattle was lower during average years compared with dry years the increase in groundwater extraction with head of cattle was lowest for wet years however interpretation was somewhat limited by the small number of properties that experienced wet conditions during the monitoring period 3 5 multiple regression modelling multiple regression analysis found evidence p 0 05 that annual groundwater extraction from stock and domestic bores is influenced by head of cattle with access to bore water ae bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure of the target formation for the bore total annual rainfall at the property the model had an adjusted r2 value of 78 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 77 ml a 1 the regression equation coefficients are in table 5 comparison of the results to those of the lasso regression indicated that all variables included in the stepwise model were included in the lasso model with the exception of total annual rainfall no additional variables were included in the lasso model based on a lambda 1se value of 0 015 3 6 spatial and temporal variation for key parameters head of cattle accessing bore water were lowest in 2018 19 and 2019 20 for all types of cattle operations noting differences in the number of properties for which data are available fig 7 a linear regression modelling indicated there may be a relationship between annual rainfall and cattle numbers p 0 12 with cattle numbers increasing by 106 ae for every 100 mm of rainfall on average there was significant variation in total annual rainfall at metered properties during the monitoring period p 0 001 with lowest rainfall recorded in 2018 19 and 2019 20 fig 7b annual rainfall varied across the study area with a difference of up to 495 mm recorded for properties participating in the metering program in the 2017 18 water year fig 7b the purpose of some bores varied from year to year depending on the availability of other water sources e g during dry years some properties used groundwater for domestic or garden purposes as surface water sources were not available the type of water storage infrastructure used and the pressure of the target formation for the bore artesian vs sub artesian did not vary at the metered properties during the monitoring period 4 discussion 4 1 bore scale analysis of factors influencing annual groundwater extraction annual groundwater extraction from metered stock and domestic bores varied spatially across the surat cma and temporally at individual bores from year to year minimum 0 2 ml a 1 maximum 24 6 ml a 1 multiple regression analysis found strong evidence that of the 18 factors and 12 interactions assessed variation in groundwater extraction at the bore scale could be explained by 5 factors head of cattle bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure and total annual rainfall despite interaction plots and statistical analysis suggesting that interactions between head of cattle and other variables may be significant for groundwater extraction no interactions were identified as significant in the multiple regression analysis 4 1 1 head of cattle accessing bore water head of cattle accessing bore water was identified as the most significant factor influencing groundwater extraction and is closely correlated with property area r2 0 91 cattle numbers were lowest during dry rainfall years 2018 19 and 2019 20 for all types of cattle operations fig 7a and showed a declining trend with declining rainfall this variation in cattle numbers with rainfall reflects how graziers manage cattle numbers on their properties to prevent overgrazing finch et al 2014 sandhage hofmann 2016 interview data indicates backgrounders in the study area were flexible in how they managed stock numbers on their properties and destocked during dry periods most breeders noted a preference for maintaining their herd breeding core during dry conditions including through hand feeding cattle and would reduce grazing pressure by selling young cattle earlier than normal however during the drought in 2018 19 and 2019 20 some landholders reported loss death of breeding stock and some breeding properties needed to destock because the drought was so widespread and the normal options of agisting sending cattle to another property for a period or sending cattle on travelling stock routes were not available to them the lower cattle numbers may explain why there was no significant difference in groundwater extraction for dry rainfall years compared to average rainfall years at the study area scale fig 2 even though per head groundwater extraction increased with declining rainfall fig 4c although climatic conditions and the associated variation in pasture growth are likely to be key factors influencing stocking rates leweri et al 2021 mckeon et al 2021 stone et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 other factors are also expected to influence spatial and temporal variation in head of cattle within the study area including farmer attitudes to land management market conditions attitudes to risk business size and dependence of the enterprise on maintaining the herd breeding core mcivor 2010 stone et al 2021 understanding the factors driving variation in stocking rates is relevant for making projections of future groundwater extraction rates and will be explored in a separate paper 4 1 2 annual rainfall annual rainfall was also identified as an important factor in addition to influencing pasture condition and therefore capacity of properties to keep cattle leweri et al 2021 mckeon 1990 rainfall influences how much water cattle consume and the availability of other water sources ahlberg et al 2018 csiro 2007 malan et al 2020 winchester and morris 1956 water consumption by cattle and reliance on groundwater sources is expected to be higher during periods of low rainfall due to drier poorer quality pasture csiro 2007 and limited availability of surface water sources csiro 2007 malan et al 2020 as shown in fig 4c groundwater extraction per head was higher when rainfall was lower the converse is expected for wet years however further monitoring is required to confirm this 4 1 3 other important factors other factors identified as significant through the multiple regression include bore purpose and bore pressure groundwater extraction was lowest for bores used only to water stock and highest for bores used for stock domestic and garden purposes indicating that distinguishing bore purpose may be important for estimation methods bore pressure may also be important for estimation methods with analysis indicating that groundwater extraction from sub artesian bores was lower than flowing artesian bores and bores that were previously artesian but had ceased to flow this may be explained by flowing artesian bores and former artesian bores being more productive and less expensive to operate than sub artesian bores due to the lesser requirement to pump which has associated energy costs although evaporative losses from on farm storages in australia are understood to be large baillie 2008 ridoutt et al 2012 the independent effects of evaporation could not be assessed independently due to collinearity with rainfall however type of water storage infrastructure was identified as an important factor through the multiple regression with the results indicating groundwater extraction was lower for bores that distribute to closed tanks and higher for bores that distribute to turkey s nests suggesting evaporation and seepage from water storage infrastructure may be important factors tanks are generally smaller in capacity than turkey s nests and so there may be some effect related to bores with lower yields and lower demands using tanks for water storage the results suggest water storage infrastructure may be an important consideration for water conservation and estimation methods 4 1 4 factors not identified as significant all of the metered properties had small farm dams that collect runoff however some properties also had other water sources including permanent waterholes ephemeral streams large dams and melon holes the availability of other water sources was not identified as a factor influencing groundwater extraction this may be related to the monitoring period occurring during dry and average rainfall years and because temporal data on the availability of other water sources were not included in the analysis per head groundwater extraction rates were estimated at 0 008 ml a 1 ae 1 on average which is lower than studies of cattle water consumption that indicate average per head consumption rates between 0 009 and 0 022 ml a 1 ae 1 alsemgeest and zuino 2002 brew et al 2011 winchester and morris 1956 this suggests surface water sources such as small farm dams water contained in pasture and other feed csiro 2007 nsw department of primary industries 2014 and water on pasture e g dew csiro 2007 may represent between 16 and 65 of water consumption by cattle in the study area this is consistent with the findings of landholder interviews undertaken by parsons brinckerhoff 2011 for shallow groundwater systems in the study area which indicated between 22 and 53 of water demand for stock and domestic purposes was met by surface water sources univariate analysis indicated a difference in groundwater extraction per head based on cattle breed with average per head extraction for bos indicus cattle estimated at 0 005 ml a 1 ae 1 compared with 0 011 ml a 1 ae 1 for cross breed cattle and 0 021 ml a 1 ae 1 for bos taurus cattle this is consistent with research that has shown bos indicus breeds of asian origin are more tolerant of heat and consume less water than bos taurus breeds of european origin brew et al 2011 winchester and morris 1956 and indicates that cattle breed may be an important consideration for water conservation initiatives in the area despite its clear effect cattle breed was not identified as an important factor through the multiple regression it is understood this is because cattle breed was a variable used to standardise cattle numbers between properties using the methodology to calculate adult equivalent by mclean and blakely 2014 and so it is implicit in the regression inputs univariate analysis also indicated a difference in groundwater extraction per head based on whether cattle had access to cultivation as a source of feed this reflects the findings of the study by barsotti et al 2022 which concluded that freshwater consumption related to beef cattle is lower in mixed crop livestock systems than in grazing systems which may be related to feed quality or cultivation occurring in areas of higher rainfall despite this cultivation was not identified as a significant factor in the multiple regression possibly due to the monitoring period occurring during dry and average rainfall years when non irrigated cultivation was less successful or not attempted the interviews noted an increasing trend towards the installation of exclusion fences with some around the entire property and others along on a boundary bordering bushland exclusion fences are installed to reduce overgrazing of pasture predation of calves and the introduction of weeds and diseases by native and feral animals giumelli and white 2016 one landholder noted more than a 50 reduction in the number of hours the bore needed to be pumped after installing exclusion fences however statistical analysis of data from the metered bores did not indicate a general difference in extraction per head based on the presence or absence of exclusion fences p 0 64 and this was not a factor identified through the multiple regression it is interpreted that while there may be local cases of fences preventing significant water take by native and feral animals such water consumption is generally minor compared with consumption by cattle aquifer transmissivity and bore operation were not identified as factors influencing groundwater extraction these factors were included in the analysis because there may be potential for them to limit the supply of water from the bore and therefore essentially put a cap on extraction the univariate analysis suggested that this is not the case with no evidence of a difference in groundwater extraction between the transmissivity classes except possibly the lowest transmissivity class of 2 m d 1 although limited data are available for this class or based on bore operation float manual or timer pump type was not included in the multiple regression due to collinearity with bore purpose however the univariate results indicate groundwater extraction from windmill driven bores was significantly lower than for other bores p 0 001 windmill bores in the study area are typically older and shallower than bores that use diesel electric and solar pumps which may explain the difference 4 2 regional scale variation in annual groundwater extraction groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use at the regional scale did not vary significantly from year to year fig 2 despite significant variation in annual rainfall ranging from 352 mm to 567 mm at the regional scale during the monitoring period fig 7b based on the bore scale results it is interpreted that cattle water consumption reliance on groundwater sources and evaporative losses were higher during periods of low rainfall however because many graziers reduced cattle numbers to prevent overgrazing during these dry periods there was little difference in extraction observed from year to year at the regional scale further monitoring during wet rainfall years is required to confirm whether this applies across the range of climatic conditions other factors may also be important at the regional scale in addition to rainfall such as spatial variation in hydrogeological conditions or parameters affecting pasture condition and require further investigation 4 3 limitations a key objective of this study was to characterise spatial and temporal variability in groundwater extraction and improve understanding of the factors driving groundwater extraction for cattle grazing the analysis used data from 54 bores that were selected to be as representative of the range of climatic and hydrogeological conditions in the study area as possible rochford et al 2022 and to reflect the diversity in farm practice nevertheless there is potential for selection bias associated with those willing to participate in the study which needs to be considered when applying the results for the development of estimation methods an imbalance in the available data for some categorical variables due to the properties selected may also have influenced the results for example only three properties that were exclusively backgrounding were included in the metering program while it might be expected that backgrounding properties would have lower groundwater extraction during dry years related to the flexibility of these operations to destock mcivor 2010 this was not identified as an effect the multiple regression analysis did not assess the independent effects of evaporation soil moisture property area and pump type due to their collinearity with other variables furthermore the effects of water quality bore yield distribution pipework channel losses and operational losses could not be explored due to insufficient data literature review has suggested these factors may be important for water consumption by cattle and groundwater extraction ahlberg et al 2018 csiro 2007 malan et al 2020 parsons brinckerhoff 2011 winchester and morris 1956 there is potential that should it become possible to collect the necessary data future analysis may find these factors to be significant the duration and timing of the metering program may also limit the findings the metering program was conducted over a five year period during dry and average rainfall years which has potentially influenced the significance of some variables in particular the availability of other water sources and the use of cultivation as a source of feed which are both highly reliant on rainfall and may have more effect during wet years metering over a longer period to collect extraction data for wet years may find these factors to be significant the applicability of the results to other regions is questionable the surat cma is mostly semi arid with high rates of evaporation 1800 to 2500 mm and summer dominated rainfall keir et al 2019 aquifers in the area are generally productive enough to meet stock and domestic demand and the land use is predominantly cattle grazing due to the climate and terrain keir et al 2019 broadly speaking similar climate hydrogeological environment land use and terrain exist across much of the area underlain by the great artesian basin 1 700 000 km2 dcceew 2018 and it is reasonable to suggest that the results can be cautiously applied to these regions due to the potential importance of climate surface and groundwater access and pasture condition it is not recommended to rely on the results for other regions in australia or globally however the methodology employed in this paper for using voluntary metering and interviews to understand groundwater extractions is of broad relevance and value 4 4 future work multiple regression was used as the main data analysis method in this work including consideration of categorical discrete and continuous variables and their interactions various more powerful data analysis methods were considered including artificial neural networks malekian and chitsaz 2021 walczak and cerpa 2003 yang 2009 however with a total of only 5 years and 42 sites compared to the typically much larger datasets used when applying such methods it is unlikely that they would provide additional insight potential future work could include looking at daily scale variability of extraction rates for which the signals would be more complex and the dataset would be much larger in that case methods more powerful than linear regression may be appropriate ongoing metering to capture a wet period including collecting interview data for the explanatory variables assessed in this paper is recommended to improve understanding of the variability in groundwater extraction under a range of conditions and to assess the significance of factors related to rainfall including the availability of other water sources and the use of cultivation as a source of feed the results of this study provide the basis for development of lower cost and more reliable methods for estimating groundwater extraction at the 99 9 of stock and domestic bores in the study area that are not metered further work is needed to consider how the bore scale extraction data and priority variables could be used to improve existing methods or develop new estimation methods there are significant challenges in doing so as publicly available datasets are either not available for factors identified as significant including head of cattle accessing bore water and type of water storage infrastructure or do not provide sufficient up to date detail including bore purpose and aquifer pressure obtaining data on the priority variables may require the application of modelling or remote sensing approaches head of cattle accessing bore water was identified as the most significant factor influencing groundwater extraction however data on head of cattle are not typically available and methods for estimating groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use need to either derive estimates of head of cattle or use other predictors as indicators of head of cattle a number of factors that may influence head of cattle were identified through this study including property size type of cattle operation farmer attitudes to land management and market conditions literature review indicates other factors may also be important including air temperature and pasture condition leweri et al 2021 mckeon 1990 future research could use the cattle number data collected through the interviews to develop a model to predict head of cattle using publicly available datasets on potentially important factors alternatively methods for assessing sustainable stocking rates could be used as a proxy for actual rates zhang et al 2021 5 conclusions the paper reported the first empirical study of factors affecting groundwater extraction volumes in cattle grazing regions facilitated by a 5 year voluntary metering program in the semi arid surat cumulative management area in southern queensland australia at the bore scale groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use varied spatially across the region ranging from 0 2 to 24 6 ml a 1 and from year to year at some bores multiple regression analysis assessed 18 variables and 12 interactions and found strong evidence that variation in groundwater extraction at the bore scale could be explained by 5 factors head of cattle bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure and total annual rainfall together these factors explained more than 78 of the variance of the annual extraction estimates ongoing metering is needed to capture a wet period so the significance of variables related to rainfall including the availability of other water sources and the use of cultivation as a source of feed can be assessed at the regional scale groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use did not vary significantly from year to year despite significant variation in annual rainfall it is interpreted that while cattle water consumption reliance on groundwater sources and evaporative losses were higher during periods of low rainfall the reduction in cattle numbers during these periods meant there was little difference in extraction observed from year to year at the regional scale further monitoring during a wet period is required to confirm whether this applies across the range of climatic conditions the results of this study provide water managers with a basis for estimating extraction at the 99 9 of stock and domestic bores in the surat cma that are not metered the results also provide an indication of the priority variables to explore when developing methods for estimating groundwater extraction in other comparable regions further work is needed to consider how the extraction data and priority variables could be used to estimate stock and domestic use in the surat cma and other regions the results also provide evidence that cattle breed and water storage infrastructure are important considerations for improving water efficiency in grazing systems these findings may be important for water managers and graziers in future as they seek to improve water

9049,quantifying groundwater extraction and understanding the factors that affect groundwater extraction are critical for improving water productivity and effectively managing groundwater resources groundwater extraction for cattle grazing is particularly poorly quantified and understood despite groundwater being an important water source in many grazing regions globally to address this knowledge gap a world first voluntary program of bore well metering in the surat basin queensland australia collected extraction data for 54 bores that are used fully or partially for cattle grazing data on factors potentially affecting extraction were gathered for each bore through landholder interviews and government database searches multiple regression analysis examined 18 variables and found strong evidence that 5 factors influence annual extraction from the metered bores cattle numbers bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure and annual rainfall together these factors explained more than 78 of the variance of the annual extraction estimates the results provide the basis for generalising extraction estimates to bores without meters in the same region and indicate the priority variables to explore in other regions the results also provide evidence of the importance of cattle breed and water storage infrastructure in improving water efficiency graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater extraction metering stock and domestic cattle grazing water use surat basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 reliance on groundwater for cattle grazing agriculture is the largest water consuming industry worldwide with over a third of agricultural water being used to produce animal livestock products heinke et al 2020 the production of beef is the most water intensive of the animal products with most water consumption used to grow pasture or feed and a small component between 4 and 8 for drinking and other services such as cooling gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 barsotti et al 2022 concluded that although drinking water intake is typically a small proportion of total water use in beef cattle grazing systems because drinking water is sourced from potentially limited water sources it should be quantified and considered in developing solutions for efficient water use in many climates the water demand of cattle is met by rainfall and associated water in pasture and surface runoff however in drought prone areas such as semi arid parts of the united states of america south america and australia groundwater is an important source of water for cattle grazing as it is largely unaffected by variations in surface hydrology dieter et al 2018 o keefe et al 2011 oecd 2015 although water consumption by cattle for drinking may seem small on a global scale mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 it can represent a significant component of extraction at a regional scale o keefe et al 2011 for example in the great artesian basin gab in queensland australia cattle grazing is the main land use and groundwater extraction to support it including drinking water for cattle and domestic use is estimated to represent 50 of the total water extraction dawe 2020 1 2 importance of understanding the factors driving groundwater extraction for cattle grazing pressure on global freshwater resources is

as evaporation and seepage losses from dams or channels and leaks from supply pipelines baillie 2008 lathuillière et al 2019 ridoutt et al 2012 singh et al 2020 are other factors which may influence groundwater extraction for cattle grazing 1 4 study objectives while there have been studies that have quantitatively assessed the factors that affect water consumption by cattle in feedlots ahlberg et al 2018 brew et al 2011 winchester and morris 1956 and from off stream watering points malan et al 2020 review of the literature has not identified any studies that have quantitatively evaluated the factors affecting groundwater extraction for cattle grazing this gap is likely to be related to the lack of available metered use data for stock bores worldwide molle and closas 2021 oecd 2015 results from a voluntary program of metering of 54 bores on cattle grazing properties in the surat basin queensland rochford et al 2022 provide a unique opportunity to address this this metering program is the only one of its kind worldwide and involved the collection of high resolution groundwater extraction data between 2015 and 2021 in addition to participants providing data on factors potentially influencing groundwater extraction through interviews in 2019 2020 and 2021 rochford et al 2022 the aim of this paper is to investigate the factors driving groundwater extraction for cattle grazing in semi arid regions using the surat basin as a case study specifically the objectives are to 1 characterise spatial and temporal variation in annual groundwater extraction within the study area 2 quantitatively identify factors influencing annual groundwater extraction from metered bores and 3 identify uncertainties in the analysis and what further research could be done to address them the research will help the agricultural sector to improve water efficiency and develop strategies to cope with water scarcity and climate change and will support groundwater resource managers in improving groundwater extraction estimates and hence aid sustainable management of groundwater resources 2 methods and data 2 1 case study area the surat cma 160 000 km2 is the queensland government s area of interest for assessing and managing cumulative impacts to groundwater resources associated with expanding coal seam gas and coal mining operations fig 1 a parts of the area form part of the great artesian basin ransley and smerdon 2012 a nationally significant water resource asset that supports economic activity groundwater dependent ecosystems and cultural heritage ordens et al 2020 the hydrogeology hydrology and land use of the surat cma are described in detail by ogia 2016 2019 and summarised by rochford et al 2022 in this paper only key background information necessary for interpreting the results here presented is provided the basin is a multilayered hydrogeological complex comprising alternating bands of higher permeability sandstones and lower permeability mudstones and siltstones overlain by alluvial sediments and volcanics there are eight main units used as water supply aquifers the agriculture sector is the dominant user of groundwater in the surat cma with groundwater the only reliable source of water for many graziers cattle grazing is the dominant land use approximately 70 of the surat cma and generally occurs on large properties 1810 ha on average but may be up to 50 000 ha many of which are remote from townships and not connected to town water there are an estimated 18 840 stock and domestic bores within the case study area fig 1a stock and domestic bores are used to water livestock for normal household purposes including potable supply and to water a garden around the homestead rainfall and runoff in the surat cma are highly variable and consequently many of the rivers and streams in the area are ephemeral the climate is sub tropical with high rates of evaporation fig 1b and most rainfall occurring in the summer months fig 1c average total annual rainfall for metered properties in the surat cma ranges from 285 to 1320 millimetres per year mm a 1 our metering program was undertaken during average rainfall years 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and dry rainfall years 2018 2019 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 where a rainfall year is from 1 july to 30 june to align with water years for groundwater management 1 july to 30 june fig 1b 2 2 groundwater extraction metering program of the 18 840 stock and domestic bores in the surat cma ogia 2019 less than 0 1 are metered several studies have highlighted the need for more targeted metering to validate extraction estimates and reduce uncertainties keir et al 2019 kent et al 2020 singh et al 2020 to address this a program of voluntary metering of groundwater extractions from stock and domestic bores was implemented in the surat cma from december 2015 to may 2021 over the course of the program 54 stock and domestic bores on cattle grazing properties spread throughout the surat cma were metered bores were selected for metering to represent the range of conditions in the study area including climate and source aquifer which varied based on location in the study area property size bore depth pump type power source and business size and ownership the properties selected for metering were also diverse in terms of farming system irrigated mixed crop livestock system vs non irrigated mixed crop livestock system vs cattle grazing system grazing strategy continuous vs set stocking vs rotational vs tactical availability of surface water sources bore operation and water storage infrastructure the selection process is further discussed in rochford et al 2022 many bore owners opted to participate in the program on a confidential basis due to privacy concerns and as such data presented in this paper are de identified and the locations of monitoring sites are not disclosed agreements with 12 participants have allowed data for 21 bores to be shared data were collected using ultrasonic time transit flow meters which clamp to the outside of the bore discharge pipe and digital data loggers to record high resolution time series of groundwater extraction field visits were conducted approximately annually to download data from the meters and conduct maintenance checks on the meters rochford et al 2022 provide details of the metering program 2 3 collection of data on the potential factors influencing groundwater extraction 2 3 1 analytical disaggregation of groundwater extraction to guide data collection within the study area stock and domestic bores are authorised under the queensland water act 2000 to provide water for grazing stock for household purposes and to water a garden not exceeding 0 5 ha other purposes may be authorised in some cases e g for dust suppression for gas field operations landholders in the study area also used water from stock and domestic bores for weed spraying water taken from a stock and domestic bore without a licence

from a bore may be restricted by supply limitations sl related to bore construction target formation for the bore pump capacity and distribution system capacity details of each of these components are in table 1 including their potential explanatory variables 2 3 2 landholder interviews the site visits in april and may 2019 august 2020 and may 2021 included semi structured interviews with bore owners or property managers for 42 bores the purpose of the interviews was to gather quantitative and qualitative data to inform analysis of the factors influencing groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use where face to face interviews were not possible telephone interviews were conducted the interviews included using property maps compiled using publicly available data and pre planned open and closed questions to guide the conversation but discussions were kept open enough to allow landholders to discuss other matters they considered important following approaches in comparable studies in other countries o keeffe et al 2016 the data collected included bore purpose cattle breed cattle numbers accessing water from the bore paddocks with access to bore water and the availability of other water sources the data provided were for the period since the previous survey the survey sheets used during the interviews in 2019 2020 and 2021 are included in supplementary material a a summary of the data gathered through the interviews is provided in table 2 2 3 3 other data sources the data gathered through the metering program and interviews were supplemented with data from publicly available sources as listed in table 3 2 4 data analysis the data analysis used multiple linear regression to identify the explanatory variables that were both statistically significant and consistent with knowledge from literature review and the interviews data and statistical analyses were undertaken using rstudio 4 1 1 rstudio team 2021 with packages mass 7 3 54 venables and ripley 2002 and glmnet 4 1 4 friedman et al 2010 analysis was undertaken at the bore scale as opposed to aggregating bores to property or grid scale this was done to increase data availability and because analysis at the bore scale is more relevant for aquifer management in this area as bores may tap different formations within a property 2 4 1 metered extraction data to create a dataset useful for analysis it was necessary to review the quality of the metered data and post process the data to remove anomalous readings or statistically impute missing values the data were then aggregated from the original sub daily time step typically hourly to an annual water year 1 july to 30 june time step where groundwater extraction data were missing for more than a third of days in a water year the data were excluded from the analysis where fewer data were missing in a water year average daily groundwater extraction for that year was used to infill after post processing to remove spurious data and infill data gaps groundwater extraction data were available for 48 stock and domestic bores over 161 annual water year periods the period of metered extraction data available for each bore varied from one to five water years the approach used to post process the extraction data is detailed in rochford et al 2022 2 4 2 selection of the candidate explanatory variables candidate explanatory variables for the data analysis table 4 were selected for each component of groundwater extraction in table 1 based on knowledge from literature review and the interviews cattle numbers were expressed as adult equivalents aes using interview data on cattle numbers accessing groundwater from each bore cattle breed weight age and breeding status ae is a standard measure of cattle grazing loads in northern australia the methodology for calculating ae was developed by mclean and blakely 2014 and calculates the energy demand of cattle based on animal specific variables the calculated energy demand is expressed relative to the energy demand of the ae standard unit which is a 450 kg bos taurus steer at maintenance the whole herd model developed by mclean and blakely 2014 was used to estimate average ae for each property during each water year none of the metered properties held licences to access surface water all properties had small farm dams that collect runoff however some properties also had other water sources that could be accessed for stock and domestic purposes including permanent surface water sources such as spring fed streams waterholes or dams large dams that collect runoff semi permanent surface water sources such as semi permanent streams and waterholes or melon holes small depressions in the landscape that collect water after rain where multiple water sources were available at the property the most permanent source that could be accessed by cattle was attributed to the property as the main other water source root zone soil moisture was used as an indicator of pasture quality with higher root zone soil moisture considered indicative of better pasture quality and the presence or absence of exclusion fences was used as an indicator of potential water consumption by native and feral animals type of water storage infrastructure was used to assess whether evaporative and or seepage losses may be factors as evaporative losses may be expected from open dams turkey s nests and open tanks and seepage losses may be expected from turkey s nests the metered bores were recorded as either sub artesian artesian ceased to flow artesian condition unknown or flowing artesian with controlled flow and had piped distribution the bores recorded as artesian ceased to flow and artesian condition unknown were grouped together with the flowing artesian bores as they were assessed to have relatively higher pressures than sub artesian bores there were no uncontrolled flowing artesian bores or open bore drains on metered properties water quality was excluded from the analysis due to insufficient data bore yield was omitted for the same reason although associated variables aquifer pressure and transmissivity were included distribution pipework channel losses dpl such as leaking headworks pipes or tanks and operational losses opl such as over pumping were also excluded as only limited data were provided through the interviews 2 4 3 univariate analysis a preliminary exploration of the factors contributing to the spatial and temporal variation in annual groundwater extraction at the bore scale was undertaken by plotting key variables against groundwater extraction megalitres per bore and groundwater extraction per head megalitres per adult equivalent ml ae 1 supplemented by statistical tests the strength of these relationships were used to prioritise the variable selection in the subsequent multiple regression section 2 4 6 chatterjee and hadi 2012 efroymson 1960 hastie et al 2009 the statistical tests included linear regression modelling for continuous and discrete variables and one way analysis of variance anova fisher 1992 with a tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test tukey 1949 for categorical variables prior to statistical testing data were assessed for normal distribution using residual plots a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 of extraction and extraction per head was applied to maximise normality of the residuals for statistical analysis 2 4 4 multicollinearity multicollinearity was assessed for continuous and discrete variables before modelling using pearson s correlation coefficients schober et al 2018 where variables were highly correlated with one another 0 75 the least correlated with groundwater extraction was excluded from the multiple regression analysis all other variables were added to the multiple regression as potential explanatory variables in the order guided by the univariate analysis variance inflation factors vifs were used to assess correlation for categorical variables after modelling and where vif 5 one of the variables was removed from the analysis chatterjee and hadi 2012 2 4 5 interactions to assess whether interaction terms might be important to include in multiple regression potential interactions between variables were assessed using interaction plots hastie et al 2009 together with statistical testing the statistical tests included linear regression modelling for continuous and discrete variables and two way anova fisher 1992 yates 1934 for categorical variables prior to statistical testing data were assessed for normal distribution using residual plots a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 of extraction was applied to maximise normality of the residuals for statistical analysis selected interactions were included in the multiple regression analysis based on the findings of the interviews interaction plots and statistical tests 2 4 6 multiple regression a multiple linear regression model was fitted using stepwise selection involving a combination of forward and backward selections efroymson 1960 the purpose of the model was not prediction rather the purpose was statistical testing to identify significant explanatory variables prior to modelling data were assessed for normality using residual plots a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 of extraction was applied to maximise normality of the residuals for statistical analysis modelling was undertaken using rstudio 4 1 1 with package glmnet version 4 1 4 all variables and the selected interactions were included in the model starting with the variables identified as most significant based on p values through the univariate analysis chatterjee and hadi 2012 hastie et al 2009 a target p value of 0 05 was used for the regression with variables and interactions between variables removed where p 0 05 the results of the stepwise selection were compared with those of a lasso least absolute shrinkage and subset selection operator regression tibshirani 1996 to test sensitivity to the regression approach lasso is useful for variable selection where parsimony is an objective hastie et al 2015 and is often considered more reliable than stepwise regression and all subsets variable selection for datasets with many parameters and small sample sizes dahlgren 2010 before analysis all continuous and discrete variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation leave one out cross validation was undertaken to find the optimal value of the regularisation parameter lambda and to evaluate prediction error cross validation is a resampling method that uses different portions of the data over multiple iterations to test the model s ability to predict the data that was not used in estimating it lambda 1se the value of lambda that gives the most regularized model such that the cross validated error is within one standard error of the minimum was selected in preference to lambda min the value of lambda that gives the minimum cross validated error to provide for parsimony hastie et al 2015 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal variation in annual groundwater extraction volumes 3 1 1 bore scale variation in annual groundwater extraction annual groundwater extraction from metered bores ranged from 0 2 to 24 6 megalitres per water year ml a 1 during the monitoring period fig 2 the measurements show significant variation in the annual volume of groundwater extracted at different bores in addition there was inter annual variation in volumes extracted at some bores while extraction was relatively stable year to year at other bores noting differences in the number of years of available metered extraction

including weed spraying and dust suppression mean annual groundwater extraction for stock bores was 3 9 ml a 1 compared with 6 9 ml a 1 for bores used for stock and domestic purposes 8 0 ml a 1 for bores used for stock domestic and garden purposes and 7 1 ml a 1 for bores used for stock and other purposes including weed spraying and dust suppression fig 3 a statistical analysis indicates strong evidence of differences between bores used only for stock and bores used for stock domestic and garden p 0 001 and bores used only for stock and bores used for stock and other purposes p 0 006 there is weaker evidence of a difference between bores used only for stock and those used for stock and domestic p 0 3 linear regression modelling indicated strong evidence of a relationship between annual groundwater extraction and cattle numbers p 0 001 groundwater extraction from stock and domestic bores increased with cattle number by approximately 0 0053 ml a 1 ae 1 fig 3b there was no difference in annual extraction per bore for properties that were breeding compared with properties that were backgrounding p 0 96 however properties that were both breeding and backgrounding had higher extraction than properties that were solely breeding p 0 004 or backgrounding p 0 015 these data are not presented in the figures annual groundwater extraction per head was lower for properties with

approximately 0 001 ml a 1 ae 1for every 100 mm increase in annual rainfall fig 4 c there was also evidence that water consumption rates increased with annual evaporation p 0 11 and average daily maximum air temperature p 0 07 statistical analysis indicated no evidence of a difference in annual groundwater extraction per head of cattle during the monitoring period based on the availability of other water sources fig 4d linear regression modelling indicated a relationship between annual groundwater extraction per head and root zone soil moisture p 0 07 with extraction decreasing by approximately 0 005 ml a 1 ae 1 for every 10 increase in root zone soil moisture during the monitoring period water extraction rates per head were lower for cattle with access to cultivation as a source of feed than cattle that did not have access to cultivation p 0 001 fig 4e 3 2 2 losses the bores distributing to closed tanks had the lowest median extraction rate per head of the three type of water storages fig 4 f however the statistical significance of the differences was low p 0 98 3 2 3 supply limitations statistical analysis indicates strong evidence of a difference in annual extraction for sub artesian bores compared to flowing artesian bores with controlled flow and bores that were previously artesian but have ceased to flow fig 5a p 0 001 no evidence of a difference in annual extraction was observed for bores tapping formations across the four higher classes of transmissivity 10 20 50 and 300 m d 1 and the statistical significance of the two way differences with

windmill bores compared to bores with other types of pumps p 0 001 and suggest there may be a difference in extraction for solar bores compared to electric bores and flowing artesian bores p 0 18 fig 5b there was weak evidence of a difference in annual groundwater extraction based on the bore operation manual timer or float p 0 18 3 3 multicollinearity assessment of multicollinearity found that property area was highly correlated with head of cattle r2 0 91 and root zone soil moisture and annual evaporation were highly correlated with annual rainfall r2 0 78 and 0 76 respectively property area root zone soil moisture and annual evaporation were excluded from multiple regression analysis pump type was removed from analysis due to collinearity with bore purpose vif 9 8 3 4 interactions statistical testing indicated that head of cattle had interactions with bore purpose and annual rainfall as well as factors that influence how much groundwater cattle drink cattle breed grazing strategy daily maximum air temperature root zone soil moisture use of cultivation as a source of feed and availability of other water sources and factors with the potential to limit supply aquifer pressure aquifer transmissivity pump type and bore operation this means that the effect of cattle numbers on groundwater extraction depends on these variables which is intuitive interview results suggested potential interactions between annual rainfall and bore purpose the availability of other water sources use of cultivation as a source of feed and type of cattle operation however these were not found to be significant in the data analysis p 0 15 interactions between categorical variables were difficult to assess as limited data were available for some categories the interaction between head of cattle and bore purpose is shown in fig 6 a for stock bores annual groundwater extraction during the monitoring period increased by approximately 0 0039 ml ae 1 whereas for bores used for stock domestic garden and other purposes annual extraction increased by 0 007 ml ae 1 the linear regression model for stock bores suggests an average loss through evaporation seepage distribution pipework and operational losses of 1 4 ml a 1 although this may vary depending on property size the difference between the two models suggests groundwater extraction for domestic garden and other purposes ranges between 1 0 ml a 1 at properties with low cattle numbers 100 ae and 8 8 ml a 1 at properties with high cattle numbers 2400 ae assuming an average loss of 1 4 ml a 1 the interaction between head of cattle and annual rainfall category is shown in fig 6b the increase in groundwater extraction with head of cattle was lower during average years compared with dry years the increase in groundwater extraction with head of cattle was lowest for wet years however interpretation was somewhat limited by the small number of properties that experienced wet conditions during the monitoring period 3 5 multiple regression modelling multiple regression analysis found evidence p 0 05 that annual groundwater extraction from stock and domestic bores is influenced by head of cattle with access to bore water ae bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure of the target formation for the bore total annual rainfall at the property the model had an adjusted r2 value of 78 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 77 ml a 1 the regression equation coefficients are in table 5 comparison of the results to those of the lasso regression indicated that all variables included in the stepwise model were included in the lasso model with the exception of total annual rainfall no additional variables were included in the lasso model based on a lambda 1se value of 0 015 3 6 spatial and temporal variation for key parameters head of cattle accessing bore water were lowest in 2018 19 and 2019 20 for all types of cattle operations noting differences in the number of properties for which data are available fig 7 a linear regression modelling indicated there may be a relationship between annual rainfall and cattle numbers p 0 12 with cattle numbers increasing by 106 ae for every 100 mm of rainfall on average there was significant variation in total annual rainfall at metered properties during the monitoring period p 0 001 with lowest rainfall recorded in 2018 19 and 2019 20 fig 7b annual rainfall varied across the study area with a difference of up to 495 mm recorded for properties participating in the metering program in the 2017 18 water year fig 7b the purpose of some bores varied from year to year depending on the availability of other water sources e g during dry years some properties used groundwater for domestic or garden purposes as surface water sources were not available the type of water storage infrastructure used and the pressure of the target formation for the bore artesian vs sub artesian did not vary at the metered properties during the monitoring period 4 discussion 4 1 bore scale analysis of factors influencing annual groundwater extraction annual groundwater extraction from metered stock and domestic bores varied spatially across the surat cma and temporally at individual bores from year to year minimum 0 2 ml a 1 maximum 24 6 ml a 1 multiple regression analysis found strong evidence that of the 18 factors and 12 interactions assessed variation in groundwater extraction at the bore scale could be explained by 5 factors head of cattle bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure and total annual rainfall despite interaction plots and statistical analysis suggesting that interactions between head of cattle and other variables may be significant for groundwater extraction no interactions were identified as significant in the multiple regression analysis 4 1 1 head of cattle accessing bore water head of cattle accessing bore water was identified as the most significant factor influencing groundwater extraction and is closely correlated with property area r2 0 91 cattle numbers were lowest during dry rainfall years 2018 19 and 2019 20 for all types of cattle operations fig 7a and showed a declining trend with declining rainfall this variation in cattle numbers with rainfall reflects how graziers manage cattle numbers on their properties to prevent overgrazing finch et al 2014 sandhage hofmann 2016 interview data indicates backgrounders in the study area were flexible in how they managed stock numbers on their properties and destocked during dry periods most breeders noted a preference for maintaining their herd breeding core during dry conditions including through hand feeding cattle and would reduce grazing pressure by selling young cattle earlier than normal however during the drought in 2018 19 and 2019 20 some landholders reported loss death of breeding stock and some breeding properties needed to destock because the drought was so widespread and the normal options of agisting sending cattle to another property for a period or sending cattle on travelling stock routes were not available to them the lower cattle numbers may explain why there was no significant difference in groundwater extraction for dry rainfall years compared to average rainfall years at the study area scale fig 2 even though per head groundwater extraction increased with declining rainfall fig 4c although climatic conditions and the associated variation in pasture growth are likely to be key factors influencing stocking rates leweri et al 2021 mckeon et al 2021 stone et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 other factors are also expected to influence spatial and temporal variation in head of cattle within the study area including farmer attitudes to land management market conditions attitudes to risk business size and dependence of the enterprise on maintaining the herd breeding core mcivor 2010 stone et al 2021 understanding the factors driving variation in stocking rates is relevant for making projections of future groundwater extraction rates and will be explored in a separate paper 4 1 2 annual rainfall annual rainfall was also identified as an important factor in addition to influencing pasture condition and therefore capacity of properties to keep cattle leweri et al 2021 mckeon 1990 rainfall influences how much water cattle consume and the availability of other water sources ahlberg et al 2018 csiro 2007 malan et al 2020 winchester and morris 1956 water consumption by cattle and reliance on groundwater sources is expected to be higher during periods of low rainfall due to drier poorer quality pasture csiro 2007 and limited availability of surface water sources csiro 2007 malan et al 2020 as shown in fig 4c groundwater extraction per head was higher when rainfall was lower the converse is expected for wet years however further monitoring is required to confirm this 4 1 3 other important factors other factors identified as significant through the multiple regression include bore purpose and bore pressure groundwater extraction was lowest for bores used only to water stock and highest for bores used for stock domestic and garden purposes indicating that distinguishing bore purpose may be important for estimation methods bore pressure may also be important for estimation methods with analysis indicating that groundwater extraction from sub artesian bores was lower than flowing artesian bores and bores that were previously artesian but had ceased to flow this may be explained by flowing artesian bores and former artesian bores being more productive and less expensive to operate than sub artesian bores due to the lesser requirement to pump which has associated energy costs although evaporative losses from on farm storages in australia are understood to be large baillie 2008 ridoutt et al 2012 the independent effects of evaporation could not be assessed independently due to collinearity with rainfall however type of water storage infrastructure was identified as an important factor through the multiple regression with the results indicating groundwater extraction was lower for bores that distribute to closed tanks and higher for bores that distribute to turkey s nests suggesting evaporation and seepage from water storage infrastructure may be important factors tanks are generally smaller in capacity than turkey s nests and so there may be some effect related to bores with lower yields and lower demands using tanks for water storage the results suggest water storage infrastructure may be an important consideration for water conservation and estimation methods 4 1 4 factors not identified as significant all of the metered properties had small farm dams that collect runoff however some properties also had other water sources including permanent waterholes ephemeral streams large dams and melon holes the availability of other water sources was not identified as a factor influencing groundwater extraction this may be related to the monitoring period occurring during dry and average rainfall years and because temporal data on the availability of other water sources were not included in the analysis per head groundwater extraction rates were estimated at 0 008 ml a 1 ae 1 on average which is lower than studies of cattle water consumption that indicate average per head consumption rates between 0 009 and 0 022 ml a 1 ae 1 alsemgeest and zuino 2002 brew et al 2011 winchester and morris 1956 this suggests surface water sources such as small farm dams water contained in pasture and other feed csiro 2007 nsw department of primary industries 2014 and water on pasture e g dew csiro 2007 may represent between 16 and 65 of water consumption by cattle in the study area this is consistent with the findings of landholder interviews undertaken by parsons brinckerhoff 2011 for shallow groundwater systems in the study area which indicated between 22 and 53 of water demand for stock and domestic purposes was met by surface water sources univariate analysis indicated a difference in groundwater extraction per head based on cattle breed with average per head extraction for bos indicus cattle estimated at 0 005 ml a 1 ae 1 compared with 0 011 ml a 1 ae 1 for cross breed cattle and 0 021 ml a 1 ae 1 for bos taurus cattle this is consistent with research that has shown bos indicus breeds of asian origin are more tolerant of heat and consume less water than bos taurus breeds of european origin brew et al 2011 winchester and morris 1956 and indicates that cattle breed may be an important consideration for water conservation initiatives in the area despite its clear effect cattle breed was not identified as an important factor through the multiple regression it is understood this is because cattle breed was a variable used to standardise cattle numbers between properties using the methodology to calculate adult equivalent by mclean and blakely 2014 and so it is implicit in the regression inputs univariate analysis also indicated a difference in groundwater extraction per head based on whether cattle had access to cultivation as a source of feed this reflects the findings of the study by barsotti et al 2022 which concluded that freshwater consumption related to beef cattle is lower in mixed crop livestock systems than in grazing systems which may be related to feed quality or cultivation occurring in areas of higher rainfall despite this cultivation was not identified as a significant factor in the multiple regression possibly due to the monitoring period occurring during dry and average rainfall years when non irrigated cultivation was less successful or not attempted the interviews noted an increasing trend towards the installation of exclusion fences with some around the entire property and others along on a boundary bordering bushland exclusion fences are installed to reduce overgrazing of pasture predation of calves and the introduction of weeds and diseases by native and feral animals giumelli and white 2016 one landholder noted more than a 50 reduction in the number of hours the bore needed to be pumped after installing exclusion fences however statistical analysis of data from the metered bores did not indicate a general difference in extraction per head based on the presence or absence of exclusion fences p 0 64 and this was not a factor identified through the multiple regression it is interpreted that while there may be local cases of fences preventing significant water take by native and feral animals such water consumption is generally minor compared with consumption by cattle aquifer transmissivity and bore operation were not identified as factors influencing groundwater extraction these factors were included in the analysis because there may be potential for them to limit the supply of water from the bore and therefore essentially put a cap on extraction the univariate analysis suggested that this is not the case with no evidence of a difference in groundwater extraction between the transmissivity classes except possibly the lowest transmissivity class of 2 m d 1 although limited data are available for this class or based on bore operation float manual or timer pump type was not included in the multiple regression due to collinearity with bore purpose however the univariate results indicate groundwater extraction from windmill driven bores was significantly lower than for other bores p 0 001 windmill bores in the study area are typically older and shallower than bores that use diesel electric and solar pumps which may explain the difference 4 2 regional scale variation in annual groundwater extraction groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use at the regional scale did not vary significantly from year to year fig 2 despite significant variation in annual rainfall ranging from 352 mm to 567 mm at the regional scale during the monitoring period fig 7b based on the bore scale results it is interpreted that cattle water consumption reliance on groundwater sources and evaporative losses were higher during periods of low rainfall however because many graziers reduced cattle numbers to prevent overgrazing during these dry periods there was little difference in extraction observed from year to year at the regional scale further monitoring during wet rainfall years is required to confirm whether this applies across the range of climatic conditions other factors may also be important at the regional scale in addition to rainfall such as spatial variation in hydrogeological conditions or parameters affecting pasture condition and require further investigation 4 3 limitations a key objective of this study was to characterise spatial and temporal variability in groundwater extraction and improve understanding of the factors driving groundwater extraction for cattle grazing the analysis used data from 54 bores that were selected to be as representative of the range of climatic and hydrogeological conditions in the study area as possible rochford et al 2022 and to reflect the diversity in farm practice nevertheless there is potential for selection bias associated with those willing to participate in the study which needs to be considered when applying the results for the development of estimation methods an imbalance in the available data for some categorical variables due to the properties selected may also have influenced the results for example only three properties that were exclusively backgrounding were included in the metering program while it might be expected that backgrounding properties would have lower groundwater extraction during dry years related to the flexibility of these operations to destock mcivor 2010 this was not identified as an effect the multiple regression analysis did not assess the independent effects of evaporation soil moisture property area and pump type due to their collinearity with other variables furthermore the effects of water quality bore yield distribution pipework channel losses and operational losses could not be explored due to insufficient data literature review has suggested these factors may be important for water consumption by cattle and groundwater extraction ahlberg et al 2018 csiro 2007 malan et al 2020 parsons brinckerhoff 2011 winchester and morris 1956 there is potential that should it become possible to collect the necessary data future analysis may find these factors to be significant the duration and timing of the metering program may also limit the findings the metering program was conducted over a five year period during dry and average rainfall years which has potentially influenced the significance of some variables in particular the availability of other water sources and the use of cultivation as a source of feed which are both highly reliant on rainfall and may have more effect during wet years metering over a longer period to collect extraction data for wet years may find these factors to be significant the applicability of the results to other regions is questionable the surat cma is mostly semi arid with high rates of evaporation 1800 to 2500 mm and summer dominated rainfall keir et al 2019 aquifers in the area are generally productive enough to meet stock and domestic demand and the land use is predominantly cattle grazing due to the climate and terrain keir et al 2019 broadly speaking similar climate hydrogeological environment land use and terrain exist across much of the area underlain by the great artesian basin 1 700 000 km2 dcceew 2018 and it is reasonable to suggest that the results can be cautiously applied to these regions due to the potential importance of climate surface and groundwater access and pasture condition it is not recommended to rely on the results for other regions in australia or globally however the methodology employed in this paper for using voluntary metering and interviews to understand groundwater extractions is of broad relevance and value 4 4 future work multiple regression was used as the main data analysis method in this work including consideration of categorical discrete and continuous variables and their interactions various more powerful data analysis methods were considered including artificial neural networks malekian and chitsaz 2021 walczak and cerpa 2003 yang 2009 however with a total of only 5 years and 42 sites compared to the typically much larger datasets used when applying such methods it is unlikely that they would provide additional insight potential future work could include looking at daily scale variability of extraction rates for which the signals would be more complex and the dataset would be much larger in that case methods more powerful than linear regression may be appropriate ongoing metering to capture a wet period including collecting interview data for the explanatory variables assessed in this paper is recommended to improve understanding of the variability in groundwater extraction under a range of conditions and to assess the significance of factors related to rainfall including the availability of other water sources and the use of cultivation as a source of feed the results of this study provide the basis for development of lower cost and more reliable methods for estimating groundwater extraction at the 99 9 of stock and domestic bores in the study area that are not metered further work is needed to consider how the bore scale extraction data and priority variables could be used to improve existing methods or develop new estimation methods there are significant challenges in doing so as publicly available datasets are either not available for factors identified as significant including head of cattle accessing bore water and type of water storage infrastructure or do not provide sufficient up to date detail including bore purpose and aquifer pressure obtaining data on the priority variables may require the application of modelling or remote sensing approaches head of cattle accessing bore water was identified as the most significant factor influencing groundwater extraction however data on head of cattle are not typically available and methods for estimating groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use need to either derive estimates of head of cattle or use other predictors as indicators of head of cattle a number of factors that may influence head of cattle were identified through this study including property size type of cattle operation farmer attitudes to land management and market conditions literature review indicates other factors may also be important including air temperature and pasture condition leweri et al 2021 mckeon 1990 future research could use the cattle number data collected through the interviews to develop a model to predict head of cattle using publicly available datasets on potentially important factors alternatively methods for assessing sustainable stocking rates could be used as a proxy for actual rates zhang et al 2021 5 conclusions the paper reported the first empirical study of factors affecting groundwater extraction volumes in cattle grazing regions facilitated by a 5 year voluntary metering program in the semi arid surat cumulative management area in southern queensland australia at the bore scale groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use varied spatially across the region ranging from 0 2 to 24 6 ml a 1 and from year to year at some bores multiple regression analysis assessed 18 variables and 12 interactions and found strong evidence that variation in groundwater extraction at the bore scale could be explained by 5 factors head of cattle bore purpose type of water storage infrastructure aquifer pressure and total annual rainfall together these factors explained more than 78 of the variance of the annual extraction estimates ongoing metering is needed to capture a wet period so the significance of variables related to rainfall including the availability of other water sources and the use of cultivation as a source of feed can be assessed at the regional scale groundwater extraction for stock and domestic use did not vary significantly from year to year despite significant variation in annual rainfall it is interpreted that while cattle water consumption reliance on groundwater sources and evaporative losses were higher during periods of low rainfall the reduction in cattle numbers during these periods meant there was little difference in extraction observed from year to year at the regional scale further monitoring during a wet period is required to confirm whether this applies across the range of climatic conditions the results of this study provide water managers with a basis for estimating extraction at the 99 9 of stock and domestic bores in the surat cma that are not metered the results also provide an indication of the priority variables to explore when developing methods for estimating groundwater extraction in other comparable regions further work is needed to consider how the extraction data and priority variables could be used to estimate stock and domestic use in the surat cma and other regions the results also provide evidence that cattle breed and water storage infrastructure are important considerations for improving water efficiency in grazing systems these findings may be important for water managers and graziers in future as they seek to improve water
