19995,water pollution by pharmaceuticals is widespread causing both environmental and human health risks we assess pharmaceutical water pollution from human and veterinary pharmaceuticals at three geographical levels global national considering germany and the netherlands and catchment level with a case study for the vecht catchment shared by germany and the netherlands the grey water footprint gwf a measure of water pollution in volumetric terms is estimated from pharmaceutical loads entering the aquatic environment considering different pollutant sources and pathways we study different substances depending on data availability which varies across geographical levels results show a global per capita gwf of 1900 m3 yr 1 resulting from human consumption of ciprofloxacin the largest gwfs in both germany and the netherlands were found for ethinylestradiol for human and amoxicillin for veterinary use the estimated per capita gwf from human use of ethinylestradiol is 2300 m3 yr 1 for germany and 11 300 m3 yr 1 for the netherlands the per capita gwfs of german and dutch consumers of animal products are 12 900 and 10 600 m3 yr 1 respectively for the vecht catchment we estimate the water pollution level per sub catchment by comparing the gwf to available runoff which enables us to identify geographic hotspots in the basin as a whole gwfs from human and veterinary pharmaceuticals both exceed available runoff at all levels pharmaceutical water pollution substantially adds to earlier water footprint studies that excluded this type of pollution which demonstrates the importance to include pharmaceutics in water footprint studies keywords grey water footprint water pollution pharmaceuticals human health livestock manure units kg yr 1 kilogram per year kg m 3 kilogram per cubic metre kg day 1 kilogram per day kg ha 1 yr 1 kilogram per hectare per year m3 yr 1 cubic metre per year m3 animal 1 cubic metre per animal m3 km 2 cubic metre per square kilometre μg l 1 microgram per litre 1 introduction worldwide about 600 pharmaceutical compounds and transformation products from pharmaceuticals have been traced in the aquatic environment aus der beek et al 2015 exposure to pharmaceuticals has led to ecotoxicological effects on various species such as vultures fish frogs and duckweed aus der beek et al 2015 sumpter 2010 which has resulted in serious concerns especially regarding drinking water risks who 2012 and antimicrobial resistance who 2014 urban wastewater discharge is generally regarded the dominant source of pharmaceuticals in water whereas discharge from manufacturing hospitals animal husbandry and aquaculture can be important locally aus der beek et al 2015 human and veterinary pharmaceuticals enter the aquatic environment via distinct pathways kümmerer 2008a fig 1 illustrates sources and pathways of pharmaceutical residues to freshwater resources considered in this study pharmaceuticals are designed to cure people and animals or diagnose or prevent diseases they have a precise function within target bodies the administered dose is rarely entirely decomposed by the body substantial fractions are generally excreted mainly via urine winker et al 2008 the excreted fractions of human pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are mostly discharged into the sewer system hughes et al 2013 and enter the receiving water body as point source in the case of livestock manure from treated animals collected in liquid solid or mixed form weinfurtner 2011 contains pharmaceutical residues and will generally be applied to crop fields or grasslands as fertilizer kümmerer 2008b a fraction of the pharmaceuticals thus brought onto land will leach to groundwater or reach open water through surface runoff boxall 2008 thus forming a diffuse source of pollution this study uses the grey water footprint gwf concept to assess water pollution by pharmaceuticals from households hospitals and animal husbandry considering different pathways the gwf indicates the volume of water required to assimilate pollutant loads to acceptable concentrations hoekstra et al 2011 despite water footprint research since 2002 hoekstra 2017 investigation of the gwf related to pharmaceuticals is in its infancy there has been extensive research into the gwf related to the use of fertilizers liu et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 2018 and pesticides gil et al 2017 lamastra et al 2014 vale et al 2019 but only one case study on the gwf of human pharmaceutical use has been published martinez alcala et al 2018 there have been various efforts to estimate pharmaceutical loads to freshwater alder et al 2010 ter laak et al 2010 winker et al 2008 and to monitor concentrations of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and in streams hirsch et al 1999 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 ternes 1998 none of the previous studies took a perspective as we undertake in the current study translating the loads of both human and veterinary pharmaceuticals to water into a gwf and putting this gwf in the context of the limited assimilation capacity of freshwater systems the objective is to gain insight in the gwf of pharmaceuticals from different sources and explore which of the selected substances and emission pathways are most influential and what parameters are most important the gwf is quantified and spatially mapped distinguishing between gwfs related to households and hospitals and different types of livestock farming gwfs are thereby expressed as polluted water volumes per area but also per community per person and per unit of animal product meat milk egg the results are compared with the gwf of other pollutants and thus add a useful extension to the assessment of the overall wf of human society we consider the gwf of pharmaceuticals at three spatial levels in a global analysis for two substances we obtain a global picture of the severity of water pollution through pharmaceuticals at national level we estimate and contrast pharmaceutical pollution in two countries germany and the netherlands for a range of substances and compare the gwf per person related to direct pharmaceutical use to the gwf per person from the consumption of animal products in the supply chain of which veterinary pharmaceuticals were used in a detailed high resolution analysis at river basin level for the vecht catchment shared by germany and the netherlands we identify local hotspots of water pollution through pharmaceuticals we estimate the potential effect of the gwf per sub catchment by calculating the water pollution level wpl as the ratio of the gwf to catchment runoff 2 methods and data 2 1 geographical levels of analysis at global level where data on pharmaceutical use are extremely limited we estimate the pollution from human use of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin using data on loads emitted to the aquatic environment from oldenkamp et al 2019 at national level environmental loads and related gwfs are estimated for germany ge and the netherlands nl both for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals regarding human pharmaceuticals substances from several therapeutic groups are included whereas the selection of veterinary pharmaceuticals is limited to antibiotics details on the substance selection are included in the supplementary information si the basin level study for the vecht catchment vc considers the same substances as on the national level a detailed description of the catchment is in the si 2 2 grey water footprint and water pollution level water footprint wf assessment is a method to quantify consumptive as well as degradative freshwater use the consumptive wf refers to the consumption of rainwater green wf and groundwater or surface water blue wf the degradative wf called the grey wf hoekstra et al 2011 refers to the volume of water that is required to assimilate pollutants which is the volume of water needed to dilute pollutants to the extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above water quality standards franke et al 2013 the gwf m3 yr 1 is defined as the load of pollutant l kg yr 1 divided by the difference between the maximum allowed concentration c max kg m 3 and the natural background concentration c nat kg m 3 hoekstra et al 2011 for pharmaceuticals considered here c nat is zero the gwf is estimated separately for different substances the overall resultant gwf is equal to the largest gwf across the examined contaminants hoekstra et al 2011 we estimate gwfs on a temporal scale of one year the water pollution level wpl in a basin or sub catchment is defined as the ratio of the gwf m3 yr 1 to the catchment s runoff r m3 yr 1 hoekstra et al 2011 wpl 1 indicates that ambient water quality standards are violated wpl is estimated in the vecht case study on annual basis per sub catchment runoff precipitation minus evaporation is estimated from data at a resolution of 1 km2 for the reference period 1961 1990 bfg 2019 and extrapolated to the dutch part of the catchment as climatic and hydrological conditions are comparable 2 3 human pharmaceutical loads following modelling approaches presented by e g alder et al 2010 and ter laak et al 2010 pharmaceutical loads entering the aquatic environment as point sources are estimated as 1 l h s f e 1 f r where l h kg yr 1 is the load of a specific human pharmaceutical to water s kg yr 1 the sales of the pharmaceutical in a defined geographical area f e the excreted fraction and f r the fraction removed by wastewater treatment pharmacy sales are obtained on national and vc level for ge and nl data on pharmaceutical use in hospitals is collected from hospital pharmacies in the vc substance specific input values for excreted pharmaceutical fractions and removed fractions in wastewater treatment plants are retrieved from scientific literature si 2 4 veterinary pharmaceutical loads veterinary pharmaceutical loads are estimated separately for beef cattle dairy cattle pigs broiler and laying hens for ge and nl as a whole and for the vc the main emission pathways via direct excretion of grazing animals and indirect manure collection and application emissions were considered boxall 2008 aggregated loads per pharmaceutical and livestock type are defined as 2 l t i l d i m l i n i m where l t i kg yr 1 is the total load of a specific veterinary pharmaceutical from livestock type i l d i kg yr 1 the load from manure directly emitted to pasture land and l in i m kg yr 1 the indirect load from manure type m liquid or solid applied to fields after temporary storage following descriptions by boxall et al 2004 direct loads are estimated as 3 l d i 365 a i f e f d i where a kg day 1 is the administered substance per day f e the excreted fraction and f d the fraction directly emitted to pasture land the pharmaceutical load from manure that has been stored before application to fields is estimated per livestock type i and manure type m liquid or solid using a first order degradation model ray et al 2017 wang and yates 2008 assuming constant production of manure over time see derivation in si 4 l i n i m 365 t i m a i f e 1 f d i f m a n i m k i m 1 e k i m t i m where 1 f d is the fraction of the daily production that is stored f man the fraction of manure type m k day 1 the degradation rate t days the duration of one storage period and 365 t the number of storage periods per year by definition k equals ln 2 divided by the half life of the substance which differs per type of manure and livestock type amounts of administered substances separately for beef cattle dairy cattle pigs broilers and laying hens are estimated based on veterinary pharmaceutical sales data for ge and nl by lack of livestock specific data we assume the same excretion fractions as in human metabolism data on pharmaceutical degradation during manure storage are obtained from literature data sources and assumptions are provided in the si pharmaceutical transport to water through leaching and runoff has been addressed through experimental trials hamscher et al 2005 kay et al 2005 ostermann et al 2013 pan and chu 2017 popova et al 2013 spielmeyer et al 2017 stoob et al 2007 modelling attempts bailey 2015 knäbel et al 2016 mackay et al 2005 and risk assessment methods cvpm 2018 menz et al 2015 but a comprehensive method applicable for the scope of this study is lacking given lack of data on decay in the soil and because pharmaceuticals from agricultural use have been found in freshwater resources under agricultural fields in ge and nl karfusehr et al 2018 kivits et al 2018 we follow here the precautionary principle by assuming that all loads applied to the field could potentially end up in freshwater this may overestimate water quality impacts given potential degradation or accumulation in the soil hannappel et al 2014 kümmerer 2008a there is great variance in mobility among different pharmaceuticals boxall 2008 plant uptake or photodegradation can occur after pharmaceuticals have been applied to the field jechalke et al 2014 we address this issue of potential overestimation in a sensitivity analysis presented in the si 2 5 limit concentrations of pharmaceuticals although the eu included pharmaceuticals in the priority substances and watch list under the water framework directive european comission 2016 2019 there are no legally binding environmental limit concentrations for pharmaceuticals barbosa et al 2016 here we take predicted no effect concentrations pnec as maximum allowed concentrations for the gwf calculations bergmann et al 2011 pnec values for the substances considered are taken from literature see si and reach from 0 00001 μg l 1 for ethinylestradiol to 60 μg l 1 for metformin bergmann et al 2011 for amantadine for which no pnec value is available we have taken 0 1 μg l 1 the threshold value for environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals suggested by the european medicines agency cvpm 2018 3 results 3 1 global perspective based on global loads for carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin to freshwater from oldenkamp et al 2019 and pnec values used in this study global gwfs of 50 billion m3 yr 1 carbamazepine and 14 556 billion m3 yr 1 ciprofloxacin were determined which on a per capita basis is 7 m3 yr 1 carbamazepine and 1900 m3 yr 1 ciprofloxacin while the latter in particular is very substantial compared for instance with a global nitrogen related gwf of 1940 m3 yr 1 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 water pollution from pharmaceuticals is likely to increase the ims institute for healthcare informatics 2015 predicts a global pharmaceutical consumption increase of 32 from 2015 to 2020 klein et al 2018 predict a global increase of human antibiotic use by 15 towards 2030 under unchanged antibiotic use policies and antibiotic consumption rates extrapolating the growth of global antibiotic consumption as observed in the past years they estimate per capita consumption to rise by 161 and total consumption by 202 this growth largely results from emerging markets where populations and per capita consumption rise ims institute for healthcare informatics 2015 growth in per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals appears to correlate to growth in gross domestic product per capita klein et al 2018 for global veterinary antibiotic consumption an increase of 67 from 2010 to 2030 is predicted due to the global rise in animal product consumption and the shift towards more intensive farming practices this trends would also lead to an increase of global gwf of pharmaceuticals 3 2 national gwfs for germany and the netherlands 3 2 1 human pharmaceuticals the largest gwfs of human pharmaceuticals in ge and nl based on pharmacy sales excretion rates and removal rates in wastewater treatment are estimated at 190 and 193 billion m3 yr 1 respectively resulting from the hormone ethinylestradiol which is not used in relatively large amounts but has a comparatively low pnec total gwfs for all substances are given in the si although the german population is around five times larger than the dutch population the total dutch gwf is larger for two out of the eleven investigated substances namely ethinylestradiol and oxazepam fig 2 shows the per capita gwfs for selected substances for ge and nl differences in gwf are up to four orders of magnitude among compounds resulting from a combination of different consumption volumes excreted fractions removed fractions in wwtps and given pnecs for some substances there is a one order of magnitude difference in per capita gwf between ge and nl this results from different per capita consumption in the two countries i e the per capita gwf linearly depends on the per capita consumption the per capita gwf for ethinylestradiol is about five times higher for nl than for ge ge has a larger per capita gwf than nl for eight out of the eleven substances resulting from differing per capita sales the largest difference in per capita gwf between the two countries is found for the antibiotic erythromycin with a nine times larger value for ge the national average per capita gwfs of carbamazepine for ge and nl are within the same order of magnitude as the global average 7 m3 yr 1 although slightly higher for ciprofloxacin the german and dutch per capita gwfs are approximately half of the global average 1900 m3 yr 1 3 2 2 veterinary pharmaceuticals between 1 and 33 of the pharmaceuticals sold to the livestock sector in germany and the netherlands are estimated to reach freshwater resources table 1 considering country specific input data note that the livestock sector in one country mainly contributes to water pollution in the same country but due to cross border manure trade exported fractions can end up in neighbouring countries the net trade of manure between nl and ge is from the former to the latter leenstra et al 2014 so some of the pharmaceuticals from the dutch livestock sector end up in water bodies in germany on the other hand a substantial part of the water pollution in germany flows downstream to the netherlands for national gwf estimations of this study we investigated gwfs related to production of animal products and therefore present the gwf of livestock production per country even though pollution might take place elsewhere for the vc we evaluate manure export from the region and present this as part of the results the largest gwfs of livestock production are from amoxicillin and amount to 1 5 and 0 3 trillion m3 yr 1 for ge and nl respectively exceeding the gwfs of human pharmaceuticals the si provides gwfs per livestock sector and country for all substances in ge beef cattle contribute most 53 to the overall gwf whereas in nl dairy cattle contribute most 60 note that this distribution is a first approximation resulting from the assumptions taken in this study regarding the distribution of pharmaceuticals over the different animal types given their weight a beef or dairy cow has a larger annual gwf than a pig or chicken see si more informative table 2 shows the gwf per unit of animal product among the three meat types beef has the largest gwf in ge 654 m3 kg 1 whereas pork has the largest gwf in nl 212 m3 kg 1 chicken meat has the smallest gwf in both countries except for pork gwfs for all products are larger in ge than in nl as shown in the table the pharmaceutical related gwfs add substantially to the total wfs of the animal products as estimated previously while excluding pharmaceutical related gwfs mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 3 2 3 the direct and indirect pharmaceutical related gwf of a consumer for both germany and the netherlands fig 3 shows the pharmaceutical related gwf for the critical substance amoxicillin per consumer resulting from meat milk and egg consumption next to the gwf of a consumer because of direct human pharmaceutical use for the critical substance ethinylestradiol the gwfs related to animal products in each country are based on consumption data per country and estimates on gwf per unit of product from table 2 pharmaceutical related gwfs from direct human medicine use as well as through the consumption of animal products exceed earlier estimates of total consumer wfs that did not yet account for pharmaceutical pollution mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 estimated the total german and dutch wfs to be 1426 and 1466 m3 cap 1 yr 1 respectively which included water consumption related to home water use and consumption of agricultural and industrial products and water pollution through nitrogen from various sources 3 3 the vecht river catchment 3 3 1 human pharmaceuticals the vc is mapped and described in detail in the si table 3 presents the gwf per substance in the vc from households and hospitals for the most critical substance ethinylestradiol where the gwf exclusively results from households approximately 95 of the total gwf in the catchment results from the dutch part this is due to the combination of more inhabitants in the dutch area and a higher per capita use of the substance gwfs for all substances are presented in the si there are approximately 4400 hospital beds in the region divided over 15 hospitals seven in ge eight in nl for six out of the 10 substances investigated the gwf from hospitals adds less than 1 to the gwf from households for ciprofloxacin however the gwf from hospitals amounts to about 10 of the total the contribution of hospitals to the total gwf in the catchment is thus substance specific fig 4 shows the relative contributions of municipalities to the total gwf in the catchment for ethinylestradiol the most critical substance and erythromycin with quite a divergent spatial pattern the actual loads occur through the wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the catchment the contributions of which to the total are shown as well though the municipalities vary in size it can be observed that gwf hotpots occur in the more densely populated communities such as enschede and nordhorn the wwtps that contribute most to the overall gwf are obviously located in or near the municipalities that contribute most the share of different municipalities in the overall gwf in the catchment differs across substances explained by diverging per capita sales 3 3 2 veterinary pharmaceuticals the largest gwf 93 billion m3 yr 1 resulting from livestock in the vc is for amoxicillin with the german part of the catchment contributing 53 whereas amoxicillin is the critical substance at catchment level the maximum gwf on the dutch side is determined by doxycycline substance specific pharmaceutical loads and gwfs are presented in the si substantial amounts of manure produced in the vc are exported from the region thus externalizing pharmaceutical emissions fig 5 in the german part of the catchment 80 is used as agricultural land arable and grassland in the dutch part this is 52 considering a nitrate limit for manure of 170 kg n ha 1 yr 1 european commission 2010 and the available agricultural land in the vc we find a maximum possible application of approximately 25 and 38 million kg n yr 1 in the german and dutch parts of the catchment respectively produced nitrogen from animal excretion was estimated at 38 and 109 million kg yr 1 in the german and dutch parts respectively taking into account livestock densities and animal specific nitrogen excretion factors implying manure surpluses in both parts of the catchment the german area thus externalizes 35 of its gwf the dutch part even 65 3 3 3 water pollution levels in the vecht catchment the total catchment s runoff is about 2 billion m3 yr 1 on average the runoff per km2 per sub catchment ranges from 202 000 to 378 300 m3 km 2 and is 332 500 m3 km 2 for the catchment as a whole differences in runoff per sub catchment fig 6 follow from differences in hydrology and sub catchment size fig 7 shows the wpl in the vc resulting from ethinylestradiol the most critical human pharmaceutical and from amoxicillin the most critical veterinary pharmaceutical the total gwf related to human use of ethinylestradiol is 13 billion m3 yr 1 the total gwf related to veterinary use of amoxicillin is 48 billion m3 yr 1 for both human and veterinary pharmaceuticals the gwf exceeds the available runoff wpls across sub catchments differ indicating hotspots for human pharmaceuticals wpl is high in sub catchments with large disposals from wwtps in several sub catchments wpl 1 which means that the gwf can be assimilated by the runoff generated within the area in nl per capita gwf for ethinylestradiol is 4 2 times larger than in ge contributing to higher wpls in sub catchments on the dutch side in one sub catchment wpl exceeds 100 demonstrating a remarkable hotspot this high value is caused by the presence of wwtps of two majors cities namely enschede and hengelo connecting over 274 000 inhabitants a gwf of 11 123 m3 yr 1 per inhabitant and a relatively low runoff the wpl from veterinary pharmaceuticals exceeds 1 for all sub catchments it results from amoxicillin and distributes more homogeneously over the catchment than the wpl for ethinylestradiol from human use while human pharmaceutical emissions enter as point sources at specific locations veterinary emissions are diffuse and spread out as manure is applied throughout the basin the gwf per area related to the veterinary pharmaceutical emissions in the vc is 22 and 7 million m3 km 2 for the german and dutch side respectively we observe that the sub catchments with the lowest wpls for veterinary pharmaceuticals show a high wpl for human pharmaceuticals because there is little agricultural land in densely populated areas note that wpls presented here refer to locally generated pollution which excludes incoming water pollution from upstream sub catchments we take this approach as we are not considering biogeochemical decay processes along the river streams 4 discussion 4 1 general observations this study shows that per capita gwfs of human pharmaceuticals can hugely vary across substances and among countries the latter can be explained by differences in consumption patterns klein et al 2018 oecd 2017 and wastewater treatment coverage oldenkamp et al 2019 global trends predict an increase in pharmaceutical use for both humans and livestock if wastewater treatment in countries with increasing consumption does neither increase nor improve gwfs of human pharmaceuticals will rise the gwf from veterinary pharmaceuticals will increase with increasing consumption of animal products if there are no changes in application routines to draw more robust conclusions about gwfs of pharmaceutical pollution on a global level substance specific information on consumption patterns as well as influential parameters have to be available and analysed within future research 4 2 gwfs of pharmaceuticals in context the global average per capita gwf from the human antibiotic ciprofloxacin estimated here is 1900 m3 yr 1 this is a lot when compared to the global average wf of 1385 m3 yr 1 per person estimated by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 a value including all water consumption and nitrogen related water pollution from households industries and agriculture but excluding water pollution from pharmaceuticals national per capita gwfs from direct pharmaceutical consumption and from consumption of animal products for ge and nl exceed this wf the wf of a consumer thus increases substantially when including pharmaceutical pollution the results of this study can be compared to estimated gwfs for other pollutants than pharmaceuticals mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 estimate a global nitrogen related gwf of 13 trillion m3 yr 1 which is the same order of magnitude as the global gwf of human use of ciprofloxacin found in this study the global gwf from anthropogenic phosphorus loads was estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 at 147 trillion m3 yr 1 the gwfs related to nitrogen in ge and nl were estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 at 14 and 0 85 billion m3 yr 1 respectively which in both cases is less than the gwf related to human and veterinary pharmaceuticals found in this research martinez alcala et al 2018 estimated the gwf of human pharmaceuticals for a region in southern spain and found a per capita gwf of 222 m3 yr 1 for carbamazepine resulting from measured concentrations in wwtp effluents considering a pnec of 1 2 μg l 1 this is a larger gwf than we found for carbamazepine on global national and regional level within this study a novel part of this research is the link made between pharmaceutical water pollution and specific animal products meat and dairy production are major water users contributing about one third of the global wf of humanity hoekstra 2020 while not yet considering pharmaceutical pollution mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 estimate the average wf of beef to be about 15 m3 kg 1 the sum of water consumption and nitrogen related water pollution while here we find the amoxicillin related gwf of beef with a magnitude higher for nl and ge this shows that the gwf related to veterinary pharmaceuticals raises an additional issue related to the consumption of animal products an interesting aspect of the vecht study was the investigation of a transboundary catchment with intensive livestock agriculture yet pharmaceutical pollution from households is dominant in the catchment as a whole mainly because the vc externalizes 50 of the produced gwf resulting from veterinary pharmaceuticals the contribution of hospitals to the gwf in the vc is minor although specific substances can locally contribute substantially we found significant differences in per capita gwf for the same human pharmaceuticals in ge and nl for instance the per capita gwf of erythromycin in the vc is 16 fold larger in ge than in nl as ge is located upstream it is likely that nl will be affected by german emissions 4 3 uncertainties and limitations of the study several input parameters considered in the gwf estimations come with uncertainty mainly due to assumptions made to fill data gaps we evaluate the sensitivity of the outcomes to several input parameters see si the results show that especially changing several input parameters at the same time can lead to substantially lower or higher gwfs one other critical input parameter for the gwf assessment is the pnec used as maximum allowed concentration pnecs are derived from ecotoxicological data depending on data availability e g for different target species an assessment factor is applied as a precautionary approach further pnecs can be derived considering different endpoints of toxicity consequently different pnecs exist in literature for individual compounds the choice of pnec influences gwf results besides that there are no limit values regarding the toxicity of a mixture of pharmaceuticals in water which could be a relevant aspect to address in future studies despite these uncertainties the main conclusion that the gwf of certain pharmaceuticals is very large compared to other forms of water pollution remains unaffected further several aspects that potentially affect the results are not included in this study resulting in limitations first the study covers a limited number substances while there are thousands of different compounds on the market jorgensen 2008 second we exclusively assessed the gwf related to pharmaceutical consumption while the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals can come along with aquatic pollution as well fick et al 2009 larsson 2014 sim et al 2011 third this study neglects that unconsumed pharmaceuticals could be disposed directly into the sewage system causing pollution barnett itzhaki et al 2016 persson et al 2009 vollmer 2010 fourth pharmaceuticals purchases via additional routes e g from abroad is not included fifth for the gwf estimation exclusively the excretion of parent compounds is considered while excreted metabolites can be likewise or even more ecotoxic and therefore environmentally relevant celiz et al 2009 kümmerer 2008b the exclusion of metabolites may lead to underestimation of gwfs sixth wwtp removal rates are considered assuming all sewage water undergoes treatment however pharmaceuticals can enter the aquatic environment via storm water overflows before undergoing treatment during rainfall events kay et al 2017 seventh for veterinary pharmaceuticals we estimate consumption per livestock sector but neglected differences between treated and non treated animals that correlate with factors such as farming practices and the health status age and weight of the animals eighth following the precautionary principle the leaching and runoff fraction of veterinary pharmaceuticals was assumed to be 100 for the regional analysis wpl related to veterinary pharmaceuticals exceeded 1 in all sub catchments indicating violation of water quality standards especially for non mobile and fast degrading substances the precautionary approach might be overestimating but was considered the most appropriate approach due to insufficient knowledge and data availability an issue that deserves follow up research is temporal variability the gwf and wpl analysis cover a temporal span of one year and do not account for temporal variability of input parameters however several factors fluctuate in time like pharmaceutical use depending on the season christoffels et al 2016 van boeckel et al 2014 yu et al 2013 periodic peaks of manure application in spring and autumn boxall 2008 and climatic variations determining runoff despite the given uncertainties and limitations this study presents a method leading to a first estimate of gwfs related to pharmaceuticals for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals at three geographical levels given the lack of data the presented findings give a unique and satisfying indication of water pollution related to pharmaceutical use which can be improved in the future 5 conclusion the severity of water pollution through pharmaceuticals is demonstrated by the estimated gwf related to the global human consumption of ciprofloxacin amounting to 1900 m3 yr 1 per capita this is more than the overall aggregated consumptive wf per person in the world considering all water consumed at home and in industries and agriculture estimated in previous studies the trend of increasing global human and veterinary pharmaceutical consumption rises the likelihood for growing global water pollution from pharmaceuticals this study demonstrates that gwfs can vary substantially among compounds influenced by loads and pnecs as well as regions influenced by loads leading to different hotspots depending on the substance under investigation therefore the inclusion of other pharmaceuticals into a global gwf assessment could potentially increase the gwf found in this study one substance causing this could be ethinylestradiol which shows the largest gwf within the national and regional gwf assessment of this study but is not included in the global assessment among the veterinary substances amoxicillin resulted in the largest gwf the national veterinary gwf from livestock production exceeded the human gwf for both countries as a precautionary approach is taken for the transport of veterinary pharmaceuticals in the soil and over land we may overestimate gwfs however amoxicillin is known for its mobile behaviour which justifies the precautionary approach chosen further the study demonstrates that gwfs from livestock production are partly externalized to other regions due to manure export from a consumption perspective an individual s pharmaceutical related gwf depends on direct pharmaceutical consumption as well as consumption of animal products an effective way for consumers to reduce pharmaceutical pollution thus includes eating less meat eggs and dairy which comes along with a large range of other environmental and health benefits as well willett et al 2019 in the vc wpls exceed acceptable levels for both human and veterinary pharmaceutical illustrating the severity of freshwater pollution on river basin scale additionally it can be assumed that downstream catchments are receivers of runoff as well as human and veterinary pharmaceuticals

19995,water pollution by pharmaceuticals is widespread causing both environmental and human health risks we assess pharmaceutical water pollution from human and veterinary pharmaceuticals at three geographical levels global national considering germany and the netherlands and catchment level with a case study for the vecht catchment shared by germany and the netherlands the grey water footprint gwf a measure of water pollution in volumetric terms is estimated from pharmaceutical loads entering the aquatic environment considering different pollutant sources and pathways we study different substances depending on data availability which varies across geographical levels results show a global per capita gwf of 1900 m3 yr 1 resulting from human consumption of ciprofloxacin the largest gwfs in both germany and the netherlands were found for ethinylestradiol for human and amoxicillin for veterinary use the estimated per capita gwf from human use of ethinylestradiol is 2300 m3 yr 1 for germany and 11 300 m3 yr 1 for the netherlands the per capita gwfs of german and dutch consumers of animal products are 12 900 and 10 600 m3 yr 1 respectively for the vecht catchment we estimate the water pollution level per sub catchment by comparing the gwf to available runoff which enables us to identify geographic hotspots in the basin as a whole gwfs from human and veterinary

2015 exposure to pharmaceuticals has led to ecotoxicological effects on various species such as vultures fish frogs and duckweed aus der beek et al 2015 sumpter 2010 which has resulted in serious concerns especially regarding drinking water risks who 2012 and antimicrobial resistance who 2014 urban wastewater discharge is generally regarded the dominant source of pharmaceuticals in water whereas discharge from manufacturing hospitals animal husbandry and aquaculture can be important locally aus der beek et al 2015 human and veterinary pharmaceuticals enter the aquatic environment via distinct pathways kümmerer 2008a fig 1 illustrates sources and pathways of pharmaceutical residues to freshwater resources considered in this study pharmaceuticals are designed to cure people and animals or diagnose or prevent diseases they have a precise function within target bodies the administered dose is rarely entirely decomposed by the body substantial fractions are generally excreted mainly via urine winker et al 2008 the excreted fractions of human pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are mostly discharged into the sewer system hughes et al 2013 and enter the receiving water body as point source in the case of livestock manure from treated animals collected in liquid solid or mixed form weinfurtner 2011 contains pharmaceutical residues and will generally be applied to crop fields or grasslands as fertilizer kümmerer 2008b a fraction of the pharmaceuticals thus brought onto land will leach to groundwater or reach open water through surface runoff boxall 2008 thus forming a diffuse source of pollution this study uses the grey water footprint gwf concept to assess water pollution by pharmaceuticals from households hospitals and animal husbandry considering different pathways the gwf indicates the volume of water required to assimilate pollutant loads to acceptable concentrations hoekstra et al 2011 despite water footprint research since 2002 hoekstra 2017 investigation of the gwf related to pharmaceuticals is in its infancy there has been extensive research into the gwf related to the use of fertilizers liu et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 2018 and pesticides gil et al 2017 lamastra et al 2014 vale et al 2019 but only one case study on the gwf of human pharmaceutical use has been published martinez alcala et al 2018 there have been various efforts to estimate pharmaceutical loads to freshwater alder et al 2010 ter laak et al 2010 winker et al 2008 and to monitor concentrations of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and in streams hirsch et al 1999 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 ternes 1998 none of the previous studies took a perspective as we undertake in the current study translating the loads of both human and veterinary pharmaceuticals to water into a gwf and putting this gwf in the context of the limited assimilation capacity of freshwater systems the objective is to gain insight in the gwf of pharmaceuticals from different sources and explore which of the selected substances and emission pathways are most influential and what parameters are most important the gwf is quantified and spatially mapped distinguishing between gwfs related to households and hospitals and different types of livestock farming gwfs are thereby expressed as polluted water volumes per area but also per community per person and per unit of animal product meat milk egg the results are compared with the gwf of other pollutants and thus add a useful extension to the assessment of the overall wf of human society we consider the gwf of pharmaceuticals at three spatial levels in a global analysis for two substances we obtain a global picture of the severity of water pollution through pharmaceuticals at national level we estimate and contrast pharmaceutical pollution in two countries germany and the netherlands for a range of substances and compare the gwf per person related to direct pharmaceutical use to the gwf per person from the consumption of animal products in the supply chain of which veterinary pharmaceuticals were used in a detailed high resolution analysis at river basin level for the vecht catchment shared by germany and the netherlands we identify local hotspots of water pollution through pharmaceuticals we estimate the potential effect of the gwf per sub catchment by calculating the water pollution level wpl as the ratio of the gwf to catchment runoff 2 methods and data 2 1 geographical levels of analysis at global level where data on pharmaceutical use are extremely limited we estimate the pollution from human use of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin using data on loads emitted to the aquatic environment from oldenkamp et al 2019 at national level environmental loads and related gwfs are estimated for germany ge and the netherlands nl both for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals regarding human pharmaceuticals substances from several therapeutic groups are included whereas the selection of veterinary pharmaceuticals is limited to antibiotics details on the substance selection are included in the supplementary information si the basin level study for the vecht catchment vc considers the same substances as on the national level a detailed description of the catchment is in the si 2 2 grey water footprint and water pollution level water footprint wf assessment is a method to quantify consumptive as well as degradative freshwater use the consumptive wf refers to the consumption of rainwater green wf and groundwater or surface water blue wf the degradative wf called the grey wf hoekstra et al 2011 refers to the volume of water that is required to assimilate pollutants which is the volume of water needed to dilute pollutants to the extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above water quality standards franke et al 2013 the gwf m3 yr 1 is defined as the load of pollutant l kg yr 1 divided by the difference between the maximum allowed concentration c max kg m 3 and the natural background concentration c nat kg m 3 hoekstra et al 2011 for pharmaceuticals considered here c nat is zero the gwf is estimated separately for different substances the overall resultant gwf is equal to the largest gwf across the examined contaminants hoekstra et al 2011 we estimate gwfs on a temporal scale of one year the water pollution level wpl in a basin or sub catchment is defined as the ratio of the gwf m3 yr 1 to the catchment s runoff r m3 yr 1 hoekstra et al 2011 wpl 1 indicates that ambient water quality standards are violated wpl is estimated in the vecht case study on annual basis per sub catchment runoff precipitation minus evaporation is estimated from data at a resolution of 1 km2 for the reference period 1961 1990 bfg 2019 and extrapolated to the dutch part of the catchment as climatic and hydrological conditions are comparable 2 3 human pharmaceutical loads following modelling approaches presented by e g alder et al 2010 and ter laak et al 2010 pharmaceutical loads entering the aquatic environment as point sources are estimated as 1 l h s f e 1 f r where l h kg yr 1 is the load of a specific human pharmaceutical to water s kg yr 1 the sales of the pharmaceutical in a defined geographical area f e the excreted fraction and f r the fraction removed by wastewater treatment pharmacy sales are obtained on national and vc level for ge and nl data on pharmaceutical use in hospitals is collected from hospital pharmacies in the vc substance specific input values for excreted pharmaceutical fractions and removed fractions in wastewater treatment plants are retrieved from scientific literature si 2 4 veterinary pharmaceutical loads veterinary pharmaceutical loads are estimated separately for beef cattle dairy cattle pigs broiler and laying hens for ge and nl as a whole and for the vc the main emission pathways via direct excretion of grazing animals and indirect manure collection and application emissions were considered boxall 2008 aggregated loads per pharmaceutical and livestock type are defined as 2 l t i l d i m l i n i m where l t i kg yr 1 is the total load of a specific veterinary pharmaceutical from livestock type i l d i kg yr 1 the load from manure directly emitted to pasture land and l in i m kg yr 1 the indirect load from manure type m liquid or solid applied to fields after temporary storage following descriptions by boxall et al 2004 direct loads are estimated as 3 l d i 365 a i f e f d i where a kg day 1 is the administered substance per day f e the excreted fraction and f d the fraction directly emitted to pasture land the pharmaceutical load from manure that has been stored before application to fields is estimated per livestock type i and manure type m liquid or solid using a first order degradation model ray et al 2017 wang and yates 2008 assuming constant production of manure over time see derivation in si 4 l i n i m 365 t i m a i f

one storage period and 365 t the number of storage periods per year by definition k equals ln 2 divided by the half life of the substance which differs per type of manure and livestock type amounts of administered substances separately for beef cattle dairy cattle pigs broilers and laying hens are estimated based on veterinary pharmaceutical sales data for ge and nl by lack of livestock specific data we assume the same excretion fractions as in human metabolism data on pharmaceutical degradation during manure storage are obtained from literature data sources and assumptions are provided in the si pharmaceutical transport to water through leaching and runoff has been addressed through experimental trials hamscher et al 2005 kay et al 2005 ostermann et al 2013 pan and chu 2017 popova et al 2013 spielmeyer et al 2017 stoob et al 2007 modelling attempts bailey 2015 knäbel et al 2016 mackay et al 2005 and risk assessment methods cvpm 2018 menz et al 2015 but a comprehensive method applicable for the scope of this study is lacking given lack of data on decay in the soil and because pharmaceuticals from agricultural use have been found in freshwater resources under agricultural fields in ge and nl karfusehr et al 2018 kivits et al 2018 we follow here the precautionary principle by assuming that all loads applied to the field could potentially end up in freshwater this may overestimate water quality impacts given potential degradation or accumulation in the soil hannappel et al 2014 kümmerer 2008a there is great variance in mobility among different pharmaceuticals boxall 2008 plant uptake or photodegradation can occur after pharmaceuticals have been applied to the field jechalke et al 2014 we address this issue of potential overestimation in a sensitivity analysis presented in the si 2 5 limit concentrations of pharmaceuticals although the eu included pharmaceuticals in the priority substances and watch list under the water framework directive european comission 2016 2019 there are no legally binding environmental limit concentrations for pharmaceuticals barbosa et al 2016 here we take predicted no effect concentrations pnec as maximum allowed concentrations for the gwf calculations bergmann et al 2011 pnec values for the substances considered are taken from literature see si and reach from 0 00001 μg l 1 for ethinylestradiol to 60 μg l 1 for metformin bergmann et al 2011 for amantadine for which no pnec value is available we have taken 0 1 μg l 1 the threshold value for environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals suggested by the european medicines agency cvpm 2018 3 results 3 1 global perspective based on global loads for carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin to freshwater from oldenkamp et al 2019 and pnec values used in this study global gwfs of 50 billion m3 yr 1 carbamazepine and 14 556 billion m3 yr 1 ciprofloxacin were determined which on a per capita basis is 7 m3 yr 1 carbamazepine and 1900 m3 yr 1 ciprofloxacin while the latter in particular is very substantial compared for instance with a global nitrogen related gwf of 1940 m3 yr 1 mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 water pollution from pharmaceuticals is likely to increase the ims institute for healthcare informatics 2015 predicts a global pharmaceutical consumption increase of 32 from 2015 to 2020 klein et al 2018 predict a global increase of human antibiotic use by 15 towards 2030 under unchanged antibiotic use policies and antibiotic consumption rates extrapolating the growth of global antibiotic consumption as observed in the past years they estimate per capita consumption to rise by 161 and total consumption by 202 this growth largely results from emerging markets where populations and per capita consumption rise ims institute for healthcare informatics 2015 growth in per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals appears to correlate to growth in gross domestic product per capita klein et al 2018 for global veterinary antibiotic consumption an increase of 67 from 2010 to 2030 is predicted due to the global rise in animal product consumption and the shift towards more intensive farming practices this trends would also lead to an increase of global gwf of pharmaceuticals 3 2 national gwfs for germany and the netherlands 3 2 1 human pharmaceuticals the largest gwfs of human pharmaceuticals in ge and nl based on pharmacy sales excretion rates and removal rates in wastewater treatment are estimated at 190 and 193 billion m3 yr 1 respectively resulting from the hormone ethinylestradiol which is not used in relatively large amounts but has a comparatively low pnec total gwfs for all substances are given in the si although the german population is around five times larger than the dutch population the total dutch gwf is larger for two out of the eleven investigated substances namely ethinylestradiol and oxazepam fig 2 shows the per capita gwfs for selected substances for ge and nl differences in gwf are up to four orders of magnitude among compounds resulting from a combination of different consumption volumes excreted fractions removed fractions in wwtps and given pnecs for some substances there is a one order of magnitude difference in per capita gwf between ge and nl this results from different per capita consumption in the two countries i e the per capita gwf linearly depends on the per capita consumption the per capita gwf for ethinylestradiol is about five times higher for nl than for ge ge has a larger per capita gwf than nl for eight out of the eleven substances resulting from differing per capita sales the largest difference in per capita gwf between the two countries is found for the antibiotic erythromycin with a nine times larger value for ge the national average per capita gwfs of carbamazepine for ge and nl are within the same order of magnitude as the global average 7 m3 yr 1 although slightly higher for ciprofloxacin the german and dutch per capita gwfs are approximately half of the global average 1900 m3 yr 1 3 2 2 veterinary pharmaceuticals between 1 and 33 of the pharmaceuticals sold to the livestock sector in germany and the netherlands are estimated to reach freshwater resources table 1 considering country specific input data note that the livestock sector in one country mainly contributes to water pollution in the same country but due to cross border manure trade exported fractions can end up in neighbouring countries the net trade of manure between nl and ge is from the former to the latter leenstra et al 2014 so some of the pharmaceuticals from the dutch livestock sector end up in water bodies in germany on the other hand a substantial part of the water pollution in germany flows downstream to the netherlands for national gwf estimations of this study we investigated gwfs related to production of animal products and therefore present the gwf of livestock production per country even though pollution might take place elsewhere for the vc we evaluate manure export from the region and present this as part of the results the largest gwfs of livestock production are from amoxicillin and amount to 1 5 and 0 3 trillion m3 yr 1 for ge and nl respectively exceeding the gwfs of human pharmaceuticals the si provides gwfs per livestock sector and country for all substances in ge beef cattle contribute most 53 to the overall gwf whereas in nl dairy cattle contribute most 60 note that this distribution is a first approximation resulting from the assumptions taken in this study regarding the distribution of pharmaceuticals over the different animal types given their weight a beef or dairy cow has a larger annual gwf than a pig or chicken see si more informative table 2 shows the gwf per unit of animal product among the three meat types beef has the largest gwf in ge 654 m3 kg 1 whereas pork has the largest gwf in nl 212 m3 kg 1 chicken meat has the smallest gwf in both countries except for pork gwfs for all products are larger in ge than in nl as shown in the table the pharmaceutical related gwfs add substantially to the total wfs of the animal products as estimated previously while excluding pharmaceutical related gwfs mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 3 2 3 the direct and indirect pharmaceutical related gwf of a consumer for both germany and the netherlands fig 3 shows the pharmaceutical related gwf for the critical substance amoxicillin per consumer resulting from meat milk and egg consumption next to the gwf of a consumer because of direct human pharmaceutical use for the critical substance ethinylestradiol the gwfs related to animal products in each country are based on consumption data per country and estimates on gwf per unit of product from table 2 pharmaceutical related gwfs from direct human medicine use as well as through the consumption of animal products exceed earlier estimates of total consumer wfs that did not yet account for pharmaceutical pollution mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 estimated the total german and dutch wfs to be 1426 and 1466 m3 cap 1 yr 1 respectively which included water consumption related to home water use and consumption of agricultural and industrial products and water pollution through nitrogen from various sources 3 3 the vecht river catchment 3 3 1 human pharmaceuticals the vc is mapped and described in detail in the si table 3 presents the gwf per substance in the vc from households and hospitals for the most critical substance ethinylestradiol where the gwf exclusively results from households approximately 95 of the total gwf in the catchment results from the dutch part this is due to the combination of more inhabitants in the dutch area and a higher per capita use of the substance gwfs for all substances are presented in the si there are approximately 4400 hospital beds in the region divided over 15 hospitals seven in ge eight in nl for six out of the 10 substances investigated the gwf from hospitals adds less than 1 to the gwf from households for ciprofloxacin however the gwf from hospitals amounts to about 10 of the total the contribution of hospitals to the total gwf in the catchment is thus substance specific fig 4 shows the relative contributions of municipalities to the total gwf in the catchment for ethinylestradiol the most critical substance and erythromycin with quite a divergent spatial pattern the actual loads occur through the wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the catchment the contributions of which to the total are shown as well though the municipalities vary in size it can be observed that gwf hotpots occur in the more densely populated communities such as enschede and nordhorn the wwtps that contribute most to the overall gwf are obviously located in or near the municipalities that contribute most the share of different municipalities in the overall gwf in the catchment differs across substances explained by diverging per capita sales 3 3 2 veterinary pharmaceuticals the largest gwf 93 billion m3 yr 1 resulting from livestock in the vc is for amoxicillin with the german part of the catchment contributing 53 whereas amoxicillin is the critical substance at catchment level the maximum gwf on the dutch side is determined by doxycycline substance specific pharmaceutical loads and gwfs are presented in the si substantial amounts of manure produced in the vc are exported from the region thus externalizing pharmaceutical emissions fig 5 in the german part of the catchment 80 is used as agricultural land arable and grassland in the dutch part this is 52 considering a nitrate limit for manure of 170 kg n ha 1 yr 1 european commission 2010 and the available agricultural land in the vc we find a maximum possible application of approximately 25 and 38 million kg n yr 1 in the german and dutch parts of the catchment respectively produced nitrogen from animal excretion was estimated at 38 and 109 million kg yr 1 in the german and dutch parts respectively taking into account livestock densities and animal specific nitrogen excretion factors implying manure surpluses in both parts of the catchment the german area thus externalizes 35 of its gwf the dutch part even 65 3 3 3 water pollution levels in the vecht catchment the total catchment s runoff is about 2 billion m3 yr 1 on average the runoff per km2 per sub catchment ranges from 202 000 to 378 300 m3 km 2 and is 332 500 m3 km 2 for the catchment as a whole differences in runoff per sub catchment fig 6 follow from differences in hydrology and sub catchment size fig 7 shows the wpl in the vc resulting from ethinylestradiol the most critical human pharmaceutical and from amoxicillin the most critical veterinary pharmaceutical the total gwf related to human use of ethinylestradiol is 13 billion m3 yr 1 the total gwf related to veterinary use of amoxicillin is 48 billion m3 yr 1 for both human and veterinary pharmaceuticals the gwf exceeds the available runoff wpls across sub catchments differ indicating hotspots for human pharmaceuticals wpl is high in sub catchments with large disposals from wwtps in several sub catchments wpl 1 which means that the gwf can be assimilated by the runoff generated within the area in nl per capita gwf for ethinylestradiol is 4 2 times larger than in ge contributing to higher wpls in sub catchments on the dutch side in one sub catchment wpl exceeds 100 demonstrating a remarkable hotspot this high value is caused by the presence of wwtps of two majors cities namely enschede and hengelo connecting over 274 000 inhabitants a gwf of 11 123 m3 yr 1 per inhabitant and a relatively low runoff the wpl from veterinary pharmaceuticals exceeds 1 for all sub catchments it results from amoxicillin and distributes more homogeneously over the catchment than the wpl for ethinylestradiol from human use while human pharmaceutical emissions enter as point sources at specific locations veterinary emissions are diffuse and spread out as manure is applied throughout the basin the gwf per area related to the veterinary pharmaceutical emissions in the vc is 22 and 7 million m3 km 2 for the german and dutch side respectively we observe that the sub catchments with the lowest wpls for veterinary pharmaceuticals show a high wpl for human pharmaceuticals because there is little agricultural land in densely populated areas note that wpls presented here refer to locally generated pollution which excludes incoming water pollution from upstream sub catchments we take this approach as we are not considering biogeochemical decay processes along the river streams 4 discussion 4 1 general observations this study shows that per capita gwfs of human pharmaceuticals can hugely vary across substances and among countries the latter can be explained by differences in consumption patterns klein et al 2018 oecd 2017 and wastewater treatment coverage oldenkamp et al 2019 global trends predict an increase in pharmaceutical use for both humans and livestock if wastewater treatment in countries with increasing consumption does neither increase nor improve gwfs of human pharmaceuticals will rise the gwf from veterinary pharmaceuticals will increase with increasing consumption of animal products if there are no changes in application routines to draw more robust conclusions about gwfs of pharmaceutical pollution on a global level substance specific information on consumption patterns as well as influential parameters have to be available and analysed within future research 4 2 gwfs of pharmaceuticals in context the global average per capita gwf from the human antibiotic ciprofloxacin estimated here is 1900 m3 yr 1 this is a lot when compared to the global average wf of 1385 m3 yr 1 per person estimated by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 a value including all water consumption and nitrogen related water pollution from households industries and agriculture but excluding water pollution from pharmaceuticals national per capita gwfs from direct pharmaceutical consumption and from consumption of animal products for ge and nl exceed this wf the wf of a consumer thus increases substantially when including pharmaceutical pollution the results of this study can be compared to estimated gwfs for other pollutants than pharmaceuticals mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 estimate a global nitrogen related gwf of 13 trillion m3 yr 1 which is the same order of magnitude as the global gwf of human use of ciprofloxacin found in this study the global gwf from anthropogenic phosphorus loads was estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 at 147 trillion m3 yr 1 the gwfs related to nitrogen in ge and nl were estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 at 14 and 0 85 billion m3 yr 1 respectively which in both cases is less than the gwf related to human and veterinary pharmaceuticals found in this research martinez alcala et al 2018 estimated the gwf of human pharmaceuticals for a region in southern spain and found a per capita gwf of 222 m3 yr 1 for carbamazepine resulting from measured concentrations in wwtp effluents considering a pnec of 1 2 μg l 1 this is a larger gwf than we found for carbamazepine on global national and regional level within this study a novel part of this research is the link made between pharmaceutical water pollution and specific animal products meat and dairy production are major water users contributing about one third of the global wf of humanity hoekstra 2020 while not yet considering pharmaceutical pollution mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 estimate the average wf of beef to be about 15 m3 kg 1 the sum of water consumption and nitrogen related water pollution while here we find the amoxicillin related gwf of beef with a magnitude higher for nl and ge this shows that the gwf related to veterinary pharmaceuticals raises an additional issue related to the consumption of animal products an interesting aspect of the vecht study was the investigation of a transboundary catchment with intensive livestock agriculture yet pharmaceutical pollution from households is dominant in the catchment as a whole mainly because the vc externalizes 50 of the produced gwf resulting from veterinary pharmaceuticals the contribution of hospitals to the gwf in the vc is minor although specific substances can locally contribute substantially we found significant differences in per capita gwf for the same human pharmaceuticals in ge and nl for instance the per capita gwf of erythromycin in the vc is 16 fold larger in ge than in nl as ge is located upstream it is likely that nl will be affected by german emissions 4 3 uncertainties and limitations of the study several input parameters considered in the gwf estimations come with uncertainty mainly due to assumptions made to fill data gaps we evaluate the sensitivity of the outcomes to several input parameters see si the results show that especially changing several input parameters at the same time can lead to substantially lower or higher gwfs one other critical input parameter for the gwf assessment is the pnec used as maximum allowed concentration pnecs are derived from ecotoxicological data depending on data availability e g for different target species an assessment factor is applied as a precautionary approach further pnecs can be derived considering different endpoints of toxicity consequently different pnecs exist in literature for individual compounds the choice of pnec influences gwf results besides that there are no limit values regarding the toxicity of a mixture of pharmaceuticals in water which could be a relevant aspect to address in future studies despite these uncertainties the main conclusion that the gwf of certain pharmaceuticals is very large compared to other forms of water pollution remains unaffected further several aspects that potentially affect the results are not included in this study resulting in limitations first the study covers a limited number substances while there are thousands of different compounds on the market jorgensen 2008 second we exclusively assessed the gwf related to pharmaceutical consumption while the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals can come along with aquatic pollution as well fick et al 2009 larsson 2014 sim et al 2011 third this study neglects that unconsumed pharmaceuticals could be disposed directly into the sewage system causing pollution barnett itzhaki et al 2016 persson et al 2009 vollmer 2010 fourth pharmaceuticals purchases via additional routes e g from abroad is not included fifth for the gwf estimation exclusively the excretion of parent compounds is considered while excreted metabolites can be likewise or even more ecotoxic and therefore environmentally relevant celiz et al 2009 kümmerer 2008b the exclusion of metabolites may lead to underestimation of gwfs sixth wwtp removal rates are considered assuming all sewage water undergoes treatment however pharmaceuticals can enter the aquatic environment via storm water overflows before undergoing treatment during rainfall events kay et al 2017 seventh for veterinary pharmaceuticals we estimate consumption per livestock sector but neglected differences between treated and non treated animals that correlate with factors such as farming practices and the health status age and weight of the animals eighth following the precautionary principle the leaching and runoff fraction of veterinary pharmaceuticals was assumed to be 100 for the regional analysis wpl related to veterinary pharmaceuticals exceeded 1 in all sub catchments indicating violation of water quality standards especially for non mobile and fast degrading substances the precautionary approach might be overestimating but was considered the most appropriate approach due to insufficient knowledge and data availability an issue that deserves follow up research is temporal variability the gwf and wpl analysis cover a temporal span of one year and do not account for temporal variability of input parameters however several factors fluctuate in time like pharmaceutical use depending on the season christoffels et al 2016 van boeckel et al 2014 yu et al 2013 periodic peaks of manure application in spring and autumn boxall 2008 and climatic variations determining runoff despite the given uncertainties and limitations this study presents a method leading to a first estimate of gwfs related to pharmaceuticals for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals at three geographical levels given the lack of data the presented findings give a unique and satisfying indication of water pollution related to pharmaceutical use which can be improved in the future 5 conclusion the severity of water pollution through pharmaceuticals is demonstrated by the estimated gwf related to the global human consumption of ciprofloxacin amounting to 1900 m3 yr 1 per capita this is more than the overall aggregated consumptive wf per person in the world considering all water consumed at home and in industries and agriculture estimated in previous studies the trend of increasing global human and veterinary pharmaceutical consumption rises the likelihood for growing global water pollution from pharmaceuticals this study demonstrates that gwfs can vary substantially among compounds influenced by loads and pnecs as well as regions influenced by loads leading to different hotspots depending on the substance under investigation therefore the inclusion of other pharmaceuticals into a global gwf assessment could potentially increase the gwf found in this study one substance causing this could be ethinylestradiol which shows the largest gwf within the national and regional gwf assessment of this study but is not included in the global assessment among the veterinary substances amoxicillin resulted in the largest gwf the national veterinary gwf from livestock production exceeded the human gwf for both countries as a precautionary approach is taken for the transport of veterinary pharmaceuticals in the soil and over land we may overestimate gwfs however amoxicillin is known for its mobile behaviour which justifies the precautionary approach chosen further the study demonstrates that gwfs from livestock production are partly externalized to other regions due to manure export from a consumption perspective an individual s pharmaceutical related gwf depends on direct pharmaceutical consumption as well as consumption of animal products an effective way for consumers to reduce pharmaceutical pollution thus includes eating less meat eggs and dairy which comes along with a large range of other environmental and health benefits as well willett et al 2019 in the vc wpls exceed acceptable levels for both human and veterinary pharmaceutical illustrating the severity of freshwater pollution on river basin scale additionally it can be assumed that downstream catchments are receivers of runoff as well as human and veterinary pharmaceuticals

that hww has limited impact on the relative levels of args and mobile genetic elements mges associated with args like integrons in hospital receiving urban wastewater ww buelow et al 2018 pallares vega et al 2019 stalder et al 2014 however most studies usually analyzed a limited number of samples and yet longitudinal studies that monitor ww dynamics are so far lacking which limits the possibility of assessing the risk for amr mediated through ww we collected 126 ww samples uww hww and mixed ww in a french city during a period of approximately four years 34 months with separate treatments for h and u ww applying the conventional secondary activated sludge treatment process and 11 months with h and u ww mixed 1 2 hww uww into one system from those we investigated the dynamics and relationship of the respective resistome and microbiota with the measured eco exposome pharmaceuticals mainly antibiotics surfactants and heavy metals multi variate analysis and machine learning were employed to evaluate signatures of the resistome microbiota and eco exposome of hww compared to uww 2 materials and methods 2 1 1 sampling and study design 126 urban and hospital wastewater uww and hww samples were collected in scientrier bellecombe wwtp haute savoie france chonova et al 2018 as part of the multi disciplinary project sipibel chonova et al 2018 the study site was implemented as an observatory for untreated and treated h and u ww and to evaluate their impact during separate and subsequently mixed treatment on the environment e g the effluent receiving river the chal hospital centre hospitalier alpes léman opened in february 2012 and includes 450 beds 140 m3 d whereas the bellecombe wwtp was collecting uww of approximately 21 000 inhabitant equivalents 5200 m3 d for more details of the sipibel project study set up wwt and sample collection refer to chonova et al 2018 and wiest et al chonova et al 2018 wiest et al 2018 and to fig 1 samples were collected in monthly intervals untreated and treated samples by flow proportional sampling from march 2012 through november 2015 chonova et al 2018 from march 2012 to december 2014 uww and hww were treated separately applying the same conventional activated sludge wwt chonova et al 2018 wiest et al 2018 then in the period from january 2015 through november 2015 uww was mixed into the hww 1 2 ratio hww uww the ratio was fixed by a local operating constraint and added to the separate hww treatment line resulting in a controlled mixed ww mww chonova et al 2018 in addition 12 water samples of the effluent receiving river up river upstream and downstream river downstream sampling point 1 and 2 of the effluent release pipes have been collected during the winter months of 2013 january february november and december 2 2 dna extraction sample preparation water samples were filtered for microorganisms using a filtration ramp sartorius göttingen germany on sterile 47 mm diameter filter with pore size of 0 45 μm sartorius göttingen germany microorganisms were recovered from filters and subject to dna extraction for downstream analysis using the power water dna extraction kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa dna concentration was determined by qubit fluoremetric quantitation thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa assays according the manufacturer s instructions all dna samples were diluted or concentrated to a final concentration of 10 ng μl for downstream qpcr and 16s rrna analysis 2 3 1 high throughput qpcr nanolitre scale quantitative pcrs to quantify levels of genes that confer resistance to antimicrobials and heavy metals were performed as described previously buelow et al 2018 2017 with some modifications in the collection of primers the primer sequences and their targets are provided in the supplementary data supplementary table 1 in total we targeted 88 individual resistance genes conferring resistance to antibiotics quaternary ammonium compounds or heavy metals grouped into 16 resistance gene classes the genes targeted include args that are most commonly detected in the gut microbiota of healthy individuals forslund et al 2013 hu et al 2013 clinically relevant args including genes encoding extended spectrum β lactamases esbls carbapenemases and vancomycin resistance and heavy metal and quaternary ammonium compound resistance genes suggested to favor cross and co selection for args in the environment gnanadhas et al 2013 pal et al 2015 we also targeted genetic elements as important transposase gene families zhu et al 2013 and class 1 2 and 3 integron integrase genes by primers described previously barraud et al 2010 that are important vectors for args in the clinics and often used as proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 finally we targeted the bacterial 16s rrna gene by universal primers gene targets and grouping of genes into gene classes according to function are detailed in supplementary tables 1 and 2 primer design and validation prior and after biomark analysis has been done as described earlier buelow et al 2018 2017 real time pcr analysis was performed using the 96 96 biomark dynamic array for real time pcr fluidigm corporation san francisco ca u s a as described previously buelow et al 2018 2017 thermal cycling and real time imaging was performed at the plateforme génomique get inra transfert https get genotoul fr en and ct values were extracted using the biomark real time pcr analysis software 2 3 2 calculation of normalized abundance and cumulative abundance calculations for normalized and cumulative abundance of individual genes and allocated gene classes was done as described previously buelow et al 2018 2017 specifically normalized abundance of resistance genes was calculated relative to the abundance of the 16s rrna gene 2 ctarg ct16s rrna cumulative abundance of each resistance gene class was calculated based on the sum of the normalized abundance 2 ctarg ct16s rrna of all individual genes detected within a class for each sample the differences in cumulative abundance over the indicated time periods and sample locations untreated and treated hospital and urban wastewaters 2012 2014 up and downstream river samples 2013 untreated and treated mixed wastewaters 2015 are shown as an averaged fold change standard deviation the non parametric mann whitney test was used to test for significance p values were corrected for multiple testing by the benjamin hochberg procedure benjamini and hochberg 1995 with a false discovery rate of 0 05 averaged normalized abundance data for allocated gene classes is provided in supplementary table 3 2 4 qpcr to determine absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes bacterial biomass the qpcrs for the determination of 16s rrna gene copy numbers per liters of water as a proxy for the bacterial biomass was performed as described previously by stalder et al stalder et al 2014 2 5 16s rrna gene sequencing and sequence data pre processing extracted dna samples for 16s rrna sequencing were prepared following a dual barcoded two step pcr procedure for amplicon sequencing for illumina primers of the first pcr step included universal cs1 and cs2 tags targeting the v4 region of the hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene using the 16srrna primer sequences of the earth microbiota project http press igsb anl gov earthmicrobiota protocols and standards 16s samples were sequenced following the illumina protocol for a 2 301 miseq run illumina inc san diego ca sequence reads from the illumina miseq were demultiplexed and classified in the following manner the python application dbcamplicons https github com msettles dbcamplicons was used to identify and assign reads to the appropriate sample by both expected barcode and primer sequences barcodes were allowed to have at most 1 mismatch hamming distance and primers were allowed to have at most 4 mismatches levenshtein distance as long as the final 4 bases of the primer matched the target sequence perfectly reads were then trimmed of their primer sequence and merged into a single amplicon sequence using the application flash magoc and salzberg 2011 2 5 1 16s rrna data analysis illumina miseq forward and reverse reads were processed using the masque pipeline https github com aghozlane masque briefly raw reads are filtered and combined followed by dereplication chimera removal and clustering are followed by taxonomic annotation of the resulting otus by comparison to the silva database a biom file is generated that combines both otu taxonomic assignment and the number of matching reads for each sample relative abundance levels form bacterial taxa order level were obtained and analyzed the obtained relative abundance otu tables order level were analyzed with microsoft excel supplementary table 4 multi variate analysis package see below and by means of a machine learning approach employing a random forest algorithm see below 2 6 chemical analysis all chemical data measured here and used for analysis where extracted from the sipibel database solid phase extraction spe and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were used to measure the antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine as detailed elsewhere wiest et al 2018 heavy metals zn cu ni pb cr gd hg as and cd were measured with inductively coupled plasma combined with atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes concentration of surfactants anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants were measured following standard methods approved by the french organization of standardization afnor as described by wiest et al wiest et al 2018 2 7 multivariate analyses multivariate statistical techniques were used to test the influence of waste water treatment or sampling time independent variables on the microbiota and the resistome dependent variables of the different sample groups urban hospital mixed including all individual genes and genes allocated into gene classes in two independent datasets statistically significant influence of the treatment or the sampling time on the microbiota and the resistome were assessed by redundancy analysis rda with 499 monte carlo permutations for testing the influence of sampling time we used sampling year or season as independent variables and all different sample groups together i e to potentially identify general patterns influencing all groups at the same time and individually as dependent variables such analysis revealed the percentage of variance that is explained by sampling time or ww treatment in each case and whether the influence of the independent variables is statistically significant or not the relationship between the resistome and the microbiota and the measured chemicals in the different raw water samples eco exposome was visualized by means of principal component analysis pca biplots moreover the influence of the measured chemicals eco exposome on the microbiota and resistome was statistically assessed by rda a variation partitioning analysis was performed to assess which group of chemicals metals pharmaceuticals surfactants explains the largest share of the variation of the microbiota and resistome datasets and to explore whether the interactive effects of the groups of chemicals would have a larger influence on those datasets than the individual groups themselves all multivariate analyses were performed with the canoco v5 0 software ter braak and smilauer 2012 using a significance level of 0 05 2 8 machine learning a random forest algorithm rfa was used in order to predict a response variable wastewater sample type urban hospital or mixed of each sample independently using measurements on individual gene gene class and microbiota level predictor variables to run the rfa the r package randomforest was used breiman and cutler s random forests for classification and regression a software package for the r statistical environment breiman 2001 in summary the rfa follows the pseudo steps i the response variable and predictor variables are chosen by the user ii a predefined number of independent bootstrap samples are drawn from the dataset with replacement and a classification tree is fit to each sample containing roughly 2 3 of the data for which predictor variable selection on each node split in the tree is conducted using only a small random subset of predictor variables iii the complete set of trees one for each bootstrap sample composes the random forest rf from which the status classification of the response variable is predicted as an average majority vote of the predictions of all trees compared to single classification trees rfa increases prediction accuracy since the ensemble of slight different classification results adjusts for the instability of the individual trees and avoids data overfitting hastie et al 2009 the mean decrease accuracy mda or breiman cutler importance was employed as a measure of predictor variable importance for which classification accuracy after data permutation of a predictor variable is subtracted from the accuracy without permutation and averaged over all trees in the rf to give an importance value 2 it should be noted that since all predictor variables were of numeric nature using rfa is equivalent to regression over classification trees for the results presented here and in supplementary text only the 2 5 of top rfa scores were considered as presented by the resulting mda distribution of all predictor variables thus selecting the subset of predictor variables which appear statistically more informative than expected in the background of all predictor variables i e we assume that 95 of the rfa scores fall between the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles as done elsewhere lourenco et al 2017 3 results 3 1 hww and uww resistome and microbiota signatures we evaluated the resistome and microbiota dynamics of monthly ww n 126 and river n 12 samples h and u ww samples were treated separately through 2012 and 2014 and were mixed at a ratio of 1 2 hww uww throughout the year 2015 fig 1 h and u ww samples exhibited a distinct signature with respect to the proportional makeup of their resistome fig 2 a and microbiota fig 2b analyzing the data with a random forest machine learning approach showed that the distinct h and u ww signatures resulted in a high prediction accuracy when using the resistome as predictor on the level of gene classes 93 5 and 96 7 of untreated hww and uww samples respectively could be correctly classified supplementary fig 1a we further analyzed the data on the individual gene level to increase resolution of the machine learning approach using individual genes resulted in similarly high predictions 93 5 prediction for untreated hww and 100 prediction for untreated uww supplementary fig 1b similarly when using the microbiota 96 8 of untreated hww and 89 of untreated uww samples were correctly classified supplementary fig 1c for the treated h and u ww the machine learning prediction accuracy was lower compared to the untreated ww sources but still considerably high for all predictor levels and in particular for the microbiota 80 supplementary fig 2 for the mww overall classification success was lower supplementary figs 1 and 2 given a much lower sample size and likely due to the mixing of the two wastewater sources hampering clear signatures 3 2 temporal dynamics of h and u ww redundancy analysis rda was performed to assess putative significant influences of time on the variability of resistome and microbiota compositions using sampling year or season as independent variables monte carlo mc permutations n 499 analysis was carried out for all different sample groups together untreated u h m ww and treated u h m ww to potentially identify general patterns influencing all groups at the same time the same analysis was also performed per individual sample group untreated and treated h u and m ww alone respectively over the first 3 years before mixing of untreated hww and uww neither year p 0 6 resistome and p 0 4 microbiota respectively nor season p 0 9 and p 0 3 had a significant impact on the resistome resistance gene classes and microbiota composition of the ww supplementary table 5a however by analyzing the sample groups separately a yearly and seasonal impact on the level of individual resistance genes in hww was demonstrated p 0 004 year p 0 032 season supplementary table 5b redundancy analysis revealed the relationship between individual genes and gene classes with seasons pointing towards a correlation of increased normalized abundance of individual genes and gene classes detected during summer season supplementary figs 3a and 4 the fact that the hospital was only installed in february 2012 chonova et al 2018 may explain why the year 2012 is particular for hww resistome with overall lower normalized abundance of the resistome and no obvious trend towards the summer season in 2012 after hww and uww mixing in 2015 no significant variation for the resistome and microbiota composition throughout the seasons could be observed considering all sample groups untreated mww hww and uww p 0 6 resistome and p 0 07 microbiota respectively supplementary table 5a for treated ww the analysis exhibited more variation of the resistome and microbiota composition compared to the untreated sources over the years 2012 2014 for h and u ww fig 2 supplementary table 5c redundancy analysis revealed that in particular the microbiota of treated h and u ww effluents varied between the years p 0 016 for all groups p 0 024 for treated hww and p 0 006 for treated uww supplementary tables 5c and 5d while no significant seasonal impact could be observed the resistome varied between the years for treated hww on both the gene class and the individual gene levels p 0 012 and p 0 004 supplementary table 5d whereas for the treated uww this variation was only significant on the individual gene level p 0 032 for the treated mixed ww mww significant seasonal variation was observed for the microbiota composition p 0 02 while for the resistome no significant variation could be observed supplementary table 5d 3 3 human gut bacteria in hww and uww the microbiota of the respective ww was assessed by 16s rrna sequencing we calculated the relative abundance of anaerobic human gut bacteria as well as enterobacteriales since many of these gram negative bacteria are also pathogens the orders clostridiales bifidobacteriales and bacteroidales which represent the most important and abundant anaerobic human gut bacteria costea et al 2018 rajilic stojanovic and de vos 2014 were grouped together and are referred to as anaerobic human gut bacteria untreated hww contained significantly higher levels of anaerobic human gut bacteria 38 11 standard deviation and enterobacteriales 2 1 5 compared to all other samples fig 3 a interestingly anaerobic human gut bacteria and enterobacteriales are comparable in their relative abundance for untreated uww and mww indicating a significant dilution effect when mixing uww with hww fig 3b on the monitored human gut microbiota markers in ww the ww treatment allowed a significant p 0 05 decrease of the relative abundance of these orders for hww and uww fig 3 whereas the reduction for mww was only marginally significant p 0 05 fig 3b 3 4 the untreated hww uww and mww resistome to verify that the differences we observed for the args mges between effluents were not due to variations in the bacterial biomass we assessed the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes per liter of water and showed that the bacterial biomass was comparable for the untreated ww sources hww uww and mww supplementary fig 5 ratios of hww over uww and hww over mww were calculated based on the averaged cumulative abundance of the resistome in untreated hww and uww table 1 the untreated hww contained significantly more gene classes compared to the untreated uww between 3 transposase genes and 161 fold qnr genes encoding quinolone resistance higher p values 0 004 table 1 when ww were mixed at the experimental ratio of 1 2 hww uww the untreated mww contained significantly less resistance gene classes compared to untreated hww between 3 and 22 fold lower p values 0 03 interestingly there was no significant difference for the genes encoding resistance to macrolides for both hww over uww and hww over mww comparisons table 1 fig 4 the only resistance gene significantly lower in hww compared to uww or mww p 0 0001 was the streptogramin resistance gene vatb the meca gene encoding resistance to methicillin was undetectable in all uww and in all but one mww samples table 1 3 5 resistome before and after ww treatment the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes per liter of water for all ww sources decreased by 2 3 log after ww treatment supplementary fig 5 indicating that secondary ww treatment did reduce total bacterial loads in similar orders of magnitude in the hospital and urban ww treatment plant to estimate the impact of ww treatment on the resistome fold changes of normalized cumulative abundance of untreated over treated h u and m ww were calculated the normalized cumulative abundance of all gene classes significantly decreased and was between 78 times for genes conferring resistance to quinolones and 5 times for genes conferring resistance to qacs sulphonamides and genes encoding transposase genes lower in the treated hww compared to untreated hww p 0 003 table 2 fig 4 when comparing untreated uww to treated uww we showed a significant reduction p 0 05 in the normalized cumulative abundance for nine resistance gene classes with fold changes between 43 for the streptogramin resistance gene vatb and three for genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides times table 2 fig 4 no significant reduction in normalized abundance was observed after treatment of uww for gene classes conferring resistance to bacitracin beta lactams quinolones heavy metals and quaternary ammonium compounds and for genes encoding integron integrases surprisingly sulphonamide resistance encoding genes were found to be significantly enriched in normalized abundance after uww treatment p 0 05 table 2 fig 4 for mww a similar removal efficacy as for uww could be observed table 2 fig 4b with significant decrease for the normalized cumulative abundance of 10 gene classes and with fold changes between 41 for the streptogramin resistance gene vatb and three for the genes encoding integron integrase genes times no significant decrease for gene classes conferring resistance to bacitracin beta lactams tetracycline heavy metals qacs and sulphonamides could be detected 3 6 impact of treated hospital ww on the receiving river we also analyzed 12 river samples up and downstream the wwtps to evaluate putatively associated risks with the release of the treated ww into the effluent receiving river and downstream environment supplementary fig 6 the resistome for the river samples collected for the sites up ri and downstream ri1 and ri2 of the effluent release pipes during winter season 2013 was not significantly different for either of the three sampling sites supplementary fig 6 there was no significant difference of the normalized abundance for any of the detected gene classes in the river samples compared to treated uww on the contrary the normalized abundance of nine resistance gene classes including genes encoding mges and integron integrase genes was significantly lower p 0 04 in all river samples when compared to treated hww supplementary fig 6 3 7 correlation analysis between the eco exposome and the microbiome and resistome of hospital and urban ww in order to estimate the eco exposome in the ww selected pharmaceutical and chemical compounds including antibiotics surfactants and heavy metals were quantified in untreated ww supplementary table 6 the association between the resistome microbiota and the eco exposome was visualized by means of principal component analysis pca biplots here hww and uww form two distinct clusters while the mww clusters closely to the uww for both resistome and microbiota fig 5 a and b antibiotics non ionic and cationic surfactants are closely associated with the respective hww resistome and microbiota length of arrows while anionic surfactants and some metals are more associated with the resistome and microbiota of the uww fig 5a and b redundancy analysis rda was performed to statistically asses the association of the monitored eco exposome with the variation of the resistome and microbiota the results of the monte carlo permutations indicated that the eco exposome significantly influences the resistome and microbiota p values 0 002 finally a variation partitioning analysis was performed to study which group of the measured compounds heavy metals pharmaceuticals surfactants might have a larger contribution on the resistome and microbiota variation and to explore whether the interaction between these compounds has a stronger influence than the individually grouped compounds pharmaceuticals the antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin and the neurological drug carbamazepine are more associated with the variance for the resistome while the surfactants are associated with the variation for the microbiota fig 5c and d finally we showed that the interaction between pharmaceuticals and surfactants contributes more to the variability in the resistome than the individual compounds alone fig 5c and d we also collected data on the consumption of three antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin by the hospital pharmacy over the period of 2012 2014 that were summarized here as gram per season supplementary table 7 and supplementary fig 3c the studied hospital site has just been opened in the winter month of february 2012 which is probably why antibiotic consumption by the hospital pharmacy was low during winter 2012 no obvious correlation between summer peaks for the measured antibiotics in ww and their respective consumption by the hospital pharmacy was shown supplementary table 7 and supplementary table 8 and supplementary figs 3b and 3c 4 discussion in the context of globally increasing amr wastewaters ww have been identified as sources for the spread of amr determinants arb args mges and chemical pollutants often pharmaceutical residues that may favor amr selection during wastewater treatment and in the receiving environment in this study we thoroughly monitored the resistome and microbiota dynamics of untreated and treated applying conventional secondary wwt hospital and urban ww over four years throughout the seasons in france we identified distinct and robust resistome and microbiota signatures in particular for untreated hww and uww indicating that hww and uww form distinct and stable ecological niches over time performing machine learning ml classified each of the ww with high accuracy and revealed top predictive genes gene classes and taxa for the respective ww sources before and after ww treatment supplementary fig 8 interestingly when collapsing data sets obtained from untreated and treated samples of the respective ww sources ml was able to predict hww and uww in general with more than 93 certainty on all predictor levels individual genes gene classes taxa supplementary fig 9 these top 10 predictors for hww and uww provide considerable marker gene classes individual genes and taxa for the respective ww sources that present targets for the monitoring and management of hww and uww for example the streptogramin resistance gene vatb and the transposase gene iss1n were significantly more abundant in uww compared to hww and seem to be specifically indicative for uww supplementary figs 8 and 9 based on the ml and multi variate analysis macrolide resistance genes also contribute to the specific resistome signature for uww supplementary figs 8 and 9 fig 5a considering the fact that macrolide and streptogramin antibiotics are more frequently prescribed in the community compared to the hospital environment in france could explain the high abundance of these gene classes in uww robert et al 2012 the antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin were detected in higher concentrations in hww compared to uww which may point towards a relationship of the measured antibiotics and the detected resistome in hww fig 5a and c interestingly the qnr genes encoding quinolone resistance in hww were the ones with the highest fold increase 161 fold between hww and uww as these genes are located on plasmids their higher abundance in hww indirectly reflects the likely abundance of bacteria harboring genetic elements involved in resistance dissemination as plasmids in hww indeed qnr genes have been described mainly in enterobacteriales carattoli 2009 rozwandowicz et al 2018 and we found that the relative abundance of enterobacteriales is higher in hww than in uww fig 3 the human gut microbiota is an important reservoir for args ruppe et al 2018 sommer et al 2010 and recently evidence based data showed that the occurrence and abundance of human fecal pollution correlates with high amounts of args in anthropogenically impacted environments karkman et al 2019 su et al 2017 the significant dilution of human gut bacteria in mww observed here even with an increased proportional contribution of hww to uww hww 33 4 compared to other study sites buelow et al 2018 pallares vega et al 2019 stalder et al 2014 is hence likely to explain the significant reduction of the abundance of gene classes after mixing hww with uww with respect to the reduction of normalized abundance of args and mges through secondary uww treatment we observed that the normalized cumulative abundance of six gene classes did not significantly decrease while one gene class sulphonamides did significantly increase table 2 fig 4 this may contribute to the dissemination of amr into the environment as discussed previously di cesare et al 2016 karkman et al 2016 lee et al 2017 pallares vega et al 2019 in addition the resistome monitored here exhibits a high mobilization potential due to the high proportion of mges integrons and args that are usually located on plasmids detected in all ww samples as well as in the receiving river waters fig 1 mges and integrons account for up to 60 of the resistome of treated effluents and river waters however specific is transposase genes are differentially abundant in both ww types supplementary fig 10 for example iss1n a member of the is6 family common in gram positive lactic acid bacteria haandrikman et al 1990 is more abundant in uww here identified as a specific uww marker supplementary figs 8 and 9 whereas is26 and tn3 are more abundant in hww these is are commonly found in gram negative bacteria in association with args harmer et al 2014 nicolas et al 2015 in order to improve wwt with respect to arg and arb removal advanced ww treatment such as disinfection by uv radiation or ozone treatment or physical treatment by ultrafiltration of ww are reported to be more efficient in reducing arb and args compared to conventionally applied secondary ww treatment gouliouris et al 2019 jäger et al 2018 the exposome a term originally coined in the context of human health epidemiology and referring to the totality of human environmental exposures wild 2005 here specifically refers to the chemical compounds quantified in our longitudinal study that represent partially the environmental or eco exposome escher et al 2017 of the ww microbiota for our study we focused on surfactants antibiotics and heavy metals anthropogenic pollution through micro pollutants present in ww has previously shown to have a negative impact on the environment cairns et al 2017 flandroy et al 2018 hendry et al 2017 palmer and hatley 2018 pereira and tagkopoulos 2019 for example high concentrations of antibiotics and cationic surfactants found in hww rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 szekeres et al 2017 varela et al 2014 and pharmaceutical production sites bengtsson palme et al 2018 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 have been correlated with a higher abundance of arbs args as well as higher abundance of mges and integrons rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 rowe et al 2017 stalder et al 2014 whereas anionic surfactants that are generally abundant in urban ww effluents untreated and treated uwws grey waters are associated with toxicity to aquatic and terrestrial environments jardak et al 2016 shafran et al 2005 siggins et al 2016 our study reports similar findings we observed that cationic surfactants and antibiotics are more abundant in hww supplementary table 6 and significantly correlated to the hww resistome fig 5 which reflects the frequent use of antibiotics and active surface agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds in hospitals interestingly we also found that qac genes were significantly higher in hww compared to uww the urban ww eco exposome on the other hand was found to be enriched with anionic surfactants supplementary table 6 which in turn were associated with the uww and mww resistome and microbiota fig 5 other parameters present in the eco exposome not measured here might also have an additional influence on the microbiota and resistome of wws for example streptogramin and macrolide antibiotics were not quantified in this study to investigate their putative association with the elevated presence of macrolide and streptogramin resistance genes in uww overall measures to reduce the load of micro pollutants in wws and the environment as a measure to reduce amr dissemination are currently discussed and warrant further attention kraemer et al 2019 pereira and tagkopoulos 2019 singer et al 2016 finally the observed peaks and variation during summer season for detected antibiotics individual resistance genes and gene classes in hww supplementary fig 3a and 3b and 4 may be due to dry season and warm temperatures during summer that could result in decreased flow rate of hww interestingly recently a potential association of rising temperatures with the globally increasing amr burden has been reported kaba et al 2020 macfadden et al 2018 our findings give further emphasis to the requirement of implementing and optimizing sanitation systems and operational wwtps on a global level particular in countries continents with poor water sanitation infrastructure and correlated high occurrence of multi resistant bacteria burgmann et al 2018 the elimination of pollution by means of human feces and bacterial taxa associated through advanced or selective ww treatment may further aid in limiting the release of args associated with human gut bacteria and pathogens gouliouris et al 2019 karkman et al 2019 pehrsson et al 2016 finally the data generated by this study are of important interest to policy makers concerning the risks associated with h and u ww their putative implication into the dissemination of amr and provide further evidence towards the necessity of environmental pollution management in the battle of amr and other important global health factors such as the preservation of biodiversity and the prevention of climate change hendry et al 2017 5 conclusion hospital and urban wastewater resistome and microbiota are remarkably stable over time and display unique signatures the differences between h and u ww signatures are in line with the differences in antibiotic exposure in both settings and may in addition be shaped by non antibiotic substances in the monitored eco exposome we confirm that hospital ww contains significantly higher loads of args mges and integrons and demonstrate that it is significantly enriched with a human gut associated microbiota compared to urban ww we suggest that ww mixing of h and u ww 1 2 bares no greater risk than separate treatment in order to lower the emissions of args mges and arb by hww advanced removal of micro pollutants such as heavy metals biocides surfactants and antibiotics is crucial to reduce the environmental risk

19996,wastewaters ww are important sources for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance amr into the environment hospital ww hww contain higher loads of micro pollutants and amr markers than urban ww uww little is known about the long term dynamics of h and u ww and the impact of their joined treatment on the general burden of amr here we characterized the resistome microbiota and eco exposome signature of 126 h and u ww samples treated separately for three years and then mixed over one year multi variate analysis and machine learning revealed a robust signature for each ww with no significant variation over time before mixing and once mixed both ww closely resembled urban signatures we demonstrated a significant impact of pharmaceuticals and surfactants on the resistome and

implicated in resistance to antimicrobial compounds allen et al 2010 canton 2009 human activity has a significant impact on the terrestrial and aquatic microbial ecosystems through chemical pollutants that are spread via urban agricultural and industrial waste and which pose an important selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance amr flandroy et al 2018 for instance urban and hospital wastewaters uww and hww contain a high diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes args and chemicals buelow et al 2018 jin et al 2018 manaia et al 2018 wang et al 2018 it is generally accepted that the implementation of efficient wastewater treatment plants wwtp is essential in order to reduce the amounts of chemicals args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs that reach the environment buelow et al 2018 chonova et al 2016 larsson et al 2018 despite the global reduction of arbs args and chemical compounds such as antibiotics abs biocides and heavy metals through ww treatment effluents from urban hospital and industrial wastewater that are re introduced into the environment still contain moderate levels of those contaminants manaia et al 2018 pallares vega et al 2019 raheem et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 hwws have been reported to contain particularly high amounts of args arbs and abs buelow et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 wang et al 2018 it has been debated whether hww contributes significantly to the load of args in the uww systems and whether separate treatment for hwws should be applied buelow et al 2018 chonova et al 2016 lienert et al 2011 recent work has shown that hww has limited impact on the relative levels of args and mobile genetic elements mges associated with args like integrons in hospital receiving urban wastewater ww buelow et al 2018 pallares vega et al 2019 stalder et al 2014 however most studies usually analyzed a limited number of samples and yet longitudinal studies that monitor ww dynamics are so far lacking which limits the possibility of assessing the risk for amr mediated through ww we collected 126 ww samples uww hww and mixed ww in a french city during a period of approximately four years 34 months with separate treatments for h and u ww applying the conventional secondary activated sludge treatment process and 11 months with h and u ww mixed 1 2 hww uww into one system from those we investigated the dynamics and relationship of the respective resistome and microbiota with the measured eco exposome pharmaceuticals mainly antibiotics surfactants and heavy metals multi variate analysis and machine learning were employed to evaluate signatures of the resistome microbiota and eco exposome of hww compared to uww 2 materials and methods 2 1 1 sampling and study design 126 urban and hospital wastewater uww and hww samples were collected in scientrier bellecombe wwtp haute savoie france chonova et al 2018 as part of the multi disciplinary project sipibel chonova et al 2018 the study site was implemented as an observatory for untreated and treated h and u ww and to evaluate their impact during separate and subsequently mixed treatment on the environment e g the effluent receiving river the chal hospital centre hospitalier alpes léman opened in february 2012 and includes 450 beds 140 m3 d whereas the bellecombe wwtp was collecting uww of approximately 21 000 inhabitant equivalents 5200 m3 d for more details of the sipibel project study set up wwt and sample collection refer to chonova et al 2018 and wiest et al chonova et al 2018 wiest et al 2018 and to fig 1 samples were collected in monthly intervals untreated and treated samples by flow proportional sampling from march 2012 through november 2015 chonova et al 2018 from march 2012 to december 2014 uww and hww were treated separately applying the same conventional activated sludge wwt chonova et al 2018 wiest et al 2018 then in the period from january 2015 through november 2015 uww was mixed into the hww 1 2 ratio hww uww the ratio was fixed by a local operating constraint and added to the separate hww treatment line resulting in a controlled mixed ww mww chonova et al 2018 in addition 12 water samples of the effluent receiving river up river upstream and downstream river downstream sampling point 1 and 2 of the effluent release pipes have been collected during the winter months of 2013 january february november and december 2 2 dna extraction sample preparation water samples were filtered for microorganisms using a filtration ramp sartorius göttingen germany on sterile 47 mm diameter filter with pore size of 0 45 μm sartorius göttingen germany microorganisms were recovered from filters and subject to dna extraction for downstream analysis using the power water dna extraction kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa dna concentration was determined by qubit fluoremetric quantitation thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa assays according the manufacturer s instructions all dna samples were diluted or concentrated to a final concentration of 10 ng μl for downstream qpcr and 16s rrna analysis 2 3 1 high throughput qpcr nanolitre scale quantitative pcrs to quantify levels of genes that confer resistance to antimicrobials and heavy metals were performed as described previously buelow et al 2018 2017 with some modifications in the collection of primers the primer sequences and their targets are provided in the supplementary data supplementary table 1 in total we targeted 88 individual resistance genes conferring resistance to antibiotics quaternary ammonium compounds or heavy metals grouped into 16 resistance gene classes the genes targeted include args that are most commonly detected in the gut microbiota of healthy individuals forslund et al 2013 hu et al 2013 clinically relevant args including genes encoding extended spectrum β lactamases esbls carbapenemases and vancomycin resistance and heavy metal and quaternary ammonium compound resistance genes suggested to favor cross and co selection for args in the environment gnanadhas et al 2013 pal et al 2015 we also targeted genetic elements as important transposase gene families zhu et al 2013 and class 1 2 and 3 integron integrase genes by primers described previously barraud et al 2010 that are important vectors for args in the clinics and often used as proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 finally we targeted the bacterial 16s rrna gene by universal primers gene targets and grouping of genes into gene classes according to function are detailed in supplementary tables 1 and 2 primer design and validation prior and after biomark analysis has been done as described earlier buelow et al 2018 2017 real time pcr analysis was performed using the 96 96 biomark dynamic array for real time pcr fluidigm corporation san francisco ca u s a as described previously buelow et al 2018 2017 thermal cycling and real time imaging was performed at the plateforme génomique get inra transfert https get genotoul fr en and ct values were extracted using the biomark real time pcr analysis software 2 3 2 calculation of normalized abundance and cumulative abundance calculations for normalized and cumulative abundance of individual genes and allocated gene classes was done as described previously buelow et al 2018 2017 specifically normalized abundance of resistance genes was calculated relative to the abundance of the 16s rrna gene 2 ctarg ct16s rrna cumulative abundance of each resistance gene class was calculated based on the sum of the normalized abundance 2 ctarg ct16s rrna of all individual genes detected within a class for each sample the differences in cumulative abundance over the indicated time periods and sample locations untreated and treated hospital and urban wastewaters 2012 2014 up and downstream river samples 2013 untreated and treated mixed wastewaters 2015 are shown as an averaged fold change standard deviation the non parametric mann whitney test was used to test for significance p values were corrected for multiple testing by the benjamin hochberg procedure benjamini and hochberg 1995 with a false discovery rate of 0 05 averaged normalized abundance data for allocated gene classes is provided in supplementary table 3 2 4 qpcr to determine absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes bacterial biomass the qpcrs for the determination of 16s rrna gene copy numbers per liters of water as a proxy for the bacterial biomass was performed as described previously by stalder et al stalder et al 2014 2 5 16s rrna gene sequencing and sequence data pre processing extracted dna samples for 16s rrna sequencing were prepared following a dual barcoded two step pcr procedure for amplicon sequencing for illumina primers of the first pcr step included universal cs1 and cs2 tags targeting the v4 region of the hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene using the 16srrna primer sequences of the earth microbiota project http press igsb anl gov earthmicrobiota protocols and standards 16s samples were sequenced following the illumina protocol for a 2 301 miseq run illumina inc san diego ca sequence reads from the illumina miseq were demultiplexed and classified in the following manner the python application dbcamplicons https github com msettles dbcamplicons was used to identify and assign reads to the appropriate sample by both expected barcode and primer sequences barcodes were allowed to have at most 1 mismatch hamming distance and primers were allowed to have at most 4 mismatches levenshtein distance as long as the final 4 bases of the primer matched the target sequence perfectly reads were then trimmed of their primer sequence and merged into a single amplicon sequence using the application flash magoc and salzberg 2011 2 5 1 16s rrna data analysis illumina miseq forward and reverse reads were processed using the masque pipeline https github com aghozlane masque briefly raw reads are filtered and combined followed by dereplication chimera removal and clustering are followed by taxonomic annotation of the resulting otus by comparison to the silva database a biom file is generated that combines both otu taxonomic assignment and the number of matching reads for each sample relative abundance levels form bacterial taxa order level were obtained and analyzed the obtained relative abundance otu tables order level were analyzed with microsoft excel supplementary table 4 multi variate analysis package see below and by means of a machine learning approach employing a random forest algorithm see below 2 6 chemical analysis all chemical data measured here and used for analysis where extracted from the sipibel database solid phase extraction spe and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were used to measure the antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine as detailed elsewhere wiest et al 2018 heavy metals zn cu ni pb cr gd hg as and cd were measured with inductively coupled plasma combined with atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes concentration of surfactants anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants were measured following standard methods approved by the french organization of standardization afnor as described by wiest et al wiest et al 2018 2 7 multivariate analyses multivariate statistical techniques were used to test the influence of waste water treatment or sampling time independent variables on the microbiota and the resistome dependent variables of the different sample groups urban hospital mixed including all individual genes and genes allocated into gene classes in two independent datasets statistically significant influence of the treatment or the sampling time on the microbiota and the resistome were assessed by redundancy analysis rda with 499 monte carlo permutations for testing the influence of sampling time we used sampling year or season as independent variables and all different sample groups together i e to potentially identify general patterns influencing all groups at the same time and individually as dependent variables such analysis revealed the percentage of variance that is explained by sampling time or ww treatment in each case and whether the influence of the independent variables is statistically significant or not the relationship between the resistome and the microbiota and the measured chemicals in the different raw water samples eco exposome was visualized by means of principal component analysis pca biplots moreover the influence of the measured chemicals eco exposome on the microbiota and resistome was statistically assessed by rda a variation partitioning analysis was performed to assess which group of chemicals metals pharmaceuticals surfactants explains the largest share of the variation of the microbiota and resistome datasets and to explore whether the interactive effects of the groups of chemicals would have a larger influence on those datasets than the individual groups themselves all multivariate analyses were performed with the canoco v5 0 software ter braak and smilauer 2012 using a significance level of 0 05 2 8 machine learning a random forest algorithm rfa was used in order to predict a response variable wastewater sample type urban hospital or mixed of each sample independently using measurements on individual gene gene class and microbiota level predictor variables to run the rfa the r package randomforest was used breiman and cutler s random forests for classification and regression a software package for the r statistical environment breiman 2001 in summary the rfa follows the pseudo steps i the response variable and predictor variables are chosen by the user ii a predefined number of independent bootstrap samples are drawn from the dataset with replacement and a classification tree is fit to each sample containing roughly 2 3 of the data for which predictor variable selection on each node split in the tree is conducted using only a small random subset of predictor variables iii the complete set of trees one for each bootstrap sample composes the random forest rf from which the status classification of the response variable is predicted as an average majority vote of the predictions of all trees compared to single classification trees rfa increases prediction accuracy since the ensemble of slight different classification results adjusts for the instability of the individual trees and avoids data overfitting hastie et al 2009 the mean decrease accuracy mda or breiman cutler importance was employed as a measure of predictor variable importance for which classification accuracy after data permutation of a predictor variable is subtracted from the accuracy without permutation and averaged over all trees in the rf to give an importance value 2 it should be noted that since all predictor variables were of numeric nature using rfa is equivalent to regression over classification trees for the results presented here and in supplementary text only the 2 5 of top rfa scores were considered as presented by the resulting mda distribution of all predictor variables thus selecting the subset of predictor variables which appear statistically more informative than expected in the background of all predictor variables i e we assume that 95 of the rfa scores fall between the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles as done elsewhere lourenco et al 2017 3 results 3 1 hww and uww resistome and microbiota signatures we evaluated the resistome and microbiota dynamics of monthly ww n 126 and river n 12 samples h and u ww samples were treated separately through 2012 and 2014 and were mixed at a ratio of 1 2 hww uww throughout the year 2015 fig 1 h and u ww samples exhibited a distinct signature with respect to the proportional makeup of their resistome fig 2 a and microbiota fig 2b analyzing the data with a random forest machine learning approach showed that the distinct h and u ww signatures resulted in a high prediction accuracy when using the resistome as predictor on the level of gene classes 93 5 and 96 7 of untreated hww and uww samples respectively could be correctly classified supplementary fig 1a we further analyzed the data on the individual gene level to increase resolution of the machine learning approach using individual genes resulted in similarly high predictions 93 5 prediction for untreated hww and 100 prediction for untreated uww supplementary fig 1b similarly when using the microbiota 96 8 of untreated hww and 89 of untreated uww samples were correctly classified supplementary fig 1c for the treated h and u ww the machine learning prediction accuracy was lower compared to the untreated ww sources but still considerably high for all predictor levels and in particular for the microbiota 80 supplementary fig 2 for the mww overall classification success was lower supplementary figs 1 and 2 given a much lower sample size and likely due to the mixing of the two wastewater sources hampering clear signatures 3 2 temporal dynamics of h and u ww redundancy analysis rda was performed to assess putative significant influences of time on the variability of resistome and microbiota compositions using sampling year or season as independent variables monte carlo mc permutations n 499 analysis was carried out for all different sample groups together untreated u h m ww and treated u h m ww to potentially identify general patterns influencing all groups at the same time the same analysis was also performed per individual sample group untreated and treated h u and m ww alone respectively over the first 3 years before mixing of untreated hww and uww neither year p 0 6 resistome and p 0 4 microbiota respectively nor season p 0 9 and p 0 3 had a significant impact on the resistome resistance gene classes and microbiota composition of the ww supplementary table 5a however by analyzing the sample groups separately a yearly and seasonal impact on the level of individual resistance genes in hww was demonstrated p 0 004 year p 0 032 season supplementary table 5b redundancy analysis revealed the relationship between individual genes and gene classes with seasons pointing towards a correlation of increased normalized abundance of individual genes and gene classes detected during summer season supplementary figs 3a and 4 the fact that the hospital was only installed in february 2012 chonova et al 2018 may explain why the year 2012 is particular for hww resistome with overall lower normalized abundance of the resistome and no obvious trend towards the summer season in 2012 after hww and uww mixing in 2015 no significant variation for the resistome and microbiota composition throughout the seasons could be observed considering all sample groups untreated mww hww and uww p 0 6 resistome and p 0 07 microbiota respectively supplementary table 5a for treated ww the analysis exhibited more variation of the resistome and microbiota composition compared to the untreated sources over the years 2012 2014 for h and u ww fig 2 supplementary table 5c redundancy analysis revealed that in particular the microbiota of treated h and u ww effluents varied between the years p 0 016 for all groups p 0 024 for treated hww and p 0 006 for treated uww supplementary tables 5c and 5d while no significant seasonal impact could be observed the resistome varied between the years for treated hww on both the gene class and the individual gene levels p 0 012 and p 0 004 supplementary table 5d whereas for the treated uww this variation was only significant on the individual gene level p 0 032 for the treated mixed ww mww significant seasonal variation was observed for the microbiota composition p 0 02 while for the resistome no significant variation could be observed supplementary table 5d 3 3 human gut bacteria in hww and uww the microbiota of the respective ww was assessed by 16s rrna sequencing we calculated the relative abundance of anaerobic human gut bacteria as well as enterobacteriales since many of these gram negative bacteria are also pathogens the orders clostridiales bifidobacteriales and bacteroidales which represent the most important and abundant anaerobic human gut bacteria costea et al 2018 rajilic stojanovic and de vos 2014 were grouped together and are referred to as anaerobic human gut bacteria untreated hww contained significantly higher levels of anaerobic human gut bacteria 38 11 standard deviation and enterobacteriales 2 1 5 compared to all other samples fig 3 a interestingly anaerobic human gut bacteria and enterobacteriales are comparable in their relative abundance for untreated uww and mww indicating a significant dilution effect when mixing uww with hww fig 3b on the monitored human gut microbiota markers in ww the ww treatment allowed a significant p 0 05 decrease of the relative abundance of these orders for hww and uww fig 3 whereas the reduction for mww was only marginally significant p 0 05 fig 3b 3 4 the untreated hww uww and mww resistome to verify that the differences we observed for the args mges between effluents were not due to variations in the bacterial biomass we assessed the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes per liter of water and showed that the bacterial biomass was comparable for the untreated ww sources hww uww and mww supplementary fig 5 ratios of hww over uww and hww over mww were calculated based on the averaged cumulative abundance of the resistome in untreated hww and uww table 1 the untreated hww contained significantly more gene classes compared to the untreated uww between 3 transposase genes and 161 fold qnr genes encoding quinolone resistance higher p values 0 004 table 1 when ww were mixed at the experimental ratio of 1 2 hww uww the untreated mww contained significantly less resistance gene classes compared to untreated hww between 3 and 22 fold lower p values 0 03 interestingly there was no significant difference for the genes encoding resistance to macrolides for both hww over uww and hww over mww comparisons table 1 fig 4 the only resistance gene significantly lower in hww compared to uww or mww p 0 0001 was the streptogramin resistance gene vatb the meca gene encoding resistance to methicillin was undetectable in all uww and in all but one mww samples table 1 3 5 resistome before and after ww treatment the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes per liter of water for all ww sources decreased by 2 3 log after ww treatment supplementary fig 5 indicating that secondary ww treatment did reduce total bacterial loads in similar orders of magnitude in the hospital and urban ww treatment plant to estimate the impact of ww treatment on the resistome fold changes of normalized cumulative abundance of untreated over treated h u and m ww were calculated the normalized cumulative abundance of all gene classes significantly decreased and was between 78 times for genes conferring resistance to quinolones and 5 times for genes conferring resistance to qacs sulphonamides and genes encoding transposase genes lower in the treated hww compared to untreated hww p 0 003 table 2 fig 4 when comparing untreated uww to treated uww we showed a significant reduction p 0 05 in the normalized cumulative abundance for nine resistance gene classes with fold changes between 43 for the streptogramin resistance gene vatb and three for genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides times table 2 fig 4 no significant reduction in normalized abundance was observed after treatment of uww for gene classes conferring resistance to bacitracin beta lactams quinolones heavy metals and quaternary ammonium compounds and for genes encoding integron integrases surprisingly sulphonamide resistance encoding genes were found to be significantly enriched in normalized abundance after uww treatment p 0 05 table 2 fig 4 for mww a similar removal efficacy as for uww could be observed table 2 fig 4b with significant decrease for the normalized cumulative abundance of 10 gene classes and with fold changes between 41 for the streptogramin resistance gene vatb and three for the genes encoding integron integrase genes times no significant decrease for gene classes conferring resistance to bacitracin beta lactams tetracycline heavy metals qacs and sulphonamides could be detected 3 6 impact of treated hospital ww on the receiving river we also analyzed 12 river samples up and downstream the wwtps to evaluate putatively associated risks with the release of the treated ww into the effluent receiving river and downstream environment supplementary fig 6 the resistome for the river samples collected for the sites up ri and downstream ri1 and ri2 of the effluent release pipes during winter season 2013 was not significantly different for either of the three sampling sites supplementary fig 6 there was no significant difference of the normalized abundance for any of the detected gene classes in the river samples compared to treated uww on the contrary the normalized abundance of nine resistance gene classes including genes encoding mges and integron integrase genes was significantly lower p 0 04 in all river samples when compared to treated hww supplementary fig 6 3 7 correlation analysis between the eco exposome and the microbiome and resistome of hospital and urban ww in order to estimate the eco exposome in the ww selected pharmaceutical and chemical compounds including antibiotics surfactants and heavy metals were quantified in untreated ww supplementary table 6 the association between the resistome microbiota and the eco exposome was visualized by means of principal component analysis pca biplots here hww and uww form two distinct clusters while the mww clusters closely to the uww for both resistome and microbiota fig 5 a and b antibiotics non ionic and cationic surfactants are closely associated with the respective hww resistome and microbiota length of arrows while anionic surfactants and some metals are more associated with the resistome and microbiota of the uww fig 5a and b redundancy analysis rda was performed to statistically asses the association of the monitored eco exposome with the variation of the resistome and microbiota the results of the monte carlo permutations indicated that the eco exposome significantly influences the resistome and microbiota p values 0 002 finally a variation partitioning analysis was performed to study which group of the measured compounds heavy metals pharmaceuticals surfactants might have a larger contribution on the resistome and microbiota variation and to explore whether the interaction between these compounds has a stronger influence than the individually grouped compounds pharmaceuticals the antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin and the neurological drug carbamazepine are more associated with the variance for the resistome while the surfactants are associated with the variation for the microbiota fig 5c and d finally we showed that the interaction between pharmaceuticals and surfactants contributes more to the variability in the resistome than the individual compounds alone fig 5c and d we also collected data on the consumption of three antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin by the hospital pharmacy over the period of 2012 2014 that were summarized here as gram per season supplementary table 7 and supplementary fig 3c the studied hospital site has just been opened in the winter month of february 2012 which is probably why antibiotic consumption by the hospital pharmacy was low during winter 2012 no obvious correlation between summer peaks for the measured antibiotics in ww and their respective consumption by the hospital pharmacy was shown supplementary table 7 and supplementary table 8 and supplementary figs 3b and 3c 4 discussion in the context of globally increasing amr wastewaters ww have been identified as sources for the spread of amr determinants arb args mges and chemical pollutants often pharmaceutical residues that may favor amr selection during wastewater treatment and in the receiving environment in this study we thoroughly monitored the resistome and microbiota dynamics of untreated and treated applying conventional secondary wwt hospital and urban ww over four years throughout the seasons in france we identified distinct and robust resistome and microbiota signatures in particular for untreated hww and uww indicating that hww and uww form distinct and stable ecological niches over time performing machine learning ml classified each of the ww with high accuracy and revealed top predictive genes gene classes and taxa for the respective ww sources before and after ww treatment supplementary fig 8 interestingly when collapsing data sets obtained from untreated and treated samples of the respective ww sources ml was able to predict hww and uww in general with more than 93 certainty on all predictor levels individual genes gene classes taxa supplementary fig 9 these top 10 predictors for hww and uww provide considerable marker gene classes individual genes and taxa for the respective ww sources that present targets for the monitoring and management of hww and uww for example the streptogramin resistance gene vatb and the transposase gene iss1n were significantly more abundant in uww compared to hww and seem to be specifically indicative for uww supplementary figs 8 and 9 based on the ml and multi variate analysis macrolide resistance genes also contribute to the specific resistome signature for uww supplementary figs 8 and 9 fig 5a considering the fact that macrolide and streptogramin antibiotics are more frequently prescribed in the community compared to the hospital environment in france could explain the high abundance of these gene classes in uww robert et al 2012 the antibiotics ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin were detected in higher concentrations in hww compared to uww which may point towards a relationship of the measured antibiotics and the detected resistome in hww fig 5a and c interestingly the qnr genes encoding quinolone resistance in hww were the ones with the highest fold increase 161 fold between hww and uww as these genes are located on plasmids their higher abundance in hww indirectly reflects the likely abundance of bacteria harboring genetic elements involved in resistance dissemination as plasmids in hww indeed qnr genes have been described mainly in enterobacteriales carattoli 2009 rozwandowicz et al 2018 and we found that the relative abundance of enterobacteriales is higher in hww than in uww fig 3 the human gut microbiota is an important reservoir for args ruppe et al 2018 sommer et al 2010 and recently evidence based data showed that the occurrence and abundance of human fecal pollution correlates with high amounts of args in anthropogenically impacted environments karkman et al 2019 su et al 2017 the significant dilution of human gut bacteria in mww observed here even with an increased proportional contribution of hww to uww hww 33 4 compared to other study sites buelow et al 2018 pallares vega et al 2019 stalder et al 2014 is hence likely to explain the significant reduction of the abundance of gene classes after mixing hww with uww with respect to the reduction of normalized abundance of args and mges through secondary uww treatment we observed that the normalized cumulative abundance of six gene classes did not significantly decrease while one gene class sulphonamides did significantly increase table 2 fig 4 this may contribute to the dissemination of amr into the environment as discussed previously di cesare et al 2016 karkman et al 2016 lee et al 2017 pallares vega et al 2019 in addition the resistome monitored here exhibits a high mobilization potential due to the high proportion of mges integrons and args that are usually located on plasmids detected in all ww samples as well as in the receiving river waters fig 1 mges and integrons account for up to 60 of the resistome of treated effluents and river waters however specific is transposase genes are differentially abundant in both ww types supplementary fig 10 for example iss1n a member of the is6 family common in gram positive lactic acid bacteria haandrikman et al 1990 is more abundant in uww here identified as a specific uww marker supplementary figs 8 and 9 whereas is26 and tn3 are more abundant in hww these is are commonly found in gram negative bacteria in association with args harmer et al 2014 nicolas et al 2015 in order to improve wwt with respect to arg and arb removal advanced ww treatment such as disinfection by uv radiation or ozone treatment or physical treatment by ultrafiltration of ww are reported to be more efficient in reducing arb and args compared to conventionally applied secondary ww treatment gouliouris et al 2019 jäger et al 2018 the exposome a term originally coined in the context of human health epidemiology and referring to the totality of human environmental exposures wild 2005 here specifically refers to the chemical compounds quantified in our longitudinal study that represent partially the environmental or eco exposome escher et al 2017 of the ww microbiota for our study we focused on surfactants antibiotics and heavy metals anthropogenic pollution through micro pollutants present in ww has previously shown to have a negative impact on the environment cairns et al 2017 flandroy et al 2018 hendry et al 2017 palmer and hatley 2018 pereira and tagkopoulos 2019 for example high concentrations of antibiotics and cationic surfactants found in hww rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 szekeres et al 2017 varela et al 2014 and pharmaceutical production sites bengtsson palme et al 2018 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 have been correlated with a higher abundance of arbs args as well as higher abundance of mges and integrons rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 rowe et al 2017 stalder et al 2014 whereas anionic surfactants that are generally abundant in urban ww effluents untreated and treated uwws grey waters are associated with toxicity to aquatic and terrestrial environments jardak et al 2016 shafran et al 2005 siggins et al 2016 our study reports similar findings we observed that cationic surfactants and antibiotics are more abundant in hww supplementary table 6 and significantly correlated to the hww resistome fig 5 which reflects the frequent use of antibiotics and active surface agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds in hospitals interestingly we also found that qac genes were significantly higher in hww compared to uww the urban ww eco exposome on the other hand was found to be enriched with anionic surfactants supplementary table 6 which in turn were associated with the uww and mww resistome and microbiota fig 5 other parameters present in the eco exposome not measured here might also have an additional influence on the microbiota and resistome of wws for example streptogramin and macrolide antibiotics were not quantified in this study to investigate their putative association with the elevated presence of macrolide and streptogramin resistance genes in uww overall measures to reduce the load of micro pollutants in wws and the environment as a measure to reduce amr dissemination are currently discussed and warrant further attention kraemer et al 2019 pereira and tagkopoulos 2019 singer et al 2016 finally the observed peaks and variation during summer season for detected antibiotics individual resistance genes and gene classes in hww supplementary fig 3a and 3b and 4 may be due to dry season and warm temperatures during summer that could result in decreased flow rate of hww interestingly recently a potential association of rising temperatures with the globally increasing amr burden has been reported kaba et al 2020 macfadden et al 2018 our findings give further emphasis to the requirement of implementing and optimizing sanitation systems and operational wwtps on a global level particular in countries continents with poor water sanitation infrastructure and correlated high occurrence of multi resistant bacteria burgmann et al 2018 the elimination of pollution by means of human feces and bacterial taxa associated through advanced or selective ww treatment may further aid in limiting the release of args associated with human gut bacteria and pathogens gouliouris et al 2019 karkman et al 2019 pehrsson et al 2016 finally the data generated by this study are of important interest to policy makers concerning the risks associated with h and u ww their putative implication into the dissemination of amr and provide further evidence towards the necessity of environmental pollution management in the battle of amr and other important global health factors such as the preservation of biodiversity and the prevention of climate change hendry et al 2017 5 conclusion hospital and urban wastewater resistome and microbiota are remarkably stable over time and display unique signatures the differences between h and u ww signatures are in line with the differences in antibiotic exposure in both settings and may in addition be shaped by non antibiotic substances in the monitored eco exposome we confirm that hospital ww contains significantly higher loads of args mges and integrons and demonstrate that it is significantly enriched with a human gut associated microbiota compared to urban ww we suggest that ww mixing of h and u ww 1 2 bares no greater risk than separate treatment in

19997,simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd is in theory a key advantage of aerobic granular sludge systems over conventional activated sludge systems but practical experience and literature suggests that snd and thus total nitrogen removal are limited during treatment of municipal wastewater using ags systems this study thus aims at quantifying the extent and understanding the mechanisms of snd during treatment of municipal wastewater with aerobic granular sludge ags systems experiments long term and batch tests as well as mathematical modelling were performed our experimental results demonstrate that snd is significantly limited during treatment of low strength municipal wastewater with ags systems 14 39 while almost full snd is observed when treating synthetic influent containing only diffusible substrate 90 our simulations demonstrate that the main mechanisms behind limited snd are 1 the dynamics of anoxic zone formation inside the granule 2 the diffusibility and availability of electron donors in those zones and 3 the aeration mode the development of anoxic zones is driven by the utilisation of oxygen in the upper layers of the granule leading to transport limitations of oxygen inside the granule this effect is closely linked to granule size and wastewater composition development of anoxic zones during the aerobic phase is limited for small granules at constant aeration at bulk dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mgo2 l 1 and anoxic zones only develop during a brief period of the aerated phase for large granules modelling results further indicate that a large fraction of electron donors are actually utilised in aerobic rather than anoxic redox zones in the bulk or at the granule surface thus full snd cannot be achieved with ags treating low strength municipal wastewater if a constant do is maintained during the aeration phase optimised aeration strategies are therefore required 2 step and alternating aeration are tested successfully using mathematical modelling and increase tn removal to 40 79 without compromising nitrification and by shifting electron donor utilisation towards anoxic redox conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge municipal wastewater simultaneous nitrification denitrification total nitrogen removal aeration strategy 1 introduction van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 in ags systems mass transfer is limited by diffusion which leads to concentration gradients of electron donors final acceptors within the granules during the aerated phase an oxygen gradient develops within the granules whereby the outer layers are aerobic and the inner core is anoxic or anaerobic de kreuk et al 2007a those different redox conditions within the granules allow nitrifying denitrifying and facultative anaerobic organisms to coexist winkler et al 2013 as a result it is usually well accepted that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd is a key feature of ags and that snd is the main nitrogen removal pathway in ags systems de kreuk et al 2005 adav et al 2008 pronk et al 2015 in theory complete total nitrogen tn removal via snd could be achieved in one single reactor and within a single aerobic phase of the sbr cycle however when analysing data from literature it is less evident that high tn removal via snd occurs in ags systems treating municipal wastewater mww fig 1 snd efficiencies reported for lab scale ags systems fed with synthetic influent mostly volatile fatty acids vfa are highly variable values ranging from 10 to 100 are reported for different dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the bulk liquid kocaturk and erguder 2016 de kreuk et al 2005 lochmatter et al 2013 but for those systems high snd efficiencies of more than 75 are typically observed for do values below 4 mgo2 l 1 fig 1 in ags systems fed with mww snd efficiencies smaller than 50 on average are on the contrary reported fig 1 pronk et al 2015 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 lashkarizadeh et al 2015 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 wagner et al 2015 high variability of snd and or low efficiencies lead to high tn and no3 effluent concentrations in the case of ags sbr operation without explicit anoxic phases low snd and tn removal of ags is problematic in areas with stringent treatment requirements it is therefore crucial to understand the extent and mechanisms of snd in order to further optimise tn removal of ags systems snd requires 1 simultaneous occurrence of aerobic for nitrification and anoxic for denitrification redox conditions and 2 electron donor availability in anoxic redox conditions for denitrification fig 1 illustrates both effects lower do concentrations generally tend to increase snd performances in both activated sludge and ags systems pochana and keller 1999 zeng et al 2003 third et al 2003 he et al 2017 2019 in activated sludge flocs anoxic micro zones form due to high oxygen utilisation rates at the surface of the flocs li and bishop 2004 or by maintaining a bulk dissolved oxygen do concentrations below the oxygen half saturation constant ko2 of denitrifying organisms daigger et al 2007 operation of activated sludge system at a do set point below ko2 thus results in snd without strict anoxic conditions in comparison to activated sludge larger snd efficiencies are observed for ags systems across all do concentrations fig 1 green and orange dots higher snd in ags systems results from the formation of anoxic zones inside the granules which is driven by the limited diffusion of oxygen and simultaneous diffusion production of no3 another important observation is the distinct snd efficiency of ags fed by synthetic ww mostly composed of readily available vfa vs real mww fig 1 indeed the type of electron donor and its availability partially determines snd efficiency pochana and keller 1999 therefore the distinct effects of the electron donor availability type and anoxic zone formation on snd in ags systems need to be clarified ags systems treating low strength mww are typically characterized by slower start up more heterogeneous granule sizes lower granule fractions and an increased floc fraction in comparison to vfa only ww fed ags layer et al 2019 the size of granules vary from d 0 5 mm or smaller after few months ni et al 2009 liu et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 layer et al 2019 up to d 2 mm after few years of operation pronk et al 2015 the granule size together with the penetration depth of o2 in theory determines the extent of anoxic zone formation inside the deeper layers of the granule li et al 2008 if the granule diameter impacts the penetration of o2 it is then key to evaluate the mechanisms of snd for both small several hundred μm and large several mm granules representative of young and mature granules respectively the extent of anoxic zones in smaller granules might thus limit snd compared to larger granules another determinant of the extent of snd is the availability of diffusible electron donors in the anoxic zones municipal ww contains a large fraction of electron donors in the non diffusible particulate form xb typically representing 50 of the total chemical oxygen demand cod metcalf and eddy 2014 if most of the electron donors contained in mww are not diffusible it is then hypothesized that denitrification might also be limited during treatment of mww understanding the distinct effects of the ww compositions and granule sizes on anoxic zone formation and electron donor availability and in turn on the snd and tn removal in ags systems is therefore crucial the objectives of this study were therefore 1 to experimentally assess that snd and thus tn removal is limited during treatment of low strength mww in comparison to 100 vfa synthetic ww and 2 to then identify which mechanisms limit the extent of snd e g the dynamic of anoxic zone formation the availability of different electron donors inside the granules and 3 to identify how to improve snd and tn removal by optimising the aeration strategies in ags systems 2 step aeration alternating aeration both experiments and mathematical modelling were conducted snd and tn removal were quantified during long term and batch experiments for different ags systems fed with different ww to better understand the influence of do influent ww and sludge composition on the snd efficiency an ags model was then used to identify the effect of 1 electron donor availability and contribution to snd and 2 anoxic zone formation inside the granules the ags model was then used to evaluate different aeration strategies in order to maximize tn removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach and reactor configuration ags were cultivated in 13 l column sbrs fed with 100 vfa synthetic r1 complex synthetic r2 primary effluent r3 and raw ww r4 respectively layer et al 2019 influent composition in terms of electron donor was either very simple only soluble and highly diffusible organic acids r1 or increasingly complex in terms of electron donor composition r2 r3 and r4 table 1 all systems were operated at constant volume and sbr cycles were as follows anaerobic plug flow feeding 1 5 h aerobic phase 4 h settling variable time and excess sludge removal after settling the total cycle length was 5 6 h the do concentration during the aerobic phase was controlled at a set point of 2 mg o2 l 1 constant do the settling and biomass properties of the different ags grown with different influent compositions were characterised table 1 snd was assessed based on both long term performances at constant do concentrations and ex situ batch tests at various do concentrations long term nitrification and denitrification performances and effluent quality tn nh4 etc were monitored for 300 400 days batch tests were performed on days 173 and 174 r1 195 and 196 r2 174 and 183 r3 and 85 and 86 r4 of operation after establishment of granulation for those batch tests ags was fed anaerobically during a regular sbr cycle followed by aeration at different do concentrations in fully mixed conditions 0 5 6 0 mgo2 l 1 mixing was provided by a stirrer and aeration 2 2 modelling 2 2 1 model description a mathematical model was used to identify the mechanisms governing snd in ags systems and test aeration strategies that optimise tn removal in ags systems the ags model consists of 1 a biofilm model 2 a biokinetic model and 3 a reactor model fig 2 biofilm model the biofilm model is based on the 1 dimensional wanner reichert mixed culture biofilm model wanner and reichert 1996 implemented in sumo software version 16 dynamita france dynamita 2019 the main difference between the wanner reichert and the sumo biofilm models are that biofilm thickness is fixed as an input in the sumo biofilm model while it is predicted in the wanner reichert model in sumo the granule compartments are modelled as a sphere subdivided into n 10 layers and the individual layer area is calculated as a function of depth within the granule fig 2 the total volume of granules is considered constant in the model the biofilm model predicts mass transfer processes between and within the fully mixed bulk phase and the different biofilm compartments granule layers 1 to 10 the mass transfer mechanisms implemented in the biofilm model are 1 diffusion of soluble and colloidal compounds si ci between all compartments bulk and granule layers 1 to 10 2 displacement of particulate compounds xi 3 attachment of xi from the bulk to the granule surface layer and 4 internal transfer of xi between the granule layers supplementary information s2 provides detailed information on the biofilm model biokinetic model the biokinetic model used in this study sumo1 varga et al

denitrification by oho is performed by using vfa or sb non fermented readily biodegradable soluble substrate as electron donors gao can perform denitrification by using internally stored gly glycogen

were considered in accordance with our experimental results collected over 1 year of operation table 1 layer et al 2019 granule size of d 2 0 mm for mww mature granules was also selected in accordance with literature pronk et al 2015 the individual layer thickness of the granule were set to 25 μm for all layers d 0 5 mm or 25 μm for the 4 outer layers and 150 μm for the residual 6 inner granule layers d 2 0 mm decreasing the thickness of the 4 outer layers of the large granules increases the resolution in those layers which is required to best predict the concentration gradients and redox conditions within the granules for data plotting and interpretation the distinction between aerobic anoxic and anaerobic redox conditions is based on the half saturation constants of growth on o2 and nox of oho of the biokinetic model table 2 2 2 2 modelling scenarios different modelling scenario were performed to 1 validate the overall performance of the model by comparing them to the batch test

batch test modelling scenarios were performed to assess the ability of the model to correctly predict the experimental observations the mechanism scenarios were performed to better understand the mechanisms influencing snd for different influent ww mww and vfa and granule diameters young and mature granules d 0 5 and 2 0 mm influent concentrations of 500 mg cod l 1 41 mg n l 1 and 5 1 mg p l 1 were selected as the basis of mww the vfa ww consisted of the biodegradable fractions of cod tn and tp of mww and comprised 403 mg cod l 1 40 mg n l 1 and 5 0 mg p l 1 respectively for the different conditions simulations were first run for 150 d at do 2 0 mg o2 l 1 do was then changed over two sbr cycles only to different values of 0 5 6 0 mgo2 l 1 data of the second cycle were then extracted matlab version r2018a mathworks usa was used for further data analysis and sigmaplot version 12 0 systat usa was used for visualization of the data finally two different aeration strategies were tested to evaluate how to optimise the snd and tn removal during treatment of municipal ww with ags optimisation scenarios alternating aeration scenario 1 and 2 step aeration scenario 2 table 3 for the alternating aeration scenario the do was switched on do 2 0 mgo2 l 1 and off do 0 0 mgo2 l 1 every 15 min during the aerobic sbr phase for the 2 step aeration scenario the do set point was set at 2 0 mgo2 l 1 for 15 min followed by 0 5 mgo2 l 1 for the residual 270 min of the aerobic sbr phase 2 3 calculations the specific rate of ammonium removal mgn gvss 1 h 1 was calculated using eq 2 2 r n

5000 analyzer denmark and anion chromatography methrom 881 compact ic switzerland respectively 3 results 3 1 how is snd influenced by ww composition during long term operation experimental results the nitrogen influent and effluent concentrations were monitored over the course of 300 400 days for the 4 reactors fig 3 tn influent concentrations were similar for all reactors ranging from 30 to 50 mg n l 1 on average also low ammonium effluent concentrations 2 mg nh4 n l 1 were measured indicating that full nitrification occurred in all reactors in addition no2 n effluent concentrations were negligible in all reactors the effluent no3 concentrations and thus the snd efficiencies were however significantly influenced by the influent composition average effluent no3 concentrations below 4 mg no3 n l 1 were measured for ags system fed by 100 vfa synthetic ww only while values of 5 15 mg no3 n l 1 were measured in the effluents of the complex synthetic primary effluent and raw ww ags systems respectively 3 2 how does do concentration affect snd performance experimental and modelling results batch tests and model simulations were performed at different bulk do concentrations to confirm the effect of the influent composition in terms of simple vs complex electron donor composition on snd fig 4 results from batch tests confirmed observations made over long term operation of the 4 reactors i e that snd is strongly influenced by the influent composition in terms of organic substrate low snd characterized by high nox accumulation rates was observed for ags systems treating complex ww complex synthetic real municipal ww on the contrary high snd was observed for ags fed with 100 vfa synthetic ww independent from the do concentration maintained in bulk fig 4 nh4 removal rates increase with an increasing bulk do concentrations for all tested ww conditions maximum nh4 removal rates of 2 mg nh4 n gvss 1 h 1 were measured for bulk do concentrations larger than 2 mg o2 l 1 the nox accumulation rates almost match the nh4 removal rates for ags systems fed with complex ww complex synthetic primary effluent and raw ww fig 3 indicative of the absence of snd in these systems high snd only occurred in the ags systems treating 100 vfa synthetic ww as indicated by the very low nox accumulation rates i e high denitrification rate modelling results batch test scenarios correctly matched experimental observations of nh4 removal and nox accumulation rates and thus snd performance with changing do fig 4 plain line low nox accumulation rates high snd were predicted by the model for ags fed with vfa ww while high nox accumulation rates low snd were predicted for ags fed by mww nh4 removal rates increased for increasing do bulk concentrations and overall higher nh4 removal rates were observed for young ags d 0 5 mm fed with mww in comparison to ags fed with vfa ww d 2 0 mm 3 3 dynamics of redox zone formation modelling results the formation of the different redox zones was predicted during the aerobic phase for different do concentration in the bulk mechanism scenarios fig 5 the simulations indicate that 1 the formation of anoxic zones inside the granules depends on influent composition granule size and bulk do concentration and that 2 the formation of these anoxic zones is particularly dynamic and thus significantly changes during the aerobic phase the composition of the influent ww governs the formation of the redox zones penetration depth of oxygen significantly reduces towards the deeper layers of the granule in case of vfa influent compared to the mww case with the same granule diameter d 2 0 mm at the same do concentration in addition the granule diameter governs how fast and deep oxygen penetrates the granule oxygen penetration is limited to 50 100 μm from the surface for ags fed with vfa and do 2 mgo2 l 1 during the entire aerobic phase while oxygen penetrates the entire granule immediately after aeration starts d 0 5 mm or 2 h of aeration d 2 0 mm for ags fed by mww the third influencing factor affecting anoxic zone formation and dynamic is the do concentration in the bulk increasing do concentrations generally result in faster and deeper penetration of oxygen towards the deeper granule layers independent of influent ww composition or granule size 3 4 which electron donors are actually used for denitrification modelling results the denitrification rates were predicted for each electron donor and in each layer of the granule during constant aeration at do 2 0 mgo2 l 1 fig 6 a the concentration of each electron donor available at the end of the anaerobic phase in each granule layer is also provided fig 6b the model predictions suggest that the higher the availability of electron donor at the end of the anaerobic phase the higher the denitrification during snd the availability and utilisation of electron donor via denitrification is highly influenced by the influent ww composition and granule diameter the denitrification rates predicted for ags fed with vfa ww are 5 6 fold larger than those predicted for mww influent with young granules d 0 5 mm and 2 4 fold over the mww influent with mature granules d 2 0 mm for ags systems fed with vfa ww the main electron donor for denitrification is glycogen gly a minor fraction of nox is removed via assimilation or readily biodegradable sb for small granules d 0 5 mm fed with mww denitrification does not occur via gly but rather through assimilation assimilation is the dominant pathway for tn removal for small granules fed with mww for large granules d 2 0 mm the majority of denitrification is achieved utilising gly as electron donor and to a smaller extent pha and sb concentrations of internally stored electron donors pha and gly after anaerobic conditions are a good proxy for their contribution to denitrification electron donors are however only utilised in denitrification if anoxic conditions also occur in those granule layers cf figure 5 figure 6ab 3 5 is there potential for electron donor shift towards anoxic utilisation pathways modelling results aerobic anoxic and anaerobic utilisation pathways of the different electron donors readily biodegradable sb vfa glycogen gly and pha were analysed during the aerobic phase with constant aeration at do 2 0 mgo2 l 1 fig 7 a main observation is that a major fraction of the electron donors is utilised aerobically also almost no electron donors are utilised in anoxic conditions in ags fed with mww while there is some anoxic utilisation in ags fed with vfa only vfa fed ags gathered the prerequisites needed for significant anoxic utilisation of gly in multiple granule layers while readily biodegradable sb is mostly utilised aerobically no pha utilisation neither aerobic nor anoxic is observed in vfa fed ags which is probably linked to competition with gly in mww fed ags on the other hand aerobic growth is the main utilisation pathway for sb vfa gly and pha anoxic electron donor utilisation is almost absent in mww conditions for young granules d 0 5 mm and only occurs to a minor extent in the inner granule layers via anoxic utilisation of gly for mature granules d 2 0 mm the model predictions indicate a large potential for shifting the utilisation of sb pha and gly from aerobic to anoxic conditions and thus to increase snd and overall tn removal performances 3 6 can snd and tn removal be improved by optimising the aeration strategy modelling results if most of sb pha and gly is utilised via aerobic utilisation pathways a main question is to what extent can the aeration strategy be optimised to increase snd and ultimately tn removal the performance of alternating aeration and 2 step aeration were thus compared to the constant do base case scenarios mww d 0 5 and 2 0 mm in terms of nitrification and denitrification performance table 4 fig 8 and fig 9 applying an optimised aeration help to significantly increase denitrification efficiencies while full nitrification was maintained for both young d 0 5 mm and mature granules d 2 0 mm denitrification efficiencies were increased by a factor of 2 4 to 40 61 for young d 0 5 mm and by a factor of 1 5 2 to 65 79 for mature d 2 0 mm granules compared to 14 39 for ags composed of young and mature granules operated at constant do aeration respectively despite the high increase in the snd efficiencies optimising the aeration strategy does not allow achieving full denitrification optimised aeration helps to better control the formation of anoxic zones within the granule and in turn the anoxic electron donor utilisation fig 8a c fig 9 granule size still influences the extent of anoxic zone formation larger anoxic zones develop for a longer period for mature granules d 2 0 mm than for young granules d 0 5 mm in the case of young granules d 0 5 mm the main contributor to denitrification shifted from assimilation in the constant do base case due to absence of anoxic redox zones to sb and pha in the optimisation scenarios fig 9 for mature granules d 2 0 mm the main electron donor for denitrification shifted from glycogen gly in constant do aeration to sb in the optimisation scenarios and the contribution of assimilation to snd decreased to almost zero 4 discussion 4 1 snd and tn removal is limited in ags systems treating municipal ww it is usually well recognised that high tn removal via snd is a key attribute of ags systems chen et al 2011 de kreuk et al 2005 he et al 2017 however our long term experiments indicated that limited snd is observed for ags systems treating municipal ww while full tn removal via snd is representative of systems fed with vfa only those results are supported by both experiments and mathematical modelling figs 3 4 and 6 experimentally only ags fed with vfa achieved high snd and no3 effluent concentrations below 4 mg no3 n l 1 effluent no3 n larger than 10 mg no3 n l 1 were on the other hand measured for ags treating municipal ww in our experiments other studies indicate a similar trend limited snd was previously reported for ags treating municipal ww derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015 and effluent no3 n of 2 6 mg no3 n l 1 and tn effluent concentrations of 5 15 mg n l 1 were measured for a nereda full scale plant pronk et al 2015 but in the study of pronk et al 2015 the majority of denitrification actually occurs once the do was reduced to 0 5 mg l 1 supplementary information s1 our modelling results indicate a similar range of snd efficiencies during constant do aeration only 14 39 of snd efficiency were achieved by ags composed of small and large granules in municipal ww conditions respectively low snd efficiency results in high effluent tn concentrations without application of specific measures conversely vfa fed ags achieved snd of 90 in our simulations thus one should not expect full tn removal via snd in the case of ags system treating municipal ww and operated at constant do a main aspect is to discuss how the ww composition influence the snd and how to increase the efficiency of ags system treating municipal ww 4 2 what mechanisms limit snd in ags systems treating municipal ww low snd efficiency in ags systems treating municipal ww is mainly governed by 1 the formation of limited anoxic zones inside the granule and 2 simultaneous lack of electron donor available for denitrification concurrently nitrification is not limiting snd penetration of oxygen is one of the key factors influencing denitrification inside granules or biofilms in general nielsen et al 1990 our results demonstrate that as a result of the sbr mode the formation of anoxic conditions within the granules is a very dynamic process a too fast and deep penetration of oxygen inside the granules limits the formation of anoxic zones and thus denitrification hibiya et al 2004 on the contrary if oxygen availability is too low nitrification is then limited when do is controlled at a constant value of 2 mg l 1 the entire granule volume is anaerobic during the first minutes of aeration due to the simultaneous absence of oxygen quickly consumed due to high microbial activities and of nox nitrification has not started yet after few minutes nox are then produced by nitrification and diffuse through the granules resulting in the formation of anoxic conditions towards the granule core oxygen gradually penetrates deeper inside the granules as substrates get converted reduced oxygen uptake rate at the surface this deeper penetration of oxygen in turn reduces the anoxic zone increasing bulk do thus results in 1 a faster appearance of anoxic zones inside the granules at the beginning of the aerobic phase but also 2 a faster disappearance of those anoxic zones at the end of the aerobic phase our modelling and batch experiment results confirm that snd can be greatly influenced by the do applied in the bulk phase of the reactor mosquera corral et al 2005 he et al 2019 third et al 2003 granule size is another important determining factor of anoxic zone formation chen et al 2011 hereby larger granules sustain anoxic zones for longer time granule size is important since it governs the volume and persistence of anoxic zones inside the granule and larger diameters prevent from too fast and deep oxygen penetration through diffusion li et al 2008 a main challenge is in finding a fine balance in terms of aeration in order to achieve full nitrification and to establish anoxic zones in the core of the granules in addition to the dynamics of anoxic zone formation the diffusion of electron donors also strongly limit denitrification in ags systems derlon et al 2016 only diffusible carbon sources like vfa or sb can reach the deeper layers of the granule in which anoxic conditions are more likely to occur vfa can be utilised directly or be stored as gly or pha during the prior anaerobic phase by gao and pao respectively the availability of vfa in the deep layers of the granule during the anaerobic sbr phase is crucial for subsequent denitrification during the aerobic sbr phase in the case of municipal ww the lack of vfa 5 10 of total cod in the influent ww thus strongly limits snd readily biodegradable substrate sb therefore becomes the most important electron donor for denitrification in municipal ww conditions ideally most of the influent sb is stored as intracellular polymers gly and pha under anaerobic conditions in order to favour granule formation but aerobic utilisation of sb can occur when part of sb leaks into the aerobic phase or is produced by hydrolysis of xb the presence of readily biodegradable sb in the aerobic sbr phase can benefit the growth of oho sb can be used by oho for denitrification if it is available in anoxic zones of the granule the presence of oho at the granule surface layers might also promote the establishment of strong oxygen gradients within the granule which ultimately helps forming anoxic conditions inside the granule however a higher availability of sb during the aerobic sbr phase can also be detrimental to the formation of granules as this promotes aerobic growth of oho oho in turn outcompete gao and pao pao gao favour granule formation overall process stability and are essential for nutrient removal in ags systems de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 another main outcome of our study is about the role of gao gao are usually considered detrimental in ebpr systems as they can hamper the biological phosphorus removal majed et al 2012 however their presence can be beneficial for tn removal as suggested by our simulations and literature weissbrodt et al 2013 in the case of ags fed with vfa ww the overall electron donor utilisation in denitrification is strongly shifted towards internally stored gly by gao thus storage compounds such as gly or pha become the major electron donor source during snd in such systems depending on the presence of gao pao the absence of denitrification on pha in the vfa influent ags case can be explained by the high cod p ratio in the influent which promotes the growth of gao over pao majed and gu 2019 our results thus demonstrate that different mechanisms govern snd depending on the influent ww composition and granule diameter but in the case of municipal ww our results indicate that the main electron donor utilisation pathways of sb vfa gly and pha are almost exclusively aerobic if most of the electron donors are used aerobically during the aerobic phase operated at constant do optimised aeration strategies might help to direct electron donors towards anoxic utilisation 4 3 how to optimise for tn removal in ags systems our results indicate that large granule diameter is one of the parameters that promotes anoxic zone formation and thus the capability of the system to achieve high snd efficiency however in practice controlling the granule diameter is very challenging as granule size is influenced by the granules age and the organic loading layer et al 2019 large granule diameters have been reported for full scale ags systems but rather after few years of operation and during treatment of ww with a high readily biodegradable sb content pronk et al 2015 for this reason improving snd via engineering of the granule size does not represent a relevant approach for optimising tn removal inoculation with large granules could impair start up and denitrification performance since snd could occur from the start of the system nevertheless the final extent of snd remains strongly hampered by the low availability of diffusible electron donors in municipal ww therefore other approaches must be considered to improve the tn removal pre or post denitrification are typical options to increase tn removal in conventional activated sludge sbr systems or in ags systems pronk et al 2015 however both come with drawbacks pre denitrification does not prevent from high tn effluent concentrations and post denitrification is associated with very low rates and hence sbr cycle duration must be increased our results demonstrate that optimising the aeration strategy represents a simple and efficient approach to improve the tn removal of ags systems an increase from 14 37 constant do aeration to 65 79 2 step and alternating aeration of the denitrification efficiency could be achieved the increase in the denitrification efficiency results from an improved utilisation of the electron donors under anoxic conditions in previous studies optimised aeration strategies for ags systems have successfully increased tn removal too like e g mathematical modelling of 2 step aeration sun et al 2019 adaptable do setpoint operation isanta et al 2013 or lab scale experiments on alternating aeration lochmatter et al 2013 on full scale installations a 2 step aeration strategy is applied to overcome limited tn removal pronk et al 2015 supplementary information s1 a recent patent on the aeration strategy of nereda reactors also confirms that specific measures must be taken to increase snd in ags systems derlon et al 2016 layer et al 2019 i e to control the aeration rate based on a targeted nox concentration van dijk et al 2018 however those studies lack fundamental understanding on anoxic zone formation or electron donor utilisation affecting tn removal our simulation results indicate that anoxic zone formation is much better controlled and prolonged when a 2 step and or an alternating aeration is applied especially we observed that the electron donor utilisation can be shifted from mostly aerobic to anoxic significantly more sb was thus utilised via anoxic pathways and the contribution of assimilation to tn removal was almost zero in comparison to constant do aeration in the case of large granules vfa could be produced via fermentation and utilised inside the granule additionally contributing to denitrification both effects result in a much higher denitrification efficiency in comparison to constant do aeration therefore high fractions and concentrations of diffusible electron donors are not only favourable to improve start up time and settling performance of ags systems but also snd performance layer et al 2019 limitations in tn removal due to unfavourable influent ww conditions can be overcome by optimised aeration strategies the microbial pathways of electron donor utilisation can directly be influenced and engineered by application of different aeration strategies however drawbacks of the proposed aeration strategies to increase tn removal also exist during 2 step and alternating aeration a balance must be found between the high do period to achieve full nitrification and low do period to maximize denitrification transient do conditions present in both optimised aeration strategies were reported to trigger growth of filamentous bacteria or breakage of granules martins et al 2004 sturm et al 2004 or increased no2 formation during nitrification alleman 1985 accumulation of no2 ultimately increases the risk of n losses via n2o production during nitrification denitrification law et al 2012 n2o has the potential to be the main greenhouse gas emission during ww treatment gruber et al 2019 therefore n2o production during nitrification and denitrification should be avoided 5 conclusions limited snd and tn removal is observed in ags systems treating low strength municipal wastewaters thus resulting in high nox and tn effluent concentrations denitrification not nitrification is limiting snd in ags systems snd is limited by the very dynamic formation of anoxic zones and the availability of electron donors within the granules anoxic zones only develop during a short period in a small volume of the granule larger granules and lower bulk do concentrations prolong anoxic zones inside the granules and hence increase snd the mechanisms and extent of anoxic substrate conversion at constant do operation is governed by the composition of the influent ww municipal or vfa only ww internal storage compounds pha and glycogen accounted for 40 ags municipal ww or 90 ags vfa only ww of electron donors used in denitrification at constant do operation in municipal ww fed ags systems sb is an important electron donor in denitrification too aeration strategies must be optimised to increase snd and tn removal during treatment of low strength municipal ww using ags systems alternating and 2 step aeration strategies help to increase tn removal from 13 to more than 65 during treatment of

19997,simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd is in theory a key advantage of aerobic granular sludge systems over conventional activated sludge systems but practical experience and literature suggests that snd and thus total nitrogen removal are limited during treatment of municipal wastewater using ags systems this study thus aims at quantifying the extent and understanding the mechanisms of snd during treatment of municipal wastewater with aerobic granular sludge ags systems experiments long term and batch tests as well as mathematical modelling were performed our experimental results demonstrate that snd is significantly limited during treatment of low strength municipal wastewater with ags systems 14 39 while almost full snd is observed when treating synthetic influent containing only diffusible substrate 90 our simulations demonstrate that the main mechanisms behind limited snd are 1 the dynamics of anoxic zone formation inside the granule 2 the diffusibility and availability of electron donors in those zones and 3 the aeration mode the development of anoxic zones is driven by the utilisation of oxygen in the upper layers of the granule leading to transport limitations of oxygen inside the granule this effect is closely linked to granule size and wastewater composition development of anoxic zones during the aerobic phase is limited for small granules at constant aeration at bulk dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mgo2 l 1 and anoxic zones only develop during a brief period of the aerated phase for large granules modelling results further indicate that a large fraction of electron donors are actually utilised in aerobic rather than anoxic redox zones in the bulk or at the granule surface thus full snd cannot be achieved with ags treating low strength municipal wastewater if a constant do is maintained during the aeration phase optimised aeration strategies are therefore required 2 step and alternating aeration are tested successfully using mathematical modelling and increase tn removal to 40 79 without compromising nitrification and by shifting electron donor utilisation towards anoxic redox conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge municipal wastewater simultaneous nitrification denitrification total nitrogen removal aeration strategy 1 introduction van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 in ags systems mass transfer is limited by diffusion which leads to concentration gradients of electron donors final acceptors within the granules during the aerated phase an oxygen gradient develops within the granules whereby the outer layers are aerobic and the inner core is anoxic or anaerobic de kreuk et al 2007a those different redox conditions within the granules allow nitrifying denitrifying and facultative anaerobic organisms to coexist winkler et al 2013 as a result it is usually well accepted that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd is a key feature of ags and that snd is the main nitrogen removal pathway in ags systems de kreuk et al 2005 adav et al 2008 pronk et al 2015 in theory complete total nitrogen tn removal via snd could be achieved in one single reactor and within a single aerobic phase of the sbr cycle however when analysing data from literature it is less evident that high tn removal via snd occurs in ags systems treating municipal wastewater mww fig 1 snd efficiencies reported for lab scale ags systems fed with synthetic influent mostly volatile fatty acids vfa are highly variable values ranging from 10 to 100 are reported for different dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the bulk liquid kocaturk and erguder 2016 de kreuk et al 2005 lochmatter et al 2013 but for those systems high snd efficiencies of more than 75 are typically observed for do values below 4 mgo2 l 1 fig 1 in ags systems fed with mww snd efficiencies smaller than 50 on average are on the contrary reported fig 1 pronk et al 2015 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 lashkarizadeh et al 2015 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 wagner et al 2015 high variability of snd and or low efficiencies lead to high tn and no3 effluent concentrations in the case of ags sbr operation without explicit anoxic phases low snd and tn removal of ags is problematic in areas with stringent treatment requirements it is therefore crucial to understand the extent and mechanisms of snd in order to further optimise tn removal of ags systems snd requires 1 simultaneous occurrence of aerobic for nitrification and anoxic for denitrification redox conditions and 2 electron donor availability in anoxic redox conditions for denitrification fig 1 illustrates both effects lower do concentrations generally tend to increase snd performances in both activated sludge and ags systems pochana and keller 1999 zeng et al 2003 third et al 2003 he et al 2017 2019 in activated sludge flocs anoxic micro zones form due to high oxygen utilisation rates at the surface of the flocs li and bishop 2004 or by maintaining a bulk dissolved oxygen do concentrations below the oxygen half saturation constant ko2 of denitrifying organisms daigger et al 2007 operation of activated sludge system at a do set point below ko2 thus results in snd without strict anoxic conditions in comparison to activated sludge larger snd efficiencies are observed for ags systems across all do concentrations fig 1 green and orange dots higher snd in ags systems results from the formation of anoxic zones inside the granules which is driven by the limited diffusion of oxygen and simultaneous diffusion production of no3 another important observation is the distinct snd efficiency of ags fed by synthetic ww mostly composed of readily available vfa vs real mww fig 1 indeed the type of electron donor and its availability partially determines snd efficiency pochana and keller 1999 therefore the distinct effects of the electron donor availability type and anoxic zone formation on snd in ags systems need to be clarified ags systems treating low strength mww are typically characterized by slower start up more heterogeneous granule sizes lower granule fractions and an increased floc fraction in comparison to vfa only ww fed ags layer et al 2019 the size of granules vary from d 0 5 mm or smaller after few months ni et al 2009 liu et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 layer et al 2019 up to d 2 mm after few years of operation pronk et al 2015 the granule size together with the penetration depth of o2 in theory determines the extent of anoxic zone formation inside the deeper layers of the granule li et al 2008 if the granule diameter impacts the penetration of o2 it is then key to evaluate the mechanisms of snd for both small several hundred μm and large several mm granules representative of young and mature granules respectively the extent of anoxic zones in smaller granules might thus limit snd compared to larger granules another determinant of the extent of snd is the availability of diffusible electron donors in the anoxic zones municipal ww contains a large fraction of electron donors in the non diffusible particulate form xb typically representing 50 of the total chemical oxygen demand cod metcalf and eddy 2014 if most of the electron donors contained in mww are not diffusible it is then hypothesized that denitrification might also be limited during treatment of mww understanding the distinct effects of the ww compositions and granule sizes on anoxic zone formation and electron donor availability and in turn on the snd and tn removal in ags systems is therefore crucial the objectives of this study were therefore 1 to experimentally assess that snd and thus tn removal is limited during treatment of low strength mww in comparison to 100 vfa synthetic ww and 2 to then identify which mechanisms limit the extent of snd e g the dynamic of anoxic zone formation the availability of different electron donors inside the granules and 3 to identify how to improve snd and tn removal by optimising the aeration strategies in ags systems 2 step aeration alternating aeration both experiments and mathematical modelling were conducted snd and tn removal were quantified during long term and batch experiments for different ags systems fed with different ww to better understand the influence of do influent ww and sludge composition on the snd efficiency an ags model was then used to identify the effect of 1 electron donor availability and contribution to snd and 2 anoxic zone formation inside the granules the ags model was then used to evaluate different aeration strategies in order to maximize tn removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach and reactor configuration ags were cultivated in 13 l column sbrs fed with 100 vfa synthetic r1 complex synthetic r2 primary effluent r3 and raw ww r4 respectively layer et al 2019 influent composition in terms of electron donor was either very simple only soluble and highly diffusible organic acids r1 or increasingly complex in terms of electron donor composition r2 r3 and r4 table 1 all systems were operated at constant volume and sbr cycles were as follows anaerobic plug flow feeding 1 5 h aerobic phase 4 h settling variable time and excess sludge removal after settling the total cycle length was 5 6 h the do concentration during the aerobic phase was controlled at a set point of 2 mg o2 l 1 constant do the settling and biomass properties of the different ags grown with different influent compositions were characterised table 1 snd was assessed based on both long term performances at constant do concentrations and ex situ batch tests at various do concentrations long term nitrification and denitrification performances and effluent quality tn nh4 etc were monitored for 300 400 days batch tests were performed on days 173 and 174 r1 195 and 196 r2 174 and 183 r3 and 85 and 86 r4 of operation after establishment of granulation for those batch tests ags was fed anaerobically during a regular sbr cycle followed by aeration at different do concentrations in fully mixed conditions 0 5 6 0 mgo2 l 1 mixing was provided by a stirrer and aeration 2 2 modelling 2 2 1 model description a mathematical model was used to identify the mechanisms governing snd in ags systems and test aeration strategies that optimise tn removal in ags systems the ags model consists of 1 a biofilm model 2 a biokinetic model and 3 a reactor model fig 2 biofilm model the biofilm model is based on the 1 dimensional wanner reichert mixed culture biofilm model wanner and reichert 1996 implemented in sumo software version 16 dynamita france dynamita 2019 the main difference between the wanner reichert and the sumo biofilm models are that biofilm thickness is fixed as an input in the sumo biofilm model while it is predicted in the wanner reichert model in sumo the granule compartments are modelled as a sphere subdivided into n 10 layers and the individual layer area is calculated as a function of depth within the granule fig 2 the total volume of granules is considered constant in the model the biofilm model predicts mass transfer processes between and within the fully mixed bulk phase and the different biofilm compartments granule layers 1 to 10 the mass transfer mechanisms implemented in the biofilm model are 1 diffusion of soluble and colloidal compounds si ci between all compartments bulk and granule layers 1 to 10 2 displacement of particulate compounds xi 3 attachment of xi from the bulk to the granule surface layer and 4 internal transfer of xi between the granule layers supplementary information s2 provides detailed information on the biofilm model biokinetic model the biokinetic model used in this study sumo1 varga et al

denitrification by oho is performed by using vfa or sb non fermented readily biodegradable soluble substrate as electron donors gao can perform denitrification by using internally stored gly glycogen

were considered in accordance with our experimental results collected over 1 year of operation table 1 layer et al 2019 granule size of d 2 0 mm for mww mature granules was also selected in accordance with literature pronk et al 2015 the individual layer thickness of the granule were set to 25 μm for all layers d 0 5 mm or 25 μm for the 4 outer layers and 150 μm for the residual 6 inner granule layers d 2 0 mm decreasing the thickness of the 4 outer layers of the large granules increases the resolution in those layers which is required to best predict the concentration gradients and redox conditions within the granules for data plotting and interpretation the distinction between aerobic anoxic and anaerobic redox conditions is based on the half saturation constants of growth on o2 and nox of oho of the biokinetic model table 2 2 2 2 modelling scenarios different modelling scenario were performed to 1 validate the overall performance of the model by comparing them to the batch test

batch test modelling scenarios were performed to assess the ability of the model to correctly predict the experimental observations the mechanism scenarios were performed to better understand the mechanisms influencing snd for different influent ww mww and vfa and granule diameters young and mature granules d 0 5 and 2 0 mm influent concentrations of 500 mg cod l 1 41 mg n l 1 and 5 1 mg p l 1

conditions simulations were first run for 150 d at do 2 0 mg o2 l 1 do was then changed over two sbr cycles only to different values of 0 5 6 0 mgo2 l 1 data of the second cycle were then extracted matlab version r2018a mathworks usa was used for further data analysis and sigmaplot version 12 0 systat usa was used for visualization of the data finally two different aeration strategies were tested to evaluate how to optimise the snd and tn removal during treatment of municipal ww with ags optimisation scenarios alternating aeration scenario 1 and 2 step aeration scenario 2 table 3 for the alternating aeration scenario the do was switched on do 2 0 mgo2 l 1 and off do 0 0 mgo2 l 1 every 15 min during the aerobic sbr phase for the 2 step aeration scenario the do set point was set at 2 0 mgo2 l 1 for 15 min followed by 0 5 mgo2 l 1 for the residual 270 min of the aerobic sbr phase 2 3 calculations the specific rate of ammonium removal mgn gvss 1 h 1 was calculated using eq 2 2 r n

analysed for total nitrogen tn using photochemical tests hach lange germany lck 238 and 338 cations nh4 n and anions no2 n no3 n were analysed using flow injection analysis foss fiastar flow injection 5000 analyzer denmark and anion chromatography methrom 881 compact ic switzerland respectively 3 results 3 1 how is snd influenced by ww composition during long term operation experimental results the nitrogen influent and effluent concentrations were monitored over the course of 300 400 days for the 4 reactors fig 3 tn influent concentrations were similar for all reactors ranging from 30 to 50 mg n l 1 on average also low ammonium effluent concentrations 2 mg nh4 n l 1 were measured indicating that full nitrification occurred in all reactors in addition no2 n effluent concentrations were negligible in all reactors the effluent no3 concentrations and thus the snd efficiencies were however significantly influenced by the influent composition average effluent no3 concentrations below 4 mg no3 n l 1 were measured for ags system fed by 100 vfa synthetic ww only while values of 5 15 mg no3 n l 1 were measured in the effluents of the complex synthetic primary effluent and raw ww ags systems respectively 3 2 how does do concentration affect snd performance experimental and modelling results batch tests and model simulations were performed at different bulk do concentrations to confirm the effect of the influent composition in terms of simple vs complex electron donor composition on snd fig 4 results from batch tests confirmed observations made over long term operation of the 4 reactors i e that snd is strongly influenced by the influent composition in terms of organic substrate low snd characterized by high nox accumulation rates was observed for ags systems treating complex ww complex synthetic real municipal ww on the contrary high snd was observed for ags fed with 100 vfa synthetic ww independent from the do concentration maintained in bulk fig 4 nh4 removal rates increase with an increasing bulk do concentrations for all tested ww conditions maximum nh4 removal rates of 2 mg nh4 n gvss 1 h 1 were measured for bulk do concentrations larger than 2 mg o2 l 1 the nox accumulation rates almost match the nh4 removal rates for ags systems fed with complex ww complex synthetic primary effluent and raw ww fig 3 indicative of the absence of snd in these systems high snd only occurred in the ags systems treating 100 vfa synthetic ww as indicated by the very low nox accumulation rates i e high denitrification rate modelling results batch test scenarios correctly matched experimental observations of nh4 removal and nox accumulation rates and thus snd performance with changing do fig 4 plain line low nox accumulation rates high snd were predicted by the model for ags fed with vfa ww while high nox accumulation rates low snd were predicted for ags fed by mww nh4 removal rates increased for increasing do bulk concentrations and overall higher nh4 removal rates were observed for young ags d 0 5 mm fed with mww in comparison to ags fed with vfa ww d 2 0 mm 3 3 dynamics of redox zone formation modelling results the formation of the different redox zones was predicted during the aerobic phase for different do concentration in the bulk mechanism scenarios fig 5 the simulations indicate that 1 the formation of anoxic zones inside the granules depends on influent composition granule size and bulk do concentration and that 2 the formation of these anoxic zones is particularly dynamic and thus significantly changes during the aerobic phase the composition of the influent ww governs the formation of the redox zones penetration depth of oxygen significantly reduces towards the deeper layers of the granule in case of vfa influent compared to the mww case with the same granule diameter d 2 0 mm at the same do concentration in addition the granule diameter governs how fast and deep oxygen penetrates the granule oxygen penetration is limited to 50 100 μm from the surface for ags fed with vfa and do 2 mgo2 l 1 during the entire aerobic phase while oxygen penetrates the entire granule immediately after aeration starts d 0 5 mm or 2 h of aeration d 2 0 mm for ags fed by mww the third influencing factor affecting anoxic zone formation and dynamic is the do concentration in the bulk increasing do concentrations generally result in faster and deeper penetration of oxygen towards the deeper granule layers independent of influent ww composition or granule size 3 4 which electron donors are actually used for denitrification modelling results the denitrification rates were predicted for each electron donor and in each layer of the granule during constant aeration at do 2 0 mgo2 l 1 fig 6 a the concentration of each electron donor available at the end of the anaerobic phase in each granule layer is also provided fig 6b the model predictions suggest that the higher the availability of electron donor at the end of the anaerobic phase the higher the denitrification during snd the availability and utilisation of electron donor via denitrification is highly influenced by the influent ww composition and granule diameter the denitrification rates predicted for ags fed with vfa ww are 5 6 fold larger than those predicted for mww influent with young granules d 0 5 mm and 2 4 fold over the mww influent with mature granules d 2 0 mm for ags systems fed with vfa ww the main electron donor for denitrification is glycogen gly a minor fraction of nox is removed via assimilation or readily biodegradable sb for small granules d 0 5 mm fed with mww denitrification does not occur via gly but rather through assimilation assimilation is the dominant pathway for tn removal for small granules fed with mww for large granules d 2 0 mm the majority of denitrification is achieved utilising gly as electron donor and to a smaller extent pha and sb concentrations of internally stored electron donors pha and gly after anaerobic conditions are a good proxy for their contribution to denitrification electron donors are however only utilised in denitrification if anoxic conditions also occur in those granule layers cf figure 5 figure 6ab 3 5 is there potential for electron donor shift towards anoxic utilisation pathways modelling results aerobic anoxic and anaerobic utilisation pathways of the different electron donors readily biodegradable sb vfa glycogen gly and pha were analysed during the aerobic phase with constant aeration at do 2 0 mgo2 l 1 fig 7 a main observation is that a major fraction of the electron donors is utilised aerobically also almost no electron donors are utilised in anoxic conditions in ags fed with mww while there is some anoxic utilisation in ags fed with vfa only vfa fed ags gathered the prerequisites needed for significant anoxic utilisation of gly in multiple granule layers while readily biodegradable sb is mostly utilised aerobically no pha utilisation neither aerobic nor anoxic is observed in vfa fed ags which is probably linked to competition with gly in mww fed ags on the other hand aerobic growth is the main utilisation pathway for sb vfa gly and pha anoxic electron donor utilisation is almost absent in mww conditions for young granules d 0 5 mm and only occurs to a minor extent in the inner granule layers via anoxic utilisation of gly for mature granules d 2 0 mm the model predictions indicate a large potential for shifting the utilisation of sb pha and gly from aerobic to anoxic conditions and thus to increase snd and overall tn removal performances 3 6 can snd and tn removal be improved by optimising the aeration strategy modelling results if most of sb pha and gly is utilised via aerobic utilisation pathways a main question is to what extent can the aeration strategy be optimised to increase snd and ultimately tn removal the performance of alternating aeration and 2 step aeration were thus compared to the constant do base case scenarios mww d 0 5 and 2 0 mm in terms of nitrification and denitrification performance table 4 fig 8 and fig 9 applying an optimised aeration help to significantly increase denitrification efficiencies while full nitrification was maintained for both young d 0 5 mm and mature granules d 2 0 mm denitrification efficiencies were increased by a factor of 2 4 to 40 61 for young d 0 5 mm and by a factor of 1 5 2 to 65 79 for mature d 2 0 mm granules compared to 14 39 for ags composed of young and mature granules operated at constant do aeration respectively despite the high increase in the snd efficiencies optimising the aeration strategy does not allow achieving full denitrification optimised aeration helps to better control the formation of anoxic zones within the granule and in turn the anoxic electron donor utilisation fig 8a c fig 9 granule size still influences the extent of anoxic zone formation larger anoxic zones develop for a longer period for mature granules d 2 0 mm than for young granules d 0 5 mm in the case of young granules d 0 5 mm the main contributor to denitrification shifted from assimilation in the constant do base case due to absence of anoxic redox zones to sb and pha in the optimisation scenarios fig 9 for mature granules d 2 0 mm the main electron donor for denitrification shifted from glycogen gly in constant do aeration to sb in the optimisation scenarios and the contribution of assimilation to snd decreased to almost zero 4 discussion 4 1 snd and tn removal is limited in ags systems treating municipal ww it is usually well recognised that high tn removal via snd is a key attribute of ags systems chen et al 2011 de kreuk et al 2005 he et al 2017 however our long term experiments indicated that limited snd is observed for ags systems treating municipal ww while full tn removal via snd is representative of systems fed with vfa only those results are supported by both experiments and mathematical modelling figs 3 4 and 6 experimentally only ags fed with vfa achieved high snd and no3 effluent concentrations below 4 mg no3 n l 1 effluent no3 n larger than 10 mg no3 n l 1 were on the other hand measured for ags treating municipal ww in our experiments other studies indicate a similar trend limited snd was previously reported for ags treating municipal ww derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015 and effluent no3 n of 2 6 mg no3 n l 1 and tn effluent concentrations of 5 15 mg n l 1 were measured for a nereda full scale plant pronk et al 2015 but in the study of pronk et al 2015 the majority of denitrification actually occurs once the do was reduced to 0 5 mg l 1 supplementary information s1 our modelling results indicate a similar range of snd efficiencies during constant do aeration only 14 39 of snd efficiency were achieved by ags composed of small and large granules in municipal ww conditions respectively low snd efficiency results in high effluent tn concentrations without application of specific measures conversely vfa fed ags achieved snd of 90 in our simulations thus one should not expect full tn removal via snd in the case of ags system treating municipal ww and operated at constant do a main aspect is to discuss how the ww composition influence the snd and how to increase the efficiency of ags system treating municipal ww 4 2 what mechanisms limit snd in ags systems treating municipal ww low snd efficiency in ags systems treating municipal ww is mainly governed by 1 the formation of limited anoxic zones inside the granule and 2 simultaneous lack of electron donor available for denitrification concurrently nitrification is not limiting snd penetration of oxygen is one of the key factors influencing denitrification inside granules or biofilms in general nielsen et al 1990 our results demonstrate that as a result of the sbr mode the formation of anoxic conditions within the granules is a very dynamic process a too fast and deep penetration of oxygen inside the granules limits the formation of anoxic zones and thus denitrification hibiya et al 2004 on the contrary if oxygen availability is too low nitrification is then limited when do is controlled at a constant value of 2 mg l 1 the entire granule volume is anaerobic during the first minutes of aeration due to the simultaneous absence of oxygen quickly consumed due to high microbial activities and of nox nitrification has not started yet after few minutes nox are then produced by nitrification and diffuse through the granules resulting in the formation of anoxic conditions towards the granule core oxygen gradually penetrates deeper inside the granules as substrates get converted reduced oxygen uptake rate at the surface this deeper penetration of oxygen in turn reduces the anoxic zone increasing bulk do thus results in 1 a faster appearance of anoxic zones inside the granules at the beginning of the aerobic phase but also 2 a faster disappearance of those anoxic zones at the end of the aerobic phase our modelling and batch experiment results confirm that snd can be greatly influenced by the do applied in the bulk phase of the reactor mosquera corral et al 2005 he et al 2019 third et al 2003 granule size is another important determining factor of anoxic zone formation chen et al 2011 hereby larger granules sustain anoxic zones for longer time granule size is important since it governs the volume and persistence of anoxic zones inside the granule and larger diameters prevent from too fast and deep oxygen penetration through diffusion li et al 2008 a main challenge is in finding a fine balance in terms of aeration in order to achieve full nitrification and to establish anoxic zones in the core of the granules in addition to the dynamics of anoxic zone formation the diffusion of electron donors also strongly limit denitrification in ags systems derlon et al 2016 only diffusible carbon sources like vfa or sb can reach the deeper layers of the granule in which anoxic conditions are more likely to occur vfa can be utilised directly or be stored as gly or pha during the prior anaerobic phase by gao and pao respectively the availability of vfa in the deep layers of the granule during the anaerobic sbr phase is crucial for subsequent denitrification during the aerobic sbr phase in the case of municipal ww the lack of vfa 5 10 of total cod in the influent ww thus strongly limits snd readily biodegradable substrate sb therefore becomes the most important electron donor for denitrification in municipal ww conditions ideally most of the influent sb is stored as intracellular polymers gly and pha under anaerobic conditions in order to favour granule formation but aerobic utilisation of sb can occur when part of sb leaks into the aerobic phase or is produced by hydrolysis of xb the presence of readily biodegradable sb in the aerobic sbr phase can benefit the growth of oho sb can be used by oho for denitrification if it is available in anoxic zones of the granule the presence of oho at the granule surface layers might also promote the establishment of strong oxygen gradients within the granule which ultimately helps forming anoxic conditions inside the granule however a higher availability of sb during the aerobic sbr phase can also be detrimental to the formation of granules as this promotes aerobic growth of oho oho in turn outcompete gao and pao pao gao favour granule formation overall process stability and are essential for nutrient removal in ags systems de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 another main outcome of our study is about the role of gao gao are usually considered detrimental in ebpr systems as they can hamper the biological phosphorus removal majed et al 2012 however their presence can be beneficial for tn removal as suggested by our simulations and literature weissbrodt et al 2013 in the case of ags fed with vfa ww the overall electron donor utilisation in denitrification is strongly shifted towards internally stored gly by gao thus storage compounds such as gly or pha become the major electron donor source during snd in such systems depending on the presence of gao pao the absence of denitrification on pha in the vfa influent ags case can be explained by the high cod p ratio in the influent which promotes the growth of gao over pao majed and gu 2019 our results thus demonstrate that different mechanisms govern snd depending on the influent ww composition and granule diameter but in the case of municipal ww our results indicate that the main electron donor utilisation pathways of sb vfa gly and pha are almost exclusively aerobic if most of the electron donors are used aerobically during the aerobic phase operated at constant do optimised aeration strategies might help to direct electron donors towards anoxic utilisation 4 3 how to optimise for tn removal in ags systems our results indicate that large granule diameter is one of the parameters that promotes anoxic zone formation and thus the capability of the system to achieve high snd efficiency however in practice controlling the granule diameter is very challenging as granule size is influenced by the granules age and the organic loading layer et al 2019 large granule diameters have been reported for full scale ags systems but rather after few years of operation and during treatment of ww with a high readily biodegradable sb content pronk et al 2015 for this reason improving snd via engineering of the granule size does not represent a relevant approach for optimising tn removal inoculation with large granules could impair start up and denitrification performance since snd could occur from the start of the system nevertheless the final extent of snd remains strongly hampered by the low availability of diffusible electron donors in municipal ww therefore other approaches must be considered to improve the tn removal pre or post denitrification are typical options to increase tn removal in conventional activated sludge sbr systems or in ags systems pronk et al 2015 however both come with drawbacks pre denitrification does not prevent from high tn effluent concentrations and post denitrification is associated with very low rates and hence sbr cycle duration must be increased our results demonstrate that optimising the aeration strategy represents a simple and efficient approach to improve the tn removal of ags systems an increase from 14 37 constant do aeration to 65 79 2 step and alternating aeration of the denitrification efficiency could be achieved the increase in the denitrification efficiency results from an improved utilisation of the electron donors under anoxic conditions in previous studies optimised aeration strategies for ags systems have successfully increased tn removal too like e g mathematical modelling of 2 step aeration sun et al 2019 adaptable do setpoint operation isanta et al 2013 or lab scale experiments on alternating aeration lochmatter et al 2013 on full scale installations a 2 step aeration strategy is applied to overcome limited tn removal pronk et al 2015 supplementary information s1 a recent patent on the aeration strategy of nereda reactors also confirms that specific measures must be taken to increase snd in ags systems derlon et al 2016 layer et al 2019 i e to control the aeration rate based on a targeted nox concentration van dijk et al 2018 however those studies lack fundamental understanding on anoxic zone formation or electron donor utilisation affecting tn removal our simulation results indicate that anoxic zone formation is much better controlled and prolonged when a 2 step and or an alternating aeration is applied especially we observed that the electron donor utilisation can be shifted from mostly aerobic to anoxic significantly more sb was thus utilised via anoxic pathways and the contribution of assimilation to tn removal was almost zero in comparison to constant do aeration in the case of large granules vfa could be produced via fermentation and utilised inside the granule additionally contributing to denitrification both effects result in a much higher denitrification efficiency in comparison to constant do aeration therefore high fractions and concentrations of diffusible electron donors are not only favourable to improve start up time and settling performance of ags systems but also snd performance layer et al 2019 limitations in tn removal due to unfavourable influent ww conditions can be overcome by optimised aeration strategies the microbial pathways of electron donor utilisation can directly be influenced and engineered by application of different aeration strategies however drawbacks of the proposed aeration strategies to increase tn removal also exist during 2 step and alternating aeration a balance must be found between the high do period to achieve full nitrification and low do period to maximize denitrification transient do conditions present in both optimised aeration strategies were reported to trigger growth of filamentous bacteria or breakage of granules martins et al 2004 sturm et al 2004 or increased no2 formation during nitrification alleman 1985 accumulation of no2 ultimately increases the risk of n losses via n2o production during nitrification denitrification law et al 2012 n2o has the potential to be the main greenhouse gas emission during ww treatment gruber et al 2019 therefore n2o production during nitrification and denitrification should be avoided 5 conclusions limited snd and tn removal is observed in ags systems treating low strength municipal wastewaters thus resulting in high nox and tn effluent concentrations denitrification not nitrification is limiting snd in ags systems snd is limited by the very dynamic formation of anoxic zones and the availability of electron donors within the granules anoxic zones only develop during a short period in a small volume of the granule larger granules and lower bulk do concentrations prolong anoxic zones inside the granules and hence increase snd the mechanisms and extent of anoxic substrate conversion at constant do operation is governed by the composition of the influent ww municipal or vfa only ww internal storage compounds pha and glycogen accounted for 40 ags municipal ww or 90 ags vfa only ww of electron donors used in denitrification at constant do operation in municipal ww fed ags systems sb is an important electron donor in denitrification too aeration strategies must be optimised to increase snd and tn removal during treatment of low strength municipal ww using ags systems alternating and 2 step aeration strategies help to increase tn removal from 13 to more than 65 during treatment of municipal low strength ww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

decrease in average particulate pb levels from 37 μg l in january march 2016 to 9 μg l in november 2016 at cold tap collected at normal flow lytle et al 2019 similarly five rounds of sampling in flint

et al 2011 two of the most problematic flint homes lytle et al 2019 pieper et al 2018 were intensively sampled by two independent teams including the epa and virginia tech with a total of 462 water samples collected at both homes 209 at home a and 253 at home b over a period of 37 months january 2016 february 2019 it was determined early on that during the system recovery the vast majority of the pb was particulate and any soluble pb was being precipitated by the high levels of phosphate being added during enhanced cct fig s4 pieper et al 2017 while the epa sampling was conducted at normal flow in order to quantify recovery of pb levels at the kitchen tap virginia tech sampling was conducted to quantify the duration and magnitude of pb release from reservoirs of loose particulates by flushing at high flow rates from the hose bib we hypothesized that repeated flushing at the highest possible flow from a home hose bib would reduce pb levels in water by progressively cleaning out reservoirs of loose pb deposits in the pipes we also hypothesized that water samples collected at normal flow from the kitchen tap would not always provide insights to this reservoir of loose pb deposits even though it is the best measure of human exposure and health risks the objectives of this study were to compile and compare the results of these two complementary datasets which tracked the recovery of premise plumbing systems impacted by interruptions in cct to 1 evaluate the relative effectiveness of high velocity flushing as a way to clean out loose pb deposits in premise plumbing 2 identify the source of pb in water using a fingerprinting metal co occurrence approach and 3 track recovery of water pb levels after interventions of corrosion control flushing and service line replacement 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site selection and plumbing survey two homes a and b had lsls and high levels of pb in water during sampling by virginia tech in august 2015 and march 2016 fig s1 both virginia tech and epa selected these two homes as part of their intensive federal emergency monitoring program after implementing enhanced cct in flint mi ftf 2016 lytle et al 2019 the detailed home plumbing and service line materials are described and cumulative volumes in each plumbing section are calculated in tables s1 s4 in brief home a had both city and private owned lsls connecting at the shut off valve with mostly pb bearing brass fittings pb solder joints and copper piping within the home home b had a city owned copper service line and private owned lsl with pb bearing brass fixtures pb solder joints and copper piping within the home within the home the entire lsl was replaced with a copper pipe in home a on february 01 2017 and in home b on september 28 2016 2 2 sequential sampling protocols virginia tech conducted sequential sampling from the hose bib at homes a and b at a high flow rate of approximately 12 13 l min to maximize pb mobilization table

after 6 h of stagnation to establish a baseline for pb in water levels to examine the impact of extended flushing at high flow rates on removal of loose pb deposits a hose bib longer duration sequential sampling protocol hbld fig s2 was devised to include 8 alternating 1 liter water samples 1st 3rd 5th 15th liter and then 6 1 liter water samples with 5 min flushing between each the hbld protocol was used for both homes on april 17 2016 and thereafter to examine the pb removal following the flush for flint program in may 2016 in contrast the parallel epa sequential sampling was from the kitchen faucet for both homes a and b using a flow of approximately 2 3 l min from the tap with the aerator on table 1 the kitchen tap sequential kts fig s2 samples included two 125 ml bottles followed by up to 16 1 liter sequential water samples after 6 h of no water use the epa sampling flow scenario represents typical water use in a household cartier et al 2012a clark et al 2014 del toral et al 2013 the first sampling was conducted on january 31 2016 in home a and february 08 2016 in home b thereafter were instances when epa used two 500 ml bottles to replace one or more 1 liter

concentrations in water flushed from hose bibs and the associated variability for home a and b were monitored by virginia tech starting in april 2016 after 4 months of cct during and after the flushing program and after lsl replacement 3 1 1 trends in water pb levels for home a the initial sampling at normal flow in august 2015 detected 406 μg l 9 7 μg l and 6 1 μg l in the first second and third draw samples respectively fig s1 after 4 months of orthophosphate cct the pb in water level collected on april 04 2016 was 119 3 μg l in the first draw 8 times the epa action level al of 15 μg l fig 1 during the 16 liters of flushing pb levels remained at relatively high levels of 57 3 1180 0 μg l after 10 l all of the water that sat stagnant in the service line should have been replaced by fresh water from the main and most of the pb in the subsequent 11 16 l samples was suspected to reflect scouring of loose deposits from pipes when the flushing event was repeated two weeks later on april 17 2016 the median pb in water was significantly reduced from 307 5 μg l april 04 2016 to 1 5 μg l mann whitney u test p 0 0001 illustrating the benefits of the one time flushing event in this

program on may 31 2016 the pb in water significantly decreased to a median of 11 0 μg l wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 0001 and ranged 2 1 32 8 μg l the reduction in median pb levels at home a potentially suggested that the city wide flushing program helped with speeding up the recovery for home a s infrastructure as predicted epa 2016a to eliminate the pb sources in home a the entire lsl was replaced with a cu pipe on february 14 2017 three weeks after the lsl replacement the overall pb in water levels continued to decrease with a median of 8 1 μg l p 0 0001 compared to levels in the previous may even though the median pb levels decreased from april 2016 to march 2017 p 0 0001 on march 03 2017 the first draw sample after lsl replacement still contained a concerning pb level of 279 9 μg l which was 19 times the epa al of 15 μg l in a follow up sampling conducted on feb 21 2019 the first draw sample contained 59 9 μg l likely due to the brass hose bib as indicated by co occurrence of elevated zn and cu with the pb in water all the remaining flushed samples were below 5 μg l suggesting the vast majority of loose pb deposits had finally been removed high pb in water levels in the first sample collected from the hose bib was likely due to the infrequent use of the fixture personal communication with homeowner and is consistent with observations in other studies

measured on april 04 2016 were 31 6 μg l in the first draw with the remaining 11 water samples containing 14 5 775 9 μg l pb another 2 weeks of enhanced cct april 17 2016 did not significantly improve median pb levels due to large variability mann whitney u test p 0 065 the pb in water during this prolonged flushing up to 30 min was also highly variable and ranged from 2 6 1308 0 μg l the flush for flint program was likely not as successful in removing leaded deposits in this home as the median pb remained at high levels on may 5 2016 wilcoxon test p 0 18 and may 31 2016 p 0 55 compared to the median level at 20 2 μg l on april 17 2016 the median pb in water increased to 50 6 μg l on may 5 2016 and further to 104 6 on may 31 2016 in any case water pb levels did not recover at this home perhaps due to the presence of cu pipe upstream of the pb lsl a configuration which has been known for decades to sometimes create massive problems with pb release britton and richards 1981 hu et al 2012 st clair et al 2012 for instance a 1981 study in scotland noted that no amount of flushing from such configurations where cu is present upstream of pb could reduce pb in water to allowable levels britton and richards 1981 the entire pb cu partial service line in home b was replaced with cu pipe on september 28 2016 on march 03 2017 the median pb level significantly decreased to 2 5 μg l wilcoxon test p 0 0002 versus may 31 2016 during the follow up sampling on february 21 2019 the first draw sample contained 57 1 μg l which was likely due to the hose bib after an estimated 6 months stagnation while all other samples collected were below 5 μg l as it has been well documented that an lsl is the most concentrated source of pb in drinking water cartier et al 2012a del toral et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 lytle et al 2019 2018 masters et al 2016 olson et al 2017 st clair et al 2016 replacing the lsl and having enhanced cct in water was effective for reducing pb at home b 3 1 3 variability in water pb levels high inherent variability of pb in water levels after the interrupted corrosion control was observed for both homes as indicated by a 52 229 rsd for all sampling rounds table 3 which was 2 4 times higher than the range of 21 80 reported by masters et al 2016 for systems around the u s three sampling rounds with relatively large rsds of 122 283 were collected on april 17 2016 may 05 2016 and march 09 2017 which demonstrates the semi random and sporadic nature of pb release to water due to disruption of pre existing pipe scale cartier et al 2011 clark et al 2014 masters et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 3 1 4 effectiveness of high velocity flushing while a significant reduction in pb levels was observed in both homes at the end of the monitoring period april 2016 february 2019 it took repeated high velocity flow events over many months to remove non durable scale from the plumbing after the disruption in cct occurred in flint in april 2014 significant water pb problems persisted until the lsl was replaced in both homes which was over one year after the switch back to lake huron source water and over 10 months after the implementation of the enhanced corrosion control one time remedial flushing on april 04 2016 only showed a short term reduction in pb levels in these two cases follow up indicated that the homeowner at home a was elderly was using bottled water for drinking and had even begun taking short showers less than 5 min due to fears of water safety personal communication homeowner we speculate that the relatively low water use rates home a and copper upstream of lsl configuration home b were contributing factors to the slow reduction in pb levels in both homes 3 2 source of lead in water 3 2 1 lead sources from lsl lead solder and brass fittings during stagnation both homes had lsls and internal copper pipes with leaded solder the shutoff and gate valves nipples water meter and tee joints were all lead bearing brass it was circumstantially determined that the lsl was the primary source of pb in water levels as pb spikes in both homes coincided with water representative of that sitting stagnant in the lsl figs 1 and 2 the lsl scale scraping derived from both homes had 4 54 times higher pb fe and 15 961 times higher pb zn indicating predominantly leaded scale on the inside of the service lines table 2 the pb zn ratio in water from both homes until may 31 2016 was in the range of 2 1 100 which is much higher than the pb zn ratio in brass of 0 06 4 41 moreover lead tin solder was effectively ruled out as a source of elevated pb levels due to the absence of sn in the water with high pb after lsl replacement brass fixtures became the major source of pb in water in both homes with a pb zn ratio in this first draw water 0 68 1 37 close to the pb zn ratio in the brass 0 09 0 96 3 2 2 sources of lead in flushed water based on co occurring metals and mapping the plumbing the epa mapped the water volume corresponding to the entire plumbing system providing insights to the source of pb in water flowing from the tap tables s1 s4 for home a and b samples after the 10 12 l reflected water from the lead free water mains fig 1 however this flushed water picked up pb resulting in levels up to 374 7 μg l for home a and up to 1308 μg l for home b demonstrating the mobilization of pb sediment from the lsl or other sections of the plumbing during the sampling effort the higher levels of pb in high velocity flushed samples indicates that low velocity sampling is relatively ineffective in detecting the source of pb in plumbing systems impacted by interruptions in cct if a large reservoir of pb detached semi randomly is a predominant source adding another dimension of sampling with higher flow rate without imposing any intervening stagnation event can unambiguously illustrate the nature of the problem as scouring of deposits at high velocity will decisively reveal the presence of loose particulate pb the co occurrence of metals in the flushed water from the water main was that the strongest between pb and phosphate in water over 2 rounds of sampling for home a and in 5 rounds of sampling for home b spearman s ρ 0 89 for home a ρ 0 77 0 92 for home b table s5 this relationship indicated that the previously formed passivated scale with incorporated orthophosphate in the lsl detached into the water which led to high levels of pb correlated with high levels of phosphate this finding highlights the importance of characterizing large reservoirs of loose deposits in the premise plumbing and that the risk of pb release is not mitigated even after enhanced cct in the flushed samples collected after 5 min of high rate flushing in both homes a stable ratio of pb cu of approximately 2 1 for home a and 5 1 for home b was always observed fig s3 supporting a hypothesis that the dislodged pb was somehow associated with cu which is most consistent with a deposition corrosion mechanism caused by the cu pipe before the lsl at home b britton and richards 1981 hu et al 2012 st clair et al 2012 because orthophosphate might inhibit deposition corrosion it is possible that these deposits formed in the more than 50 years these pipes were present before corrosion control was implemented in the latter part of the 20th century or in the year and a half period when orthophosphate was not added to the system in 2015 2016 3 3 impact of flow rate on pb levels comparing high velocity and normal velocity flushing all samples collected from both home a and b using kts sampling had median pb 5 μg l both before and after lsl replacements except for the first sampling at home a on feb 02 2016 which had a median pb of 20 5 μg l table s6 on aug 16 2016 at home b the median pb levels at the kitchen tap when sampled with the aerator on was 2 4 μg l with a maximum spike of 7 9 μg l there was a marginal increase to median pb of 3 1 μg l and a maximum spike of 28 3 μg l when the aerator was removed and the sampling was repeated immediately after the previous round with aerator on the location of sampling within a home either hose bib or kitchen tap which is a surrogate for different sampling flow rates in this work had a significant impact on pb concentrations in water irrespective of sampling date kruskal wallis p 0 001 fig 3 at home a median pb in water of 19 5 μg l in samples collected from the hose bib at high flow 12 13 l min was over 10 times higher than median pb in water of 1 8 μg l in samples collected from kitchen tap at normal flow 2 3 l min similarly at home b median pb in water at high flow 12 3 μg l was over 5 times higher than the median pb at normal flow 2 3 μg l sampling at low flow might not detect problems associated with a large reservoir of relatively loose pb deposits from a service line as was revealed by hose bib and high velocity sampling herein and in other studies cartier et al 2012a clark et al 2014 pieper et al 2017 welter 2016 additionally the current sampling procedure under the lcr requires the collection of a 1 l sample from the kitchen tap after at least 6 h of water stagnation which likely underrepresents pb problems from service lines clark et al 2014 del toral et al 2013 pieper et al 2017 roy and edwards 2018 for both homes a and b the cumulative mass of pb released in each sampling round was calculated by integrating the area under the curve for pb concentration versus volume flushed normalized to 375 l of water flushed in home a and 405 l at home b fig 4 for hose bib sequential and kitchen tap sequential sampling rounds the pb concentration in the last sample was used for the rest of the volume of water to obtain a conservative estimate of cumulative mass of pb released at low velocity and after stagnation there was no significant difference in cumulative mass of pb released from the hose bib when compared with kitchen tap in both homes mann whitney u test p 0 05 but the extra flushing at high flow from hose bib mobilized 23 100 times more pb on average when compared to the samples collected at normal flow from kitchen tap moreover in home b the median cumulative mass of pb released before lsl replacement from hose bib sampling was significantly greater than the cumulative mass released from kitchen tap mann whitney u test p 0 048 nevertheless in both homes the cumulative mass of pb released dropped below 1 mg per sampling round after lsl replacement as the replacement removed the massive reservoir of pb remedial flushing at high flow was effective in removing a higher mass of pb deposits in the short term and may be an effective tool to remediate pb contamination in premise plumbing and to track problems with loose deposits 3 4 implications the city of flint complied with the lcr in 2014 2015 using highly publicized loopholes roy and edwards 2018 such as pre flushing the water and collecting water in narrow mouth bottles at low flow davis et al 2016 del toral 2015 pieper et al 2017 on february 29 2016 the epa released a memorandum to provide clarifications for tap water sampling procedures and recommended using wide mouth bottles and sampling at the highest possible normal flow rate davis et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 this recommendation to use wide mouth bottles has been incorporated into the proposed lcr revisions epa 2019 pb in drinking water is likely going to remain a significant concern for public health due to weak enforcement of the lcr highly publicized loopholes in the lcr rising concern about pb in water exposures in the aftermath of the flint water crisis and increasing corrosivity of some source waters katner et al 2018 roy and edwards 2018 4 conclusions in this study we tracked the recovery of premise plumbing scale after water source switch and disruption of corrosion control in two problematic homes during the flint water crisis we employed remedial flushing at the highest possible flow at the hose bib to quantify the reservoir of particles in the plumbing and duration and magnitude of pb release from that pb reservoir during high flow throughout the recovery elevated pb levels measured in both homes from the hose bib at high flow showed that sampling from the kitchen tap alone would not have identified the true extent of pb contamination although a downward trend in pb levels was observed from january 2016 february 2019 a one time high velocity flow flush event was not effective in reducing pb levels and might have even increased the risk of pb release in the short term by mapping pb spikes with the plumbing profile and calculating metal ratios we found that lsl was the major source for pb and lsl replacement was the most effective intervention for reducing pb levels in the long term before lsl replacement pb levels in samples collected at high flow from the hose bib were significantly higher than samples collected at normal flow from the kitchen tap irrespective of sampling date the long term water quality problems in flint arising from very expensive water water main breaks low water use and disruption of scale due to abrupt change in water chemistry should have been anticipated as water infrastructure ages and water conservation efforts are implemented nationwide pb in drinking water will likely remain a significant concern for the public and health agencies

19998,a federal emergency was declared in flint mi on january 16 2016 18 months after a switch to flint river source water without phosphate corrosion control remedial actions to resolve the corresponding lead in water crisis included reconnection to the original lake huron source water with orthophosphate implementing enhanced corrosion control by dosing extra orthophosphate a flush for flint program to help clean out loose leaded sediment from service lines and premise plumbing and eventually lead service line replacement independent sampling over a period of 37 months january 2016 february 2019 was conducted by the united states environmental protection agency and virginia tech to evaluate possible human exposure via normal flow 2 3 l min sampling at the cold kitchen tap and to examine the status of loose deposits from the service line and the premise plumbing via high velocity flushing 12 13 l min from the hose bib the sampling results indicated that high lead in water persisted for more than a year in two flint homes due to a large reservoir of lead deposits the effects of a large reservoir of loose lead deposits persisted until the lead service line was completely removed in these two anomalous homes as water conservation efforts are implemented in many areas of the country problems with mobile lead reservoirs in service lines are likely to pose a human health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords sequential sampling profiling lead in water corrosion control premise plumbing 1 introduction after decades of steady decline in mean blood lead pb levels in the united states dignam et al 2019 the recent flint federal emergency has increased concern of exposure from pb in drinking water davis et al 2016 the natural resources defense council nrdc reported that more than 5300 public water systems in the united states serving over 18 million people were in violation of the environmental protection agency epa lead and copper rule lcr in 2015 due to

corrosion of lead service lines lsls pb goosenecks pb lined steel pipes pb solder galvanized iron pipes and leaded brass fittings all of these sources of pb can act as reservoirs for pb release and corrosion control treatment cct is implemented at water utilities to optimize water chemistry to minimize pb release clark et al 2015 epa 2016b 1991 hdr engineering inc 2009 lytle and schock 1996 subramanian et al 1995 tang et al 2018 triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 popular cct methods include orthophosphate corrosion inhibitors and ph alkalinity adjustments and the revised lcr re emphasizes the importance of these approaches clark et al 2014 epa 2016b epa 2019 there is evidence that water pb release may now be increasing in some cities due to higher temperatures water conservation use of chloramine road salt use and other factors roy et al 2018 changes in water chemistry can also exacerbate pb release by destabilizing scales rust on pipe that formed over decades or centuries

pb in water at 10 l min versus 0 4 l min triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 aerators on low flow fixtures and showers reduced consumption of water due to contamination events and or voluntary conservation due to high water rates will reduce the velocity and volume of water flowing through homes nguyen et al 2012 low flows are problematic because water stays in contact with the pipes longer increasing soluble pb in water low flows can also increase particulate pb release due to accelerated corrosion rates arnold and edwards 2012 del toral et al 2013 1 2 remedial flushing to reduce lead in water the notion of remedial flushing for removal of loose iron rust from water systems is well established benson et al 2012 and can be extended to reducing pb release in new buildings with water conservation features through automated flushers nguyen et al 2012 flushing pipes at high velocity flow has also been shown to reduce pb levels after lsl replacements brown and cornwell 2015 cornwell et al 2018 deshommes et al 2016 while in some cases a one time flush event is effective in remediating pb levels in water elfland et al 2010 cornwell et al 2018 pieper et al 2015 in other cases water pb problems may persist for a much longer duration due to changes in water chemistry lytle et al 2019 masten et al 2016 1 3 fingerprinting metal correlations to identify the source of lead identifying the source of water pb can help interpret the nature of the corrosion problem which in turn could help identify common plumbing characteristics of homes at risk within a city sequential sampling

deshommes et al 2010 lytle et al 2018 pieper et al 2017 specifically tin co occurrence with pb indicates solder zinc and copper co occurrence indicates brass and cadmium co occurrence indicates

when switching from lake huron water with orthophosphate to a flint river source without orthophosphate in april 2014 creating a major water pb contamination event davis et al 2016 edwards et al 2015 pieper et al 2018 masten et al 2016 schwake et al 2016 after a local and federal emergency was declared relief agency responses to mitigate the problems included reconnecting to the original lake huron source with orthophosphate october 16 2015 implementation of enhanced corrosion control with extra phosphate december 09 2015 and a flush for flint program in homes to clean pb sediments from home plumbing systems may 1 15 2016 epa 2016a pieper et al 2018 the pb in water levels decreased from these remediation efforts four rounds of sampling in flint by the epa indicated an overall decrease in average particulate pb levels from 37 μg l in january march 2016 to 9 μg l in november 2016 at cold tap collected at normal flow lytle et al 2019 similarly five rounds of sampling in flint by virginia tech between august 2015 and august 2017 showed that the 90th percentile total pb of first draw samples reduced from 26 8 μg l to 7 9 μg l pieper et al 2018 most of the pb released after the reintroduction of corrosion control was likely particulate pb due to dislodging of pipe scale clark et al 2014 pieper et al 2017 2018 there were still a few homes where severe problems with high pb persisted abokifa et al 2020 pieper et al 2018 as was the case in the aftermath of another major water pb contamination event in washington d c 2001 2004 edwards and dudi 2004 edwards 2014 mcfadden et al 2011 two of the most problematic flint homes lytle et al 2019 pieper et al 2018 were intensively sampled by two independent teams including the epa and virginia tech with a total of 462 water samples collected at both homes 209 at home a and 253 at home b over a period of 37 months january 2016 february 2019 it was determined early on that during the system recovery the vast majority of the pb was particulate and any soluble pb was being precipitated by the high levels of phosphate being added during enhanced cct fig s4 pieper et al 2017 while the epa sampling was conducted at normal flow in order to quantify recovery of pb levels at the kitchen tap virginia tech sampling was conducted to quantify the duration and magnitude of pb release from reservoirs of loose particulates by flushing at high flow rates from the hose bib we hypothesized that repeated flushing at the highest possible flow from a home hose bib would reduce pb levels in water by progressively cleaning out reservoirs of loose pb deposits in the pipes we also hypothesized that water samples collected at normal flow from the kitchen tap would not always provide insights to this reservoir of loose pb deposits even though it is the best measure of human exposure and health risks the objectives of this study were to compile and compare the results of these two complementary datasets which tracked the recovery of premise plumbing systems impacted by interruptions in cct to 1 evaluate the relative effectiveness of high velocity flushing as a way to clean out loose pb deposits in premise plumbing 2 identify the source of pb in water using a fingerprinting metal co occurrence approach and 3 track recovery of water pb levels after interventions of corrosion control flushing and service line replacement 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site selection and plumbing survey two homes a and b had lsls and high levels of pb in water during sampling by virginia tech in august 2015 and march 2016 fig s1 both virginia tech and epa selected these two homes as part of their intensive federal emergency monitoring program after implementing enhanced cct in flint mi ftf 2016 lytle et al 2019 the detailed home plumbing and service line materials are described and cumulative volumes in each plumbing section are calculated in tables s1 s4 in brief home a had both city and private owned lsls connecting at the shut off valve with mostly pb bearing brass fittings pb solder joints and copper piping within the home home b had a city owned copper service line and private owned lsl with pb bearing brass fixtures pb solder joints and copper piping within the home within the home the entire lsl was replaced with a copper pipe in home a on february 01 2017 and in home b on september 28 2016 2 2 sequential sampling protocols virginia tech conducted sequential sampling from the hose bib at homes a and b at a high flow rate of approximately 12 13 l min to maximize pb mobilization table 1 on april 04 2016 after 4 months of enhanced cct sequential sampling with the hose bib sequential hbs protocol fig s2 was used to collect up to 16 consecutive 1 liter water samples from both homes after 6 h of stagnation to establish a baseline for pb in water levels to examine the impact of extended flushing at high flow rates on removal of loose pb deposits a hose bib longer duration sequential sampling protocol hbld fig s2 was devised to include 8 alternating 1 liter water samples 1st 3rd 5th 15th liter and then 6 1 liter water samples with 5 min flushing between each the hbld protocol was used for both homes on april 17 2016 and thereafter to examine the pb removal following the flush for flint program in may 2016 in contrast the parallel epa sequential sampling was from the kitchen faucet for both homes a and b using a flow of approximately 2 3 l min from the tap with the aerator on table 1 the kitchen tap sequential kts fig s2 samples included two 125 ml bottles followed by up to 16 1 liter sequential water samples after 6 h of no water use the epa sampling flow scenario represents typical water use in a household cartier et al 2012a clark et al 2014 del toral et al 2013 the first sampling was conducted on january 31 2016 in home a and february 08 2016 in home b thereafter were instances when epa used two 500 ml bottles to replace one or more 1 liter

scraping analysis for lsl scale a scraping was collected along the entire length of the pipe exhumed from the property then 5 mg samples were taken in triplicate and dissolved in 20 nitric acid solution and digested at 60 c for 16 h for brass and solder a single composite scale sample with a total weight of at least 5 mg was taken from each home and prepared for total metals analysis as previously outlined if samples contained visible particulate after the 16 h period 2 hydroxylamine was added and the sample was held for an additional 16 h at 50 c masters and edwards 2015 afterwards the digested samples were analyzed by icp ms as outlined in section 2 3 metal ratios e g pb fe pb cu were calculated using elemental analyses 2 5 statistical analysis all data were analyzed using r studio r version 3 5 3 and an alpha of 0 05 was used as a measure of significance as pb concentration data were non normal shapiro wilk test p 0 05 wilcoxon and mann whitney u tests were used to compare pb concentration among the different sampling rounds and sampling locations spearman s rank correlation ρ was used to determine correlations between pb fe phosphate and zn in water relative standard deviation rsd standard deviation mean was used to evaluate the variability of pb in water masters et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 water lead levels during high velocity flushing pb concentrations in water flushed from hose bibs and the associated variability for home a and b were monitored by virginia tech starting in april 2016 after 4 months of cct during and after the flushing program and after lsl replacement 3 1 1 trends in water pb levels for home a the initial sampling at normal flow in august 2015 detected 406 μg l 9 7 μg l and 6 1 μg l in the first second and third draw samples respectively fig s1 after 4 months of orthophosphate cct the pb in water level collected on april 04 2016 was 119 3 μg l in the first draw 8 times the epa action level al of 15 μg l fig 1 during the 16 liters of flushing pb levels remained at relatively high levels of 57 3 1180 0 μg l after 10 l all of the water that sat stagnant in the service line should have been replaced by fresh water from the main and most of the pb in the subsequent 11 16 l samples was suspected to reflect scouring of loose deposits from pipes when the flushing event was repeated two weeks later on april 17 2016 the median pb in water was significantly reduced from 307 5 μg l april 04 2016 to 1 5 μg l mann whitney u test p 0 0001 illustrating the benefits of the one time flushing event in this home however on may 5 2016 the median pb was again high relative to sampling on april 17 2016 increasing to 74 4 μg l wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 0001 two weeks after the citywide flush for flint program on may 31 2016 the pb in water significantly decreased to a median of 11 0 μg l wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 0001 and ranged 2 1 32 8 μg l the reduction in median pb levels at home a potentially suggested that the city wide flushing program helped with speeding up the recovery for home a s infrastructure as predicted epa 2016a to eliminate the pb sources in home a the entire lsl was replaced with a cu pipe on february 14 2017 three weeks after the lsl replacement the overall pb in water levels continued to decrease with a median of 8 1 μg l p 0 0001 compared to levels in the previous may even though the median pb levels decreased from april 2016 to march 2017 p 0 0001 on march 03 2017 the first draw sample after lsl replacement still contained a concerning pb level of 279 9 μg l which was 19 times the epa al of 15 μg l in a follow up sampling conducted on feb 21 2019 the first draw sample contained 59 9 μg l likely due to the brass hose bib as indicated by co occurrence of elevated zn and cu with the pb in water all the remaining flushed samples were below 5 μg l suggesting the vast majority of loose pb deposits had finally been removed high pb in water levels in the first sample collected from the hose bib was likely due to the infrequent use of the fixture personal communication with homeowner and is consistent with observations in other studies cartier et al 2012a lytle and schock 1996 mcfadden et al 2011 3 1 2 trends in water pb levels for home b the pb in water for home b presented a different pattern than home a the pb in water levels measured on april 04 2016 were 31 6 μg l in the first draw with the remaining 11 water samples containing 14 5 775 9 μg l pb another 2 weeks of enhanced cct april 17 2016 did not significantly improve median pb levels due to large variability mann whitney u test p 0 065 the pb in water during this prolonged flushing up to 30 min was also highly variable and ranged from 2 6 1308 0 μg l the flush for flint program was likely not as successful in removing leaded deposits in this home as the median pb remained at high levels on may 5 2016 wilcoxon test p 0 18 and may 31 2016 p 0 55 compared to the median level at 20 2 μg l on april 17 2016 the median pb in water increased to 50 6 μg l on may 5 2016 and further to 104 6 on may 31 2016 in any case water pb levels did not recover at this home perhaps due to the presence of cu pipe upstream of the pb lsl a configuration which has been known for decades to sometimes create massive problems with pb release britton and richards 1981 hu et al 2012 st clair et al 2012 for instance a 1981 study in scotland noted that no amount of flushing from such configurations where cu is present upstream of pb could reduce pb in water to allowable levels britton and richards 1981 the entire pb cu partial service line in home b was replaced with cu pipe on september 28 2016 on march 03 2017 the median pb level significantly decreased to 2 5 μg l wilcoxon test p 0 0002 versus may 31 2016 during the follow up sampling on february 21 2019 the first draw sample contained 57 1 μg l which was likely due to the hose bib after an estimated 6 months stagnation while all other samples collected were below 5 μg l as it has been well documented that an lsl is the most concentrated source of pb in drinking water cartier et al 2012a del toral et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 lytle et al 2019 2018 masters et al 2016 olson et al 2017 st clair et al 2016 replacing the lsl and having enhanced cct in water was effective for reducing pb at home b 3 1 3 variability in water pb levels high inherent variability of pb in water levels after the interrupted corrosion control was observed for both homes as indicated by a 52 229 rsd for all sampling rounds table 3 which was 2 4 times higher than the range of 21 80 reported by masters et al 2016 for systems around the u s three sampling rounds with relatively large rsds of 122 283 were collected on april 17 2016 may 05 2016 and march 09 2017 which demonstrates the semi random and sporadic nature of pb release to water due to disruption of pre existing pipe scale cartier et al 2011 clark et al 2014 masters et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 3 1 4 effectiveness of high velocity flushing while a significant reduction in pb levels was observed in both homes at the end of the monitoring period april 2016 february 2019 it took repeated high velocity flow events over many months to remove non durable scale from the plumbing after the disruption in cct occurred in flint in april 2014 significant water pb problems persisted until the lsl was replaced in both homes which was over one year after the switch back to lake huron source water and over 10 months after the implementation of the enhanced corrosion control one time remedial flushing on april 04 2016 only showed a short term reduction in pb levels in these two cases follow up indicated that the homeowner at home a was elderly was using bottled water for drinking and had even begun taking short showers less than 5 min due to fears of water safety personal communication homeowner we speculate that the relatively low water use rates home a and copper upstream of lsl configuration home b were contributing factors to the slow reduction in pb levels in both homes 3 2 source of lead in water 3 2 1 lead sources from lsl lead solder and brass fittings during stagnation both homes had lsls and internal copper pipes with leaded solder the shutoff and gate valves nipples water meter and tee joints were all lead bearing brass it was circumstantially determined that the lsl was the primary source of pb in water levels as pb spikes in both homes coincided with water representative of that sitting stagnant in the lsl figs 1 and 2 the lsl scale scraping derived from both homes had 4 54 times higher pb fe and 15 961 times higher pb zn indicating predominantly leaded scale on the inside of the service lines table 2 the pb zn ratio in water from both homes until may 31 2016 was in the range of 2 1 100 which is much higher than the pb zn ratio in brass of 0 06 4 41 moreover lead tin solder was effectively ruled out as a source of elevated pb levels due to the absence of sn in the water with high pb after lsl replacement brass fixtures became the major source of pb in water in both homes with a pb zn ratio in this first draw water 0 68 1 37 close to the pb zn ratio in the brass 0 09 0 96 3 2 2 sources of lead in flushed water based on co occurring metals and mapping the plumbing the epa mapped the water volume corresponding to the entire plumbing system providing insights to the source of pb in water flowing from the tap tables s1 s4 for home a and b samples after the 10 12 l reflected water from the lead free water mains fig 1 however this flushed water picked up pb resulting in levels up to 374 7 μg l for home a and up to 1308 μg l for home b demonstrating the mobilization of pb sediment from the lsl or other sections of the plumbing during the sampling effort the higher levels of pb in high velocity flushed samples indicates that low velocity sampling is relatively ineffective in detecting the source of pb in plumbing systems impacted by interruptions in cct if a large reservoir of pb detached semi randomly is a predominant source adding another dimension of sampling with higher flow rate without imposing any intervening stagnation event can unambiguously illustrate the nature of the problem as scouring of deposits at high velocity will decisively reveal the presence of loose particulate pb the co occurrence of metals in the flushed water from the water main was that the strongest between pb and phosphate in water over 2 rounds of sampling for home a and in 5 rounds of sampling for home b spearman s ρ 0 89 for home a ρ 0 77 0 92 for home b table s5 this relationship indicated that the previously formed passivated scale with incorporated orthophosphate in the lsl detached into the water which led to high levels of pb correlated with high levels of phosphate this finding highlights the importance of characterizing large reservoirs of loose deposits in the premise plumbing and that the risk of pb release is not mitigated even after enhanced cct in the flushed samples collected after 5 min of high rate flushing in both homes a stable ratio of pb cu of approximately 2 1 for home a and 5 1 for home b was always observed fig s3 supporting a hypothesis that the dislodged pb was somehow associated with cu which is most consistent with a deposition corrosion mechanism caused by the cu pipe before the lsl at home b britton and richards 1981 hu et al 2012 st clair et al 2012 because orthophosphate might inhibit deposition corrosion it is possible that these deposits formed in the more than 50 years these pipes were present before corrosion control was implemented in the latter part of the 20th century or in the year and a half period when orthophosphate was not added to the system in 2015 2016 3 3 impact of flow rate on pb levels comparing high velocity and normal velocity flushing all samples collected from both home a and b using kts sampling had median pb 5 μg l both before and after lsl replacements except for the first sampling at home a on feb 02 2016 which had a median pb of 20 5 μg l table s6 on aug 16 2016 at home b the median pb levels at the kitchen tap when sampled with the aerator on was 2 4 μg l with a maximum spike of 7 9 μg l there was a marginal increase to median pb of 3 1 μg l and a maximum spike of 28 3 μg l when the aerator was removed and the sampling was repeated immediately after the previous round with aerator on the location of sampling within a home either hose bib or kitchen tap which is a surrogate for different sampling flow rates in this work had a significant impact on pb concentrations in water irrespective of sampling date kruskal wallis p 0 001 fig 3 at home a median pb in water of 19 5 μg l in samples collected from the hose bib at high flow 12 13 l min was over 10 times higher than median pb in water of 1 8 μg l in samples collected from kitchen tap at normal flow 2 3 l min similarly at home b median pb in water at high flow 12 3 μg l was over 5 times higher than the median pb at normal flow 2 3 μg l sampling at low flow might not detect problems associated with a large reservoir of relatively loose pb deposits from a service line as was revealed by hose bib and high velocity sampling herein and in other studies cartier et al 2012a clark et al 2014 pieper et al 2017 welter 2016 additionally the current sampling procedure under the lcr requires the collection of a 1 l sample from the kitchen tap after at least 6 h of water stagnation which likely underrepresents pb problems from service lines clark et al 2014 del toral et al 2013 pieper et al 2017 roy and edwards 2018 for both homes a and b the cumulative mass of pb released in each sampling round was calculated by integrating the area under the curve for pb concentration versus volume flushed normalized to 375 l of water flushed in home a and 405 l at home b fig 4 for hose bib sequential and kitchen tap sequential sampling rounds the pb concentration in the last sample was used for the rest of the volume of water to obtain a conservative estimate of cumulative mass of pb released at low velocity and after stagnation there was no significant difference in cumulative mass of pb released from the hose bib when compared with kitchen tap in both homes mann whitney u test p 0 05 but the extra flushing at high flow from hose bib mobilized 23 100 times more pb on average when compared to the samples collected at normal flow from kitchen tap moreover in home b the median cumulative mass of pb released before lsl replacement from hose bib sampling was significantly greater than the cumulative mass released from kitchen tap mann whitney u test p 0 048 nevertheless in both homes the cumulative mass of pb released dropped below 1 mg per sampling round after lsl replacement as the replacement removed the massive reservoir of pb remedial flushing at high flow was effective in removing a higher mass of pb deposits in the short term and may be an effective tool to remediate pb contamination in premise plumbing and to track problems with loose deposits 3 4 implications the city of flint complied with the lcr in 2014 2015 using highly publicized loopholes roy and edwards 2018 such as pre flushing the water and collecting water in narrow mouth bottles at low flow davis et al 2016 del toral 2015 pieper et al 2017 on february 29 2016 the epa released a memorandum to provide clarifications for tap water sampling procedures and recommended using wide mouth bottles and sampling at the highest possible normal flow rate davis et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 this recommendation to use wide mouth bottles has been incorporated into the proposed lcr revisions epa 2019 pb in drinking water is likely going to remain a significant concern for public health due to weak enforcement of the lcr highly publicized loopholes in the lcr rising concern about pb in water exposures in the aftermath of the flint water crisis and increasing corrosivity of some source waters katner et al 2018 roy and edwards 2018 4 conclusions in this study we tracked the recovery of premise plumbing scale after water source switch and disruption of corrosion control in two problematic homes during the flint water crisis we employed remedial flushing at the highest possible flow at the hose bib to quantify the reservoir of particles in the plumbing and duration and magnitude of pb release from that pb reservoir during high flow throughout the recovery elevated pb levels measured in both homes from the hose bib at high flow showed that sampling from the kitchen tap alone would not have identified the true extent of pb contamination although a downward trend in pb levels was observed from january 2016 february 2019 a one time high velocity flow flush event was not effective in reducing pb levels and might have even increased the risk of pb release in the short term by mapping pb spikes with the plumbing profile and calculating metal ratios we found that lsl was the major source for pb and lsl replacement was the most effective intervention for reducing pb levels in the long term before lsl replacement pb levels in samples collected at high flow from the hose bib were significantly higher than samples collected at normal flow from the kitchen tap irrespective of sampling date the long term water quality problems in flint arising from very expensive water water main breaks low water use and disruption of scale due to abrupt change in water chemistry should have been anticipated as water infrastructure ages and water conservation efforts are implemented nationwide pb in drinking water will likely remain a significant concern for the public and health agencies

19999,the removal or degradation of particulate organic matter is a crucial part in biological wastewater treatment this is even more valid with respect to aerobic granular sludge and the impact of particulate organic matter on the formation and stability of the entire granulation process before the organic part of the particulate matter can be hydrolyzed and finally degraded by the microorganism the particles have to be transported towards and retained within the granulated biomass the understanding of these processes is currently very limited thus the present study aimed at visualizing the transport of particulate organic matter into and through an aerobic granular sludge bed magnetic resonance imaging mri was successfully applied to resolve the different fractions of a granular sludge bed over time and space quantification and merging of 3d data sets allowed for a clear determination of the particle distribution within the granular sludge bed dextran coated super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions d p 38 10 nm served as model particles for colloidal particles microcrystalline cellulose particles d p 1 20 μm tagged with paramagnetic iron oxide were applied as a reference for toilet paper which is a major fraction of particulate matter in domestic wastewater the results were supplemented by the use of real wastewater particles with a size fraction between 28 and 100 μm colloidal spions distributed evenly over the granular sludge bed penetrating the granules up to 300 μm rinsing the granular sludge bed proved their immobilization microcrystalline cellulose and real wastewater particles in the micrometer range accumulated in the void space between settled granules an almost full retention of the wastewater particles was observed within the first 20 mm of the granular sludge bed moreover the formation of particle layers indicates that most of the micrometer sized particles are not attached to the biomass and remain mobile consequently these particles are released into the bulk phase when the granulated sludge bed is resuspended graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge particulate organic matter magnetic resonance imaging anaerobic feeding phase colloid wastewater particle hydrolysis 1 introduction within the last decade aerobic granular sludge systems for municipal wastewater treatment have proved to be economically competitive compared to the activated sludge systems giesen et al 2013 pronk et al 2015b by now around 50 aerobic granular sludge reactors have been set into operation in full scale for the treatment of wastewater haskoningdhv 2020 li et al 2014 despite these full scale plants only little is known about the granulation process during municipal wastewater treatment as well as the factors causing low or high effluent concentrations of particulate organic matter derlon et al 2016 rocktäschel et al 2015 wagner et al 2015 wilén et al 2018 around 50 of the chemical oxygen demand in municipal wastewater are dedicated to particulate organic matter the latter represents a crucial carbon source in municipal wastewater treatment orhon and çokgör 1997 particulate organic matter has to undergo hydrolysis before it can be metabolized to carbon dioxide and new biomass by the microorganisms the removal of particulate organic matter can be divided into 4 steps i external transport to the biofilm surface ii attachment of the particles iii hydrolysis of particulate organic matter and release of hydrolytic products iv uptake of these products by microorganisms boltz and motta 2007 li et al 2018 theories about the removal of particulate organic matter in granular sludge reactors typically assume that it attaches adsorbs at the granule surface during the feeding phase de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015a overall the degradation of particulate organic matter takes several days benneouala et al 2017 thus attachment is a prerequisite to ensure that particulate organic matter can serve as a carbon source for aerobic granular sludge systems and is not washed out with the effluent to understand how particulate organic matter behaves within a bed of settled granules during anaerobic feeding imaging techniques might be applied imaging techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm optical coherence tomography oct and micro computer tomography μ ct are either limited by their penetration depth or by exposing microorganisms to potentially harmful radiation adav et al 2008 bouma 2001 li et al 2018 peszynska et al

organic matter during the anaerobic feeding phase of a granular sludge bed to our knowledge mass transport studies have been limited to single granules and or did not resolve an entire granular sludge bed the main objectives of this study were thus i to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of mri for the structural characterization of granular sludge beds ii to investigate the transport loading and retention behavior of particulate organic matter within a bed of settled granules and iii to demonstrate the dependence of the retention mechanism on the size of particulate organic matter super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions d p 38 10 nm have been applied which resemble the colloidal fraction of particulate organic matter the results are supplemented by the investigation of artificial microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps d p 1 20 μm and real wastewater particles wwps d p 28 100 μm as models for particulate organic matter in the micrometer range 2 material and methods 2 1 aerobic granular sludge aerobic granular sludge was taken from a lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr at eawag samples were sieved to separate flocs from aerobic granules d 0 63 mm the granule size allowed for a sufficient resolution of the voids between the granules the granules had a smooth surface and a typical size range of 1 2 mm granules were send from eawag dübendorf switzerland to karlsruhe germany approx 200 ml of granular sludge were filled in a bottle and covered to the top with tap water the bottle was send on ice in a styrofoam box the maximum delivery time was two days the first mri experiments were started immediately after sample arrival however granular sludge samples were stored in the fridge 4 c not longer than five days in case the experiments had to be repeated the latter could occur due to air bubbles or incorrect packing of the granules 2 2 preparation and characterization of particulate organic matter colloidal particles spions superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions with a diameter d p of 38 10 nm were utilized as reference for colloidal particles resembling the colloidal fraction of particulate organic matter nanomag d spio micromod partikeltechnologie gmbh rostock germany spions consist of iron oxide cores covered by an organic dextran matrix large macromolecules consisting of dextran have been successfully applied in hydrolysis experiments before confer and logan 1997 spions have a zeta potential close to zero further the particles showed no signs of agglomeration or sedimentation the iron oxide cores serve as paramagnetic tagging causing fluctuating disturbances of the magnetic field hence mainly transverse relaxation is enhanced creating predominantly a t 2 contrast information about the applied particle concentration and loading is given in table 1 a detailed characterization of these particles is given in cuny et al 2015 microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps as model particulate organic matter cellulose is a major fraction of particulate organic matter in domestic wastewater as it originates from toilet paper ruiken et al 2013 a dispersion of the base product alfa aesar thermo fisher scientific gmbh karlsruhe germany was sonicated and wet sieved to collect a size fraction between 1 and 20 μm for paramagnetic tagging mcps have been suspended in a 50 g l ferrous sulphate solution under anoxic conditions after draining the iron ii saturated microcrystalline cellulose particles were dried at room temperature over night to allow for a complete oxidation of the often diamagnetic iron ii to paramagnetic iron iii no mobilization of iron iii ions was recognized later on real wastewater particles wwps primary effluent wastewater of the pilot scale wastewater treatment plant at eawag dübendorf switzerland was collected to extract real wwps after centrifuging 3000 rpm 5 min and decanting settled particles were collected and freeze dried before conducting the experiment the freeze dried particles were suspended in ultrapure water homogenized and wet sieved a size fraction between 28 and 100 μm was further used 2 3 experimental setup and procedure a small sample design was necessary to meet imaging requirements sufficient signal to noise ratio the authors are aware that due to the small column diameter wall effects have a larger impact on the process compared to commonly applied pilot and full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors a schematic of the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 the aerobic granules were placed inside a glass column with an inner diameter of 14 mm and a length of 100 mm the height of the bed of settled granular sludge was approximately 50 mm 2 cm space were given at each end of the column to distribute the flow before reaching the granular sludge bed at the bottom glass spheres with a diameter of 2 mm stabilized the granular sludge bed an o ring and a mesh size 0 7 mm fabric were positioned in between to separate the granules from the glass spheres both beds were wet packed to avoid air entrapment the glass column was installed into the 200 mhz spectrometer and connected to a peristaltic pump ismatec ipc idex health and science gmbh wertheim germany via polytetrafluoroethylene capillaries inner diameter 0 75 mm duratec analysentechnik gmbh hockenheim germany the granular sludge bed was initially rinsed with tap water for 60 min with a volumetric flow rate of 1 ml min corresponding to a flow velocity of 0 78 m h the particles were pumped through the column during two loading phases see table 1 in between the flow was turned off for image acquisition the particle suspension feed was positioned on a magnetic stirrer being continuously mixed to avoid particle sedimentation as channeling occurred at average velocities higher than 1 m h the particle concentration was adjusted to ensure a moderate experiment duration 2 4 adjusted parameters between experimental runs the artificial particles spions and mcps were paramagnetic tagged paramagnetic tagging strongly enhances image contrast via paramagnetic relaxation enhancement untreated particulate organic matter does not significantly alter the mri signal unless it appears in a large concentration and geometric extensions e g in form of particle layers the occurrence of particle layers in experiment 2 lead to the conclusion that paramagnetic relaxation enhancement is not necessary for micrometer sized particles in large concentrations thus no paramagnetic relaxation enhancement was conducted in experiment 3 in addition a larger minimum particle diameter has been chosen for the wwps to conclusively neglect penetration into the biofilm matrix as channeling occurred at average velocities higher than 1 m h the particle concentration was adjusted to ensure a moderate experiment duration in addition the average flow velocity was adjusted in experiment 3 due to the channeling event in experiment 2 in general high concentrations of particles in relation to biomass were necessary to allow for a clear detection of the transport behavior and differentiation of particles and granular sludge e g signal to noise ratio flow direction and field of view were changed for experiment 1 due to the aim of highlighting the granular sludge bed in contact with the bulk interface due to their particle size spions are staying suspended for weeks without any signs of settling 2 5 magnetic resonance imaging the experiments were performed on a 200 mhz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer bruker avance hdiii 200 swb bruker biospin gmbh rheinstetten germany the superconducting magnet has a vertical bore of 150 mm and a magnetic flux density b 0 of 4 7 t a 25 mm birdcage of the micwb 40 series was used gradients up to 1 5 t m were available in all spatial directions x y z multi slice multi echo imaging msme was performed in 2d and 3d as provided within paravision 6 0 1 bruker biospin gmbh rheinstetten germany a signal to noise study revealed that a combination of t 1 and t 2 weighting is the most convenient t 1 weighted images favor the so called longitudinal relaxation differences while simultaneously but to a smaller extent transverse relaxation is occurring vice versa the same applies for t 2 weighted images t 1 weighted images were used to differentiate between granules and the bulk liquid t 2 weighted images were acquired to supplementary locate the added particles within the bed of settled granules data acquisition parameters are listed in table 2 2 6 data analysis and visualization data analysis was performed within matlab r2018b mathworks nattick ma us using home written scripts and avizo 9 4 thermo fisher scientific waltham masssachusetts usa graphical illustrations of the data analysis are provided in the supporting information briefly the 3d datasets recorded at the end of each experiment have been segmented via interactive thresholding in the t 1 weighted images the shell of the granules showed high signal intensity and appeared bright these signals were used to separate the granules from the background e g bulk water phase from t 2 weighted images the dark appearing particles were extracted the resulting binary datasets were combined and an artificial color allocation was given to differentiate between void space black granules green and particles yellow in addition granules and particles were assigned to the fraction of granule particle white in case of spatially overlapping signals co localization see fig s1 it has to be noticed that the void space includes all voxels which have not been assigned to granules or particles during thresholding in particular these are interpreted as water filled pores and channels as well as the interior of granules confer t 1 weighted images in fig s1 quantification has been achieved as follows the volumetric fractions of each class have been determined for a region of interest in 3d as the wastewater particles were also visualized t 1 weighted images image analysis was adapted to quantify the fractions of granules particles and void spaces correctly within the limitations of the approach see supporting information s2 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 behavior of colloidal particles spions the aim of this experiment was to visualize and quantify the interaction of spions in the bulk phase and the granular sludge bed a set of mri images shows the behavior of spions in the granular sludge bed fig 2 in fig 2a the t 1 weighted images show the structure of the granular sludge bed bulk liquid phase and granules can be distinguished based on their respective t 1 relaxation times after applying the particle load spions were distributed within the pores of the granular sludge bed as visible in fig 2a after step ii spions enhance the relaxation of the liquid phase the result is a brighter appearing liquid phase and a declined contrast between granules and liquid phase in t 1 weighted images immediately after the spion injection compare steps i and ii in fig 2a however the t 2 weighted images are more sensitive for the detection of spions due to the inherent relaxivities of these spions cuny et al 2015 in t 2 weighted images fig 2b step ii the enhanced relaxation causes the low signal intensity of the liquid phase in contrast to the initial image shown in fig 2b step i the liquid phase can be distinguished from the granules in t 2 weighted images to study the interaction of the spions with and within the granular sludge bed driven by diffusion flow was stopped after 16 h without flow the pore space within the granular sludge bed appears bright in t2 weighted images fig 2b step iii which correlates to a low spion concentration the sorption of the colloidal particles to the granule surface is visible as a ring of low intensity in the t 2 weighted images in fig 2b step iii in relation to the intensity of the granular sludge bed the dark appearing bulk liquid phase above the granular sludge bed see fig 2b step iii indicates a relatively high concentration of spions without applied flow the spions were not deeply entering the granular sludge bed as no concentration gradient within the granular sludge bed is observed fig 2b step iii z 0 14 mm an additional particle load was reestablishing the concentration of spions within the pore space of the granular sludge bed compare fig 2a and b steps ii and iv by rinsing the granular sludge bed see fig 2 step v mobile particles were removed the t 2 weighted image in fig 2b step v shows residual spions immobilized at the granule surface see dark rings the liquid above and within the pore space exhibit a similar signal intensity compared to the initial state indicating a low spion concentration in the bulk liquid compare fig 2a steps i and v 3 2 experiment 2 behavior of microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps the set of t 1 and t 2 weighted mri images in fig 3 illustrates the behavior of mcps d p 1 20 μm in the granular sludge bed the formation of a channel through the granule bed can be observed on fig 3a steps i to iii at y 10 15 mm mcps are not recognizable in the t 1 weighted images after the initial particle load mcps accumulated below the granular sludge bed which is indicated by the darker regions in fig 3b step ii z 0 3 mm further accumulations of mcps are visible along the channel at y 10 15 mm see fig 3b step ii in detail mcps are found at the granule surfaces or in void spaces situated next to the channel nevertheless the major part of the granular sludge bed is free from mcps bright regions remaining in step ii compared to step i in fig 3b after the additional particle injection see fig 3b step iii further particle accumulation filled void space next to the channel and partially the channel itself while no additional particles distributed over the rest of the granular sludge bed the development of a preferential flow path at y 10 15 mm through the granular sludge bed was further confirmed by measuring flow data not shown 3 3 experiment 3 behavior of real wastewater particles wwps fig 4 illustrates the behavior of real wwps d p 28 100 μm inside the granular sludge bed to avoid immediate channeling as observed during the experiment with mcps see section 3 2 above the average flow velocity was lowered to 0 39 m h compared to the particles applied in the first two experiments spions mcps wwps caused an additional image contrast in predominantly t 1 weighted images see fig 4a steps ii and iii wwps appear brighter than the granules the wwps appear also more inhomogeneous in terms of signal intensity and are surrounded by some susceptibility artifacts black dots in bright layer fig 4a steps ii and iii the t 2 weighted images are more sensitive to the wwps in fig 4b the wwps appear dark because of a faster t 2 relaxation whereas the granules and void space are similar in signal intensity the wwps show a similar behavior compared to the mcps an accumulation in the void space and around the granule surfaces is observed after both injections see fig 4 steps ii and iii particles distribute within the granular sludge bed in the region of x 5 10 mm and z 5 20 mm the granular sludge bed was slightly rearranged during both particle loadings as indicated in fig 4a step i compared to ii and iii in this case the particles were slightly pushed through the granular sludge bed in fig 4 step iii the additional particle load led to further infiltration of wwps along the height of the granule bed as well as accumulation at the inlet z 5 mm x 3 10 mm 3 4 comparison of particle distribution in this section 3d mri datasets from the end of each experiment are analyzed and compared spions experiment 1 and micro particles experiment 2 and 3 interact differently with the granular sludge bed fig 5 the spions penetrated into the granules and remained immobilized sorbed white bars fig 5 analysis of these 3d mri datasets further revealed that spions penetrated each granule independent of its surrounding environment e g packaging density granule size sorption of spions occurred homogenously within the granular bed height z 3 13 mm as presented in fig 6 experiment 1 the penetration depth for spions into the granules was estimated to up to 300 50 μm due to the flow direction that s compacting the granular sludge bed the granule content in experiment 1 is the highest 60 for granule and granule particle in fig 5 the higher flow velocity in experiment 2 and the channeling event lead to a lower granule fraction compared to experiment 3 in general the granule fraction is underestimated within this approach due to lower signal intensities at the inner of the aerobic granules compared to the behavior of spions mcps locate nearby granules see fig 5 experiment 2 but do not penetrate the granules in consequence the fraction of granule particle white color allocation is below 1 in fig 5 for mcps compared to approximately 34 for spions since the wwps are larger than the mcps no penetration of the larger particles into the granules is assumed mcps and wwps behave similarly in terms of spatial distribution moreover micro particles preferentially accumulate at lower parts of the granular sludge bed rather than distributing equally within the void space due to advective and diffusive transport processes as concluded from fig 6 experiment 2 and 3 the distribution of mcps is mainly affected by the geometry of the flow path fig 6 experiment 2 particles gradually fill the void space along the channel which causes a heterogeneous distribution of mcps in addition a deposit of settled mcps on top of the granular sludge bed was detected the wastewater particle fraction yellow is sharply decreasing within the lower part z 4 6 mm of the granule bed see fig 6 experiment 3 the low particle fraction for wwps in fig 5 indicates that most particles are already retained at the glass spheres positioned below the granular sludge bed fig 1 almost complete particle retention was observed within the first 20 mm of the granule bed see fig 6c experiment 3 also an additional particle load or a higher flow velocity would release particles to the bulk phase atop the granular sludge bed similar to the observations made in experiment 2 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of mri the results prove the applicability of mri to study the fate and transport of particles into and through a settled bed of aerobic granules t 1 weighted images were successfully applied to resolve the structure of a settled bed of aerobic granules colloidal spions as well as micro particles mcps wwps were resolved in time and space x y z by t 2 weighted images further processing and merging of 3d mri data sets allowed for the determination of the particle position inside the granular sludge bed some uncertainties remain in the predictability of the granule and void space volume fractions because of their signal intensity the cores of the granules are assigned to the void space fraction the changes in signal intensity caused by diverse relaxation times within biofilms are usually aligned with its properties i e compactness and chemical composition for example bartacek et al 2016 observed that the outer zone of aerobic granules has a faster t 1 and t 2 relaxation than the inner core the faster relaxation times might be related to a higher amount of extracellular polymeric substances eps and microorganisms at the outer layers adav et al 2008 mcswain et al 2005 wang et al 2005 further the presence of precipitates in granules was reported which locally fastened relaxation time herrling et al 2017 kirkland 2017 nevertheless advanced image segmentation might improve the differentiation of void space and granule core via shape validating tools as applied by bégin et al 2014 on nerve fibers 4 2 particle retention the current study demonstrates that the retention mechanism of particulate organic matter is size dependent retention of particulate organic matter in an aerobic granular sludge reactor increases with decreasing influent wastewater particle size schwarzenbeck et al 2004 our results show that colloidal particles distribute equally within the granular sludge bed under applied flow thus colloidal particles are able to attach and penetrate granules we hypothesize that the hydrolysis of colloidal particles takes place within the granules and will lead to a rather uniform distribution of additional substrate during the subsequent cycles of a sbr furthermore the estimated penetration depth up to 300 50 μm suggests that the colloidal particles partially immobilize within the anoxic zone of aerobic granules therefore hydrolysis would potentially release organic carbon to phosphorous accumulating and denitrifying microorganisms in the anoxic zone and contribute to the growth of stable and compact granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015a experiments with mcps and wwps support findings of schwarzenbeck et al 2004 who concluded that the removal efficiency of micro particles seems critical recent studies demonstrated that micro particles are not able to penetrate granules and are retained at the granule surface de kreuk et al 2010 morgenroth et al 2002 pronk et al 2015a wagner et al 2015 this study supports and extends this knowledge as the accumulation of micro particles inside the void space was directly visualized during the feeding phase further particle accumulation leads to the formation of particle layers the particle layer thickness exceeds the particle diameter which leads to the conclusion that most of the particles are not attached to the granule surface but remain available mobile after the feeding phase overall around 80 of the particulate organic matter are in the micrometer range after a primary treatment step sophonsiri and morgenroth 2004 therefore a large quantity of particulate organic matter might not necessarily be washed out with the effluent but stays distributed remobilized over the whole reactor within the aerobic mixing phase 4 3 influence of flow velocity on particle distribution average flow velocity through the granular sludge bed during the anaerobic feeding phase is a particularly important strategic parameter experiment 1 showed that convection is necessary to distribute the spions over the granular sludge bed here a low flow velocity of 0 78 m h allowed for a uniform distribution of particles within the void space which is followed by sorption of spions to aerobic granular sludge the entire process resulted in an even distribution of spions within the granular sludge bed the impact of flow on the particle distribution is evident in the experiments utilizing mcps and wwps respectively channels formed that led to preferential flow and thus advective transport of particles occurred in experiment 2 high velocities inside the channel lead to a transport the mcps through the entire granular sludge bed this caused the sedimentation of mcps on top of the granular sludge bed in case of the wwps a reduced average velocity of 0 39 m h was sufficient to retain the majority of the particles within the first 20 mm of the settled bed of aerobic granules however for the typical anaerobic feeding time of around 1 h 0 39 m h would be much too low typically average flow velocities range from 1 to 5 m h for low strength wastewater derlon et al 2016 li et al 2014 pronk et al 2015b wagner et al 2015 channeling has been reported on full scale reactors at average filter velocities from 3 to 3 3 m h pronk et al 2015b our findings indicate that channeling might also occur at average filter velocities below 1 m h hence average filter velocities and volume exchange ratio should be considered to minimize the risk of washing out particulate organic matter during simultaneous fill and draw as applied by pronk et al 2015b on full scale reactors conclusions mri is a suitable analytical tool to visualize and quantify the transport and retention behavior of colloidal spions and micro particles microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps and real wastewater particles wwps inside a granular sludge bed the combination of t 1 and t 2 weighted images allowed for the localization of granules void space and particles in all spatial directions and over time the size of particles colloidal or several micrometer large governs their fate within the granular sludge bed during feeding colloidal particles spions distributed evenly over the granular sludge beds these also penetrate the granules homogeneously by up to 300 50 μm as these particles are retained and immobilized inside the granules degradation will most likely occur delivering additional substrate even in anoxic regions of aerobic granules micrometer sized particles of micro crystalline cellulose model particles as well as real wastewater particles were affected by gravitation sedimentation particles accumulated within as well as on top of the granular sludge bed results indicate that a large fraction of these particles remains mobile and might be degraded in subsequent phases of a sbr cycle or might be discharged causing constant or elevated effluent concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

19999,the removal or degradation of particulate organic matter is a crucial part in biological wastewater treatment this is even more valid with respect to aerobic granular sludge and the impact of particulate organic matter on the formation and stability of the entire granulation process before the organic part of the particulate matter can be hydrolyzed and finally degraded by the microorganism the particles have to be transported towards and retained within the granulated biomass the understanding of these processes is currently very limited thus the present study aimed at visualizing the transport of particulate organic matter into and through an aerobic granular sludge bed magnetic resonance imaging mri was successfully applied to resolve the different fractions of a granular sludge bed over time and space quantification and merging of 3d data sets allowed for a clear determination of the particle distribution within the granular sludge bed dextran coated super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions d p 38 10 nm served as model particles for colloidal particles microcrystalline cellulose particles d p 1 20 μm tagged with paramagnetic iron oxide were applied as a reference for toilet paper which is a major fraction of particulate matter in domestic wastewater the results were supplemented by the use of real wastewater particles with a size fraction between 28 and 100 μm colloidal spions distributed evenly over the granular sludge bed penetrating the granules up to 300 μm rinsing the granular sludge bed proved their immobilization microcrystalline cellulose and real wastewater particles in the micrometer range accumulated in the void space between settled granules an almost full retention of the wastewater particles was observed within the first 20 mm of the granular sludge bed moreover the formation of particle layers indicates that most of the micrometer sized particles are not attached to the biomass and remain mobile consequently these particles are released into the bulk phase when the granulated sludge bed is resuspended graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge particulate organic matter magnetic resonance imaging anaerobic feeding phase colloid wastewater particle hydrolysis 1 introduction within the last decade aerobic granular sludge systems for municipal wastewater treatment have proved to be economically competitive compared to the activated sludge systems giesen et al 2013 pronk et al 2015b by now around 50 aerobic granular sludge reactors have been set into operation in full scale for the treatment of wastewater haskoningdhv 2020 li et al 2014 despite these full scale plants only little is known about the granulation process during municipal wastewater treatment as well as the factors causing low or high effluent concentrations of particulate organic matter derlon et al 2016 rocktäschel et al 2015 wagner et al 2015 wilén et al 2018 around 50 of the chemical oxygen demand in municipal wastewater are dedicated to particulate organic matter the latter represents a crucial carbon source in municipal wastewater treatment orhon and çokgör 1997 particulate organic matter has to undergo hydrolysis before it can be metabolized to carbon dioxide and new biomass by the microorganisms the removal of particulate organic matter can be divided into 4 steps i external transport to the biofilm surface ii attachment of the particles iii hydrolysis of particulate organic matter and release of hydrolytic products iv uptake of these products by microorganisms boltz and motta 2007 li et al 2018 theories about the removal of particulate organic matter in granular sludge reactors typically assume that it attaches adsorbs at the granule surface during the feeding phase de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015a overall the degradation of particulate organic matter takes several days benneouala et al 2017 thus attachment is a prerequisite to ensure that particulate organic matter can serve as a carbon source for aerobic granular sludge systems and is not washed out with the effluent to understand how particulate organic matter behaves within a bed of settled granules during anaerobic feeding imaging techniques might be applied imaging techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm optical coherence tomography oct and micro computer tomography μ ct are either limited by their penetration depth or by exposing microorganisms to potentially harmful radiation adav et al 2008 bouma 2001 li et al 2018 peszynska et al 2016 magnetic resonance imaging mri is a powerful and widely applied tool in biofilm research herrling et al 2019 neu et al 2010 mri is a non destructive in situ method with a spatial resolution down to a few tenth of μm mri offers the spatial investigation of the distribution of nmr active nuclei commonly 1h relaxation times diffusional and advective transport an image contrast between water and biofilm is generated by their difference in the so called longitudinal t 1 and transverse t 2 relaxation times manz et al 2003 seymour et al 2004 the image contrast depends on the biofilm properties i

and nanoparticles bartacek et al 2016 herrling et al 2017 phoenix et al 2008 ramanan et al 2013 ranzinger et al 2016 in addition mri can be applied to resolve the dynamics of the water distribution and structure of the biofilm several studies explored biofilm development its impact on fluid flow biomass distribution and shape as well as cohesive and adhesive strength in tube reactors or porous media graf von der schulenburg et al 2008 manz et al 2003 seymour et al 2004 wagner et al 2010 the current study aims at exploiting the capabilities of mri in order to assess the fate of particulate organic matter during the anaerobic feeding phase of a granular sludge bed to our knowledge mass transport studies have been limited to single granules and or did not resolve an entire granular sludge bed the main objectives of this study were thus i to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of mri for the structural characterization of granular sludge beds ii to investigate the transport loading and retention behavior of particulate organic matter within a bed of settled granules and iii to demonstrate the dependence of the retention mechanism on the size of particulate organic matter super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions d p 38 10 nm have been applied which resemble the colloidal fraction of particulate organic matter the results are supplemented by the investigation of artificial microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps d p 1 20 μm and real wastewater particles wwps d p 28 100 μm as models for particulate organic matter in the micrometer range 2 material and methods 2 1 aerobic granular sludge aerobic granular sludge was taken from a lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr at eawag samples were sieved to separate flocs from aerobic granules d 0 63 mm the granule size allowed for a sufficient resolution of the voids between the granules the granules had a smooth surface and a typical size range of 1 2 mm granules were send from eawag dübendorf switzerland to karlsruhe germany approx 200 ml of granular sludge were filled in a bottle and covered to the top with tap water the bottle was send on ice in a styrofoam box the maximum delivery time was two days the first mri experiments were started immediately after sample arrival however granular sludge samples were stored in the fridge 4 c not longer than five days in case the experiments had to be repeated the latter could occur due to air bubbles or incorrect packing of the granules 2 2 preparation and characterization of particulate organic matter colloidal particles spions superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles spions with a diameter d p of 38 10 nm were utilized as reference for colloidal particles resembling the colloidal fraction of particulate organic matter nanomag d spio micromod partikeltechnologie gmbh rostock germany spions consist of iron oxide cores covered by an organic dextran matrix large macromolecules consisting of dextran have been successfully applied in hydrolysis experiments before confer and logan 1997 spions have a zeta potential close to zero further the particles showed no signs of agglomeration or sedimentation the iron oxide cores serve as paramagnetic tagging causing fluctuating disturbances of the magnetic field hence mainly transverse relaxation is enhanced creating predominantly a t 2 contrast information about the applied particle concentration and loading is given in table 1 a detailed characterization of these particles is given in cuny et al 2015 microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps as model particulate organic matter cellulose is a major fraction of particulate organic matter in domestic wastewater as it originates from toilet paper ruiken et al 2013 a dispersion of the base product alfa aesar thermo fisher scientific gmbh karlsruhe germany was sonicated and wet sieved to collect a size fraction between 1 and 20 μm for paramagnetic tagging mcps have been suspended in a 50 g l ferrous sulphate solution under anoxic conditions after draining the iron ii saturated microcrystalline cellulose particles were dried at room temperature over night to allow for a complete oxidation of the often diamagnetic iron ii to paramagnetic iron iii no mobilization of iron iii ions was recognized later on real wastewater particles wwps primary effluent wastewater of the pilot scale wastewater treatment plant at eawag dübendorf switzerland was collected to extract real wwps after centrifuging 3000 rpm 5 min and decanting settled particles were collected and freeze dried before conducting the experiment the freeze dried particles were suspended in ultrapure water homogenized and wet sieved a size fraction between 28 and 100 μm was further used 2 3 experimental setup and procedure a small sample design was necessary to meet imaging requirements sufficient signal to noise ratio the authors are aware that due to the small column diameter wall effects have a larger impact on the process compared to commonly applied pilot and full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors a schematic of the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 the aerobic granules were placed inside a glass column with an inner diameter of 14 mm and a length of 100 mm the height of the bed of settled granular sludge was approximately 50 mm 2 cm space were given at each end of the column to distribute the flow before reaching the granular sludge bed at the bottom glass spheres with a diameter of 2 mm stabilized the granular sludge bed an o ring and a mesh size 0 7 mm fabric were positioned in between to separate the granules from the glass spheres both beds were wet packed to avoid air entrapment the glass column was installed into the 200 mhz spectrometer and connected to a peristaltic pump ismatec ipc idex health and science gmbh wertheim germany via polytetrafluoroethylene capillaries inner diameter 0 75 mm duratec analysentechnik gmbh hockenheim germany the granular sludge bed was initially rinsed with tap water for 60 min with a volumetric flow rate of 1 ml min corresponding to a flow velocity of 0 78 m h the particles were pumped through the column during two loading phases see table 1 in between the flow was turned off for image acquisition the particle suspension feed was positioned on a magnetic stirrer being continuously mixed to avoid particle sedimentation as channeling occurred at average velocities higher than 1 m h the particle concentration was adjusted to ensure a moderate experiment duration 2 4 adjusted parameters between experimental runs the artificial particles spions and mcps were paramagnetic tagged paramagnetic tagging strongly enhances image contrast via paramagnetic relaxation enhancement untreated particulate organic matter does not significantly alter the mri signal unless it appears in a large concentration and geometric extensions e g in form of particle layers the occurrence of particle layers in experiment 2 lead to the conclusion that paramagnetic relaxation enhancement is not necessary for micrometer sized particles in large concentrations thus no paramagnetic relaxation enhancement was conducted in experiment 3 in addition a larger minimum particle diameter has been chosen for the wwps to conclusively neglect penetration into the biofilm matrix as channeling occurred at average velocities higher than 1 m h the particle concentration was adjusted to ensure a moderate experiment duration in addition the average flow velocity was adjusted in experiment 3 due to the channeling event in experiment 2 in general high concentrations of particles in relation to biomass were necessary to allow for a clear detection of the transport behavior and differentiation of particles and granular sludge e g signal to noise ratio flow direction and field of view were changed for experiment 1 due to the aim of highlighting the granular sludge bed in contact with the bulk interface due to their particle size spions are staying suspended for weeks without any signs of settling 2 5 magnetic resonance imaging the experiments were performed on a 200 mhz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer bruker avance hdiii 200 swb bruker biospin gmbh rheinstetten germany the superconducting magnet has a vertical bore of 150 mm and a magnetic flux density b 0 of 4 7 t a 25 mm birdcage of the micwb 40 series was used gradients up to 1 5 t m were available in all spatial directions x y z multi slice multi echo imaging msme was performed in 2d and 3d as provided within paravision 6 0 1 bruker biospin gmbh rheinstetten germany a signal to noise study revealed that a combination of t 1 and t 2 weighting is the most convenient t 1 weighted images favor the so called longitudinal relaxation differences while simultaneously but to a smaller extent transverse relaxation is occurring vice versa the same applies for t 2 weighted images t 1 weighted images were used to differentiate between granules and the bulk liquid t 2 weighted images were acquired to supplementary locate the added particles within the bed of settled granules data acquisition parameters are listed in table 2 2 6 data analysis and visualization data analysis was performed within matlab r2018b mathworks nattick ma us using home written scripts and avizo 9 4 thermo fisher scientific waltham masssachusetts usa graphical illustrations of the data analysis are provided in the supporting information briefly the 3d datasets recorded at the end of each experiment have been segmented via interactive thresholding in the t 1 weighted images the shell of the granules showed high signal intensity and appeared bright these signals were used to separate the granules from the background e g bulk water phase from t 2 weighted images the dark appearing particles were extracted the resulting binary datasets were combined and an artificial color allocation was given to differentiate between void space black granules green and particles yellow in addition granules and particles were assigned to the fraction of granule particle white in case of spatially overlapping signals co localization see fig s1 it has to be noticed that the void space includes all voxels which have not been assigned to granules or particles during thresholding in particular these are interpreted as water filled pores and channels as well as the interior of granules confer t 1 weighted images in fig s1 quantification has been achieved as follows the volumetric fractions of each class have been determined for a region of interest in 3d as the wastewater particles were also visualized t 1 weighted images image analysis was adapted to quantify the fractions of granules particles and void spaces correctly within the limitations of the approach see supporting information s2 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 behavior of colloidal particles spions the aim of this experiment was to visualize and quantify the interaction of spions in the bulk phase and the granular sludge bed a set of mri images shows the behavior of spions in the granular sludge bed fig 2 in fig 2a the t 1 weighted images show the structure of the granular sludge bed bulk liquid phase and granules can be distinguished based on their respective t 1 relaxation times after applying the particle load spions were distributed within the pores of the granular sludge bed as visible in fig 2a after step ii spions enhance the relaxation of the liquid phase the result is a brighter appearing liquid phase and a declined contrast between granules and liquid phase in t 1 weighted images immediately after the spion injection compare steps i and ii in fig 2a however the t 2 weighted images are more sensitive for the detection of spions due to the inherent relaxivities of these spions cuny et al 2015 in t 2 weighted images fig 2b step ii the enhanced relaxation causes the low signal intensity of the liquid phase in contrast to the initial image shown in fig 2b step i the liquid phase can be distinguished from the granules in t 2 weighted images to study the interaction of the spions with and within the granular sludge bed driven by diffusion flow was stopped after 16 h without flow the pore space within the granular sludge bed appears bright in t2 weighted images fig 2b step iii which correlates to a low spion concentration the sorption of the colloidal particles to the granule surface is visible as a ring of low intensity in the t 2 weighted images in fig 2b step iii in relation to the intensity of the granular sludge bed the dark appearing bulk liquid phase above the granular sludge bed see fig 2b step iii indicates a relatively high concentration of spions without applied flow the spions were not deeply entering the granular sludge bed as no concentration gradient within the granular sludge bed is observed fig 2b step iii z 0 14 mm an additional particle load was reestablishing the concentration of spions within the pore space of the granular sludge bed compare fig 2a and b steps ii and iv by rinsing the granular sludge bed see fig 2 step v mobile particles were removed the t 2 weighted image in fig 2b step v shows residual spions immobilized at the granule surface see dark rings the liquid above and within the pore space exhibit a similar signal intensity compared to the initial state indicating a low spion concentration in the bulk liquid compare fig 2a steps i and v 3 2 experiment 2 behavior of microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps the set of t 1 and t 2 weighted mri images in fig 3 illustrates the behavior of mcps d p 1 20 μm in the granular sludge bed the formation of a channel through the granule bed can be observed on fig 3a steps i to iii at y 10 15 mm mcps are not recognizable in the t 1 weighted images after the initial particle load mcps accumulated below the granular sludge bed which is indicated by the darker regions in fig 3b step ii z 0 3 mm further accumulations of mcps are visible along the channel at y 10 15 mm see fig 3b step ii in detail mcps are found at the granule surfaces or in void spaces situated next to the channel nevertheless the major part of the granular sludge bed is free from mcps bright regions remaining in step ii compared to step i in fig 3b after the additional particle injection see fig 3b step iii further particle accumulation filled void space next to the channel and partially the channel itself while no additional particles distributed over the rest of the granular sludge bed the development of a preferential flow path at y 10 15 mm through the granular sludge bed was further confirmed by measuring flow data not shown 3 3 experiment 3 behavior of real wastewater particles wwps fig 4 illustrates the behavior of real wwps d p 28 100 μm inside the granular sludge bed to avoid immediate channeling as observed during the experiment with mcps see section 3 2 above the average flow velocity was lowered to 0 39 m h compared to the particles applied in the first two experiments spions mcps wwps caused an additional image contrast in predominantly t 1 weighted images see fig 4a steps ii and iii wwps appear brighter than the granules the wwps appear also more inhomogeneous in terms of signal intensity and are surrounded by some susceptibility artifacts black dots in bright layer fig 4a steps ii and iii the t 2 weighted images are more sensitive to the wwps in fig 4b the wwps appear dark because of a faster t 2 relaxation whereas the granules and void space are similar in signal intensity the wwps show a similar behavior compared to the mcps an accumulation in the void space and around the granule surfaces is observed after both injections see fig 4 steps ii and iii particles distribute within the granular sludge bed in the region of x 5 10 mm and z 5 20 mm the granular sludge bed was slightly rearranged during both particle loadings as indicated in fig 4a step i compared to ii and iii in this case the particles were slightly pushed through the granular sludge bed in fig 4 step iii the additional particle load led to further infiltration of wwps along the height of the granule bed as well as accumulation at the inlet z 5 mm x 3 10 mm 3 4 comparison of particle distribution in this section 3d mri datasets from the end of each experiment are analyzed and compared spions experiment 1 and micro particles experiment 2 and 3 interact differently with the granular sludge bed fig 5 the spions penetrated into the granules and remained immobilized sorbed white bars fig 5 analysis of these 3d mri datasets further revealed that spions penetrated each granule independent of its surrounding environment e g packaging density granule size sorption of spions occurred homogenously within the granular bed height z 3 13 mm as presented in fig 6 experiment 1 the penetration depth for spions into the granules was estimated to up to 300 50 μm due to the flow direction that s compacting the granular sludge bed the granule content in experiment 1 is the highest 60 for granule and granule particle in fig 5 the higher flow velocity in experiment 2 and the channeling event lead to a lower granule fraction compared to experiment 3 in general the granule fraction is underestimated within this approach due to lower signal intensities at the inner of the aerobic granules compared to the behavior of spions mcps locate nearby granules see fig 5 experiment 2 but do not penetrate the granules in consequence the fraction of granule particle white color allocation is below 1 in fig 5 for mcps compared to approximately 34 for spions since the wwps are larger than the mcps no penetration of the larger particles into the granules is assumed mcps and wwps behave similarly in terms of spatial distribution moreover micro particles preferentially accumulate at lower parts of the granular sludge bed rather than distributing equally within the void space due to advective and diffusive transport processes as concluded from fig 6 experiment 2 and 3 the distribution of mcps is mainly affected by the geometry of the flow path fig 6 experiment 2 particles gradually fill the void space along the channel which causes a heterogeneous distribution of mcps in addition a deposit of settled mcps on top of the granular sludge bed was detected the wastewater particle fraction yellow is sharply decreasing within the lower part z 4 6 mm of the granule bed see fig 6 experiment 3 the low particle fraction for wwps in fig 5 indicates that most particles are already retained at the glass spheres positioned below the granular sludge bed fig 1 almost complete particle retention was observed within the first 20 mm of the granule bed see fig 6c experiment 3 also an additional particle load or a higher flow velocity would release particles to the bulk phase atop the granular sludge bed similar to the observations made in experiment 2 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of mri the results prove the applicability of mri to study the fate and transport of particles into and through a settled bed of aerobic granules t 1 weighted images were successfully applied to resolve the structure of a settled bed of aerobic granules colloidal spions as well as micro particles mcps wwps were resolved in time and space x y z by t 2 weighted images further processing and merging of 3d mri data sets allowed for the determination of the particle position inside the granular sludge bed some uncertainties remain in the predictability of the granule and void space volume fractions because of their signal intensity the cores of the granules are assigned to the void space fraction the changes in signal intensity caused by diverse relaxation times within biofilms are usually aligned with its properties i e compactness and chemical composition for example bartacek et al 2016 observed that the outer zone of aerobic granules has a faster t 1 and t 2 relaxation than the inner core the faster relaxation times might be related to a higher amount of extracellular polymeric substances eps and microorganisms at the outer layers adav et al 2008 mcswain et al 2005 wang et al 2005 further the presence of precipitates in granules was reported which locally fastened relaxation time herrling et al 2017 kirkland 2017 nevertheless advanced image segmentation might improve the differentiation of void space and granule core via shape validating tools as applied by bégin et al 2014 on nerve fibers 4 2 particle retention the current study demonstrates that the retention mechanism of particulate organic matter is size dependent retention of particulate organic matter in an aerobic granular sludge reactor increases with decreasing influent wastewater particle size schwarzenbeck et al 2004 our results show that colloidal particles distribute equally within the granular sludge bed under applied flow thus colloidal particles are able to attach and penetrate granules we hypothesize that the hydrolysis of colloidal particles takes place within the granules and will lead to a rather uniform distribution of additional substrate during the subsequent cycles of a sbr furthermore the estimated penetration depth up to 300 50 μm suggests that the colloidal particles partially immobilize within the anoxic zone of aerobic granules therefore hydrolysis would potentially release organic carbon to phosphorous accumulating and denitrifying microorganisms in the anoxic zone and contribute to the growth of stable and compact granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015a experiments with mcps and wwps support findings of schwarzenbeck et al 2004 who concluded that the removal efficiency of micro particles seems critical recent studies demonstrated that micro particles are not able to penetrate granules and are retained at the granule surface de kreuk et al 2010 morgenroth et al 2002 pronk et al 2015a wagner et al 2015 this study supports and extends this knowledge as the accumulation of micro particles inside the void space was directly visualized during the feeding phase further particle accumulation leads to the formation of particle layers the particle layer thickness exceeds the particle diameter which leads to the conclusion that most of the particles are not attached to the granule surface but remain available mobile after the feeding phase overall around 80 of the particulate organic matter are in the micrometer range after a primary treatment step sophonsiri and morgenroth 2004 therefore a large quantity of particulate organic matter might not necessarily be washed out with the effluent but stays distributed remobilized over the whole reactor within the aerobic mixing phase 4 3 influence of flow velocity on particle

utilizing mcps and wwps respectively channels formed that led to preferential flow and thus advective transport of particles occurred in experiment 2 high velocities inside the channel lead to a

sufficient to retain the majority of the particles within the first 20 mm of the settled bed of aerobic granules however for the typical anaerobic feeding time of around 1 h 0 39 m h would be much too low typically average flow velocities range from 1 to 5 m h for low strength wastewater derlon et al 2016 li et al 2014 pronk et al 2015b wagner et al 2015 channeling has been reported on full scale reactors at average filter velocities from 3 to 3 3 m h pronk et al 2015b our findings indicate that channeling might also occur at average filter velocities below 1 m h hence average filter velocities and volume exchange ratio should be considered to minimize the risk of washing out particulate organic matter during simultaneous fill and draw as applied by pronk et al 2015b on full scale reactors conclusions mri is a suitable analytical tool to visualize and quantify the transport and retention behavior of colloidal spions and micro particles microcrystalline cellulose particles mcps and real wastewater particles wwps inside a granular sludge bed the combination of t 1 and t 2 weighted images allowed for the localization of granules void space and particles in all spatial directions and over time the size of particles colloidal or several micrometer large governs their fate within the granular sludge bed during feeding colloidal particles spions distributed evenly over the granular sludge beds these also penetrate the granules homogeneously by up to 300 50 μm as these particles are retained and immobilized inside the granules degradation will most likely occur delivering additional substrate even in anoxic regions of aerobic granules micrometer sized particles of micro crystalline cellulose model particles as well as real wastewater particles were affected by gravitation sedimentation particles accumulated within as well as on top of the granular sludge bed results indicate that a large fraction of these particles remains mobile and might be degraded in subsequent phases of a sbr cycle or might be discharged causing constant or elevated effluent concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
