11205,one of the strategies proposed for reducing nitrate losses from subsurface tile drain systems in midwestern agricultural lands controlled drainage is known to reduce drain flow on an annual basis but is not well understood for individual events understanding hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from free and controlled drainage systems during drainage events can offer improved insight on the overall functioning of these systems so that they can be better managed or retrofitted to increase their environmental benefits this study used data from a monitoring site in east central indiana to investigate the hydrology of 22 drainage events in free and controlled subsurface drainage systems relationships between event drainage volume drain flow hydrograph metrics column soil moisture water table depth and precipitation time series for each event were explored to determine the effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions on these metrics controlled drainage reduced event drainage volume and peak flows by 22 12 and 29 16 respectively and increased the time to peak of drainage by 98 52 higher total precipitation and precipitation time spread increased infiltration while the average precipitation intensity did not correlate with drainage volumes in either system peak flow rate in free draining quadrants were positively affected by higher precipitation and average precipitation intensity while in managed quadrants the antecedent soil moisture appeared to be more influential in affecting peak flow rate than precipitation characteristics surface runoff potential increased with the increase in average precipitation intensity in all quadrants saturation excess ponding or possibly overland flow occurred in events that have a low average precipitation intensity and a high precipitation time spread field observations indicate that saturation excess overland flow was more pronounced in controlled quadrants because water table levels rose higher than the water table levels of their free draining counterpart keywords controlled subsurface drainage tile drainage drainage event hydrologic controls event based analysis 1 introduction controlled drainage cd also known as drainage water management is one management practice that aims to reduce flow from subsurface drains by installing in line water control structures at field outlets the structure acts as a dam that keeps water table levels above drain levels in order to conserve the nitrate laden drainage water at its point of generation frankenberger et al 2004 skaggs and schilfgaarde 1999 controlled drainage is based on the premise that not all water held inside the soil needs to be drained at all times of the year an increase in anaerobic conditions in the soil as well as longer flowpaths through deeper soil layers may promote favorable conditions for denitrification meek et al 1969 willardson et al 1970 field studies at 20 different locations around the united states canada and northern europe reported that cd reduces average annual drainage volumes from 17 to over 89 and does not greatly affect drainage nitrate concentrations skaggs et al 2012 however this reduction varied across sites and even in the midwest corn belt mean drainage reductions between 19 and 89 have been reported from field studies varying in length from two to ten years e g saadat et al 2018a adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 fausey et al 2004 helmers et al 2012 tan et al 1998 such across site variability in drainage flow reduction is attributed to differences in soil properties drainage system intensity drainage operational strategy topography and climate skaggs et al 2010 simulation studies of the potential impact of cd have reported that in addition to conserving drainage water the practice also increases seepage and surface runoff skaggs et al 2010 ale et al 2009 singh et al 2007 singh et al 2007 concluded that there is a tradeoff between subsurface drainage water and surface runoff as a means of getting the water out of the field through drainmod simulations for a 50 year period skaggs et al 2010 showed that cd conserves water reduces drainage and increases surface runoff moreover cd reduces drainage volumes by increasing surface runoff lateral seepage vertical seepage and evapotranspiration field studies that have measured total outflows from cd experiments noted that cd resulted in a reduction of drainage flow that is accompanied by an almost equal increase of surface runoff that generally has a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus concentration than drain water gaynor et al 2002 valero et al 2007 drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 accordingly by potentially increasing surface runoff cd could have a positive effect on nitrogen and a negative effect on phosphorus load leaving the field these previous studies that examine drain flows on a daily adeuya et al 2012 saadat et al 2018a monthly helmers et al 2012 lalonde et al 1996 and annual basis saadat et al 2018b helmers et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 drury et al 2009 provide important information on volume differences between free and controlled drainage systems the adoption of a drainage event based analysis approach however provides a physical basis for the comparison of drain volumes on an intra inter site level with respect to hydroclimatological characteristics particularly when the record is incomplete an event based approach can be used to systematically examine conventional and controlled drainage systems across different sites which can make it useful for synthesis studies accordingly a better understanding of the hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from controlled and conventionally managed tile systems during drainage events can offer improved insight on the overall functioning and effectiveness of the treatments so that they can be better managed or retrofitted to increase environmental benefits by conserving more water and better promoting denitrification a number of studies have systematically examined storm event hydrology in conventionally drained systems reid and parkinson 1984 studied drainage event hydrographs with respect to precipitation topographic controls and seasonal variations in the antecedent conditions in north london united kingdom seasonal differences in event drainage response were attributed to differences in antecedent soil moisture the time lag between rainfall and the peak drain flow during the non winter events that had drier antecedent moisture conditions was generally longer than the lag for winter events the authors attributed this to a faster transmission of water through deep cracks amatya et al 2000 used a paired watershed approach to study storm event hydrology of free and controlled subsurface drainage in loblolly pine experimental watersheds in north carolina and found that controlled drainage significantly reduced total drainage volume and peak flow rates for all events vidon and cuadra 2010 examined the hydrological controls that regulate matrix flow and macropore flow for eight drainage events that occurred during spring for two free draining subsurface drain systems in central indiana they found that antecedent soil moisture had a minor role in affecting tile flow response within one season while total precipitation was a more important predictor of mean and peak flow rate in their thorough treatment of the effect of subsurface drainage on streamflow peaks robinson et al 1999 reviewed a number of field drainage and simulations studies they concluded that in areas with high water table because of high rainfall and or poor permeability drainage increases the soil water storage capacity and reduces surface runoff and peak storm flows contrarily in areas that have deep water tables because of dry climates and permeable soils artificial drainage increases peak flows because of greater hydraulic gradients and short flow paths robinson et al 1999 however controlled drainage has not been studied in midwestern agricultural systems on an event basis although much is known about factors that influence the event hydrology of artificially drained landscapes that are free draining there is a need to investigate the hydrological controls in controlled subsurface drainage systems in order to gain greater understanding of observed variability in the effectiveness of this conservation practice the overarching goal of this study is to better characterize the hydrological behavior of free draining and controlled subsurface drainage systems by systematically studying the hydrologic responses of tile drainage systems during storm events this is achieved by exploring the effect of precipitation characteristics and site antecedent conditions on event outflow volume and the timing and magnitude of peak drainflow the mechanisms which generate overland flow or ponding on the field are also examined 2 site description and experimental setup the controlled drainage research site is located at 40 266 n 85 160 w in eastern indiana at the davis purdue agricultural center dpac the 14 3 ha field is divided into four quadrants two that are free draining southwest sw and northeast ne and two that are controlled northwest nw and southeast se fig 1 brooks 2013 utt 2010 adeuya 2009 there is an elevation change of approximately 3 m across the field the dominant soil parent material in the area is clayey wisconsin glacial till franzmeier et al 2004 the soil series map shown in fig 1 comes from a first order soil survey that was done by g steinhardt at the purdue agronomy department the first order soil survey provides a higher resolution delineation of the soils than the soil survey geographic database ssurgo digital soils map but the official soil series descriptions were found to provide an appropriate description of the soils in the area the predominant soil series in each quadrant are shown in table 1 along with their drainage class and depth to restrictive layer soil survey staff 2014 soil was sampled at three locations near the water table well and at four depths in each quadrant the soil at the sampling sites in the southern quadrants is clay throughout the profile while in the northern quadrants the soil in the first 20 cm is clay loam and at greater depths it becomes clay since clay generally has a lower hydraulic conductivity than clay loam such variability in the soil layers across the four quadrants may have implications for the overall hydraulic behavior as reflected in the observation wells the subsurface drainage system connects a submain in each of the quadrants to the outlet that empties into a subsurface county main in the northwest corner of the field laterals 10 cm diameter flowing into each submain are at a nominal 14 m spacing and depth of 1 m the sw and ne quadrants drain freely while the nw and se quadrants are under controlled drainage inline water level control structures agridrain corp adair iowa were placed at the outlet of the nw and se quadrants and due to its topography the se quadrant has two control structures during 2012 and 2013 the height of drop logs was controlled to have a high water table during winter 0 1 m below the surface to offer water quality benefits and a lower water table during summer 0 4 m below the surface to reduce the likelihood of water logging in the soil that would cause damage to crops drop logs are usually pulled from the control structure before field operations to enhance the trafficability and workability of the soil so that it can support agricultural machinery electromagnetic flow meters krohne waterflux 3070 were installed at the outlet of each quadrant brooks 2013 these flow meters can accurately measure bidirectional flow at very low flow levels as well as high flow levels these electromagnetic flow meters offer an advantage over other measurement methods as they can capture the timing and volume of backward flow that occurs at this site during large flow events due to restricted flow through the outlet four long term water table monitoring wells are positioned at the mid point between two lateral drains and near the soil sampling locations they were instrumented with global water wl16 water level loggers soil moisture sensor nests were installed in the field near each of the monitoring wells brooks 2013 each nest consists of one 5te and four 5tm decagon capacitance based soil moisture sensors placed at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm each of the sensors measures the soil volumetric water content vwc and the soil temperature the sensor nests are located in actively farmed areas so the 10 and 20 cm sensors must be removed during tillage operations and replaced following planting resulting in gaps in data in this dataset a tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronic te525 l measures rainfall in 0 01 inch increments at the monitoring site 3 methodology total soil moisture in the soil profile was calculated using the trapezoidal rule hupet et al 2004 hupet and vanclooster 2004 soil moisture measurement time gaps due to malfunctioning soil moisture sensors were filled using data from the adjacent sensor with maximum correlation to the failed sensor see bou lahdou 2014 for details water table data was processed as height of water table above the corresponding tile drain depth the water table height above the drain was adjusted to be zero when the outlet was lowered and drain flow dropped to zero the adjustment procedure was required because the sensor height changed during the course of this study saadat et al 2017 continuous hourly and daily precipitation records for the site were generated by filling missing data from the on site gauge using data from the national climatic data center ncdc gauge and purdue automatic gauge network located at dpac bou lahdou 2014 a drainage event was identified if it produced a peak drain flow greater than 5 m3 h and drain flow data was available for the event for at least two quadrants the start of the event was defined as one hour before precipitation started and the end of the event was defined as the time at which drain flow in the nw quadrant was less than 70 liters hour for 10 consecutive hours basing the end of the event on the drain flow from one quadrant was necessary to make data extraction for the same event from all quadrants consistent the nw quadrant was chosen because the western quadrants have the most complete drainage data set and the nw quadrant has shorter flow duration than the sw quadrant thus allowing for a shorter event definition fig 2 shows net drain flow water table depth and soil moisture for a sample drainage event total event precipitation was 12 7 mm the event start and end times are indicated by the vertical dashed lines water table is given as height above the drain level a total of 22 events were identified in 2012 and 2013 out of the 22 events 11 events have complete drainage data across the four quadrants the nw sw and ne quadrants have water table data missing for three two and two events respectively although events represent only a portion of annual flow the 15 events for which complete data are available from this study in 2012 out of 19 drainage events represented 67 and 90 of the measured annual drain flow that occurred from a free and controlled field respectively sixteen hydrological metrics were extracted from each event as summarized in table 2 events 18 and 19 occurred in march 2013 in a period in which rainfall followed a few days of snow accumulation the event start was defined by the start of the rain event therefore the earlier snow precipitation was not originally captured in the event precipitation total the daily contribution of snow melt to the drainage event was estimated from the daily change in snow depth as recorded by the ncdc coop station as it was melting and generating a drainage response at field w the snow density was estimated by assuming that the prior precipitation as measured from the coop station came completely as snowfall the sum of melt water and rainfall that occurred during each event was used as an input for the total precipitation a metric called precipitation time spread was developed to quantify how precipitation is distributed over the course of a drainage event this is a measure of the standard deviation of the center of mass of precipitation and represents how concentrated or dispersed the precipitation is that occurs during the course of the drainage event for each drainage event equations 1 and 2 were employed to calculate the precipitation weighted standard deviation of the precipitation time series as follows 1 t i 1 n t i p i i 1 n p i where t is the weighted mean or the center of mass of the precipitation event in hours ti is the time in hours of each precipitation pulse with respect to the start of the event pi is the precipitation that fell during interval t i and n is the duration hours of the drainage event the weighted standard deviation or precipitation time spread is calculated as 2 ó t i 1 n t i t 2 p i i 1 n p i in order to evaluate the impact of controlled drainage on event hydrology three change metrics were also calculated the drainage volume percentage change for each event is the difference between the average total drainage volume of free draining quadrants and the average total drainage volume of managed quadrants divided by the average total drainage volume of free draining quadrants similarly the peak flow change and change in time to peak were calculated based on the difference between the average of free draining quadrants and the average of managed quadrants kendall s tau a rank based non parametric hypothesis test for statistical dependence was used throughout the results and discussion section to generate measures of correlation this test does not assume a distribution and is generally resistant to the effect of outliers and efficient in detecting monotonic relationships helsel and hirsch 2002 drainage and antecedent conditions metrics were separated by management type controlled versus free draining for the analysis and a 5 significance level was used the wilcoxon signed rank non parametric hypothesis test was used throughout the results and discussion section to evaluate if median values of controlled and free drainage metrics are significantly different from each other at a 5 significance level 4 results and discussion 4 1 event precipitation characteristics the total precipitation depth average precipitation intensity and precipitation time spread for all the drainage events are summarized in fig 3 see bou lahdou 2014 for a list of all events two events occurred mainly as a result of snow melt thus both of these events have a total precipitation depth but no precipitation intensity and precipitation time spread were calculated event 3 had the lowest total precipitation depth 10 mm that resulted mostly from six hours of continuous low intensity precipitation 1 7 mm hr bou lahdou 2014 event 22 had the highest total precipitation that resulted mostly from a four hour precipitation event with an average intensity of 14 5 mm hr bou lahdou 2014 to put the two precipitation events in context they were compared to the depth duration curves of the area bonnin et al 2006 these two events have return periods of less than a year and 10 years respectively based on their intensity and duration the total precipitation depth fig 3a and average precipitation intensity fig 3b had a right skewed distribution with the majority of the events having a total precipitation depth between 10 and 30 mm and an average precipitation intensity that is between 0 5 and 3 mm hr six out of 22 events have a high precipitation time spread which indicates that more than one storm occurred during these events or precipitation pulses were spread out throughout the drainage event fig 3c events that had a precipitation depth between 10 and 20 mm generally had an average precipitation intensity that is less than 4 mm h events that had high average precipitation intensity greater than 3 mm hr tended to have a low duration while events that had lower precipitation intensity tend to have a high duration of precipitation 4 2 drainage volumes and reduction in drainage one overall effect of cd during drainage events is to reduce the outflow volume from controlled quadrants however the difference in the drainage volume between the controlled and free draining quadrants is not consistent as a multitude of factors can affect drainage volumes which are explored below 4 2 1 effect of precipitation characteristics on drainage volumes the relationship between total drainage volume and total precipitation depth average precipitation intensity and precipitation time spread is illustrated in fig 4 drainage volume does not show a clearly discernible relationship to precipitation depth fig 4a although the smoothed line based on locally weighted scatter plot smoothing lowess of the controlled and free draining quadrant data suggests a tendency towards increasing drainage volumes with increasing precipitation on average across all events the free draining quadrants have a higher drainage volume than managed drainage p 0 05 rank sum test the general difference is 1 3 2 mm during precipitation events that have totals between 10 and 20 mm of rainfall and 2 5 3 mm during precipitation events that have totals that are greater than 20 mm fig 4a the average precipitation intensity as a standalone variable does not have any observable impact on drainage volume fig 4b while the precipitation time spread is a more important hydrologic control that affects drainage volumes as shown in fig 4c this was expected as the more the precipitation is spread across the drainage event the more time is available for water to infiltrate and thus increase the drainage volume there also appears to be a positive correlation between the total drainage volume and the hours of precipitation not shown correlation analysis based on kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient reveals that out of the four examined precipitation characteristics the total precipitation depth hours of precipitation and the precipitation time spread are significantly correlated p 0 05 to the drainage volume in both controlled and uncontrolled quadrants with the latter having the highest kendall s tau 0 5 in controlled quadrants and 0 41 in uncontrolled quadrants on the contrary average precipitation intensity does not appear to have a direct effect on drainage volume p 0 05 this observation is further discussed below as precipitation intensity might have an important effect on overland flow generation 4 2 2 effect of antecedent conditions on drainage volumes overall drainage volume was not significantly affected by antecedent water table height fig 5 but the behavior differs even among the two replicates of each drainage treatment the ne quadrant is the driest among all four quadrants and it has an event drainage volume that is greater than all other quadrants this has also been observed by brooks 2013 this suggests that the ne quadrant is more efficient in draining water than its sw counterpart the ne quadrant antecedent water table height fluctuates around a height of 0 05 m above the drain and it does not seem to affect the drainage volume in the quadrant fig 5 kendall s tau τ rank correlations between antecedent conditions both antecedent water table height and antecedent soil moisture and drainage volumes are not statistically significant p 0 05 for controlled and free draining quadrants the previous examination of the initial height of the water table s effect on drainage volumes fig 5 suggests one probable reason behind this statistical insignificance the antecedent conditions in each quadrant appear to operate in loosely defined and different ranges thus using data from both controlled or both free quadrants in the test fails to highlight if there is any relationship in the data fig 5 see bou lahdou 2014 these results agree with the finding of vidon and cuadra 2010 who concluded that antecedent conditions cause some variability in the tile flow response but precipitation was the main driver and predictor of volume for drainage events that happen during the fallow season 4 2 3 effect of antecedent conditions on the reduction in drainage volumes reduction in drainage volume due to drainage water management from the 11 events in which drainage data for all quadrants is available was calculated drainage volume reduction due to controlled drainage ranged from 8 and 38 with an average and standard deviation of 22 12 if the event reduction from the nw and sw pair from the remaining 11 events in which the ne and se data are missing is included with the 11 events in which data from all quadrants are available then drainage volume reduction of the 22 events averages 25 a value that is close to the average reduction of the 11 events in which drainage data for all quadrants is available to further evaluate and understand event reduction in drainage volumes all quadrants were paired with both of their counterparts i e each freely drained was paired with both controlled quadrants and the drainage volume percentage reduction was calculated to examine the potential effect of antecedent conditions on drainage volume reduction scatter plots of the antecedent water table height of the controlled quadrants versus the percent reduction in drainage volume were plotted for all quadrant pairs fig 6 the plots highlight a weak relationship between the antecedent water table and percent drainage volume reduction for the nw sw se ne and nw ne pairs as expected a lower antecedent water table in controlled quadrants may result in greater reduction in drainage volumes an examination of the association between the percent reduction in drainage volume for each of the pairs and precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions yielded statistically insignificant results and variables that were statistically significant for one pair were not significant for the rest of the quadrant pairs such an inconsistency across the quadrant pairs can be expected partly because of the small sample size of pairings and because antecedent conditions and soil effective properties can vary significantly across the four quadrants thus increasing the variability in the observed results however rank correlation between the average precipitation intensity and reduction in drainage volume for both ne pairs and the precipitation time spread and reduction in drainage volume for the nw sw pair were statistically significant with a higher precipitation time spread resulting in a smaller reduction in drainage volume and higher precipitation intensity resulting in a greater reduction in drainage volume for all except one of the pairs this is in line with the finding that a higher precipitation time spread results in greater drainage volumes for both free draining and controlled system this might indicate that greater drainage volumes result in less drainage reduction the hypothesis was examined by applying kendall s tau rank correlation test between reduction pairs and drainage volumes of both controlled and free draining quadrants the test was statistically insignificant for both controlled and free draining quadrants 4 3 peak flow and reduction in peak flow peak flow from the controlled quadrants was lower than the freely draining quadrants in all events except one event p 0 01 rank sum test the nw quadrant has a quasi constant peak flow throughout all the events while the se quadrant s peak flow has more fluctuations this constant peak flow may be the result of a flow restriction in the downstream subsurface main drain the nw quadrant had a lower total hydraulic head at its outlet than the ne se sw quadrants so was most affected by the restriction in the 11 events in which drainage data for all four quadrants are available the reduction in peak flow was 29 16 and it ranges between 7 and 46 if the event peak flow reduction from the nw and sw pair of the remaining 11 events in which the ne and se data are missing is averaged with the 11 events in which data from all quadrants are available then the mean decrease in peak flow is 37 4 3 1 effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions on peak flows the general difference in peak flow between free draining and controlled quadrants is 0 1 to 0 2 mm h during precipitation events that have totals between 10 and 20 mm of rainfall and 0 2 to 0 35 mm hr during precipitation events that have totals that are greater than 20 mm fig 7 a peak drain flow of free draining quadrants increases with increasing precipitation depth and average precipitation intensity fig 7a b kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient for these relationships is statistically significant contrarily the peak flow of controlled quadrants is not influenced by these precipitation characteristics such a result might be attributed to the attenuation of peak flows that is due to management the peak flow in free draining quadrants correlates with average precipitation intensity p 0 01 τ 0 42 reflecting that higher than average precipitation intensities can maximize the infiltration rate up to the infiltration capacity of the soil thus maximizing peak flow rate in their correlation analysis of eight spring storms vidon and cuadra 2010 found a significant correlation between the peak flow and total precipitation depth but no correlation with the average precipitation intensity it might be the case that their sample size of eight storms does not have similar characteristics to precipitation events that are examined here moreover their paper did not specify how the average precipitation intensity was calculated no quadrants appear to be affected by the precipitation time spread as indicated by the lowess line fig 7c the precipitation time spread hours of precipitation event duration and antecedent water table height fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was no correlation with peak flow rate at a 0 05 significance level in both the free draining and controlled quadrants in contrast there is a correlation between peak flow in the controlled quadrants and the antecedent soil moisture p 0 01 τ 0 40 it might be that the column soil moisture is more representative of antecedent conditions than the water table height above the drain as it accounts for all the water that is in the column in both the saturated and unsaturated zones in the soil these results suggest that in controlled quadrants precipitation characteristics do not influence the peak flow as much as antecedent conditions the moister the soil column is the less infiltration water is required to fill up the pore space and make the water table rise above the board height accordingly more water is available to contribute to the increase of the pressure head at the board level thus leading to an increase in the peak flow numerical modeling and more experimental data can help in further validating this explanation if controlled drainage is to be used to reduce peak flows then boards can be raised and then lowered before precipitation events to drain the retained water and thus increase the storage capacity of the system during anticipated precipitation events such pre draining could be important in further reducing peak flows from the system by providing temporary storm water storage much as detention ponds are used in urban environments to buffer the impact of new developments 4 4 time to peak and increase in the time to peak controlled drainage generally increased the time to peak drain flow during most of the events figs 8 and 9 p 0 01 rank sum test in the 10 events in which drainage data for all quadrants is available the average event increase in the time to peak between the average time to peak of the free draining quadrant and the average time to peak of the controlled quadrants is 98 52 if the event increase in time to peak between the nw and sw from the remaining 9 events in which the nw and se quadrant data is missing is averaged with the 10 events in which data from all quadrants is available then the increase in the time to peak averages 168 this increase of 70 in the average time to peak comes as a result of the sw quadrant having a generally lower time to peak than its ne counterpart fig 9 illustrates how controlled drainage flattens out the drainage hydrograph such that the peak flow is pushed back total precipitation depth did not appear to influence the time to peak of drain flow fig 8a kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient was not statistically significant for either the controlled or free draining quadrants on average throughout all events and precipitation depths there is a 10 h difference between the time to peak of controlled and free draining quadrants the scatter plot of the time to peak and the average precipitation intensity along with the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing indicate that the time to peak decreases with the increase of average precipitation intensity fig 8b there is also a positive correlation between the precipitation time spread and time to peak τ 0 28 fig 8c in free draining quadrants there is a statistically significant negative correlation between the average precipitation intensity and the time to peak τ 0 34 and a statistically significant positive correlation between both the precipitation time spread τ 0 28 and the hours of precipitation τ 0 38 and time to peak in contrast to what has been observed with peak flows time to peak decreases with higher average precipitation intensities that can maximize infiltration rate thus leading to a decrease in the response time of the resulting drainage hydrograph moreover the more precipitation is spread over the course of the drainage event the longer it takes for the drain hydrograph to reach its peak all correlation results in the controlled quadrants are statistically insignificant a reason for this might be that the complex interaction between different board heights the variability in antecedent conditions and the effect of various precipitation characteristics that can mask the behavior of the time to peak in controlled quadrants fig 9 time to peak was not correlated with antecedent soil moisture for any of the quadrants an important consideration is that all events that were examined in this study occurred between october and june a period in which variability in the column soil moisture is low accordingly no comparison can be made to studies that have highlighted the seasonal effect mainly summer versus winter of antecedent conditions on the lag time of the system 4 5 overland flow and surface ponding although overland flow was not directly measured drainage and precipitation intensity metrics were used to infer about generation mechanisms in controlled and free drainage quadrants the analysis suggests that both infiltration excess and saturation excess flow occurred as described below 4 5 1 infiltration excess overland flow the finding in section 4 2 1 that the average precipitation intensity was not correlated with drainage volume might reflect that the higher average precipitation intensities exceeded the soil infiltration capacity thus promoting an increase in infiltration excess overland flow generation robinson et al 1999 nearing et al 2005 dunkerley 2012 wei et al 2014 the drainage to precipitation ratio decreases with increasing average precipitation intensity fig 10 a and increases with increasing precipitation time spread fig 10b indicating that high average precipitation intensities result in less drainage and more overland flow kendall s tau test for rank correlation indicates that there is a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between the average precipitation intensity and the drainage to precipitation ratio in free draining τ 0 46 and controlled quadrants τ 0 53 events 2 and 21 illustrate how a higher average precipitation intensity resulted in a lower drainage volume and thus a likely increase in overland flow they had comparable precipitation depth 18 5 mm h and 19 mm but event 2 had a lower average precipitation intensity 1 35 mm hr than event 21 3 7 mm hr event 2 resulted in a drainage volume of 10 9 mm and 10 8 mm respectively in the nw and sw quadrants while event 21 had a drainage volume of 5 5 mm and 7 4 mm in the nw and sw quadrants despite similar antecedent moisture contents bou lahdou 2014 4 5 2 saturation excess overland flow in the 22 events that were examined the maximum height of the water table as recorded by the water level sensors inside observation wells in controlled quadrants generally rose above ground surface while the maximum height of the water table in free quadrants stayed mostly below the ground surface the maximum height of the water table does not influence the peak drain flow in the controlled quadrants while the opposite is observed in free quadrants with the exception of the nw quadrant it appears that the higher the maximum water table is in free quadrants the higher the peak flow becomes after the maximum water table height in free quadrants reaches the level of the ground surface the peak flow keeps increasing without any increase in the maximum water table height during the 22 events the controlled quadrants had a total of 745 h of surface ponding water table above the ground surface versus a total of 8 h for the free draining quadrants such an observation though not a direct measurement of ground surface ponding indicates that controlled subsurface drainage leads to an increase in ponded water a further examination of the hours of ponding and the average precipitation intensity reveals that the events that had surface ponding occur mostly when the average precipitation intensity is low these events correspond to events that have in general a high drainage to precipitation ratio fig 10a and a high precipitation time spread fig 10b that correlates with greater drainage volumes which leads to the conclusion that this ponding is a result of saturation excess in this discussion the effect of precipitation characteristics on the maximum water table height and the mechanisms of overland flow and ponding were analyzed the water table reached the ground surface across all ranges of precipitation characteristics higher precipitation intensities decreased the drainage to precipitation ratio which suggests overland flow on both controlled and free draining quadrants if such infiltration excess overland flow occurred it could affect the entire area filling depressions and generating runoff leaving the field saturation excess ponding and possibly overland flow occurred mostly in controlled quadrants and in events that have low average precipitation intensities and high precipitation time spreads in such events the two controlled quadrants had more hours of water table being above the ground surface than the free draining quadrants since observation wells are used as indicators of ponding it may also be the case that events that have low average precipitation intensities are generating infiltration excess runoff from high points in the field that flows into lower points where the observation well is locating thus contributing to the observed ponding accordingly the mechanisms of infiltration excess overland flow and saturation excess overland flow exist but cannot be exactly distinguished this generally agrees with field observations of gaynor et al 2002 and drury et al 2009 who noted that controlled drainage increases overland flow such a behavior of the system has implications on water quality that need to be accounted for as overland flow generally has a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus concentration than drain water 5 conclusion the goal of this study was to gain better understanding of the hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from controlled and free draining subsurface drainage systems from a monitoring site located at the davis purdue agricultural center in east central indiana hydrological metrics were extracted and analyzed from 22 wet season drainage outflow events in two free draining and two controlled drainage subsurface systems before discussing conclusions it is important to highlight the limitations of this study the drainage events examined in this study occurred during the wet time of the year with the exception of a few events in may and june in which most of drainage events occurred although some events during the growing season were missed the focus on wet season events gives a better understanding of the hydrology of controlled and free draining subsurface drainage systems that is important to understanding water quality implications doing an event analysis does not capture the entire flow record and some percentage of the flow is not included this percentage of flow that is not captured is greater in free drainage than in controlled drainage this field was not designed to be hydrologically isolated and there might be run on or runoff that was not measured the study resulted in the following conclusions 1 throughout the events drainage volume and peak flows in controlled subsurface drainage systems were respectively 22 12 and 29 16 lower than in free draining subsurface drainage systems and time to peak in controlled subsurface drainage systems was 98 52 higher than in free draining subsurface drainage systems 2 precipitation characteristics played a major role in determining the drainage volume in controlled and free draining quadrants higher total precipitation and precipitation time spread promote more infiltration throughout the course of the event and thus greater drainage volumes in controlled and free draining systems while the average precipitation intensity did not greatly affect drainage volumes 3 peak flow rates in free draining quadrants were positively correlated with higher precipitation and average precipitation intensity in controlled quadrants antecedent conditions appear to play a more important role in affecting peak flows than precipitation characteristics 4 the time to peak in the free draining quadrants decreases with higher average precipitation intensity and increases with higher precipitation time spread no significant correlations were found between the time to peak and hydrologic characteristics in the controlled quadrants this was attributed to the presence of control structures and their interplay with antecedent conditions that add further complexity to the system thus masking the behavior of single independent variables 5 both infiltration excess overland flow and saturation excess overland flow likely occurred in both the controlled and free draining quadrants as the average precipitation intensity increases the runoff potential increases on both controlled and free draining quadrants saturation excess ponding and possibly overland flow occurs as a result in events that have a low average precipitation intensity and a high precipitation time spread field observations indicate that saturation excess overland flow is more pronounced in controlled quadrants that have their water tables rise higher than the water table of the free draining quadrants this was pronounced in the two controlled quadrants which had a total of 745 h of water table being above the ground surface versus a total of 7 h for the free draining quadrants however it was not possible to quantify the increase in overland flow future research should examine the potential increase in overland flow due to controlled drainage through field measurements or detailed modeling acknowledgement this research was

11205,one of the strategies proposed for reducing nitrate losses from subsurface tile drain systems in midwestern agricultural lands controlled drainage is known to reduce drain flow on an annual basis but is not well understood for individual events understanding hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from free and controlled drainage systems during drainage events can offer improved insight on the overall functioning of these systems so that they can be better managed or retrofitted to increase their environmental benefits this study used data from a monitoring site in east central indiana to investigate the hydrology of 22 drainage events in free and controlled subsurface drainage systems relationships between event drainage volume drain flow hydrograph metrics column soil moisture water table depth and precipitation time series for each event were explored to determine the effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions on these metrics controlled drainage reduced event drainage volume and peak flows by 22 12 and 29 16 respectively and increased the time to peak of drainage by 98 52 higher total precipitation and precipitation time spread increased infiltration while the average precipitation intensity did not correlate with drainage volumes in either system peak flow rate in free draining quadrants were positively affected by higher precipitation and average precipitation intensity while in managed quadrants the antecedent soil moisture appeared to be more influential in affecting peak flow rate than precipitation characteristics surface runoff potential increased with the increase in average precipitation intensity in all quadrants saturation excess ponding or possibly overland flow occurred in events that have a low average precipitation intensity and a high precipitation time spread field observations indicate that saturation excess overland flow was more pronounced in controlled quadrants because water table levels rose higher than the water table levels of their free draining counterpart keywords controlled subsurface drainage tile drainage drainage event hydrologic controls event based analysis 1 introduction controlled drainage cd also known as drainage water management is one management practice that aims to reduce flow from subsurface drains by installing in line water control structures at field outlets the structure acts as a dam that keeps water table levels above drain levels in order to conserve the nitrate laden drainage water at its point of generation frankenberger et al 2004 skaggs and schilfgaarde 1999 controlled drainage is based on the premise that not all water held inside the soil needs to be drained at all times of the year an increase in anaerobic conditions in the soil as well as longer flowpaths through deeper soil layers may promote favorable conditions for denitrification meek et al 1969 willardson et al 1970 field studies at 20 different locations around the united states canada and northern europe reported that cd reduces average annual drainage volumes from 17 to over 89 and does not greatly affect drainage nitrate concentrations skaggs et al 2012 however this reduction varied across sites and even in the midwest corn belt mean drainage reductions between 19 and 89 have been reported from field studies varying in length from two to ten years e g saadat et al 2018a adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 fausey et al 2004 helmers et al 2012 tan et al 1998 such across site variability in drainage flow reduction is attributed to differences in soil properties drainage system intensity drainage operational strategy topography and climate skaggs et al 2010 simulation studies of the potential impact of cd have reported that in addition to conserving drainage water the practice also increases seepage and surface runoff skaggs et al 2010 ale et al 2009 singh et al 2007 singh et al 2007 concluded that there is a tradeoff between subsurface drainage water and surface runoff as a means of getting the water out of the field through drainmod simulations for a 50 year period skaggs et al 2010 showed that cd conserves water reduces drainage and increases surface runoff moreover cd reduces drainage volumes by increasing surface runoff lateral seepage vertical seepage and evapotranspiration field studies that have measured total outflows from cd experiments noted that cd resulted in a reduction of drainage flow that is accompanied by an almost equal increase of surface runoff that generally has a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus concentration than drain water gaynor et al 2002 valero et al 2007 drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 accordingly by potentially increasing surface runoff cd could have a positive effect on nitrogen and a negative effect on phosphorus load leaving the field these previous studies that examine drain flows on a daily adeuya et al 2012 saadat et al 2018a monthly helmers et al 2012 lalonde et al 1996 and annual basis saadat et al 2018b helmers et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 drury et al 2009 provide important information on volume differences between free and controlled drainage systems the adoption of a drainage event based analysis approach however provides a physical basis for the comparison of drain volumes on an intra inter site level with respect to hydroclimatological characteristics particularly when the record is incomplete an event based approach can be used to systematically examine conventional and controlled drainage systems across different sites which can make it useful for synthesis studies accordingly a better understanding of the hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from controlled and conventionally managed tile systems during drainage events can offer improved insight on the overall functioning and effectiveness of the treatments so that they can be better managed or retrofitted to increase environmental benefits by conserving more water and better promoting denitrification a number of studies have systematically examined storm event hydrology in conventionally drained systems reid and parkinson 1984 studied drainage event hydrographs with respect to precipitation topographic controls and seasonal variations in the antecedent conditions in north london united kingdom seasonal differences in event drainage response were attributed to differences in antecedent soil moisture the time lag between rainfall and the peak drain flow during the non winter events that had drier antecedent moisture conditions was generally longer than the lag for winter events the authors attributed this to a faster transmission of water through deep cracks amatya et al 2000 used a paired watershed approach to study storm event hydrology of free and controlled subsurface drainage in loblolly pine experimental watersheds in north carolina and found that controlled drainage significantly reduced total drainage volume and peak flow rates for all events vidon and cuadra 2010 examined the hydrological controls that regulate matrix flow and macropore flow for eight drainage events that occurred during spring for two free draining subsurface drain systems in central indiana they found that antecedent soil moisture had a minor role in affecting tile flow response within one season while total precipitation was a more important predictor of mean and peak flow rate in their thorough treatment of the effect of subsurface drainage on streamflow peaks robinson et al 1999 reviewed a number of field drainage and simulations studies they concluded that in areas with high water table because of high rainfall and or poor permeability drainage increases the soil water storage capacity and reduces surface runoff and peak storm flows contrarily in areas that have deep water tables because of dry climates and permeable soils artificial drainage increases peak flows because of greater hydraulic gradients and short flow paths robinson et al 1999 however controlled drainage has not been studied in midwestern agricultural systems on an event basis although much is known about factors that influence the event hydrology of artificially drained landscapes that are free draining there is a need to investigate the hydrological controls in controlled subsurface drainage systems in order to gain greater understanding of observed variability in the effectiveness of this conservation practice the overarching goal of this study is to better characterize the hydrological behavior of free draining and controlled subsurface drainage systems by systematically studying the hydrologic responses of tile drainage systems during storm events this is achieved by exploring the effect of precipitation characteristics and site antecedent conditions on event outflow volume and the timing and magnitude of peak drainflow the mechanisms which generate overland flow or ponding on the field are also examined 2 site description and experimental setup the controlled drainage research site is located at 40 266 n 85 160 w in eastern indiana at the davis purdue agricultural center dpac the 14 3 ha field is divided into four quadrants two that are free draining southwest sw and northeast ne and two that are controlled northwest nw and southeast se fig 1 brooks 2013 utt 2010 adeuya 2009 there is an elevation change of approximately 3 m across the field the dominant soil parent material in the area is clayey wisconsin glacial till franzmeier et al 2004 the soil series map shown in fig 1 comes from a first order soil survey that was done by g steinhardt at the purdue agronomy department the first order soil survey provides a higher resolution delineation of the soils than the soil survey geographic database ssurgo digital soils map but the official soil series descriptions were found to provide an appropriate description of the soils in the area the predominant soil series in each quadrant are shown in table 1 along with their drainage class and depth to restrictive layer soil survey staff 2014 soil was sampled at three locations near the water table well and at four depths in each quadrant the soil at the sampling sites in the southern quadrants is clay throughout the profile while in the northern quadrants the soil in the first 20 cm is clay loam and at greater depths it becomes clay since clay generally has a lower hydraulic conductivity than clay loam such variability in the soil layers across the four quadrants may have implications for the overall hydraulic behavior as reflected in the observation wells the subsurface drainage system connects a submain in each of the quadrants to the outlet that empties into a subsurface county main in the northwest corner of the field laterals 10 cm diameter flowing into each submain are at a nominal 14 m spacing and depth of 1 m the sw and ne quadrants drain freely while the nw and se quadrants are under controlled drainage inline water level control structures agridrain corp adair iowa were placed at the outlet of the nw and se quadrants and due to its topography the se quadrant has two control structures during 2012 and 2013 the height of drop logs was controlled to have a high water table during winter 0 1 m below the surface to offer water quality benefits and a lower water table during summer 0 4 m below the surface to reduce the likelihood of water logging in the soil that would cause damage to crops drop logs are usually pulled from the control structure before field operations to enhance the trafficability and workability of the soil so that it can support agricultural machinery electromagnetic flow meters krohne waterflux 3070 were installed at the outlet of each quadrant brooks 2013 these flow meters can accurately measure bidirectional flow at very low flow levels as well as high flow levels these electromagnetic flow meters offer an advantage over other measurement methods as they can capture the timing and volume of backward flow that occurs at this site during large flow events due to restricted flow through the outlet four long term water table monitoring wells are positioned at the mid point between two lateral drains and near the soil sampling locations they were instrumented with global water wl16 water level loggers soil moisture sensor nests were installed in the field near each of the monitoring wells brooks 2013 each nest consists of one 5te and four 5tm decagon capacitance based soil moisture sensors placed at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm each of the sensors measures the soil volumetric water content vwc and the soil temperature the sensor nests are located in actively farmed areas so the 10 and 20 cm sensors must be removed during tillage operations and replaced following planting resulting in gaps in data in this dataset a tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronic te525 l measures rainfall in 0 01 inch increments at the monitoring site 3 methodology total soil moisture in the soil profile was calculated using the trapezoidal rule hupet et al 2004 hupet and vanclooster 2004 soil moisture measurement time gaps due to malfunctioning soil moisture sensors were filled using data from the adjacent sensor with maximum correlation to the failed sensor see bou lahdou 2014 for details water table data was processed as height of water table above the corresponding tile drain depth the water table height above the drain was adjusted to be zero when the outlet was lowered and drain flow dropped to zero the adjustment procedure was required because the sensor height changed during the course of this study saadat et al 2017 continuous hourly and daily precipitation records for the site were generated by filling missing data from the on site gauge using data from the national climatic data center ncdc gauge and purdue automatic gauge network located at dpac bou lahdou 2014 a drainage event was identified if it produced a peak drain flow greater than 5 m3 h and drain flow data was available for the event for at least two quadrants the start of the event was defined as one hour before precipitation started and the end of the event was defined as the time at which drain flow in the nw quadrant was less than 70 liters hour for 10 consecutive hours basing the end of the event on the drain flow from one quadrant was necessary to make data extraction for the same event from all quadrants consistent the nw quadrant was chosen because the western quadrants have the most complete drainage data set and the nw quadrant has shorter flow duration than the sw quadrant thus allowing for a shorter event definition fig 2 shows net drain flow water table depth and soil moisture for a sample drainage event total event precipitation was 12 7 mm the event start and end times are indicated by the vertical dashed lines water table is given as height above the drain level a total of 22 events were identified in 2012 and 2013 out of the 22 events 11 events have complete drainage data across the four quadrants the nw sw and ne quadrants have water table data missing for three two and two events respectively although events represent only a portion of annual flow the 15 events for which complete data are available from this study in 2012 out of 19 drainage events represented 67 and 90 of the measured annual drain flow that occurred from a free and controlled field respectively sixteen hydrological metrics were extracted from each event as summarized in table 2 events 18 and 19 occurred in march 2013 in a period in which rainfall followed a few days of snow accumulation the event start was defined by the start of the rain event therefore the earlier snow precipitation was not originally captured in the event precipitation total the daily contribution of snow melt to the drainage event was estimated from the daily change in snow depth as recorded by the ncdc coop station as it was melting and generating a drainage response at field w the snow density was estimated by assuming that the prior precipitation as measured from the coop station came completely as snowfall the sum of melt water and rainfall that occurred during each event was used as an input for the total precipitation a metric called precipitation time spread was developed to quantify how precipitation is distributed over the course of a drainage event this is a measure of the standard deviation of the center of mass of precipitation and represents how concentrated or dispersed the precipitation is that occurs during the course of the drainage event for each drainage event equations 1 and 2 were employed to calculate the precipitation weighted standard deviation of the precipitation time series as follows 1 t i 1 n t i p i i 1 n p i where t is the weighted mean or the center of mass of the precipitation event in hours ti is the time in hours of each precipitation pulse with respect to the start of the event pi is the precipitation that fell during interval t i and n is the duration hours of the drainage event the weighted standard deviation or precipitation time spread is calculated as 2 ó t i 1 n t i t 2 p i i 1 n p i in order to evaluate the impact of controlled drainage on event hydrology three change metrics were also calculated the drainage volume percentage change for each event is the difference between the average total drainage volume of free draining quadrants and the average total drainage volume of managed quadrants divided by the average total drainage volume of free draining quadrants similarly the peak flow change and change in time to peak were calculated based on the difference between the average of free draining quadrants and the average of managed quadrants kendall s tau a rank based non parametric hypothesis test for statistical dependence was used throughout the results and discussion section to generate measures of correlation this test does not assume a distribution and is generally resistant to the effect of outliers and efficient in detecting monotonic relationships helsel and hirsch 2002 drainage and antecedent conditions metrics were separated by management type controlled versus free draining for the analysis and a 5 significance level was used the wilcoxon signed rank non parametric hypothesis test was used throughout the results and discussion section to evaluate if median values of controlled and free drainage metrics are significantly different from each other at a 5 significance level 4 results and discussion 4 1 event precipitation characteristics the total precipitation depth average precipitation intensity and precipitation time spread for all the drainage events are summarized in fig 3 see bou lahdou 2014 for a list of all events two events occurred mainly as a result of snow melt thus both of these events have a total precipitation depth but no precipitation intensity and precipitation time spread were calculated event 3 had the lowest total precipitation depth 10 mm that resulted mostly from six hours of continuous low intensity precipitation 1 7 mm hr bou lahdou 2014 event 22 had the highest total precipitation that resulted mostly from a four hour precipitation event with an average intensity of 14 5 mm hr bou lahdou 2014 to put the two precipitation events in context they were compared to the depth duration curves of the area bonnin et al 2006 these two events have return periods of less than a year and 10 years respectively based on their intensity and duration the total precipitation depth fig 3a and average precipitation intensity fig 3b had a right skewed distribution with the majority of the events having a total precipitation depth between 10 and 30 mm and an average precipitation intensity that is between 0 5 and 3 mm hr six out of 22 events have a high precipitation time spread which indicates that more than one storm occurred during these events or precipitation pulses were spread out throughout the drainage event fig 3c events that had a precipitation depth between 10 and 20 mm generally had an average precipitation intensity that is less than 4 mm h events that had high average precipitation intensity greater than 3 mm hr tended to have a low duration while events that had lower precipitation intensity tend to have a high duration of precipitation 4 2 drainage volumes and reduction in drainage one overall effect of cd during drainage events is to reduce the outflow volume from controlled quadrants however the difference in the drainage volume between the controlled and free draining quadrants is not consistent as a multitude of factors can affect drainage volumes which are explored below 4 2 1 effect of precipitation characteristics on drainage volumes the relationship between total drainage volume and total precipitation depth average precipitation intensity and precipitation time spread is illustrated in fig 4 drainage volume does not show a clearly discernible relationship to precipitation depth fig 4a although the smoothed line based on locally weighted scatter plot smoothing lowess of the controlled and free draining quadrant data suggests a tendency towards increasing drainage volumes with increasing precipitation on average across all events the free draining quadrants have a higher drainage volume than managed drainage p 0 05 rank sum test the general difference is 1 3 2 mm during precipitation events that have totals between 10 and 20 mm of rainfall and 2 5 3 mm during precipitation events that have totals that are greater than 20 mm fig 4a the average precipitation intensity as a standalone variable does not have any observable impact on drainage volume fig 4b while the precipitation time spread is a more important hydrologic control that affects drainage volumes as shown in fig 4c this was expected as the more the precipitation is spread across the drainage event the more time is available for water to infiltrate and thus increase the drainage volume there also appears to be a positive correlation between the total drainage volume and the hours of precipitation not shown correlation analysis based on kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient reveals that out of the four examined precipitation characteristics the total precipitation depth hours of precipitation and the precipitation time spread are significantly correlated p 0 05 to the drainage volume in both controlled and uncontrolled quadrants with the latter having the highest kendall s tau 0 5 in controlled quadrants and 0 41 in uncontrolled quadrants on the contrary average precipitation intensity does not appear to have a direct effect on drainage volume p 0 05 this observation is further discussed below as precipitation intensity might have an important effect on overland flow generation 4 2 2 effect of antecedent conditions on drainage volumes overall drainage volume was not significantly affected by antecedent water table height fig 5 but the behavior differs even among the two replicates of each drainage treatment the ne quadrant is the driest among all four quadrants and it has an event drainage volume that is greater than all other quadrants this has also been observed by brooks 2013 this suggests that the ne quadrant is more efficient in draining water than its sw counterpart the ne quadrant antecedent water table height fluctuates around a height of 0 05 m above the drain and it does not seem to affect the drainage volume in the quadrant fig 5 kendall s tau τ rank correlations between antecedent conditions both antecedent water table height and antecedent soil moisture and drainage volumes are not statistically significant p 0 05 for controlled and free draining quadrants the previous examination of the initial height of the water table s effect on drainage volumes fig 5 suggests one probable reason behind this statistical insignificance the antecedent conditions in each quadrant appear to operate in loosely defined and different ranges thus using data from both controlled or both free quadrants in the test fails to highlight if there is any relationship in the data fig 5 see bou lahdou 2014 these results agree with the finding of vidon and cuadra 2010 who concluded that antecedent conditions cause some variability in the tile flow response but precipitation was the main driver and predictor of volume for drainage events that happen during the fallow season 4 2 3 effect of antecedent conditions on the reduction in drainage volumes reduction in drainage volume due to drainage water management from the 11 events in which drainage data for all quadrants is available was calculated drainage volume reduction due to controlled drainage ranged from 8 and 38 with an average and standard deviation of 22 12 if the event reduction from the nw and sw pair from the remaining 11 events in which the ne and se data are missing is included with the 11 events in which data from all quadrants are available then drainage volume reduction of the 22 events averages 25 a value that is close to the average reduction of the 11 events in which drainage data for all quadrants is available to further evaluate and understand event reduction in drainage volumes all quadrants were paired with both of their counterparts i e each freely drained was paired with both controlled quadrants and the drainage volume percentage reduction was calculated to examine the potential effect of antecedent conditions on drainage volume reduction scatter plots of the antecedent water table height of the controlled quadrants versus the percent reduction in drainage volume were plotted for all quadrant pairs fig 6 the plots highlight a weak relationship between the antecedent water table and percent drainage volume reduction for the nw sw se ne and nw ne pairs as expected a lower antecedent water table in controlled quadrants may result in greater reduction in drainage volumes an examination of the association between the percent reduction in drainage volume for each of the pairs and precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions yielded statistically insignificant results and variables that were statistically significant for one pair were not significant for the rest of the quadrant pairs such an inconsistency across the quadrant pairs can be expected partly because of the small sample size of pairings and because antecedent conditions and soil effective properties can vary significantly across the four quadrants thus increasing the variability in the observed results however rank correlation between the average precipitation intensity and reduction in drainage volume for both ne pairs and the precipitation time spread and reduction in drainage volume for the nw sw pair were statistically significant with a higher precipitation time spread resulting in a smaller reduction in drainage volume and higher precipitation intensity resulting in a greater reduction in drainage volume for all except one of the pairs this is in line with the finding that a higher precipitation time spread results in greater drainage volumes for both free draining and controlled system this might indicate that greater drainage volumes result in less drainage reduction the hypothesis was examined by applying kendall s tau rank correlation test between reduction pairs and drainage volumes of both controlled and free draining quadrants the test was statistically insignificant for both controlled and free draining quadrants 4 3 peak flow and reduction in peak flow peak flow from the controlled quadrants was lower than the freely draining quadrants in all events except one event p 0 01 rank sum test the nw quadrant has a quasi constant peak flow throughout all the events while the se quadrant s peak flow has more fluctuations this constant peak flow may be the result of a flow restriction in the downstream subsurface main drain the nw quadrant had a lower total hydraulic head at its outlet than the ne se sw quadrants so was most affected by the restriction in the 11 events in which drainage data for all four quadrants are available the reduction in peak flow was 29 16 and it ranges between 7 and 46 if the event peak flow reduction from the nw and sw pair of the remaining 11 events in which the ne and se data are missing is averaged with the 11 events in which data from all quadrants are available then the mean decrease in peak flow is 37 4 3 1 effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions on peak flows the general difference in peak flow between free draining and controlled quadrants is 0 1 to 0 2 mm h during precipitation events that have totals between 10 and 20 mm of rainfall and 0 2 to 0 35 mm hr during precipitation events that have totals that are greater than 20 mm fig 7 a peak drain flow of free draining quadrants increases with increasing precipitation depth and average precipitation intensity fig 7a b kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient for these relationships is statistically significant contrarily the peak flow of controlled quadrants is not influenced by these precipitation characteristics such a result might be attributed to the attenuation of peak flows that is due to management the peak flow in free draining quadrants correlates with average precipitation intensity p 0 01 τ 0 42 reflecting that higher than average precipitation intensities can maximize the infiltration rate up to the infiltration capacity of the soil thus maximizing peak flow rate in their correlation analysis of eight spring storms vidon and cuadra 2010 found a significant correlation between the peak flow and total precipitation depth but no correlation with the average precipitation intensity it might be the case that their sample size of eight storms does not have similar characteristics to precipitation events that are examined here moreover their paper did not specify how the average precipitation intensity was calculated no quadrants appear to be affected by the precipitation time spread as indicated by the lowess line fig 7c the precipitation time spread hours of precipitation event duration and antecedent water table height fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was no correlation with peak flow rate at a 0 05 significance level in both the free draining and controlled quadrants in contrast there is a correlation between peak flow in the controlled quadrants and the antecedent soil moisture p 0 01 τ 0 40 it might be that the column soil moisture is more representative of antecedent conditions than the water table height above the drain as it accounts for all the water that is in the column in both the saturated and unsaturated zones in the soil these results suggest that in controlled quadrants precipitation characteristics do not influence the peak flow as much as antecedent conditions the moister the soil column is the less infiltration water is required to fill up the pore space and make the water table rise above the board height accordingly more water is available to contribute to the increase of the pressure head at the board level thus leading to an increase in the peak flow numerical modeling and more experimental data can help in further validating this explanation if controlled drainage is to be used to reduce peak flows then boards can be raised and then lowered before precipitation events to drain the retained water and thus increase the storage capacity of the system during anticipated precipitation events such pre draining could be important in further reducing peak flows from the system by providing temporary storm water storage much as detention ponds are used in urban environments to buffer the impact of new developments 4 4 time to peak and increase in the time to peak controlled drainage generally increased the time to peak drain flow during most of the events figs 8 and 9 p 0 01 rank sum test in the 10 events in which drainage data for all quadrants is available the average event increase in the time to peak between the average time to peak of the free draining quadrant and the average time to peak of the controlled quadrants is 98 52 if the event increase in time to peak between the nw and sw from the remaining 9 events in which the nw and se quadrant data is missing is averaged with the 10 events in which data from all quadrants is available then the increase in the time to peak averages 168 this increase of 70 in the average time to peak comes as a result of the sw quadrant having a generally lower time to peak than its ne counterpart fig 9 illustrates how controlled drainage flattens out the drainage hydrograph such that the peak flow is pushed back total precipitation depth did not appear to influence the time to peak of drain flow fig 8a kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient was not statistically significant for either the controlled or free draining quadrants on average throughout all events and precipitation depths there is a 10 h difference between the time to peak of controlled and free draining quadrants the scatter plot of the time to peak and the average precipitation intensity along with the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing indicate that the time to peak decreases with the increase of average precipitation intensity fig 8b there is also a positive correlation between the precipitation time spread and time to peak τ 0 28 fig 8c in free draining quadrants there is a statistically significant negative correlation between the average precipitation intensity and the time to peak τ 0 34 and a statistically significant positive correlation between both the precipitation time spread τ 0 28 and the hours of precipitation τ 0 38 and time to peak in contrast to what has been observed with peak flows time to peak decreases with higher average precipitation intensities that can maximize infiltration rate thus leading to a decrease in the response time of the resulting drainage hydrograph moreover the more precipitation is spread over the course of the drainage event the longer it takes for the drain hydrograph to reach its peak all correlation results in the controlled quadrants are statistically insignificant a reason for this might be that the complex interaction between different board heights the variability in antecedent conditions and the effect of various precipitation characteristics that can mask the behavior of the time to peak in controlled quadrants fig 9 time to peak was not correlated with antecedent soil moisture for any of the quadrants an important consideration is that all events that were examined in this study occurred between october and june a period in which variability in the column soil moisture is low accordingly no comparison can be made to studies that have highlighted the seasonal effect mainly summer versus winter of antecedent conditions on the lag time of the system 4 5 overland flow and surface ponding although overland flow was not directly measured drainage and precipitation intensity metrics were used to infer about generation mechanisms in controlled and free drainage quadrants the analysis suggests that both infiltration excess and saturation excess flow occurred as described below 4 5 1 infiltration excess overland flow the finding in section 4 2 1 that the average precipitation intensity was not correlated with drainage volume might reflect that the higher average precipitation intensities exceeded the soil infiltration capacity thus promoting an increase in infiltration excess overland flow generation robinson et al 1999 nearing et al 2005 dunkerley 2012 wei et al 2014 the drainage to precipitation ratio decreases with increasing average precipitation intensity fig 10 a and increases with increasing precipitation time spread fig 10b indicating that high average precipitation intensities result in less drainage and more overland flow kendall s tau test for rank correlation indicates that there is a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between the average precipitation intensity and the drainage to precipitation ratio in free draining τ 0 46 and controlled quadrants τ 0 53 events 2 and 21 illustrate how a higher average precipitation intensity resulted in a lower drainage volume and thus a likely increase in overland flow they had comparable precipitation depth 18 5 mm h and 19 mm but event 2 had a lower average precipitation intensity 1 35 mm hr than event 21 3 7 mm hr event 2 resulted in a drainage volume of 10 9 mm and 10 8 mm respectively in the nw and sw quadrants while event 21 had a drainage volume of 5 5 mm and 7 4 mm in the nw and sw quadrants despite similar antecedent moisture contents bou lahdou 2014 4 5 2 saturation excess overland flow in the 22 events that were examined the maximum height of the water table as recorded by the water level sensors inside observation wells in controlled quadrants generally rose above ground surface while the maximum height of the water table in free quadrants stayed mostly below the ground surface the maximum height of the water table does not influence the peak drain flow in the controlled quadrants while the opposite is observed in free quadrants with the exception of the nw quadrant it appears that the higher the maximum water table is in free quadrants the higher the peak flow becomes after the maximum water table height in free quadrants reaches the level of the ground surface the peak flow keeps increasing without any increase in the maximum water table height during the 22 events the controlled quadrants had a total of 745 h of surface ponding water table above the ground surface versus a total of 8 h for the free draining quadrants such an observation though not a direct measurement of ground surface ponding indicates that controlled subsurface drainage leads to an increase in ponded water a further examination of the hours of ponding and the average precipitation intensity reveals that the events that had surface ponding occur mostly when the average precipitation intensity is low these events correspond to events that have in general a high drainage to precipitation ratio fig 10a and a high precipitation time spread fig 10b that correlates with greater drainage volumes which leads to the conclusion that this ponding is a result of saturation excess in this discussion the effect of precipitation characteristics on the maximum water table height and the mechanisms of overland flow and ponding were analyzed the water table reached the ground surface across all ranges of precipitation characteristics higher precipitation intensities decreased the drainage to precipitation ratio which suggests overland flow on both controlled and free draining quadrants if such infiltration excess overland flow occurred it could affect the entire area filling depressions and generating runoff leaving the field saturation excess ponding and possibly overland flow occurred mostly in controlled quadrants and in events that have low average precipitation intensities and high precipitation time spreads in such events the two controlled quadrants had more hours of water table being above the ground surface than the free draining quadrants since observation wells are used as indicators of ponding it may also be the case that events that have low average precipitation intensities are generating infiltration excess runoff from high points in the field that flows into lower points where the observation well is locating thus contributing to the observed ponding accordingly the mechanisms of infiltration excess overland flow and saturation excess overland flow exist but cannot be exactly distinguished this generally agrees with field observations of gaynor et al 2002 and drury et al 2009 who noted that controlled drainage increases overland flow such a behavior of the system has implications on water quality that need to be accounted for as overland flow generally has a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus concentration than drain water 5 conclusion the goal of this study was to gain better understanding of the hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from controlled and free draining subsurface drainage systems from a monitoring site located at the davis purdue agricultural center in east central indiana hydrological metrics were extracted and analyzed from 22 wet season drainage outflow events in two free draining and two controlled drainage subsurface systems before discussing conclusions it is important to highlight the limitations of this study the drainage events examined in this study occurred during the wet time of the year with the exception of a few events in may and june in which most of drainage events occurred although some events during the growing season were missed the focus on wet season events gives a better understanding of the hydrology of controlled and free draining subsurface drainage systems that is important to understanding water quality implications doing an event analysis does not capture the entire flow record and some percentage of the flow is not included this percentage of flow that is not captured is greater in free drainage than in controlled drainage this field was not designed to be hydrologically isolated and there might be run on or runoff that was not measured the study resulted in the following conclusions 1 throughout the events drainage volume and peak flows in controlled subsurface drainage systems were respectively 22 12 and 29 16 lower than in free draining subsurface drainage systems and time to peak in controlled subsurface drainage systems was 98 52 higher than in free draining subsurface drainage systems 2 precipitation characteristics played a major role in determining the drainage volume in controlled and free draining quadrants higher total precipitation and precipitation time spread promote more infiltration throughout the course of the event and thus greater drainage volumes in controlled and free draining systems while the average precipitation intensity did not greatly affect drainage volumes 3 peak flow rates in free draining quadrants were positively correlated with higher precipitation and average precipitation intensity in controlled quadrants antecedent conditions appear to play a more important role in affecting peak flows than precipitation characteristics 4 the time to peak in the free draining quadrants decreases with higher average precipitation intensity and increases with higher precipitation time spread no significant correlations were found between the time to peak and hydrologic characteristics in the controlled quadrants this was attributed to the presence of control structures and their interplay with antecedent conditions that add further complexity to the system thus masking the behavior of single independent variables 5 both infiltration excess overland flow and saturation excess overland flow likely occurred in both the controlled and free draining quadrants as the average precipitation intensity increases the runoff potential increases on both controlled and free draining quadrants saturation excess ponding and possibly overland flow occurs as a result in events that have a low average precipitation intensity and a high precipitation time spread field observations indicate that saturation excess overland flow is more pronounced in controlled quadrants that have their water tables rise higher than the water table of the free draining quadrants this was pronounced in the two controlled quadrants which had a total of 745 h of water table being above the ground surface versus a total of 7 h for the free draining quadrants however it was not possible to quantify the increase in overland flow future research should examine the potential increase in overland flow due to controlled drainage through field measurements or detailed modeling acknowledgement this research was

11206,losses of nitrogen fertilizer from agricultural watersheds are among the main causes of water quality degradation in quebec under maize crop leached nitrate can reach up to 185 kg n ha 1 the synchronization of the nitrogen fertilization with crop uptake would be a way to optimize the use of nitrogen fertilizer and reduce nitrate leaching coupling an empirical nitrogen cycle model with a physical soil water dynamics model could simplify the optimization of nitrogen fertilizer use the objective of this study was to couple the soil surface empirical nitrate production model adapted to the regional agro climatic conditions of study area with hydrus to determine the most suitable combination in order to predict nitrate leaching into subsurface drains in this study we used estimation equations of nitrogen pools and transformations in nitrate the equations using historical field data were combined into 60 n release patterns taking into account a dissolution function of nitrate 4 transformation and dissolution functions for the ammonium 5 organic nitrogen pools and 3 n organic nitrogen from the soil and manure release functions these n release patterns were applied in a mineral fertilizer treatment and four organic fertilizer treatments for a total of 300 unique nitrate release patterns the results demonstrate the potential of a method to evaluate the contributions of nitrogen based on atmospheric data crop rotation or soil particle sizes as 5 of the 300 combination gave a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse above 0 70 the prediction method must be different according to the source of the fertilization organic or mineral as only 1 of the combination gave nse above 0 70 in more than one treatment in addition the study showed that the soil organic nitrogen contribution to nitrate leaching tends to decrease as the organic fertilizer applications rate increases as 75 of the combination giving nse above 0 70 in high fertilization treatment used the lower organic n pool and only 17 used the lower organic n pool for the agronomic fertilization rate and mineral fertilizer the simulations also showed that the nitrate leached masses are closely related to the fertilizer supply nitrogen content keywords nitrogen management modeling organic fertilizer mineral fertilizer water pollution 1 introduction nitrogen used for agricultural fertilization is the main cause of anthropogenic perturbations of the n cycle fowler et al 2013 an excessive input of nitrogen in waterways may result in accelerated eutrophication of lakes and rivers dupas et al 2015 erisman et al 2013 along with pesticides nitrate represents the main source of aquifer contamination in agricultural areas dupuy et al 2012 nitrate leachate can reach 185 kg ha 1 in groundwater under maize crop gollamudi 2006 despite these environmental risks nitrogen fertilization remains the basis of modern agriculture it is the limiting nutrient for crop growth to the extent that nearly half of the human population depends on it for food supply craaq 2010 erisman et al 2013 n dayegamiye et al 2007 in 2009 in canada 75 of the mass of fertilizers used in agriculture was nitrogen agriculture and agri food canada 2014 nitrate leaching and the resulting surface and groundwater contamination are a concern especially in maize cultivated areas because this crop requires high nitrogen fertilizer applications over extensive areas one way to reduce nitrate leaching is to synchronize nitrogen fertilization with crop uptake synchronizing nitrogen availability with nitrate uptake can be performed indirectly by modeling nitrate leaching under the root zone or in drain tiles various process oriented and physically based solute transport models have been used to this end leaching estimation and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1991 soiln bergström et al 1991 soil water and assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and drainmod n youssef et al 2005 these models are usually based on three nitrogen pools nitrate ammonium and organic nitrogen or subdivisions of these three pools the rate of transfer between the different pools depends on several soil factors such as temperature water content and ph youssef et al 2005 most process oriented and physically based solute transport models use the advection dispersion equation to describe nitrogen transport in the soil profile these models often require detailed parameters describing nitrogen transport dispersion and diffusion transformation fertilizer dissolution nitrification denitrification and volatilization and organic matter processes and status potential rate of decomposition c n ratio of the litter and soil organic nitrogen pools contents the extent and the specificity of the required information limit the use of deterministic solute transport models for practical agronomic applications the physically based model hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 has been used to simulate water ammonium and nitrate transport in various soils hydrological and cultural conditions baram et al 2016 hanson et al 2006 li et al 2015 sansoulet 2007 veizaga et al 2016 in order to simulate nitrate leaching while accounting for all key processes hydrus requires first order rate degradation constants and the use of multiple solutes to integrate the various forms of nitrogen and their reaction chains to gather this information an undisturbed soil column experiment is almost necessary furthermore quantifying the soil organic nitrogen pool and associated role in nitrate leaching availability involves biological microbiological and chemistry knowledge since it is dependent of the soil type temperature water content and ph in order to answer to the data preparation difficulties hydrus can be coupled with a empirical nitrate production model based on easily measurable agronomic information data based models like swat use empirical relationships to define the rate of movement between the different nitrogen pools and to evaluate nitrate leaching these relationships do not describe natural processes therefore data based models can be applied only within the range of values that was used to derive them louks et al 2005 since these models have a small computational time they allow for longer and more important number of simulations equations and empirical relationships have been developed to predict the soil organic nitrogen content based on a number of parameters growing degree days clay content soil temperature soil water content crop rotation and potential evapotranspiration dessureault rompré et al 2015 dessureault rompré et al 2010a giroux and lemieux 2002 other relationships describe the seasonal mineralization of soil organic nitrogen into nitrate based on air temperature soil water content or the stage of the growing season dessureault rompré et al 2010b sbih et al 2003 some researchers derived soil specific dissolution and nitrification rates for ammonia fertilizers based on a log normal distribution gasser et al 2003 or a first order degradation equation hanson et al 2006 these equations are simple and may be applied in northern soils however none of these equations have been coupled with hydrus a coupling of these empirical equations would allow a prediction of nitrate availability to leaching with an estimate of the organic nitrogen pool and the transfer rate of organic nitrogen and ammonium into nitrate hydrus allows a daily solute input such that a simple model based on easily measurable data can be used to predict nitrate availability and organic matter contribution to nitrogen leaching using a simple nitrogen leaching prediction model at the farm scale could help to optimize nitrogen fertilization and to minimize negative environmental effects the objective of this study was to test the effect of a combination of models for the soil surface empirical nitrate production with hydrus in order to evaluate nitrate leaching into subsurface drains 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted on long term manure fertilizer test plots initiated in 1978 at the irda institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement experimental station of st lambert near québec city in the province of québec n 46 05 w 71 02 starting in 2006 a crop rotation of maize zea mays l canola brassica napus l and spring wheat triticum aestivum l was implemented data from the 2009 growing season were used in this study the annual mean temperature and the total precipitation for the year 2009 were measured on site with a meteorological station campbell scientific logan ut and were respectively 4 5 c and 1020 mm the precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge te525 l texas electronic dallas tx the snow accumulation was neglected because simulations were made only for the growing season the experimental site is divided in 20 plots the 20 plots were 90 m2 each 15 m long by 6 m wide and set up in a randomized complete block design with four replicates of four organic fertilizer treatments liquid swine manure and one mineral fertilizer treatment as the control fig 1 swine manure was applied at increasing rates 30 mg ha 1 60 mg ha 1 90 mg ha 1 and 120 mg ha 1 before seeding in spring usually for field crops especially in maize split nitrogen fertilizer applications are used at this experimental site in order to simplify the operation only one fertilizer application was used before seedling in spring of 2009 liquid swine manure lsm came from an outdoor storage pit from a maternity confinement during each field application swine manure samples were collected in triplicates at the outlet of the pit samples were analyzed using standard procedures total n in manure was determined after acid digestion of fresh material isaac and johnson 1976 nh4 n in dry matter rich fractions dmfs was extracted in kcl total n in the acid digests and nh4 n in the kcl extracts were measured as nh4 with an automated continuous flow injection analyzer model quickchem 8000 fia lachat instruments loveland co the mineral fertilizer was calcium ammonium nitrate 27 0 0 applied at 150 kg n ha 1 according to local crop recommendations craaq 2010 in 1998 each plot was equipped in its center with an independent subsurface perforated 10 cm diameter drain 85 cm deep drainage from each plot was directed to an isolated shelter where outflow was measured with a one liter tipping bucket and a campbell scientific datalogger drainage water was stored in closed plastic barrels at a temperature between 5 c and 10 c the drainage water was accumulated in 60 l reservoirs sampled stored in a cold chamber at 4 c and analyzed for the total contents of nitrite and nitrate where the lixiviate was passed through a 0 45 micron filter and reduced to nitrite by the cadmium method margeson et al 1980 the nitrite content was determined by colorimetry fia quickchem 8000 lachat instruments usa with sulfanilamide and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride bendschneider and robinson 1952 therefore we used the term nitrate to designate nitrate and nitrite in the drainage water 2 2 soil description according to the canadian classification system the soil is a poorly drained le bras series clay loam 275 g clay kg 1 425 g silt kg 1 classified as

saturated hydraulic conductivity by the constant head soil core method reynolds and elrick 2002 soil physical and textural characteristics were measured on duplicate samples at five depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 85 cm in each of the 20 plots the ranges of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat sand silt and clay percentages and bulk density with depth are shown in table 1 sand silt and clay contents are similar through the profile although there is a noticeable decreasing trend for ksat and increasing trend for bulk density with depth based on these results the soil profile was divided into two homogeneous regions and physical properties were averaged for these two layers 0 20 cm and 20 85 cm which correspond respectively to the plow layer and the natural layer 3 nitrate production model fig 2 shows the nitrate production model conceptual diagram for one treatment the nitrate production model combines the organic nitrogen pool supply and the net transformation of organic nitrogen and ammonium into nitrate three nitrate pools have been considered as shown in fig 2a 1 nitrate from fertilizers 2 ammonium from fertilizers and 3 organic n from liquid swine manure lsm org n and organic n from soil soil org n the fertilizer nitrogen supplied for each treatment are shown in table 2 soil mineralization is subdivided into five soil organic nitrogen contribution combinations 1 craaq 2010 organic soil nitrogen zero soil n 2 nitrate mass balance based pool 3 giroux rotation based pool giroux and lemieux 2002 4 stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variable dessureault rompré et al 2015 and 5 stable nitrogen pool plus easily mineralizable organic nitrogen pool pool i dessureault rompré et al 2010a the eight n release functions are represented in fig 2b as rectangles and are used to transform ammonium or organic nitrogen into nitrate which is released daily at the surface of the soil profile throughout the growing season ammonium n release was modeled using either an instant decay function 1 day a linear 20 day decay function 20 day eq 1 gasser et al 2003 or eq 2 hanson et al 2006 where for eqs 1 and 2 most nitrification occurs following 75 and 30 days respectively it is to be noted that all release equations were tested for the organic nitrogen n release function eq 3 was modified from an equation developed by dessureault rompré et al 2010b and eq 4 was developed from the data measured by sbih et al 2003 the individual n release pattern for the three pools are added up and the total n release pattern shown in fig 2c represents the total amount of nitrate released daily for each treatment the permutation of nitrate ammonium and the five soil organic pools with their respective n release function generated 60 n release patterns by treatment for a total of 300 n release patterns the daily n release patterns were used as an input for hydrus for the nitrate transport modeling the three colors levels in fig 2 represent the chemical forms of nitrogen in fig 2a the nitrogen is in its initial form no3 nh4 and organic n in fig 2b the nitrogen is transformed by the n release functions whereas in fig 2c all the nitrogen content is in the nitrate form nitrate from mineral fertilizer is considered to be instantly and completely available in the dissolved phase at the moment of the application as shown in table 2 ammonium is present in various proportions in all treatments as suggested by craaq 2010 ammonia volatilization was taken into account by using an efficiency coefficient of 0 75 as a withdrawal of ammonium from liquid swine manure according to the application and incorporation method four n release functions were applied to the ammonium pools 1 instant availability 2 constant dissolution in 20 days 3 gasser equation and 4 hanson equation the hypothesis of instant availability considers that following an application ammonium could be transformed into nitrate and added to the soil solution instantly the 20 day constant dissolution hypothesis implies that all ammonium supply is transformed into nitrate and added to the soil solution at a constant rate during 20 days following applications the gasser equation describes nitrate availability from ammonium fertilizer and was developed from field measurements in potato fields in québec gasser et al 2003 1 nf t nh 4 f 2 π σ t

applications in day 3 1 soil organic nitrogen pools five soil organic nitrogen pools were used as soil potentially mineralizable nitrogen n0 soil n mineralization was modeled using a first order kinetics at a rate of mineralization k stanford and smith 1972 the amount of soil nitrogen drives the potential mineralization as it is common for a resource limited process and can be expressed as 3 d dt n min k n 0 n min where n min is the cumulative amount of nitrogen mineralized at time t and n0 is the potential mineralizable nitrogen pool content if we assume that mineralized n is zero at the start of the mineralization process i e at t 0 then the analytical solution to eq 3 is 4 n min n 0 1 e kt where n0 is the soil potential nitrogen supply and k is the kinetic parameter varying daily with soil temperature and water content inhibition of mineralization by a high nitrogen fertilization is a possibility considered by the zero organic soil nitrogen contribution hypothesis used by craaq 2010 from now referred as craaq 2010 on site mineralization was calculated using a 6 year nitrate mass balance second hypothesis under the mineral fertilizer treatment using plant nitrogen uptake and nitrate leached in subsurface drains plant nitrogen uptake was compiled using measured crop yields above ground biomass nitrogen analysis and estimated root biomass a mean deficit of 40 kg n ha 1 per year was identified and considered as the soil mineralizable n pool a third estimate of soil mineralizable n pool was the giroux rotation pool based on work from giroux and lemieux 2002 who estimated at 94 kg ha 1 the mineralizable n pool at the same experimental site under the same soil and comparable crop rotation maize canola and wheat the fourth estimate stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variable was estimated by a linear regression with the pool i dessureault rompré et al 2015 the stable nitrogen pool estimated by dessureault rompré et al 2015 method was 343 81 kg ha 1 the fifth soil organic nitrogen pool adds the pool i to the stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variables and estimate a organic nitrogen pool of 456 43 kg ha 1 the pool i is estimated by a multiple regression based on agroclimatic variables dessureault rompré et al 2010a 5 pool i 0 064 pet 0 051 gdd 177 re temp 0 031 clay 4 39 t c where pet is the annual potential evapotranspiration mm gdd is the number of growing degree days above 5 c re temp a unitless soil temperature index was calculated in three steps using the method of dessureault rompré et al 2010a 1 the soil surface temperature was estimated from the air temperature katterer and andren 2009 2 the soil temperature was estimated from the soil surface temperature katterer and andren 2009 3 re temp was calculated from the soil temperature andrén et al 2004 clay is the clay content mg kg 1 and t c is the air temperature in degree celsius 3 2 soil organic nitrogen release function we propose the use of n release functions for soil mineralizable nitrogen and manure organic nitrogen for their seasonal transformation in nitrate and their release in soil the n release functions take into account soil nitrogen source depletion two of the functions are based on a logistic equation which was found to give adequate results and be representative of the soil biological temperature conditions dessureault rompré et al 2010b the first is based on soil temperature and the other on soil temperature and water content at 7 cm soil depth the third n release function the sbih equation is based on mineralization measured weekly on incubated soil sbih et al 2003 these three n release functions represent the environmental conditions affecting soil nitrogen mineralization i e the k rate in eqs 3 and 4 the logistic equation eq 6 based only on soil temperature gives the k k0 ratio where k is the environmental conditions rate and k0 is k at the reference temperature the reference temperature t0 and k0 was proposed to be respectively 25 c and 0 014 mg kg 1 d 1 dessureault rompré et al 2010b 6 k k 0 m 1 ce r t 273 16 t 0 273 16 where m c and r are dimensionless parameters with values of respectively 4 00 31 30 and 2 45 these values have shown to be accurate for canadian soils t is the soil temperature in kelvin and t 0 299 k is the reference temperature dessureault rompré et al 2010b the second organic n release function also uses the logistic equation but is based on soil temperature and water content a daily rate modifier for the water content was calculated using the biophysical water function with the water filled pore space at a 7 cm depth and is multiplied by the result of eq 6 dessureault rompré et al 2011 the sbih equation is a function of the time after planting fitted from the data measured by sbih et al 2003 the rational model of eq 7 describes the sbih n release function 7 k k 0 5 80 03 7 92 03 t 1 5 74 02 t 1 06 03 t 2 where t days is the time since planting and k0 is 0 014 mg kg 1 d 1 3 3 leaching modeling strategy hydrus implements time variable boundary conditions like root water uptake and daily variations of transpiration and rainfall water and solute transports were modeled for each of the five treatments the water flux into subsurface drains was calibrated with data of the 2009 maize crop season and validated with data of 2011 wheat crop season the hydrus root water uptake model contains a database of crop water uptake parameters including maize and wheat therefore validation on a second crop allows for the evaluation of the robustness of the model outflows from the subsurface drain was compared with the free drainage flux at the bottom of the simulated soil column subsurface drain outflows was averaged over the twenty plots the solute component of hydrus was used only for one maize growing season in 2009 the cumulative daily solute prediction outflow was compared with the mean of each treatment cumulative nitrate mass at five dates during the growing season 2009 06 03 2009 06 29 2009 07 06 2009 10 16 and 2009 10 30 4 model calibration pest model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis doherty 2002 was used with hydrus 1d to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten van genuchten 1980 model for each of the two homogeneous soil layers table 3 shows the resulting parameters the single porosity model of van genuchten mualem was chosen with an air entry value of 2 cm without hysteresis nitrate movement was assumed to follow an equilibrium transport model nitrate dispersivity was set to 450 cm d 1 molnar and viraraghavan 1990 and the diffusion was optimized to 0 002 cm d 1 by hydrus inverse solution method nitrate was considered to be inert therefore adsorption isotherms coefficients were set to zero gasser et al 2003 hanson et al 2006 all root solute uptake was considered to be passive e g the solute is absorbed by the plant with the water movement hanson et al 2006 root water uptake was described by the feddes model feddes et al 1978 rooting depths for maize and wheat were taken from fao 2015 assuming linear root growth between seeding and maturity 4 1 initial and boundary conditions the modeling period started with the fertilizer application and ended with the last water sampling therefore the experiment lasted for a 175 day period in 2009 corresponding to the maize growing season in québec and for a 77 day period for wheat in 2011 previous year soil residual nitrogen content was neglected considering preliminary simulations results based on the empirical model shown above nitrate amounts were added throughout the season on a daily basis as a boundary condition for the solute modeling for the 2009 year the boundary and initial conditions are shown in fig 3 the upper boundary conditions were defined by daily potential evapotranspiration precipitation and nitrate fertilization potential evapotranspiration was calculated with fao 56 penman monteith equation multiplied by crop coefficients adjusted for actual evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 only 1d flow was considered the lower boundary condition was set to free drainage where all water was assumed to be recovered by the subsurface drain the soil hydraulic conductivity were optimized based on observed outflow rates to account for soil and drain resistances 4 2 model evaluation criteria the model evaluation criteria used for the soil water movement modeling was the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 for the solute n release pattern modeling nse r 2 and the root mean square error rmse were used these criteria have been chosen based on the result for their sensitiveness for the nitrogen plant uptake the rmse was used to evaluate the performance of the model between observed and simulated value 5 results and discussion 5 1 water transport the hydrus water transport module was calibrated under the 2009 maize crop growing season and validated using the 2011 wheat growing season the total water drainage measured for 2009 and 2011 were respectively 16 87 and 12 49 m3 the total rainfall measured for the growing season of 2009 and 2011 were respectively 677 and 622 mm calibration of drainage events in 2009 showed a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 67 and r 2 of 0 78 and validation in 2011 showed a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 76 and r 2 of 0 84 both for the growing season fig 4 shows the drainage water observed and modeled for the 2009 and 2011 seasons these results are judged satisfactory for field scale model as stated by moriasi et al 2015 especially in subsurface drain simulation in dry period muma et al 2017 the results indicate the model prediction ability for water transport therefore it is justified to go forward with the solute movement prediction 5 2 predictive n release pattern analysis the solute modeling showed a large difference between n release patterns with a four order magnitude difference in certain cases fig 5 shows the range of cumulative nitrate leachate under the 60 n release patterns for each treatment illustrated in each graph as shown in fig 5 the results of the n release patterns vary widely therefore not every n release function may be combined with every n organic pools in general there was an overestimation of n released fig 6 shows the nitrate release patterns that resulted in nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients above 0 70 nitrate leaching occurred predominantly in spring after seeding and fertilization in 2009 whereas only a smaller part of leaching occurred in fall when drainage resumed all retained n release patterns produced adequate simulations for the spring period but tend to overestimate leaching during fall when drainage resumed of the 300 release patterns only 20 gave a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 as shown in fig 6 fewer n release patterns gave appropriate results as the rate of added organic fertilizer liquid swine manure increased n release pattern numbers are described in table 4 there are not any combinations of nitrogen pools and n release functions that gave appropriate results for both mineral and organic treatments also no n release patterns provided appropriate results for each application rate of organic fertilizer for each treatment table 4 shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients and the rmse for the best 20 n release patterns from table 4 it can be seen that the n release patterns characterized by nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 for the mineral fertilizer treatment did not match satisfactorily the leaching nitrate in the organic treatment this result was surprising as we thought that at least one n release pattern would be able to accurately predict the nitrate leaching for both lsm and mineral treatment at every application rate inversely none of the n release patterns giving nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 in the organic treatment gave appropriate results in the mineral fertilizer mf treatment therefore it seems that nitrogen dynamics in the soil are too different under lsm and mf to be modeled by the same n release function and the same soil nitrogen pool from table 4 it can also be observed that n release pattern three and five provided good results for three lsm application rates 30 mg ha 1 60 mg ha 1 and 90 mg ha 1 which are the most realistic applications used in northern agriculture those two n release patterns used an instant availability of ammonium but the organic nitrogen pool and the n release function were different the n release pattern three used the craaq 2010 soil nitrogen pool with the sbih n release function while the n release pattern five used the mass balance organic nitrogen pool and the logistic equation with temperature and water content as n organic release function the two organic nitrogen pools are the less contributing to the total nitrate mass 0 kg n ha 1 for craaq 2010 and 40 kg n ha 1 for the mass balance approach this indicates that under our modeling the contribution of the soil mineralizable n pool is less important than the lsm organic nitrogen it is also observed from table 4 under the four lsm treatments the three only organic nitrogen pools showing results above the threshold are either identified by the mass balance craaq 2010 and giroux rotation the giroux rotation pattern gave a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 only in the case of the n release pattern 53 and was barely above this threshold inversely for the mineral fertilizer the n release patterns having nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 were those with larger soil mineralizable n pools an explanation for a better model adjustment with the organic fertilizer treatments model especially those with high organic nitrogen input is that the excess of organic nitrogen causes a decrease in soil mineralization because of the c n ratio difference between organic fertilizers which is 4 5 and the soil organic matter which is between 9 8 and 17 5 kirkby et al 2011 a lower c n ratio enhances mineralization castellanos and pratt 1981 causing the microorganisms to use mostly the nitrogen from the organic fertilizer preventing the soil to provide as much nitrogen as it could it is also observed in table 4 that the n release function based on the work of sbih et al 2003 provide the n release patterns with higher nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient than the two logistic equations for the organic fertilizer this conclusion is consistent with the origin of the equations as the two logistic equations are based on soil without organic fertilizer and the sbih equation is based on incubation of soils with organic fertilizer therefore the sbih equation was developed to take into account the transformation of two molecular forms of organic nitrogen from manure and from soil organic matter 5 3 nitrogen plant uptake for an additional evaluation of the model goodness of fit nitrogen plant uptake was estimated for each treatment using grain and stem analyses and estimate of root nitrogen partitioning weiland 1989 model simulated cumulative root solute uptake with a mean rmse of 20 9 kg ha 1 for the mineral fertilizer treatment 11 47 kg ha 1 for the 30 mg treatments 27 55 kg ha 1 for the 60 mg treatments 27 81 kg ha 1 for the 90 mg treatments and 45 19 kg ha 1 for the 120 mg treatments the cumulative nitrogen plant uptake was slightly underestimated for the mineral treatment and the organic fertilizer treatments of 30 mg 60 mg and 90 mg but was underestimated at the highest lsm application rate this indicates that plant uptake parameters could have been optimized to enhance the model performance and could explain why modeled nitrate leaching was overestimated in the fall in this study only passive solute uptake was used the difference observed between measurements and predictions could be linked to active solute uptake future works should include active nitrate uptake to enhance modeling accuracy 6 conclusion in this study multiple ways of considering nitrate transformation and availability were compared we used a combination of hydrus 1d and empirical nitrate production models and found the combination suitable to simulate nitrate leached into subsurface drains 1 the simulations showed that nitrate from mineral fertilizer and nitrate from organic fertilizer are not explained by the same n release function and soil nitrogen pool nitrate transport should be simulated differently whether the sources are organic or mineral six suitable n release patterns could be identified for mineral fertilizer the n release patterns giving a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 all use the 20 day constant dissolution for ammonium and the following pools and release functions 1 the mass balance organic n pool and the sbih organic n release function 2 the mass balance organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature as organic n release function 3 the giroux rotation organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature and water content as organic n release function 4 the mass balance organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature and water content as organic n release function 5 the giroux rotation organic n pool and the sbih organic n release function and 6 the giroux rotation organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature as organic n release function to use our model combination three solute parameters are needed in hydrus the culture rotation for the giroux rotation organic pool or an empirical nitrate mass balance in soil to estimate the organic n pool and the soil water content and temperature for the organic n release function to compare doing this modeling using only hydrus require the use of three solutes each using 20 parameters for a total of 60 parameters with soil column experiment to determine some parameters two n release patterns gave nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 for the three agronomic application rates of organic fertilizer both of which used instant dissolution for ammonium but differ in the organic n pool and organic n release function which were 1 the mass balance organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature and water content organic n release function and 2 the craaq 2010 organic n pool and the sbih organic n release function the n release patterns framework for simulating nitrate leaching is based on easily available atmospheric soil content or crop data and could be used to improve the models or the tools used to describe the nitrate losses from cropland 2 computer simulations were done with increasing organic fertilizer application rates they showed that the masses of nitrate leached are closely related to the rate of nitrogen applied 3 the simulations also showed that as the organic fertilizer application rate increases the soil organic nitrogen contribution tends to decrease which decreases the efficiency of the fertilization and consequently contributes to the rise of agricultural nitrate discharges into subsurface drains 4 in this study the nitrate leaching was overestimated by some of the adapted equation to evaluate organic nitrogen pools stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variable stable n0 and stable nitrogen pool plus easily mineralizable organic nitrogen pool stable n0 pool i and some n release function gasser equation the field specific parameter used and the estimation of certain variables could explain the overestimation 5 the water fluxes modeling was judged satisfactory with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 67 and r 2 of 0 78 in calibration and a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 76 and r 2 of 0 84 in validation the simulation of dry period with no drainage or low drainage event is known to be difficult but the reality of the experimental site required a model able to simulate dry subsurface drain for long period over the growing season 6 this study was done using an exploratory approach oriented on nitrate leaching we progressed from 300 possible n release patterns to 10 probable n release patterns now that some n release patterns have been identified future work should take into account the different molecular forms of organic nitrogen in organic fertilizer and soil this approach could enhance model accuracy future work should also include the plant active uptake of nitrate to verify the validity of the passive plant uptake

11206,losses of nitrogen fertilizer from agricultural watersheds are among the main causes of water quality degradation in quebec under maize crop leached nitrate can reach up to 185 kg n ha 1 the synchronization of the nitrogen fertilization with crop uptake would be a way to optimize the use of nitrogen fertilizer and reduce nitrate leaching coupling an empirical nitrogen cycle model with a physical soil water dynamics model could simplify the optimization of nitrogen fertilizer use the objective of this study was to couple the soil surface empirical nitrate production model adapted to the regional agro climatic conditions of study area with hydrus to determine the most suitable combination in order to predict nitrate leaching into subsurface drains in this study we used estimation equations of nitrogen pools and transformations in nitrate the equations using historical field data were combined into 60 n release patterns taking into account a dissolution function of nitrate 4 transformation and dissolution functions for the ammonium 5 organic nitrogen pools and 3 n organic nitrogen from the soil and manure release functions these n release patterns were applied in a mineral fertilizer treatment and four organic fertilizer treatments for a total of 300 unique nitrate release patterns the results demonstrate the potential of a method to evaluate the contributions of nitrogen based on atmospheric data crop rotation or soil particle sizes as 5 of the 300 combination gave a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse above 0 70 the prediction method must be different according to the source of the fertilization organic or mineral as only 1 of the combination gave nse above 0 70 in more than one treatment in addition the study showed that the soil organic nitrogen contribution to nitrate leaching tends to decrease as the organic fertilizer applications rate increases as 75 of the combination giving nse above 0 70 in high fertilization treatment used the lower organic n pool and only 17 used the lower organic n pool for the agronomic fertilization rate and mineral fertilizer the simulations also showed that the nitrate leached masses are closely related to the fertilizer supply nitrogen content keywords nitrogen management modeling organic fertilizer mineral fertilizer water pollution 1 introduction nitrogen used for agricultural fertilization is the main cause of anthropogenic perturbations of the n cycle fowler et al 2013 an excessive input of nitrogen in waterways may result in accelerated eutrophication of lakes and rivers dupas et al 2015 erisman et al 2013 along with pesticides nitrate represents the main source of aquifer contamination in agricultural areas dupuy et al 2012 nitrate leachate can reach 185 kg ha 1 in groundwater under maize crop gollamudi 2006 despite these environmental risks nitrogen fertilization remains the basis of modern agriculture it is the limiting nutrient for crop growth to the extent that nearly half of the human population depends on it for food supply craaq 2010 erisman et al 2013 n dayegamiye et al 2007 in 2009 in canada 75 of the mass of fertilizers used in agriculture was nitrogen agriculture and agri food canada 2014 nitrate leaching and the resulting surface and groundwater contamination are a concern especially in maize cultivated areas because this crop requires high nitrogen fertilizer applications over extensive areas one way to reduce nitrate leaching is to synchronize nitrogen fertilization with crop uptake synchronizing nitrogen availability with nitrate uptake can be performed indirectly by modeling nitrate leaching under the root zone or in drain tiles various process oriented and physically based solute transport models have been used to this end leaching estimation and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1991 soiln bergström et al 1991 soil water and assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and drainmod n youssef et al 2005 these models are usually based on three nitrogen pools nitrate ammonium and organic nitrogen or subdivisions of these three pools the rate of transfer between the different pools depends on several soil factors such as temperature water content and ph youssef et al 2005 most process oriented and physically based solute transport models use the advection dispersion equation to describe nitrogen transport in the soil profile these models often require detailed parameters describing nitrogen transport dispersion and diffusion transformation fertilizer dissolution nitrification denitrification and volatilization and organic matter processes and status potential rate of decomposition c n ratio of the litter and soil organic nitrogen pools contents the extent and the specificity of the required information limit the use of deterministic solute transport models for practical agronomic applications the physically based model hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 has been used to simulate water ammonium and nitrate transport in various soils hydrological and cultural conditions baram et al 2016 hanson et al 2006 li et al 2015 sansoulet 2007 veizaga et al 2016 in order to simulate nitrate leaching while accounting for all key processes hydrus requires first order rate degradation constants and the use of multiple solutes to integrate the various forms of nitrogen and their reaction chains to gather this information an undisturbed soil column experiment is almost necessary furthermore quantifying the soil organic nitrogen pool and associated role in nitrate leaching availability involves biological microbiological and chemistry knowledge since it is dependent of the soil type temperature water content and ph in order to answer to the data preparation difficulties hydrus can be coupled with a empirical nitrate production model based on easily measurable agronomic information data based models like swat use empirical relationships to define the rate of movement between the different nitrogen pools and to evaluate nitrate leaching these relationships do not describe natural processes therefore data based models can be applied only within the range of values that was used to derive them louks et al 2005 since these models have a small computational time they allow for longer and more important number of simulations equations and empirical relationships have been developed to predict the soil organic nitrogen content based on a number of parameters growing degree days clay content soil temperature soil water content crop rotation and potential evapotranspiration dessureault rompré et al 2015 dessureault rompré et al 2010a giroux and lemieux 2002 other relationships describe the seasonal mineralization of soil organic nitrogen into nitrate based on air temperature soil water content or the stage of the growing season dessureault rompré et al 2010b sbih et al 2003 some researchers derived soil specific dissolution and nitrification rates for ammonia fertilizers based on a log normal distribution gasser et al 2003 or a first order degradation equation hanson et al 2006 these equations are simple and may be applied in northern soils however none of these equations have been coupled with hydrus a coupling of these empirical equations would allow a prediction of nitrate availability to leaching with an estimate of the organic nitrogen pool and the transfer rate of organic nitrogen and ammonium into nitrate hydrus allows a daily solute input such that a simple model based on easily measurable data can be used to predict nitrate availability and organic matter contribution to nitrogen leaching using a simple nitrogen leaching prediction model at the farm scale could help to optimize nitrogen fertilization and to minimize negative environmental effects the objective of this study was to test the effect of a combination of models for the soil surface empirical nitrate production with hydrus in order to evaluate nitrate leaching into subsurface drains 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted on long term manure fertilizer test plots initiated in 1978 at the irda institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement experimental station of st lambert near québec city in the province of québec n 46 05 w 71 02 starting in 2006 a crop rotation of maize zea mays l canola brassica napus l and spring wheat triticum aestivum l was implemented data from the 2009 growing season were used in this study the annual mean temperature and the total precipitation for the year 2009 were measured on site with a meteorological station campbell scientific logan ut and were respectively 4 5 c and 1020 mm the precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge te525 l texas electronic dallas tx the snow accumulation was neglected because simulations were made only for the growing season the experimental site is divided in 20 plots the 20 plots were 90 m2 each 15 m long by 6 m wide and set up in a randomized complete block design with four replicates of four organic fertilizer treatments liquid swine manure and one mineral fertilizer treatment as the control fig 1 swine manure was applied at increasing rates 30 mg ha 1 60 mg ha 1 90 mg ha 1 and 120 mg ha 1 before seeding in spring usually for field crops especially in maize split nitrogen fertilizer applications are used at this experimental site in order to simplify the operation only one fertilizer application was used before seedling in spring of 2009 liquid swine manure lsm came from an outdoor storage pit from a maternity confinement during each field application swine manure samples were collected in triplicates at the outlet of the pit samples were analyzed using standard procedures total n in manure was determined after acid digestion of fresh material isaac and johnson 1976 nh4 n in dry matter rich fractions dmfs was extracted in kcl total n in the acid digests and nh4 n in the kcl extracts were measured as nh4 with an automated continuous flow injection analyzer model quickchem 8000 fia lachat instruments loveland co the mineral fertilizer was calcium ammonium nitrate 27 0 0 applied at 150 kg n ha 1 according to local crop recommendations craaq 2010 in 1998 each plot was equipped in its center with an independent subsurface perforated 10 cm diameter drain 85 cm deep drainage from each plot was directed to an isolated shelter where outflow was measured with a one liter tipping bucket and a campbell scientific datalogger drainage water was stored in closed plastic barrels at a temperature between 5 c and 10 c the drainage water was accumulated in 60 l reservoirs sampled stored in a cold chamber at 4 c and analyzed for the total contents of nitrite and nitrate where the lixiviate was passed through a 0 45 micron filter and reduced to nitrite by the cadmium method margeson et al 1980 the nitrite content was determined by colorimetry fia quickchem 8000 lachat instruments usa with sulfanilamide and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride bendschneider and robinson 1952 therefore we used the term nitrate to designate nitrate and nitrite in the drainage water 2 2 soil description according to the canadian classification system the soil is a poorly drained le bras series clay loam 275 g clay kg 1 425 g silt kg 1 classified as an orthic humic gleysol pageau 1974 particle size distribution was determined by the sedimentation method bouyoucos 1962 bulk density by the intact core samples method grossman and reinsch 2002 and saturated hydraulic conductivity by the constant head soil core method reynolds and elrick 2002 soil physical and textural characteristics were measured on duplicate samples at five depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm and 40 85 cm in each of the 20 plots the ranges of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat sand silt and clay percentages and bulk density with depth are shown in table 1 sand silt and clay contents are similar through the profile although there is a noticeable decreasing trend for ksat and increasing trend for bulk density with depth based on these results the soil profile was divided into two homogeneous regions and physical properties were averaged for these two layers 0 20 cm and 20 85 cm which correspond respectively to the plow layer and the natural layer 3 nitrate production model fig 2 shows the nitrate production model conceptual diagram for one treatment the nitrate production model combines the organic nitrogen pool supply and the net transformation of organic nitrogen and ammonium into nitrate three nitrate pools have been considered as shown in fig 2a 1 nitrate from fertilizers 2 ammonium from fertilizers and 3 organic n from liquid swine manure lsm org n and organic n from soil soil org n the fertilizer nitrogen supplied for each treatment are shown in table 2 soil mineralization is subdivided into five soil organic nitrogen contribution combinations 1 craaq 2010 organic soil nitrogen zero soil n 2 nitrate mass balance based pool 3 giroux rotation based pool giroux and lemieux 2002 4 stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variable dessureault rompré et al 2015 and 5 stable nitrogen pool plus easily mineralizable organic nitrogen pool pool i dessureault rompré et al 2010a the eight n release functions are represented in fig 2b as rectangles and are used to transform ammonium or organic nitrogen into nitrate which is released daily at the surface of the soil profile throughout the growing season ammonium n release was modeled using either an instant decay function 1 day a linear 20 day decay function 20 day eq 1 gasser et al 2003 or eq 2 hanson et al 2006 where for eqs 1 and 2 most nitrification occurs following 75 and 30 days respectively it is to be noted that all release equations were tested for the organic nitrogen n release function eq 3 was modified from an equation developed by dessureault rompré et al 2010b and eq 4 was developed from the data measured by sbih et al 2003 the individual n release pattern for the three pools are added up and the total n release pattern shown in fig 2c represents the total amount of nitrate released daily for each treatment the permutation of nitrate ammonium and the five soil organic pools with their respective n release function generated 60 n release patterns by treatment for a total of 300 n release patterns the daily n release patterns were used as an input for hydrus for the nitrate transport modeling the three colors levels in fig 2 represent the chemical forms of nitrogen in fig 2a the nitrogen is in its initial form no3 nh4 and organic n in fig 2b the nitrogen is transformed by the n release functions whereas in fig 2c all the nitrogen content is in the nitrate form nitrate from mineral fertilizer is considered to be instantly and completely available in the dissolved phase at the moment of the application as shown in table 2 ammonium is present in various proportions in all treatments as suggested by craaq 2010 ammonia volatilization was taken into account by using an efficiency coefficient of 0 75 as a withdrawal of ammonium from liquid swine manure according to the application and incorporation method four n release functions were applied to the ammonium pools 1 instant availability 2 constant dissolution in 20 days 3 gasser equation and 4 hanson equation the hypothesis of instant availability considers that following an application ammonium could be transformed into nitrate and added to the soil solution instantly the 20 day constant dissolution hypothesis implies that all ammonium supply is transformed into nitrate and added to the soil solution at a constant rate during 20 days following applications the gasser equation describes nitrate availability from ammonium fertilizer and was developed from field measurements in potato fields in québec gasser et al 2003 1 nf t nh 4 f 2 π σ t

applications in day 3 1 soil organic nitrogen pools five soil organic nitrogen pools were used as soil potentially mineralizable nitrogen n0 soil n mineralization was modeled using a first order kinetics at a rate of mineralization k stanford and smith 1972 the amount of soil nitrogen drives the potential mineralization as it is common for a resource limited process and can be expressed as 3 d dt n min k n 0 n min where n min is the cumulative amount of nitrogen mineralized at time t and n0 is the potential mineralizable nitrogen pool content if we assume that mineralized n is zero at the start of the mineralization process i e at t 0 then the analytical solution to eq 3 is 4 n min n 0 1 e kt where n0 is the soil potential nitrogen supply and k is the kinetic parameter varying daily with soil temperature and water content inhibition of mineralization by a high nitrogen fertilization is a possibility considered by the zero organic soil nitrogen contribution hypothesis used by craaq 2010 from now referred as craaq 2010 on site mineralization was calculated using a 6 year nitrate mass balance second hypothesis under the mineral fertilizer treatment using plant nitrogen uptake and nitrate leached in subsurface drains plant nitrogen uptake was compiled using measured crop yields above ground biomass nitrogen analysis and estimated root biomass a mean deficit of 40 kg n ha 1 per year was identified and considered as the soil mineralizable n pool a third estimate of soil mineralizable n pool was the giroux rotation pool based on work from giroux and lemieux 2002 who estimated at 94 kg ha 1 the mineralizable n pool at the same experimental site under the same soil and comparable crop rotation maize canola and wheat the fourth estimate stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variable was estimated by a linear regression with the pool i dessureault rompré et al 2015 the stable nitrogen pool estimated by dessureault rompré et al 2015 method was 343 81 kg ha 1 the fifth soil organic nitrogen pool adds the pool i to the stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variables and estimate a organic nitrogen pool of 456 43 kg ha 1 the pool i is estimated by a multiple regression based on agroclimatic variables dessureault rompré et al 2010a 5 pool i 0 064 pet 0 051 gdd 177 re temp 0 031 clay 4 39 t c where pet is the annual potential evapotranspiration mm gdd is the number of growing degree days above 5 c re temp a unitless soil temperature index was calculated in three steps using the method of dessureault rompré et al 2010a 1 the soil surface temperature was estimated from the air temperature katterer and andren 2009 2 the soil temperature was estimated from the soil surface temperature katterer and andren 2009 3 re temp was calculated from the soil temperature andrén et al 2004 clay is the clay content mg kg 1 and t c is the air temperature in degree celsius 3 2 soil organic nitrogen release function we propose the use of n release functions for soil mineralizable nitrogen and manure organic nitrogen for their seasonal transformation in nitrate and their release in soil the n release functions take into account soil nitrogen source depletion two of the functions are based on a logistic equation which was found to give adequate results and be representative of the soil biological temperature conditions dessureault rompré et al 2010b the first is based on soil temperature and the other on soil temperature and water content at 7 cm soil depth the third n release function the sbih equation is based on mineralization measured weekly on incubated soil sbih et al 2003 these three n release functions represent the environmental conditions affecting soil nitrogen mineralization i e the k rate in eqs 3 and 4 the logistic equation eq 6 based only on soil temperature gives the k k0 ratio where k is the environmental conditions rate and k0 is k at the reference temperature the reference temperature t0 and k0 was proposed to be respectively 25 c and 0 014 mg kg 1 d 1 dessureault rompré et al 2010b 6 k k 0 m 1 ce r t 273 16 t 0 273 16 where m c and r are dimensionless parameters with values of respectively 4 00 31 30 and 2 45 these values have shown to be accurate for canadian soils t is the soil temperature in kelvin and t 0 299 k is the reference temperature dessureault rompré et al 2010b the second organic n release function also uses the logistic equation but is based on soil temperature and water content a daily rate modifier for the water content was calculated using the biophysical water function with the water filled pore space at a 7 cm depth and is multiplied by the result of eq 6 dessureault rompré et al 2011 the sbih equation is a function of the time after planting fitted from the data measured by sbih et al 2003 the rational model of eq 7 describes the sbih n release function 7 k k 0 5 80 03 7 92 03 t 1 5 74 02 t 1 06 03 t 2 where t days is the time since planting and k0 is 0 014 mg kg 1 d 1 3 3 leaching modeling strategy hydrus implements time variable boundary conditions like root water uptake and daily variations of transpiration and rainfall water and solute transports were modeled for each of the five treatments the water flux into subsurface drains was calibrated with data of the 2009 maize crop season and validated with data of 2011 wheat crop season the hydrus root water uptake model contains a database of crop water uptake parameters including maize and wheat therefore validation on a second crop allows for the evaluation of the robustness of the model outflows from the subsurface drain was compared with the free drainage flux at the bottom of the simulated soil column subsurface drain outflows was averaged over the twenty plots the solute component of hydrus was used only for one maize growing season in 2009 the cumulative daily solute prediction outflow was compared with the mean of each treatment cumulative nitrate mass at five dates during the growing season 2009 06 03 2009 06 29 2009 07 06 2009 10 16 and 2009 10 30 4 model calibration pest model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis doherty 2002 was used with hydrus 1d to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten van genuchten 1980 model for each of the two homogeneous soil layers table 3 shows the resulting parameters the single porosity model of van genuchten mualem was chosen with an air entry value of 2 cm without hysteresis nitrate movement was assumed to follow an equilibrium transport model nitrate dispersivity was set to 450 cm d 1 molnar and viraraghavan 1990 and the diffusion was optimized to 0 002 cm d 1 by hydrus inverse solution method nitrate was considered to be inert therefore adsorption isotherms coefficients were set to zero gasser et al 2003 hanson et al 2006 all root solute uptake was considered to be passive e g the solute is absorbed by the plant with the water movement hanson et al 2006 root water uptake was described by the feddes model feddes et al 1978 rooting depths for maize and wheat were taken from fao 2015 assuming linear root growth between seeding and maturity 4 1 initial and boundary conditions the modeling period started with the fertilizer application and ended with the last water sampling therefore the experiment lasted for a 175 day period in 2009 corresponding to the maize growing season in québec and for a 77 day period for wheat in 2011 previous year soil residual nitrogen content was neglected considering preliminary simulations results based on the empirical model shown above nitrate amounts were added throughout the season on a daily basis as a boundary condition for the solute modeling for the 2009 year the boundary and initial conditions are shown in fig 3 the upper boundary conditions were defined by daily potential evapotranspiration precipitation and nitrate fertilization potential evapotranspiration was calculated with fao 56 penman monteith equation multiplied by crop coefficients adjusted for actual evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 only 1d flow was considered the lower boundary condition was set to free drainage where all water was assumed to be recovered by the subsurface drain the soil hydraulic conductivity were optimized based on observed outflow rates to account for soil and drain resistances 4 2 model evaluation criteria the model evaluation criteria used for the soil water movement modeling was the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 for the solute n release pattern modeling nse r 2 and the root mean square error rmse were used these criteria have been chosen based on the result for their sensitiveness for the nitrogen plant uptake the rmse was used to evaluate the performance of the model between observed and simulated value 5 results and discussion 5 1 water transport the hydrus water transport module was calibrated under the 2009 maize crop growing season and validated using the 2011 wheat growing season the total water drainage measured for 2009 and 2011 were respectively 16 87 and 12 49 m3 the total rainfall measured for the growing season of 2009 and 2011 were respectively 677 and 622 mm calibration of drainage events in 2009 showed a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 67 and r 2 of 0 78 and validation in 2011 showed a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 76 and r 2 of 0 84 both for the growing season fig 4 shows the drainage water observed and modeled for the 2009 and 2011 seasons these results are judged satisfactory for field scale model as stated by moriasi et al 2015 especially in subsurface drain simulation in dry period muma et al 2017 the results indicate the model prediction ability for water transport therefore it is justified to go forward with the solute movement prediction 5 2 predictive n release pattern analysis the solute modeling showed a large difference between n release patterns with a four order magnitude difference in certain cases fig 5 shows the range of cumulative nitrate leachate under the 60 n release patterns for each treatment illustrated in each graph as shown in fig 5 the results of the n release patterns vary widely therefore not every n release function may be combined with every n organic pools in general there was an overestimation of n released fig 6 shows the nitrate release patterns that resulted in nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients above 0 70 nitrate leaching occurred predominantly in spring after seeding and fertilization in 2009 whereas only a smaller part of leaching occurred in fall when drainage resumed all retained n release patterns produced adequate simulations for the spring period but tend to overestimate leaching during fall when drainage resumed of the 300 release patterns only 20 gave a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 as shown in fig 6 fewer n release patterns gave appropriate results as the rate of added organic fertilizer liquid swine manure increased n release pattern numbers are described in table 4 there are not any combinations of nitrogen pools and n release functions that gave appropriate results for both mineral and organic treatments also no n release patterns provided appropriate results for each application rate of organic fertilizer for each treatment table 4 shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients and the rmse for the best 20 n release patterns from table 4 it can be seen that the n release patterns characterized by nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 for the mineral fertilizer treatment did not match satisfactorily the leaching nitrate in the organic treatment this result was surprising as we thought that at least one n release pattern would be able to accurately predict the nitrate leaching for both lsm and mineral treatment at every application rate inversely none of the n release patterns giving nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 in the organic treatment gave appropriate results in the mineral fertilizer mf treatment therefore it seems that nitrogen dynamics in the soil are too different under lsm and mf to be modeled by the same n release function and the same soil nitrogen pool from table 4 it can also be observed that n release pattern three and five provided good results for three lsm application rates 30 mg ha 1 60 mg ha 1 and 90 mg ha 1 which are the most realistic applications used in northern agriculture those two n release patterns used an instant availability of ammonium but the organic nitrogen pool and the n release function were different the n release pattern three used the craaq 2010 soil nitrogen pool with the sbih n release function while the n release pattern five used the mass balance organic nitrogen pool and the logistic equation with temperature and water content as n organic release function the two organic nitrogen pools are the less contributing to the total nitrate mass 0 kg n ha 1 for craaq 2010 and 40 kg n ha 1 for the mass balance approach this indicates that under our modeling the contribution of the soil mineralizable n pool is less important than the lsm organic nitrogen it is also observed from table 4 under the four lsm treatments the three only organic nitrogen pools showing results above the threshold are either identified by the mass balance craaq 2010 and giroux rotation the giroux rotation pattern gave a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 only in the case of the n release pattern 53 and was barely above this threshold inversely for the mineral fertilizer the n release patterns having nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 were those with larger soil mineralizable n pools an explanation for a better model adjustment with the organic fertilizer treatments model especially those with high organic nitrogen input is that the excess of organic nitrogen causes a decrease in soil mineralization because of the c n ratio difference between organic fertilizers which is 4 5 and the soil organic matter which is between 9 8 and 17 5 kirkby et al 2011 a lower c n ratio enhances mineralization castellanos and pratt 1981 causing the microorganisms to use mostly the nitrogen from the organic fertilizer preventing the soil to provide as much nitrogen as it could it is also observed in table 4 that the n release function based on the work of sbih et al 2003 provide the n release patterns with higher nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient than the two logistic equations for the organic fertilizer this conclusion is consistent with the origin of the equations as the two logistic equations are based on soil without organic fertilizer and the sbih equation is based on incubation of soils with organic fertilizer therefore the sbih equation was developed to take into account the transformation of two molecular forms of organic nitrogen from manure and from soil organic matter 5 3 nitrogen plant uptake for an additional evaluation of the model goodness of fit nitrogen plant uptake was estimated for each treatment using grain and stem analyses and estimate of root nitrogen partitioning weiland 1989 model simulated cumulative root solute uptake with a mean rmse of 20 9 kg ha 1 for the mineral fertilizer treatment 11 47 kg ha 1 for the 30 mg treatments 27 55 kg ha 1 for the 60 mg treatments 27 81 kg ha 1 for the 90 mg treatments and 45 19 kg ha 1 for the 120 mg treatments the cumulative nitrogen plant uptake was slightly underestimated for the mineral treatment and the organic fertilizer treatments of 30 mg 60 mg and 90 mg but was underestimated at the highest lsm application rate this indicates that plant uptake parameters could have been optimized to enhance the model performance and could explain why modeled nitrate leaching was overestimated in the fall in this study only passive solute uptake was used the difference observed between measurements and predictions could be linked to active solute uptake future works should include active nitrate uptake to enhance modeling accuracy 6 conclusion in this study multiple ways of considering nitrate transformation and availability were compared we used a combination of hydrus 1d and empirical nitrate production models and found the combination suitable to simulate nitrate leached into subsurface drains 1 the simulations showed that nitrate from mineral fertilizer and nitrate from organic fertilizer are not explained by the same n release function and soil nitrogen pool nitrate transport should be simulated differently whether the sources are organic or mineral six suitable n release patterns could be identified for mineral fertilizer the n release patterns giving a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 all use the 20 day constant dissolution for ammonium and the following pools and release functions 1 the mass balance organic n pool and the sbih organic n release function 2 the mass balance organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature as organic n release function 3 the giroux rotation organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature and water content as organic n release function 4 the mass balance organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature and water content as organic n release function 5 the giroux rotation organic n pool and the sbih organic n release function and 6 the giroux rotation organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature as organic n release function to use our model combination three solute parameters are needed in hydrus the culture rotation for the giroux rotation organic pool or an empirical nitrate mass balance in soil to estimate the organic n pool and the soil water content and temperature for the organic n release function to compare doing this modeling using only hydrus require the use of three solutes each using 20 parameters for a total of 60 parameters with soil column experiment to determine some parameters two n release patterns gave nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient above 0 70 for the three agronomic application rates of organic fertilizer both of which used instant dissolution for ammonium but differ in the organic n pool and organic n release function which were 1 the mass balance organic n pool and the logistic equation with soil temperature and water content organic n release function and 2 the craaq 2010 organic n pool and the sbih organic n release function the n release patterns framework for simulating nitrate leaching is based on easily available atmospheric soil content or crop data and could be used to improve the models or the tools used to describe the nitrate losses from cropland 2 computer simulations were done with increasing organic fertilizer application rates they showed that the masses of nitrate leached are closely related to the rate of nitrogen applied 3 the simulations also showed that as the organic fertilizer application rate increases the soil organic nitrogen contribution tends to decrease which decreases the efficiency of the fertilization and consequently contributes to the rise of agricultural nitrate discharges into subsurface drains 4 in this study the nitrate leaching was overestimated by some of the adapted equation to evaluate organic nitrogen pools stable nitrogen pool based on agroclimatic variable stable n0 and stable nitrogen pool plus easily mineralizable organic nitrogen pool stable n0 pool i and some n release function gasser equation the field specific parameter used and the estimation of certain variables could explain the overestimation 5 the water fluxes modeling was judged satisfactory with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 67 and r 2 of 0 78 in calibration and a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 76 and r 2 of 0 84 in validation the simulation of dry period with no drainage or low drainage event is known to be difficult but the reality of the experimental site required a model able to simulate dry subsurface drain for long period over the growing season 6 this study was done using an exploratory approach oriented on nitrate leaching we progressed from 300 possible n release patterns to 10 probable n release patterns now that some n release patterns have been identified future work should take into account the different molecular forms of organic nitrogen in organic fertilizer and soil this approach could enhance model accuracy future work should also include the plant active uptake of nitrate to verify the validity of the passive plant uptake

11207,rice paddy fields pose a high risk of water pollutions for the surrounding waterbodies through surface runoff and subsurface fluxes compared to surface runoff subsurface flux from rice paddy fields has received less attention and is still poorly quantified mainly due to low frequency measurements at field scale and limited modeling capability at regional scale here we proposed a simplified modeling approach to estimate the subsurface fluxes of water nitrogen n and phosphorus p from rice paddy fields and examined their relative importance compared to surface runoff this model was established based on the high frequency field measurements over two rice growing seasons in central china and the extended datasets across the east asia two year site based observations indicate the significance of subsurface fluxes of water 737 785 mm season 1 n 28 5 40 0 kg n ha 1 and p 0 7 4 3 kg p ha 1 compared to those of surface runoff 178 199 mm season 1 4 5 12 9 kg n ha 1 0 5 2 6 kg p ha 1 our regional estimations in the east asia reveal that subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields were comparable with surface fluxes primarily controlled by the magnitude of seasonal precipitation subsurface fluxes were the dominant pathway of nutrient losses in drier rice cropping areas while surface runoff was the more important process in wetter areas in the light of the regional differences we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for mitigating nutrient losses from rice paddy fields would be beneficial for the future water quality improvements in the surrounding waterbodies keywords nitrogen phosphorous leaching surface runoff paddy rice hydroclimatic condition 1 introduction rice is the staple food for more than half of world s population in the world and the main source of calories in developing countries fao 2014 seck et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 to maintain rice yields rice paddy fields are frequently irrigated and excessively fertilized accounting for 50 and 14 of global irrigation water and fertilizer consumptions ifa and ipni 2017 yunus et al 2013 therefore rice paddy fields pose a high risk of water pollutions for the surrounding waterbodies through surface runoff and subsurface fluxes of nutrients maruyama et al 2008 xue et al 2014 as one of the consequences aquatic eutrophication and groundwater contamination were intensively observed particularly in the east asia choi et al 2010 gu et al 2013 hou et al 2018 neumann et al 2011 paerl et al 2014 wick et al 2012 assessing such environmental consequences requires quantification of surface and subsurface fluxes of nitrogen n and phosphorus p at first subsurface flux from rice paddy fields however has received less attention compared to the pathway of surface runoff mainly due to the existence of hardpan or plough pan below topsoil layer that is largely impervious to water he et al 2017 janssen and lennartz 2007 zhao et al 2012 therefore the importance of subsurface fluxes of n and p from rice paddy fields is still poorly understood subsurface flows take place beneath rice paddy fields including the processes of infiltration seepage and groundwater recharge subsurface fluxes of n and p depend on the infiltration rate of water and the concentrations of n and p below the rooting zone riley et al 2001 zheng and bennett 2002 zhao et al 2015 at present it is still difficult to directly measure the subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields bouman et al 2007 calculations based on water balance approach were widely applied instead cho et al 2008 liang et al 2014 peng et al 2011 yoon et al 2006 yoshinaga et al 2007 meanwhile estimation uncertainties related to subsurface fluxes were originated from different sampling procedures and observations of the other water balance components e g evapotranspiration change in ponded water depth phogat et al 2009 first sampling frequency for n and p concentrations was often limited e g weekly biweekly due to the high cost and sampling was mostly performed after seedlings transplantation darzi naftchali et al 2017 tian et al 2007 however there is no solid evidence to demonstrate that these intermittent sampling methods are sufficient to capture peaks and daily variations of subsurface fluxes second uncertainties of the other budget components were propagated into the estimates of subsurface fluxes hindering their accurate quantification jha et al 2017 these limitations can be addressed by modeling approaches despite the existence of large uncertainties arising from model structure e g groundwater recharge of n and p across soil aquifer interface dourte et al 2014 iwasaki et al 2014 leon and kohyama 2017 yoshioka et al 2016 the reliability of simulation models also depends on the accuracy of management related input forcing such as irrigation and fertilization where their spatiotemporally explicit datasets are not available especially in developing countries alternatively a default value of 30 in ipcc 2006 has been used to estimate the cropland n losses via surface and subsurface fluxes which overestimated the eutrophication potential by 50 than the site specific approach introduced by leon and kohyama 2017 however the site specific modeling approach was limited to be applied for specific soil types therefore a simplified and reliable modeling approach is urgently needed to upscale subsurface fluxes from field scale observations to regional estimates it was intensively studied about the impacts of management practices on nutrient losses via surface and subsurface flows liang et al 2017 miniotti et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however the importance of subsurface fluxes relative to surface runoff remains elusive at regional scale in addition to the inherent uncertainty the lack of synchronous observations restricts the quantitative comparison between surface and subsurface fluxes the limited synchronous observations showed conflicting conclusions that is a part of observations found that surface runoff of water and nutrient losses exceeded subsurface flows cho et al 2008 maruyama et al 2008 tian et al 2007 while others showed the opposite miniotti et al 2016 to address such conflicts additional data that are representative for most of rice cropping areas are needed to clarify the relationship between surface and subsurface flows here we proposed a simplified modeling approach to estimate the subsurface fluxes of water n and p from rice paddy fields and examined their relative importance compared to surface runoff we first carried out high frequency measurements in central china in the years 2017 and 2018 to calibrate the simplified models which was further validated by the independent data observed in rice paddy fields across the east asia we then applied the models to generate a larger dataset to enable us to address two hypotheses 1 surface fluxes dominate the pathway of nutrient losses from rice paddy fields 2 total water inputs control the relative importance of subsurface compared to surface fluxes in the east asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experiment design high resolution observations of water n and p

subsection 2 3 1 to quantify the subsurface fluxes of n and p subsurface water samples were collected every two hours in the daytime 8 00 19 00 with polyvinyl chloride pipes following the methods of meng et al 2014 and liang et al 2017 specifically before the experiment pipes 16 cm in diameter 100 cm in length and open bottom were vertically inserted into soil at a depth of 90 cm in each plot to prevent ponded water leaking along the pipe a plastic pellicle was wrapped around the pipe at 10 cm beneath the soil surface and extended horizontally to 10 cm water samples from surface runoff were collected for each events after the collections samples were transferred to the laboratory immediately water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm syringe filter and digested with drb200 digital reactor hach colorado usa total nitrogen tn concentrations in water samples were analyzed by the persulfate digestion method and total phosphorus tp concentrations were analyzed by the potassium persulfate

the size of leaves during whole growing season in addition soil water storage at time t st were derived from soil volumetric water content weighted by measurement depth following the method of pangle

concentrations ci of subsurface flows 4 k i f c i where i denote the index of pollutants i 1 for n and i 2 for p similarly surface fluxes of n and p are determined by multiplying r and associated concentration in addition we apply a monte carlo ensemble simulation to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimates of f and ki that stems from observations and model parameterization more details of estimation uncertainty can be found in supplementary text s1 2 3 2 development of simplified models for subsurface fluxes to simplify modeling approach for predicting subsurface fluxes of water n and p we used two forms of water budget components and concentrations the linear and product terms to account for their interplay this resulted in a total of 3 forms of independent variables eq 5 we used these variables in different combinations to linearly regress with daily subsurface fluxes of n or p based on the observations in 2017 to avoid over fitting we applied stepwise linear regression to capture the relationship between independent variables and subsurface fluxes at the jingzhou station and of the basic form 5 k i f f j c i f j c i where fj the subsurface water fluxes at time j ci the ponded water concentration of n i 1 and p i 2 the generated regression equations were statistically tested next based on the highly temporal resolution observations at jingzhou station we identified which functional form of eq 5 from different combinations fit the data best using the akaike information criterion aic which penalizes equations with more terms the subsurface fluxes of water n and p in 2018 were then used to validate the simplified models the predictive performance of the simplified models were measured using two quantitative statistics coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias bias when there are r2 0 8 and bias 20 the models were developed with satisfaction besides we further validate the models with the best functional representation by field studies from the literatures where in situ observations of subsurface fluxes of n or p and associated variables were applied under different environmental and management related conditions see supplementary table s2 we included in our search all published datasets from the web of science wos and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki three types of samples were excluded from the analysis gao et al 2016a b i observations with the duration not covering a whole rice growing season ii observations that included the use of such chemicals as nitrification inhibitors and iii observations conducted within laboratories greenhouses or pots this reduced dataset comprised 78 samples for water 25 samples for n 36 samples for p across the east asia table s2 missing values of precipitation or irrigations at a few sites were supplemented with data from the 0 1 degree china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd v0106 http data cma cn or from 1 km china agricultural irrigation dataset hou et al 2018 depending on its geographic coordinates respectively 2 4 comparison between subsurface and surface fluxes in addition to the quantification of subsurface fluxes we revealed their relative importance compared to surface runoff fluxes from paddy rice fields following three steps we first collected two types of samples in asia from the literatures 1 the observations where both subsurface and surface fluxes were simultaneously measured during rice growing season 2 the observations where surface runoff fluxes were only measured with the associated variables hou et al 2018 the detailed information of such samples can be found in table s2 in the next step we simulated subsurface fluxes of water n and p using the simplified models for the second type of samples the paired data of subsurface and surface fluxes were then largely extended from 97 samples synchronous observations to 279 samples both of observations and model simulations the combined datasets covered most of rice cropping areas in the east asia finally we compared the subsurface fluxes with surface fluxes of water n and p across the east asia moreover we applied regression analysis to further identify the driving factors e g total water inputs precipitation et clay content that dominate the relative importance of subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of subsurface fluxes temporal dynamics of the estimated subsurface fluxes at jingzhou station are displayed in fig 2 in 2017 subsurface water flux was 737 3 59 4 mm 1σ as standard deviation due to estimation uncertainty see text s1 which were 48 9 of total water inputs fig 2 specifically pre flooding accounted for 29 4 of subsurface water flux which was often ignored in previous studies darzi naftchali et al 2017 peng et al 2015 yoon et al 2006 after midseason drainage rice paddy fields experienced a substantial flux at a rate of 9 8 mm day 1 and contributed to 54 8 of the total subsurface flux of water however it was then limited to 3 2 mm day 1 10 8 of the total during the stage of physiological maturity similar results in 2018 were also illustrated in fig 2 except for the period of mid season drainage when rice paddy fields experienced higher subsurface fluxes of water 16 6 mm day 1 surprisingly subsurface water fluxes were estimated as negative values through water budget analysis indicating an intermittent groundwater recharge during the whole rice growing season taking the observations in 2017 for example correlation analysis shows that subsurface water fluxes were positively correlated with water input intensities e g r 0 61 n 58 p 0 001 fig s2a and negatively correlated with change in ponded water depth when no additional water were applied r 0 97 n 55 p 0 001 fig s2b in addition surface runoff flux were 177 8 mm 11 8 of total water input in 2017 and 199 mm 12 9 in 2018 accounting for only one quarter of subsurface fluxes the detailed observations of the other water budget components were provided in fig s1 subsurface flux of n was 40 1 8 9 kg n ha 1 for the whole rice growing season accounting for 13 1 of total n inputs the dynamics of subsurface n flux were similar with subsurface water fluxes with the correlation coefficient of 0 92 n 113 p 0 001 fig s3a subsurface n flux during the pre flooding period comprised 27 2 of the total while that in the 2nd flooding period comprised 65 1 fig 2b the subsurface flux of p was 4 4 0 1 kg p ha 1 or 10 8 of total p inputs subsurface flux of p was also positively correlated with subsurface water flux with a correlation coefficient of 0 94 n 113 p 0 001 fig s3a although subsurface fluxes of n and p in 2018 were 29 and 83 lower than those in 2017 they were also correlated well with subsurface water fluxes fig s3b by contrast surface runoff of n was observed to be low accounting for 4 1 and 1 5 of total n input in 2017 and 2018 respectively surface runoff of p were 2 6 0 3 kg p ha 1 in 2017 and 0 5 0 1 kg p ha 1 in 2018 which comprised 6 4 and 1 3 of total p inputs accordingly fig 2c 3 2 performance of the simplified models the optimal simplified models were finally found with r2 of 0 89 0 90 and 0 95 for water n and p respectively table 1 the values of bias were 0 5 16 and 19 accordingly the regression variables for subsurface water fluxes included water inputs change in ponded water depth equals zero when considering the whole rice season and surface runoff table 1 similarly subsurface fluxes of n and p were estimated by concentration of ponded water and subsurface water fluxes the evaluation results suggest that most of the variances of subsurface fluxes could be explained by the simplified models fig 3 a d and g the models were first validated by field observations in 2018 the modeled subsurface fluxes of water n and p were consistent with that of observations with r2 of 0 86 0 96 and bias of 9 2 20 table 1 and fig 3b e and h second the models were further validated by independent data from 49 stations across east asia results indicate that our models calibrated by the high frequency observations at jingzhou station were able to reproduce the accumulated subsurface fluxes of water n and p over rice growing season even if the stations had different hydroclimate conditions and management practices r2 0 97 for water 0 91 for n and 0 99 for p fig 3c f and i this simplified model was also validated by daily observations of subsurface fluxes of water and n in japan r2 0 88 for water 0 47 for n fig s5 these results provided an additional confidence on the predictive capabilities of the simplified models implying that such models could be applied to predict spatiotemporal patterns of subsurface fluxes 3 3 relative importance of subsurface to surface fluxes both of synchronous observations and model simulations suggested that subsurface fluxes were comparable with surface fluxes across the rice paddy fields in the east asia fig 4 a c for example subsurface fluxes were dominant pathways at 53 65 and 43 of stations for water n and p respectively i e ratio of subsurface flow to surface runoff fluxes 1 mainly located in subtropical and tropical regions fig 5 in addition the ratios of subsurface flow to surface runoff across east asia including the fluxes of water n and p responded to seasonal precipitation in an exponentially decreasing manner p 0 001 fig 4d f rather than total water inputs i e the sum of precipitation and irrigation fig 4g i these results revealed that precipitation controlled the relevant importance of subsurface and surface flow from rice paddy fields for n losses regions with seasonal precipitation of 500 mm such as japan central and north china should pay more attention to subsurface n fluxes when estimating the environmental risks of rice paddy fields conversely the risks from surface runoff may be more important for regions with seasonal precipitation 500 mm e g south china similarly for p losses subsurface fluxes becomes the dominant pathway to waterbodies when precipitation is less than 300 mm per growing season it should be noted that we are cautious regarding to the robustness of this results for p given the fact that the combined datasets were still limited and the stations were not widely distributed across east asia fig s4 4 discussion the simplified models extended previous field scale evidences from limited sites to a regional biogeochemical paradigm the combined datasets pointed out that subsurface fluxes of n and p were comparable to those of surface runoff fluxes roughly across a half of east asia s sites fig 5 unfortunately previous measurements typically underrated subsurface fluxes of n and p leon and kohyama 2017 loeve et al 2004 mainly due to inappropriate procedures of subsurface flux measurements at field scale and limited capability of modeling approaches at regional scale 4 1 implication for subsurface flux measurements firstly subsurface fluxes were in general ignored to measure in the period of pre flooding when substantial irrigation is required to facilitate plowing and puddling bouman et al 2007 in fact pre flooding is prevalent in china especially for paddy rice rotated with upland crops although no fertilizers were applied during this period residual n and p from previous upland cropping season mainly in the form of nitrate zhou et al 2016 and phosphate hernandez ramirez et al 2011 nemery et al 2005 are readily infiltrated through the irrigation activity secondly the inadequate sampling frequency for n or p concentrations of subsurface flows were identified as a critical source of uncertainty fig s5 with some exceptions zhao et al 2009 most available field scale studies collected water samples at weekly or biweekly interval darzi naftchali et al 2017 jha et al 2017 yang et al 2015 our scenario based simulations however revealed that low sampling frequency amplified the estimation uncertainties that is twice per week sampling resulted in a relative difference ranging from 7 0 to 12 2 and such ranges were enlarged to 16 1 37 6 along with the decline of sampling frequency from twice per week to once per bi week in 2017 fig s5d one of methods for reducing this uncertainty is to improve the sampling procedures of the key budget components with advanced equipment for example changes in ponded water depth the most important source of uncertainty for subsurface water fluxes fig s5 can be automatically measured by ultrasonic sensors with the measurement accuracy of less than 1 mm the method to improve the accuracy of et estimation is to use the direct observations based on energy balance approach 4 2 implication for model improvement in addition to high frequency flux measurements modeling approach is one of effective tools to estimate the high resolution dynamics of subsurface fluxes of water n and p from rice paddy fields here our results provide new insights to help understand the behaviors of subsurface flows in rice paddy fields most of process based models were carried out using the constant ponded water depth li et al 2015 xu et al 2013 which potentially introduces an additional bias particular for the high resolution estimation of subsurface fluxes of water improvement of irrigation scheme should be prioritized for modeling subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields previous process based models set up irrigation scheme mainly based on the crop demands and water availability dash et al 2015 simunek et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 xu et al 2013 rather than the management oriented requirements taking the jingzhou station for example one third of irrigation amounts are applied in the period before rice transplantation to the fields in 2017 without water demands for rice growth additional irrigation are also required to lower the temperature to maintain the rice yield kogel knabner et al 2010 lobell et al 2008 peng et al 2004 importantly intermittent irrigation dominated the subsurface fluxes during these two periods updating irrigation scheme of model therefore would help accurately simulate ponded water depth and thereby the dynamics of subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields to further confirm the contribution of subsurface fluxes eventually to the surrounding waterbodies n and p attenuations within soil profile should be conducted in future 4 3 policy implication to n and p loss mitigation although the government of china has issued regulatory policies for cleaner surface waters e g the water pollution control action plan issued in 2015 most of efforts related to agricultural nonpoint sources were made to mitigate surface runoff of n and p local administrators still face challenges in coordinating the reductions of surface runoff and subsurface flows given limited financial resources here our results indicated precipitation as dominant factor in determining the relevant importance of subsurface fluxes and surface runoff such spatial discrepancies in dominant pathways of nutrient losses can be explained by the differences in their generation mechanisms in rice paddy fields intermittent surface runoff is driven by heavy rainfall or active drainage li et al 2018 rather than irrigation events that are only applied to keep the ponded water depth sufficient for rice growth e g 5 cm at jingzhou station however subsurface flows occur continuously and steady that are driven by either rainfall or irrigation events in the light of these regional differences we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for mitigating nutrient losses from rice paddy fields would be beneficial for the future water quality improvements in the surrounding waterbodies to reduce the risks of water pollution intensive irrigation should be reduced by using advanced water saving technologies e g the ground cover rice production system yao et al 2018 and the alternate wetting and drying approach that applies irrigation only when water table larger than 15 cm hou et al 2012 linquist et al 2015 moreover pre flooding that contributes to more than 30 of subsurface fluxes of n and p needs to be optimized to decrease the infiltration of residual n and p from the former cropping season one of effective approaches is to apply direct seedling approach for which pre flooding is not required farooq et al 2009 liang et al 2016 in addition splitting application of fertilizers effectively reduces n and p infiltration rates comparing to single application peng et al 2011 the use of polymer coated controlled release fertilizers can effectively decrease the n and p concentrations of soil water and thereby the risk of infiltration li et al 2018 4 4 summary and future works in summary to our knowledge this study is the first to spatially assess the importance of subsurface fluxes relative to surface runoff from rice paddy fields at the regional scale results revealed the subsurface fluxes of water n and p were comparable with surface runoff across east asia their relevant importance was primarily controlled by the magnitude of seasonal precipitation subsurface fluxes were the dominant pathway of nutrient losses in drier rice cropping areas 500 mm season 1 for n and 300 mm season 1 for p while surface runoff was the more important process in wetter areas although some general goals have been achieved there are a few challenges that should be addressed in the future the first challenge is to separate water samples generated from infiltration seepage and groundwater recharge which are different processes but mixed together when collecting samples beneath the rooting zone it therefore remains difficult to clarify whether n or p concentrations in water samples represent the actual levels of the mixture of three budget components for fields located at low terrain infiltration and recharging may occur simultaneously and frequently within a day due to the landscape interactions nutrient concentration of subsurface fluxes are in a dynamic equilibrium among ponded water soil water and groundwater whether the concentration of obtained water samples is

11207,rice paddy fields pose a high risk of water pollutions for the surrounding waterbodies through surface runoff and subsurface fluxes compared to surface runoff subsurface flux from rice paddy fields has received less attention and is still poorly quantified mainly due to low frequency measurements at field scale and limited modeling capability at regional scale here we proposed a simplified modeling approach to estimate the subsurface fluxes of water nitrogen n and phosphorus p from rice paddy fields and examined their relative importance compared to surface runoff this model was established based on the high frequency field measurements over two rice growing seasons in central china and the extended datasets across the east asia two year site based observations indicate the significance of subsurface fluxes of water 737 785 mm season 1 n 28 5 40 0 kg n ha 1 and p 0 7 4 3 kg p ha 1 compared to those of surface runoff 178 199 mm season 1 4 5 12 9 kg n ha 1 0 5 2 6 kg p ha 1 our regional estimations in the east asia reveal that subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields were comparable with surface fluxes primarily controlled by the magnitude of seasonal precipitation subsurface fluxes were the dominant pathway of nutrient losses in drier rice cropping areas while surface runoff was the more important process in wetter areas in the light of the regional differences we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for mitigating nutrient losses from rice paddy fields would be beneficial for the future water quality improvements in the surrounding waterbodies keywords nitrogen phosphorous leaching surface runoff paddy rice hydroclimatic condition 1 introduction rice is the staple food for more than half of world s population in the world and the main source of calories in developing countries fao 2014 seck et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 to maintain rice yields rice paddy fields are frequently irrigated and excessively fertilized accounting for 50 and 14 of global irrigation water and fertilizer consumptions ifa and ipni 2017 yunus et al 2013 therefore rice paddy fields pose a high risk of water pollutions for the surrounding waterbodies through surface runoff and subsurface fluxes of nutrients maruyama et al 2008 xue et al 2014 as one of the consequences aquatic eutrophication and groundwater contamination were intensively observed particularly in the east asia choi et al 2010 gu et al 2013 hou et al 2018 neumann et al 2011 paerl et al 2014 wick et al 2012 assessing such environmental consequences requires quantification of surface and subsurface fluxes of nitrogen n and phosphorus p at first subsurface flux from rice paddy fields however has received less attention compared to the pathway of surface runoff mainly due to the existence of hardpan or plough pan below topsoil layer that is largely impervious to water he et al 2017 janssen and lennartz 2007 zhao et al 2012 therefore the importance of subsurface fluxes of n and p from rice paddy fields is still poorly understood subsurface flows take place beneath rice paddy fields including the processes of infiltration seepage and groundwater recharge subsurface fluxes of n and p depend on the infiltration rate of water and the concentrations of n and p below the rooting zone riley et al 2001 zheng and bennett 2002 zhao et al 2015 at present it is still difficult to directly measure the subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields bouman et al 2007 calculations based on water balance approach were widely applied instead cho et al 2008 liang et al 2014 peng et al 2011 yoon et al 2006 yoshinaga et al 2007 meanwhile estimation uncertainties related to subsurface fluxes were originated from different sampling procedures and observations of the other water balance components e g evapotranspiration change in ponded water depth phogat et al 2009 first sampling frequency for n and p concentrations was often limited e g weekly biweekly due to the high cost and sampling was mostly performed after seedlings transplantation darzi naftchali et al 2017 tian et al 2007 however there is no solid evidence to demonstrate that these intermittent sampling methods are sufficient to capture peaks and daily variations of subsurface fluxes second uncertainties of the other budget components were propagated into the estimates of subsurface fluxes hindering their accurate quantification jha et al 2017 these limitations can be addressed by modeling approaches despite the existence of large uncertainties arising from model structure e g groundwater recharge of n and p across soil aquifer interface dourte et al 2014 iwasaki et al 2014 leon and kohyama 2017 yoshioka et al 2016 the reliability of simulation models also depends on the accuracy of management related input forcing such as irrigation and fertilization where their spatiotemporally explicit datasets are not available especially in developing countries alternatively a default value of 30 in ipcc 2006 has been used to estimate the cropland n losses via surface and subsurface fluxes which overestimated the eutrophication potential by 50 than the site specific approach introduced by leon and kohyama 2017 however the site specific modeling approach was limited to be applied for specific soil types therefore a simplified and reliable modeling approach is urgently needed to upscale subsurface fluxes from field scale observations to regional estimates it was intensively studied about the impacts of management practices on nutrient losses via surface and subsurface flows liang et al 2017 miniotti et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however the importance of subsurface fluxes relative to surface runoff remains elusive at regional scale in addition to the inherent uncertainty the lack of synchronous observations restricts the quantitative comparison between surface and subsurface fluxes the limited synchronous observations showed conflicting conclusions that is a part of observations found that surface runoff of water and nutrient losses exceeded subsurface flows cho et al 2008 maruyama et al 2008 tian et al 2007 while others showed the opposite miniotti et al 2016 to address such conflicts additional data that are representative for most of rice cropping areas are needed to clarify the relationship between surface and subsurface flows here we proposed a simplified modeling approach to estimate the subsurface fluxes of water n and p from rice paddy fields and examined their relative importance compared to surface runoff we first carried out high frequency measurements in central china in the years 2017 and 2018 to calibrate the simplified models which was further validated by the independent data observed in rice paddy fields across the east asia we then applied the models to generate a larger dataset to enable us to address two hypotheses 1 surface fluxes dominate the pathway of nutrient losses from rice paddy fields 2 total water inputs control the relative importance of subsurface compared to surface fluxes in the east asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experiment design high resolution observations of water n and p budget components were conducted over two rice growing seasons from may 25 2017 to september 18 2018 the study site is located in the jingzhou agrometeorological experimental station 30 21 n 112 09 e

management in plots was flooding midseason drainage frequent water logging with intermittent irrigation li et al 2018 pre flooding was initiated before transplantation followed by frequent water logging except for midseason drainage then no irrigation was applied during the period of physiological maturity in total the irrigation of 1025 5 mm and 1229 2 mm were applied in the whole rice growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 respectively fertilizers were applied with total amounts of 230 5 kg n ha 1 and 26 6 kg p ha 1 for each of rice growing season compound fertilizer i e mixture of urea

subsection 2 3 1 to quantify the subsurface fluxes of n and p subsurface water samples were collected every two hours in the daytime 8 00 19 00 with polyvinyl chloride pipes following the methods of meng et al 2014 and liang et al 2017 specifically before the experiment pipes 16 cm in diameter 100 cm in length and open bottom were vertically inserted into soil at a depth of 90 cm in each plot to prevent ponded water leaking along the pipe a plastic pellicle was wrapped around the pipe at 10 cm beneath the soil surface and extended horizontally to 10 cm water samples from surface runoff were collected for each events after the collections samples were transferred to the laboratory immediately water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm syringe filter and digested with drb200 digital reactor hach colorado usa total nitrogen tn concentrations in water samples were analyzed by the persulfate digestion method and total phosphorus tp concentrations were analyzed by the potassium persulfate

et and r denote outputs of evapotranspiration and surface runoff respectively δs and δh denote the changes of soil water storage and ponded water depth between two consecutive sampling times t t 1

coefficient kc is crop coefficient that was calculated based on daily air temperature t and leaf area index lai according to gao et al 2016a b eq 2c where lai was determined by continually measuring the size of leaves during whole growing season in addition soil water storage at time t st were derived from soil volumetric water content weighted by measurement depth following the method of pangle et al 2014 3 s t d 1 θ 1 d 2 θ 2 d 3 θ 3 d where θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are soil volumetric water contents measured at depth of 10 30 and 60 cm deemed as mean value for 0 20 cm d 1 20 cm 20 40 cm d 2 20 cm and 40 90 cm depth d 3 50 cm respectively and d for the total depth 90 cm correspondingly daily subsurface fluxes ki are calculated by multiplying daily subsurface water fluxes f with daily mean concentrations ci of subsurface flows 4 k i f c i where i denote the index of pollutants i 1 for n and i 2 for p similarly surface fluxes of n and p are determined by multiplying r and associated concentration in addition we apply a monte carlo ensemble simulation to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimates of f and ki that stems from observations and model parameterization more details of estimation uncertainty can be found in supplementary text s1 2 3 2 development of simplified models for subsurface fluxes to simplify modeling approach for predicting subsurface fluxes of water n and p we used two forms of water budget components and concentrations the linear and product terms to account for their interplay this resulted in a total of 3 forms of independent variables eq 5 we used these variables in different combinations to linearly regress with daily subsurface fluxes of n or p based on the observations in 2017 to avoid over fitting we applied stepwise linear regression to capture the relationship between independent variables and subsurface fluxes at the jingzhou station and of the basic form 5 k i f f j c i f j c i where fj the subsurface water fluxes at time j ci the ponded water concentration of n i 1 and p i 2 the generated regression equations were statistically tested next based on the highly temporal resolution observations at jingzhou station we identified which functional form of eq 5 from different combinations fit the data best using the akaike information criterion aic which penalizes equations with more terms the subsurface fluxes of water n and p in 2018 were then used to validate the simplified models the predictive performance of the simplified models were measured using two quantitative statistics coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias bias when there are r2 0 8 and bias 20 the models were developed with satisfaction besides we further validate the models with the best functional representation by field studies from the literatures where in situ observations of subsurface fluxes of n or p and associated variables were applied under different environmental and management related conditions see supplementary table s2 we included in our search all published datasets from the web of science wos and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki three types of samples were excluded from the analysis gao et al 2016a b i observations with the duration not covering a whole rice growing season ii observations that included the use of such chemicals as nitrification inhibitors and iii observations conducted within laboratories greenhouses or pots this reduced dataset comprised 78 samples for water 25 samples for n 36 samples for p across the east asia table s2 missing values of precipitation or irrigations at a few sites were supplemented with data from the 0 1 degree china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd v0106 http data cma cn or from 1 km china agricultural irrigation dataset hou et al 2018 depending on its geographic coordinates respectively 2 4 comparison between subsurface and surface fluxes in addition to the quantification of subsurface fluxes we revealed their relative importance compared to surface runoff fluxes from paddy rice fields following three steps we first collected two types of samples in asia from the literatures 1 the observations where both subsurface and surface fluxes were simultaneously measured during rice growing season 2 the observations where surface runoff fluxes were only measured with the associated variables hou et al 2018 the detailed information of such samples can be found in table s2 in the next step we simulated subsurface fluxes of water n and p using the simplified models for the second type of samples the paired data of subsurface and surface fluxes were then largely extended from 97 samples synchronous observations to 279 samples both of observations and model simulations the combined datasets covered most of rice cropping areas in the east asia finally we compared the subsurface fluxes with surface fluxes of water n and p across the east asia moreover we applied regression analysis to further identify the driving factors e g total water inputs precipitation et clay content that dominate the relative importance of subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of subsurface fluxes temporal dynamics of the estimated subsurface fluxes at jingzhou station are displayed in fig 2 in 2017 subsurface water flux was 737 3 59 4 mm 1σ as standard deviation due to estimation uncertainty see text s1 which were 48 9 of total water inputs fig 2 specifically pre flooding accounted for 29 4 of subsurface water flux which was often ignored in previous studies darzi naftchali et al 2017 peng et al 2015 yoon et al 2006 after midseason drainage rice paddy fields experienced a substantial flux at a rate of 9 8 mm day 1 and contributed to 54 8 of the total subsurface flux of water however it was then limited to 3 2 mm day 1 10 8 of the total during the stage of physiological maturity similar results in 2018 were also illustrated in fig 2 except for the period of mid season drainage when rice paddy fields experienced higher subsurface fluxes of water 16 6 mm day 1 surprisingly subsurface water fluxes were estimated as negative values through water budget analysis indicating an intermittent groundwater recharge during the whole rice growing season taking the observations in 2017 for example correlation analysis shows that subsurface water fluxes were positively correlated with water input intensities e g r 0 61 n 58 p 0 001 fig s2a and negatively correlated with change in ponded water depth when no additional water were applied r 0 97 n 55 p 0 001 fig s2b in addition surface runoff flux were 177 8 mm 11 8 of total water input in 2017 and 199 mm 12 9 in 2018 accounting for only one quarter of subsurface fluxes the detailed observations of the other water budget components were provided in fig s1 subsurface flux of n was 40 1 8 9 kg n ha 1 for the whole rice growing season accounting for 13 1 of total n inputs the dynamics of subsurface n flux were similar with subsurface water fluxes with the correlation coefficient of 0 92 n 113 p 0 001 fig s3a subsurface n flux during the pre flooding period comprised 27 2 of the total while that in the 2nd flooding period comprised 65 1 fig 2b the subsurface flux of p was 4 4 0 1 kg p ha 1 or 10 8 of total p inputs subsurface flux of p was also positively correlated with subsurface water flux with a correlation coefficient of 0 94 n 113 p 0 001 fig s3a although subsurface fluxes of n and p in 2018 were 29 and 83 lower than those in 2017 they were also correlated well with subsurface water fluxes fig s3b by contrast surface runoff of n was observed to be low accounting for 4 1 and 1 5 of total n input in 2017 and 2018 respectively surface runoff of p were 2 6 0 3 kg p ha 1 in 2017 and 0 5 0 1 kg p ha 1 in 2018 which comprised 6 4 and 1 3 of total p inputs accordingly fig 2c 3 2 performance of the simplified models the optimal simplified models were finally found with r2 of 0 89 0 90 and 0 95 for water n and p respectively table 1 the values of bias were 0 5 16 and 19 accordingly the regression variables for subsurface water fluxes included water inputs change in ponded water depth equals zero when considering the whole rice season and surface runoff table 1 similarly subsurface fluxes of n and p were estimated by concentration of ponded water and subsurface water fluxes the evaluation results suggest that most of the variances of subsurface fluxes could be explained by the simplified models fig 3 a d and g the models were first validated by field observations in 2018 the modeled subsurface fluxes of water n and p were consistent with that of observations with r2 of 0 86 0 96 and bias of 9 2 20 table 1 and fig 3b e and h second the models were further validated by independent data from 49 stations across east asia results indicate that our models calibrated by the high frequency observations at jingzhou station were able to reproduce the accumulated subsurface fluxes of water n and p over rice growing season even if the stations had different hydroclimate conditions and management practices r2 0 97 for water 0 91 for n and 0 99 for p fig 3c f and i this simplified model was also validated by daily observations of subsurface fluxes of water and n in japan r2 0 88 for water 0 47 for n fig s5 these results provided an additional confidence on the predictive capabilities of the simplified models implying that such models could be applied to predict spatiotemporal patterns of subsurface fluxes 3 3 relative importance of subsurface to surface fluxes both of synchronous observations and model simulations suggested that subsurface fluxes were comparable with surface fluxes across the rice paddy fields in the east asia fig 4 a c for example subsurface fluxes were dominant pathways at 53 65 and 43 of stations for water n and p respectively i e ratio of subsurface flow to surface runoff fluxes 1 mainly located in subtropical and tropical regions fig 5 in addition the ratios of subsurface flow to surface runoff across east asia including the fluxes of water n and p responded to seasonal precipitation in an exponentially decreasing manner p 0 001 fig 4d f rather than total water inputs i e the sum of precipitation and irrigation fig 4g i these results revealed that precipitation controlled the relevant importance of subsurface and surface flow from rice paddy fields for n losses regions with seasonal precipitation of 500 mm such as japan central and north china should pay more attention to subsurface n fluxes when estimating the environmental risks of rice paddy fields conversely the risks from surface runoff may be more important for regions with seasonal precipitation 500 mm e g south china similarly for p losses subsurface fluxes becomes the dominant pathway to waterbodies when precipitation is less than 300 mm per growing season it should be noted that we are cautious regarding to the robustness of this results for p given the fact that the combined datasets were still limited and the stations were not widely distributed across east asia fig s4 4 discussion the simplified models extended previous field scale evidences from limited sites to a regional biogeochemical paradigm the combined datasets pointed out that subsurface fluxes of n and p were comparable to those of surface runoff fluxes roughly across a half of east asia s sites fig 5 unfortunately previous measurements typically underrated subsurface fluxes of n and p leon and kohyama 2017 loeve et al 2004 mainly due to inappropriate procedures of subsurface flux measurements at field scale and limited capability of modeling approaches at regional scale 4 1 implication for subsurface flux measurements firstly subsurface fluxes were in general ignored to measure in the period of pre flooding when substantial irrigation is required to facilitate plowing and puddling bouman et al 2007 in fact pre flooding is prevalent in china especially for paddy rice rotated with upland crops although no fertilizers were applied during this period residual n and p from previous upland cropping season mainly in the form of nitrate zhou et al 2016 and phosphate hernandez ramirez et al 2011 nemery et al 2005 are readily infiltrated through the irrigation activity secondly the inadequate sampling frequency for n or p concentrations of subsurface flows were identified as a critical source of uncertainty fig s5 with some exceptions zhao et al 2009 most available field scale studies collected water samples at weekly or biweekly interval darzi naftchali et al 2017 jha et al 2017 yang et al 2015 our scenario based simulations however revealed that low sampling frequency amplified the estimation uncertainties that is twice per week sampling resulted in a relative difference ranging from 7 0 to 12 2 and such ranges were enlarged to 16 1 37 6 along with the decline of sampling frequency from twice per week to once per bi week in 2017 fig s5d one of methods for reducing this uncertainty is to improve the sampling procedures of the key budget components with advanced equipment for example changes in ponded water depth the most important source of uncertainty for subsurface water fluxes fig s5 can be automatically measured by ultrasonic sensors with the measurement accuracy of less than 1 mm the method to improve the accuracy of et estimation is to use the direct observations based on energy balance approach 4 2 implication for model improvement in addition to high frequency flux measurements modeling approach is one of effective tools to estimate the high resolution dynamics of subsurface fluxes of water n and p from rice paddy fields here our results provide new insights to help understand the behaviors of subsurface flows in rice paddy fields most of process based models were carried out using the constant ponded water depth li et al 2015 xu et al 2013 which potentially introduces an additional bias particular for the high resolution estimation of subsurface fluxes of water improvement of irrigation scheme should be prioritized for modeling subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields previous process based models set up irrigation scheme mainly based on the crop demands and water availability dash et al 2015 simunek et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 xu et al 2013 rather than the management oriented requirements taking the jingzhou station for example one third of irrigation amounts are applied in the period before rice transplantation to the fields in 2017 without water demands for rice growth additional irrigation are also required to lower the temperature to maintain the rice yield kogel knabner et al 2010 lobell et al 2008 peng et al 2004 importantly intermittent irrigation dominated the subsurface fluxes during these two periods updating irrigation scheme of model therefore would help accurately simulate ponded water depth and thereby the dynamics of subsurface fluxes from rice paddy fields to further confirm the contribution of subsurface fluxes eventually to the surrounding waterbodies n and p attenuations within soil profile should be conducted in future 4 3 policy implication to n and p loss mitigation although the government of china has issued regulatory policies for cleaner surface waters e g the water pollution control action plan issued in 2015 most of efforts related to agricultural nonpoint sources were made to mitigate surface runoff of n and p local administrators still face challenges in coordinating the reductions of surface runoff and subsurface flows given limited financial resources here our results indicated precipitation as dominant factor in determining the relevant importance of subsurface fluxes and surface runoff such spatial discrepancies in dominant pathways of nutrient losses can be explained by the differences in their generation mechanisms in rice paddy fields intermittent surface runoff is driven by heavy rainfall or active drainage li et al 2018 rather than irrigation events that are only applied to keep the ponded water depth sufficient for rice growth e g 5 cm at jingzhou station however subsurface flows occur continuously and steady that are driven by either rainfall or irrigation events in the light of these regional differences we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for mitigating nutrient losses from rice paddy fields would be beneficial for the future water quality improvements in the surrounding waterbodies to reduce the risks of water pollution intensive irrigation should be reduced by using advanced water saving technologies e g the ground cover rice production system yao et al 2018 and the alternate wetting and drying approach that applies irrigation only when water table larger than 15 cm hou et al 2012 linquist et al 2015 moreover pre flooding that contributes to more than 30 of subsurface fluxes of n and p needs to be optimized to decrease the infiltration of residual n and p from the former cropping season one of effective approaches is to apply direct seedling approach for which pre flooding is not required farooq et al 2009 liang et al 2016 in addition splitting application of fertilizers effectively reduces n and p infiltration rates comparing to single application peng et al 2011 the use of polymer coated controlled release fertilizers can effectively decrease the n and p concentrations of soil water and thereby the risk of infiltration li et al 2018 4 4 summary and future works in summary to our knowledge this study is the first to spatially assess the importance of subsurface fluxes relative to surface runoff from rice paddy fields at the regional scale results revealed the subsurface fluxes of water n and p were comparable with surface runoff across east asia their relevant importance was primarily controlled by the magnitude of seasonal precipitation subsurface fluxes were the dominant pathway of nutrient losses in drier rice cropping areas 500 mm season 1 for n and 300 mm season 1 for p while surface runoff was the more important process in wetter areas although some general goals have been achieved there are a few challenges that should be addressed in the future the first challenge is to separate water samples generated from infiltration seepage and groundwater recharge which are different processes but mixed together when collecting samples beneath the rooting zone it therefore remains difficult to clarify whether n or p concentrations in water samples represent the actual levels of the mixture of three budget components for fields located at low terrain infiltration and recharging may occur simultaneously and frequently within a day due to the landscape interactions nutrient concentration of subsurface fluxes are in a dynamic equilibrium among ponded water soil water and groundwater whether the concentration of obtained water samples is representative for a day is still open to question accordingly improving sampling procedures should be the priority for quantifying subsurface fluxes second our simplified models showed well agreements with the subsurface fluxes of n and p observed over the whole growing season and model performance for daily or weekly intervals should be further validated using more observations at larger spatial extent lastly in contrast with n the extended dataset of surface and subsurface fluxes of p was still rare and further work is needed to confirm the drivers identified in this study to do so widespread observations or manipulation experiments needs to be carried out in the future acknowledgment the authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interest this study was supported by the

11208,a saline sodic wasteland of takyric solonetz is widely distributed across arid regions of northwest china the poor soil structure and low permeability ks 0 1 mm d 1 hinder reclamation because the excessive sodium salt occurring mainly in the surface soil layer cannot be leached down by conventional leaching methods including drip irrigation without any assistance measure the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize salt movement that occurs within the planted ridge due to drip irrigation of varying amounts and 2 to identify the optimum soil matric potential smp threshold for drip irrigation in order for wolfberry lycium barbarum l to be successfully produced based on plant survival and productivity a three year field experiment was conducted with wolfberry using drip irrigation on this solonetz soil the soil was improved by creating shallow sand filled niches beneath drip emitters five smp levels triggered irrigations of 5 mm 5 kpa s1 10 kpa s2 15 kpa s3 20 kpa s4 and 25 kpa s5 the improved drip irrigation system significantly facilitated soil water infiltration and redistributed soil salt in the planted ridge the leached salt accumulated increasingly at the surface layers of the ridge slope and furrow irrigating at higher threshold smp resulted in lower soil salinity in the root zone crop evapotranspiration et was affected by different drip regimes and

irrigation has been used widely to reclaim salt affected soils burt and isbell 2005 rajak et al 2006 however the long term success of drip irrigation also depends on choosing appropriate and practical

et al 2014 for example kang and wan 2005 found an smp of 35 kpa at a depth of 20 cm immediately under a drip emitter could be used as an effective threshold for drip irrigation scheduling of radish raphanus sativus l in the north china plain an smp of 10 kpa was used as an indicator for mulched drip irrigation scheduling of cotton gossypium hirsutum l on saline alkali soil in inland arid areas

studies were also reported for saline soil in humid north china coastal areas sun et al 2012 although drip irrigation based on smp has been used widely in reclaiming salt affected soils its supporting measures and amelioration effects varied greatly in various soils consequently drip irrigation should be managed according to the soil salinization type climatic factors and crop requirements darwish et al 2005 takyric solonetz is a highly saline sodic soil widely spread throughout arid regions of northwest china generally it does not have very high salinity except for the surface layer but it is always characterized by high alkalinity ph 9 5 high sodicity exchangeable sodium percentage 60 extremely poor soil structure and compacted soil layers bulk density 1 6 g cm 3 with the soil surface prone to crusting all of these soil properties of takyric solonetz result in a low soil hydraulic conductivity ks 0 1 mm d 1 wang et al 1993 zhang et al 2013 especially when irrigated with non saline water which could result in soil dispersion and clogging of soil pores quirk and schofield 1955 tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 basile et al 2012 this soil does not support any vegetation except some blue green algae growing in patches during the monsoon season many methods have failed to reclaim this saline sodic soil because of its impermeability wang et al 1993 in 2009 a field experiment was initiated to evaluate reclamation of takyric solonetz with drip irrigation by replacing soil beneath the drip emitters near the plants with sand the planted crop was wolfberry a celebrated perennial medicinal fruit crop in northwest china results from the field experiments showed that the sand filled niches beneath drip emitters improved infiltration and finally made reclamation possible expressed by the spatial distribution of soil salt and cations zhang et al 2013 2018 improvement in soil nutrient availability zhang et al 2017 and biological properties zhang et al 2014a b but the proper management and evaluation of drip irrigation requires a full understanding of salt movement patterns and crop water consumption which have however not been well understood in this solonetz the difficulty comes mainly from the strong variability of soil salinity both at temporal and spatial scales but a larger number of soil samples could overcome such variability problems to some extent and provide a more accurate salinity appraisal u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 as a salt tolerant plant wolfberry is a celebrated medicinal fruit crop in ningxia northwest china wolfberry and its peripheral products are the competitive industries for the local economy and the main income of native farmers wen et al 2018 in flora of china wu et al 2004 stated that wolfberry can grow well in saline soil with a salt content of 0 3 0 5 and in highly saline soil with salt content 0 5 the growth of wolfberry would be noticeably impeded wu et al 2004 this means that soil salt content of 0 5 is the salt tolerance threshold for wolfberry this value can be expressed as 8 9 ds m 1 in soil ece electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract according to the relationship between soil salt content s in percentage and ece in northwest china qi et al 2018 therefore the salt affected soil reclamation and irrigation management for wolfberry production will be of great importance for local economic and social development the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize salt movement that occurs within the planted ridge due to drip irrigation of varying amounts and 2 to identify the optimum smp threshold for drip irrigation in order for wolfberry to be successfully produced based on plant survival and productivity the findings will improve understanding of the salinity

experimental site the field experiment was conducted at xidatan agricultural comprehensive development experimental station 38 52 n 106 27 e 1095 m in pingluo county ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china takyric solonetz soil in china is typically found in this region wang et al 1993 iuss working group wrb 2014 the area has an arid continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 4 c a mean annual precipitation of 178 mm and a mean annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm the local soil environment is extremely infertile supporting almost no vegetation the water table is about 2 5 m and the mineral concentration of groundwater is 3 g l 1 little interannual variation exists in the water table and salinity of groundwater as groundwater did not participate in modern soil formation wang et al 1993 the arid climate and special geographical conditions of the region produce the high salinity and sodicity in the top layers of takyric solonetz for the 0 30 cm surface soil layer soil ece electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract phs ph of saturated paste and sar sodium adsorption ratio of saturated paste extract were 12 3 ds m 1 9 4 and 44 1 respectively table 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of takyric solonetz is very low usually 0 1 mm d 1 2 2 agronomic practices in april 2009 this takyric solonetz wasteland was reclaimed for planting wolfberry with ridge cultivation and drip irrigation the ridge had a height of 0 5 m a width of 1 m at the top and an inter ridge distance of 3 m fig 1 drip irrigation lines with emitters spaced 0 2 m apart flow rate of 0 76 l h 1 at an operating pressure of 0 03 mpa 0 3 kg cm 2 were placed in the center of each raised ridge after constructing the ridges semi ellipsoid pits ground surface diameter of 0 2 m and depth of 0 2 m were dug beneath the emitters and filled with sand fig 1 wolfberry seedlings cultivar ningqi no 1 were transplanted into the sand pits in the center of the ridges at 1 m intervals on 25 april 2009 following the transplanting operation the ridges were mulched with white polyethylene film 2 3 experimental treatments in order to determine the optimal drip irrigation regime for wolfberry grown on these modified ridges five water treatments based on smp measured with tensiometers located at a depth of 0 2 m beneath a drip emitter fig 1a were used to trigger irrigations these smp threshold values were 5 kpa s1 10 kpa s2 15 kpa s3 20 kpa s4 25 kpa s5 each of the five treatments was replicated three times resulting in 15 plots and laid out permanently in a completely randomized block design each 12 m 12 m plot consisted of four raised beds each treatment including three plots was installed with one drip irrigation system which mainly consisted of valves pressure gauges a flow meter a screen filter a fertilizer tank and 12 drip lines 4 lines plot on 26 april 2009 20 mm of water was applied in 3 days to reduce the soil salinity near the plant and to provide a favorable soil moisture condition to promote survival of the wolfberry seedlings thereafter all treatments were irrigated uniformly by maintaining the smp higher than about 10 kpa to ensure uniform survival and growth while the seedlings were getting established water treatments based on different smp threshold values were initiated on 28 august 2009 irrigation applications from this time forward had 5 mm of water applied each time the smp decreased to the designated threshold value as a perennial plant in northwest china wolfberry generally germinates in april and leaves fall in october therby defining the growing season and the irrigation application period in the following two years 10 mm of water was applied at the beginning of the growing season 20 april 2010 14 april 2011 respectively to leach the salts brought near the surface during winter because of the lack of irrigation and upward water movement as a consequence of the freeze thaw cycle and evaporation thereafter irrigation events of 5 mm were triggered by the designated threshold smp irrigation water table 2 was pumped from a reservoir supplied with water from the yellow river the irrigation details are given in fig 2 and table 3 urea phosphoric acid and potassium nitrate were dissolved and applied with the irrigation water the same amount of fertilizer was applied to all treatments table 3 similar to local high yield wolfberry fields field management mainly included regular pruning trimming weeding and application of pesticides to control insects 2 4 soil sampling and analysis all treatments were sampled at the beginning and the end of each growing season 25 april and 28 october in 2009 13 april and 18 october in 2010 13 april and 16 october in 2011 respectively in addition treatments s1 s3 and s5 were also sampled at approximately 40 d intervals within growing seasons fig 2 sampling locations were close to but not within the sand filled niches at each location a hand auger 4 0 cm diameter with an extensible drill stem was used to collect soil samples at 10 cm intervals within the 0 40 cm layer and 20 cm intervals below 40 cm depth as shown in fig 1b and c a total of 62 soil samples were obtained in each transect and three replicate transects were sampled for each treatment fig 1b to avoid sampling the same locations at multiple times we marked the spots with labels after each sampling the soil water content was determined gravimetrically on the field moist subsamples after carefully removing the surface organic materials and fine roots soil volumetric water content was calculated by multiplying the gravimetric water content by real time soil bulk density the remaining soil subsamples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm sieve bao 2005 wang et al 2012 then the three replicates of soil samples were mixed to optimize the time consuming jobs of chemical analysis 2 4 1 soil salinity saturated soil paste was made for chemical analysis soil phs was measured with a ph meter phs 3c rex shanghai china then clear extracts of saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation 4000 rpm 30 min and analyzed for ece and ion concentrations the values of ece were measured with a conductivity meter dds 11 a rex shanghai china concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were measured by edta titration and na and k by flame photometry bao 2005 sar was calculated by molar concentration using the following formula 1 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 0 5 where a chemical element symbol indicates a concentration in mmolc l 1 2 4 2 crop evapotranspiration et in order to quantify the salt movement in soil transects a soil transect was divided into three zones root zone bare zone and deep zone fig 1 crop evapotranspiration et for treatments s1 s3 and s5 was calculated using the soil water balance equation as 2 e t δ s p i g r d where δs is the change soil water content in the profile mm p is the total precipitation mm i is the irrigation amount mm g is the capillary contribution from the ground water to the root zone mm r is the surface runoff mm d is the deep percolation mm see explanation below the δs was estimated by the space weighted mean method based on the soil samples above the 80 cm depth which is shown in fig 1b above the red dotted line in the root zone and bare zone it was therefore safe to ignore lateral seepage in soil water balance calculation in this study g and r were neglected due to the small amount of growing season rainfall and the groundwater table being more than a meter below the lowest soil measurement depth wang et al 1993 2 4 3 deep percolation soil water characteristic curve was measured using the high speed centrifuge method hitachi cr21 rotor no 60 the internal diameter and height of cutting rings were 5 cm we measured the root development in different years and found that plant roots basically grew in the 0 60 cm depth in the first and second years during the third year more than 99 of roots were found above 80 cm so the root zone in this study was considered to be 80 cm fig 1b and 80 cm was considered to be the depth at which water flowed out of the root zone the soil water fluxes q at 80 cm were determined using darcy s law 3 q k θ d φ d z 1 k θ φ 90 φ 70 z 90 z 70 1 where k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity φ70 is soil matric potential at 70 cm and φ90 is soil matric potential at 90 cm z70 70 cm z90 90 cm according to the previous studies on the saline sodic soils of northwest china wang et al 2012 the water potential at 70 and 90 cm was calculated using the characteristic curve of water content versus water potential at 70 90 cm depth for this soil 4 φ 1 4679 θ θ s 6 632 where φ is soil matric potential kpa and θ is soil water volumetric content cm3 cm 3 θs is the saturated water content 0 45 cm3 cm 3 obtained from actual measurement k θ for the 70 90 cm depth was calculated using the follow equation 5 k θ k s θ θ s m where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity at depth of 70 90 cm the ks was measured using the constant water head method with a markov bottle and found to be 11 mm d 1 which was much higher than the ks at the soil surface due to the occurrence of a higher percentage of sand at 70 90 cm table 1 the k θ was determined by intensive field observations after an irrigation event shao et al 2006 wang et al 2012 then the empirical coefficient m 9 4 was obtained by regression of eq 5 soil water fluxes were calculated using eqs 3 5 in the 70 90 cm depth a previous study showed that under ridge planting with drip irrigation deep percolation could be estimated from the water content data obtained at horizontal distances of 0 20 and 40 cm from the drip emitter wang et al 2012 therefore the spatial average soil water fluxes q were estimated using 6 q q 0 10 q 20 20 q 40 10 40 where q0 q20 and q40 are the soil water fluxes at 0 20 and 40 cm from the drip emitters during the three growing seasons the water content was measured four times in 2009 and five times in 2010 and 2011 so the total amount of deep percolation was calculated by 7 d 2009 i 1 2 3 t i q i q i 1 2 8 d 2010 2011 i 1 2 3 4 t i q i q i 1 2 where d is the total amount of deep percolation during the growing season and ti denotes the period between the two adjacent times for water sampling and q i and q i 1 are the spatial average soil water fluxes estimated using eq 6 at the sampling time of i or i 1 wang et al 2012 2 5 statistical analysis the average values of soil properties in each zone were calculated by spatial weighted mean taking soil ece in the root zone as an example the calculation formula is as follows 9 ec i j 0 10 20 30 40 k 10 20 30 40 60 ec i j k s j k j 0 10 20 30 40 k 10 20 30 40 60 s j k where ec i is the spatial weighted mean of soil salinity in root zone from the given transect i ec i j k is the ec of the soil sample from transect i j is the horizontal distance from drip emitter and k is the sampling depth s j k is the representative area of the soil sample analysis of variance anova was conducted and significance of differences among treatments was tested using the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 spss 11 5 statistical software spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and the figures were created using surfer 8 0 golden software inc co usa and sigmaplot 10 0 systat software inc ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water and salt movement taking treatment s3 15 kpa as an example the changes in spatial distribution of soil moisture and salinity ece in soil transects with sampling times are shown in figs 3 and 4 significant changes occurred in soil moisture distribution with time fig 3 indicating that the planting method combining drip irrigation with sand filled niches dramatically improved soil water infiltration performance of takyric solonetz before transplanting a relatively low but uniform soil moisture occurred in the soil profile due to the agronomic practices including deep plowing and ridge raising after transplanting the wetted areas beneath drip emitters expanded in both horizontal and vertical directions as the soil moisture front was pushed ahead with the application of 5 mm of water the soil wetting front did move to the depth of 80 cm beneath the drip emitter after transplanting in the first year during which a total of 284 mm of water sum of irrigation and precipitation was applied during the growing season and at the end of the second and third years the soil wetting front moved to the depth of 100 cm resulting from the 300 mm and 401 mm of water received in those two growing seasons respectively however soil moisture contents were always lower in the surface layer of the ridge slope and furrow fig 3 due to the intensive evaporation moisture movement governs salt redistribution after reclamation a desalted zone emerged gradually beneath the drip emitters and soil salts were prone to accumulate in the top layer of the ridge slope and furrow fig 4 this was the result of both lateral and vertical movement of the applied water from the drip emitter as well as the intense evaporation from the bare soil this finding was in accordance with the general observation that soil salts accumulate at the periphery of the wetted bulb under drip irrigation burt and isbell 2005 due to the low soil permeability only marginal changes of soil salinity occurred in the soil layers below 80 cm in sum this improved drip irrigation resulted in a significant redistribution of salts in the upper layers of the bed with salts tending to accumulate in the surface layers of the ridge slope and furrow it is clear from fig 4 that this salt redistribution trend was increasing with time the weighted means of soil salt content in different zones under different smp levels are shown in fig 5 where the temporal trend of soil salt movement during the three growing seasons is presented because of the smaller irrigation amount during the first growing season soil salinity in the root zone showed no significant changes during that time period under any of the smp treatments fig 5a soil salinity declined sharply at the beginning of the second growing season to an acceptable level ece around 5 ds m 1 under all treatments and then remained essentially constant through the remainder of the growing season among the various irrigation scheduling treatments s1 produced the lowest soil salinity in root zone the soil salt accumulation in ridge slope and furrow over the three years of the study was seen in the increasing mean soil ece in the bare zone fig 5b during the winters between growing seasons october to the next april soil salinity decreased slightly in the bare zone probably caused by the cessation of water application from the drip emitter and low evaporation rate in the winter soil salinity in the deep zone showed only a small increase over the three years of the study with most of that increase occurring in the third growing season soil ece changed from 2 6 ds m 1 before cultivation to mean values of 3 9 3 7 and 5 9 ds m 1 at the end of first second and third seasons respectively fig 5c soil salinity differences in the deep zone due to irrigation treatments were not significant in the first two seasons during the third season s1 had the greatest increase in salinity while s5 had the least this was probably because of the greater water application 405 mm with the s1 treatment than with the s5 treatment 190 mm table 3 mace and amerhein 2001 observed successful leaching reclamation of a sodic soil without amendments keren 1996 stated that reclamation under such conditions could only take place when soil profile drainage was good when leaching water was adequate and when a source of ca2 e g calcium carbonate was present as for this study there were two sources of ca2 the irrigation water and the dissolution of calcite present in the native soil zhang et al 2013 however drainage was not good enough to successfully leach soil salt down to deep layers below the wolfberry root zone because of the low permeability of the native soil and the low amount of drip irrigation applied in this study the 50 cm high ridges provided areas for salt accumulation in the top layers of the ridge slope and furrow figs 4 and 5 an additional analysis of the effects of different drip irrigation regimes on salt regulation is shown in fig 6 which gives the weighted mean soil ece in the root zone at the end of the three growing seasons irrigation with higher smp 5 10 and 15 kpa facilitated soil salt movement and resulted in lower soil salinity in the root zone at the end of the 2009 growing season fig 6a at the end of the 2010 growing season root zone soil salinity had decreased under all treatments this result could be explained by the greater irrigation and deep percolation amounts during 2010 table 4 at the end of the third growing season 2011 ece in the root zone continued to decline for the 5 kpa treatment but not for the other four treatments fig 6c of great importance for wolfberry root development and production is the finding that at the end of the third growing season the median values of ece in root zone for all irrigation treatments were at or below the salt tolerant threshold for wolfberry 8 9 ds m 1 and that variability in ece decreased with the increasing smp thresholds in addition to the increased soil water contact area and extended infiltration times that occur with the use of sand filled niches that we discussed in our previous studies zhang et al 2013 2017 another study also showed that the capillary barrier between coarse media sand filled niches and fine media native soil prevents salts from returning to the root zone berezniak et al 2017 this fact should also contribute partly to the low salinity environment in root zone 3 2 crop water consumption in the first growing season more of the water received as precipitation p and applied as irrigation i was stored in the soil values of δs ranging between 165 and 182 mm than was used in that year et accounted for less than 42 of the water applied as irrigation and received as precipitation and there were no significant differences in et due to irrigation treatments table 4 the low et during this first year was a result of the small perennial plants establishing themselves and requiring less water than larger established plants in the following two seasons crop et decreased as irrigation amounts decreased with the declining smp threshold for initiating irrigation this finding of reduced et when irrigating according to a lower smp threshold is similar to the results found with annual crops under drip irrigation but the et values observed in this study with the perennial wolfberry crop were lower than those reported for two annual crops kang and wan 2005 kang et al 2012 the amount of deep percolation declined as threshold smp decreased in the three growing seasons table 4 similar to the results reported by wang et al 2012 for an inland arid saline area of northwest china this finding implies that irrigating with a lower threshold smp could result in a reduction in deep percolation but since these deep percolation values in each season were less than 8 mm generally less than 3 of et it is safe to conclude that the percolation loss of applied water can be ignored when takyric solonetz is reclaimed with drip irrigation these low percolation values can be attributed to the low water amount applied by drip irrigation and the low permeability of the soil profile these deep percolation results are similar to those reported previously showing that drip irrigation distributed water uniformly while precisely controlling the amount of water applied thereby reducing evaporation and deep percolation batchelor et al 1996 ayars et al 1999 liu et al 2013 also stated that it was difficult for drip irrigation water to infiltrate to deep soil layers but rather permeates sideways and that different drip irrigation regimes strongly affected the distribution of soil water and salt in the root zone but had only a small impact on deep percolation the proportions of deep percolation to applied irrigation water d i were small i e 2 for all treatments in the first and third growing seasons and only slightly greater in the second season table 4 this is perhaps the reason for the lower salinity in root zone for all treatments in second season than in other seasons fig 6 i e more water passed down through the root zone the values of soil water change over the growing season δs in table 4 indicate greater soil water use less negative values for the s5 25 kpa smp irrigation threshold treatment than for the s1 and s3 treatments this is likely a result of the lower amount of irrigation water applied to the s5 treatment which stimulated the wolfberry plants to extract more stored soil water to meet et demand 3 3 crop growth and yield there were no significant effects of irrigation threshold smp treatment on wolfberry survival rate average 84 at the end of the establishment year 2009 or at the end of the second year average 81 table 5 however at the end of the third year the root zone soil salinity for the s5 25 kpa irrigation smp threshold treatment had risen to near the 8 9 ds m 1 wolfberry salt tolerance level and survival rate dropped to 72 7 survival rates at the end of the third year were not different for irrigation treatments s2 s3 and s4 where mean salinity had remained below the wolfberry salt tolerance level the significantly reduced survival rate of 56 8 observed for the s1 treatment at the end 2011 may be a result of decreased soil aeration due to the 405 mm of irrigation applied fruit yield likewise was not influenced by irrigation treatment during 2009 when plants were being established table 5 however in 2010 the effect of the reduced irrigation amounts that were a result of the increasingly negative smp used to trigger irrigation was clearly seen on wolfberry fruit yield fruit yield of 465 8 kg ha 1 was observed for the s1 treatment with 220 mm of irrigation applied compared with fruit yield of 395 1 kg ha 1 for the s5 treatment with 105 mm of irrigation applied in the third year of the study the lowest yields were obtained from the s1 treatment which had the most irrigation water applied but which suffered from lower plant survival as stated above the lower survival may have been related to soil aeration issues for the s2 s3 and s4 irrigation treatments yield was not significantly affected by the reduced irrigation amounts and averaged 879 4 kg ha 1 which was similar to yields obtained on local farms in the region yield for the s5 treatment was 809 5 kg ha 1 with 190 mm of applied irrigation which was 89 of the s2 yield 908 8 kg ha 1 with about 340 mm of irrigation water use efficiency was relatively low about 0 44 kg ha 1 mm 1 during 2009 when the wolfberry plants were being established water use efficiency increased in 2010 and increased further in 2011 as the wolfberry plants matured table 4 in both 2010 and 2011 water use efficiency increased as irrigation threshold smp decreased and amount of applied irrigation water decreased based on the yield and water use efficiency results a recommended drip irrigation strategy for wolfberry would be to irrigate when the smp falls to 20 kpa irrigating at this threshold would appear to keep soil salinity below the wolfberry salt tolerace level while providing sufficient water to maintain acceptable fruit yields 4 conclusions use of planting ridges in which highly impermeable takyric solonetz soil was replaced with sand in a small volume where wolfberry plants were transplanted in conjunction with drip irrigation with emitters placed in the sand plant area facilitated soil infiltration this system removed soil salt out of root zone although the salt in top soil layer could not be leached down to deeper layers because of the low permeability of the soil and the low irrigation amounts the ridged planting beds provided an area in the top layers of the ridge slope and the furrow for leached salt only a small increase in soil salinity was observed in the area below the root zone this salt redistribution trend increased over time the higher smp irrigation threshold facilitated soil salt movement and resulted in lower soil salinity in the root zone additionally the uniformity of soil salinity in root zone increased under higher smp crop et was affected by different drip regimes with a lower smp irrigation threshold resulting in reduced et we found that with this drip irrigation system used to reclaim a takyric solonetz percolation loss of applied water could be ignored after using this drip irrigation system for three years soil salinity in root zone under treatments of s1 s4 was reduced below 8 9 ds m 1 the salt tolerant threshold of wolfberry in sum for the impermeable solonetz we can maintain salt load below a dangerous level with a meager 5 mm water application using drip irrigation to permit wolfberry production considering wolfberry survival growth fruit yield and water use efficiency an smp irrigation threshold of 20 kpa was proposed to trigger drip irrigation acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

11208,a saline sodic wasteland of takyric solonetz is widely distributed across arid regions of northwest china the poor soil structure and low permeability ks 0 1 mm d 1 hinder reclamation because the excessive sodium salt occurring mainly in the surface soil layer cannot be leached down by conventional leaching methods including drip irrigation without any assistance measure the objectives of

drip irrigation in order for wolfberry lycium barbarum l to be successfully produced based on plant survival and productivity a three year field experiment was conducted with wolfberry using drip irrigation on this solonetz soil the soil was improved by creating shallow sand filled niches beneath drip emitters five smp levels triggered irrigations of 5 mm 5 kpa s1 10 kpa s2 15 kpa s3 20 kpa s4 and 25 kpa s5 the improved drip irrigation system significantly facilitated soil water infiltration and redistributed soil salt in the planted ridge the leached salt accumulated increasingly at the surface layers of the ridge slope and furrow irrigating at higher threshold smp resulted in lower soil salinity in the root zone crop evapotranspiration et was affected by different drip regimes and lower smp resulted in reduction in irrigation application amount and et deep percolation was always 8 mm during the three year study soil salinity in the root zone at the end of the study under the s1 s4 treatments decreased to 8 9 ds m 1 the salt tolerant threshold of wolfberry at the end of the study wolfberry survival rate and productivity were greatest for the s2 s4 treatments these results and the greater water use efficiency found with the s3 and s4 treatments suggest using an smp threshold of 20 kpa to trigger drip irrigation for wolfberry production on this impermeable saline sodic soil keywords drip irrigation salt characteristic salt regulation solonetz water consumption 1 introduction drip irrigation allows for precise application of water and nutrients resulting in adequate soil water nutrients and aeration in the root zone hanson et al 2006 by moving excess salt out of root zone drip irrigation could result in a low salinity environment for crop growth drip irrigation is likely to result in little of the negative impact on soil structure that is seen with flood irrigation e g soil compaction problems due to the frequent alternation of wet and dry conditions so drip irrigation has been used widely to reclaim salt affected soils burt and isbell 2005 rajak et al 2006 however the long term success of drip irrigation also depends on choosing appropriate and practical management strategies dastranj et al 2018 and improper drip irrigation regimes can result in many problems especially for the ecologically vulnerable regions characterized by high soil salinity

conducted that focused on the use of smp to trigger drip irrigation for crops grown on various salt affected soils tan and kang 2009 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2011 wan et al 2012 sun et al 2012 wang et al 2014 for example kang and wan 2005 found an smp of 35 kpa at a depth of 20 cm immediately under a drip emitter could be used as an effective threshold for drip irrigation scheduling of radish raphanus sativus l in the north china plain an smp of 10 kpa was used as an indicator for mulched drip irrigation scheduling of cotton gossypium hirsutum l on saline alkali soil in inland arid areas of northwest china wang et al 2012 2014 and the soil water movement in the unsaturated zone was also studied when maintaining the smp above 10 kpa and 20 kpa han and zhou 2018 an smp of 15 kpa was found to be an effective value for initiating drip irrigation for puccinellia tenuiflora grassland restoration on saline sodic soil in songnen plain northeast china liu et al 2012 results of similar studies were also reported for saline soil in humid north china coastal areas sun et al 2012 although drip irrigation based on smp has been used widely in reclaiming salt affected soils its supporting measures and amelioration effects varied greatly in various soils consequently drip irrigation should be managed according to the soil salinization type climatic factors and crop requirements darwish et al 2005 takyric solonetz is a highly saline sodic soil widely spread throughout arid regions of northwest china generally it does not have very high salinity except for the surface layer but it is always characterized by high alkalinity ph 9 5 high sodicity exchangeable sodium percentage 60 extremely poor soil structure and compacted soil layers bulk density 1 6 g cm 3 with the soil surface prone to crusting all of these soil properties of takyric solonetz result in a low soil hydraulic conductivity ks 0 1 mm d 1 wang et al 1993 zhang et al 2013 especially when irrigated with non saline water which could result in soil dispersion and clogging of soil pores quirk and schofield 1955 tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 basile et al 2012 this soil does not support any vegetation except some blue green algae growing in patches during the monsoon season many methods have failed to reclaim this saline sodic soil because of its impermeability wang et al 1993 in 2009 a field experiment was initiated to evaluate reclamation of takyric solonetz with drip irrigation by replacing soil beneath the drip emitters near the plants with sand the planted crop was wolfberry a celebrated perennial medicinal fruit crop in northwest china results from the field experiments showed that the sand filled niches beneath drip emitters improved infiltration and finally made reclamation possible expressed by the spatial distribution of soil salt and cations zhang et al 2013 2018 improvement in soil nutrient availability zhang et al 2017 and biological properties zhang et al 2014a b but the proper management and evaluation of drip irrigation requires a full understanding of salt movement patterns and crop water consumption which have however not been well understood in this solonetz the difficulty comes mainly from the strong variability of soil salinity both at temporal and spatial scales but a larger number of soil samples could overcome such variability problems to some extent and provide a more accurate salinity appraisal u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 as a salt tolerant plant wolfberry is a celebrated medicinal fruit crop in ningxia northwest china wolfberry and its peripheral products are the competitive industries for the local economy and the main income of native farmers wen et al 2018 in flora of china wu et al 2004 stated that wolfberry can grow well in saline soil with a salt content of 0 3 0 5 and in highly saline soil with salt content 0 5 the growth of wolfberry would be noticeably impeded wu et al 2004 this means that soil salt content of 0 5 is the salt tolerance threshold for wolfberry this value can be expressed as 8 9 ds m 1 in soil ece electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract according to the relationship between soil salt content s in percentage and ece in northwest china qi et al 2018 therefore the salt affected soil reclamation and irrigation management for wolfberry production will be of great importance for local economic and social development the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize salt movement that occurs within the planted ridge due to drip irrigation of varying amounts and 2 to identify the optimum smp threshold for drip irrigation in order for wolfberry to be successfully produced based on plant survival and productivity the findings will improve understanding of the salinity amelioration mechanism to evaluate the sustainability of agronomic measures and to propose a feasible alternative for reclamation of sodic land with poor permeability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at xidatan agricultural comprehensive development experimental station 38 52 n 106 27 e 1095 m in pingluo county ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china takyric solonetz soil in china is typically found in this region wang et al 1993 iuss working group wrb 2014 the area has an arid continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 4 c a mean annual precipitation of 178 mm and a mean annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm the local soil environment is extremely infertile supporting almost no vegetation the water table is about 2 5 m and the mineral concentration of groundwater is 3 g l 1 little interannual variation exists in the water table and salinity of groundwater as groundwater did not participate in modern soil formation wang et al 1993 the arid climate and special geographical conditions of the region produce the high salinity and sodicity in the top layers of takyric solonetz for the 0 30 cm surface soil layer soil ece electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract phs ph of saturated paste and sar sodium adsorption ratio of saturated paste extract were 12 3 ds m 1 9 4 and 44 1 respectively table 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of takyric solonetz is very low usually 0 1 mm d 1 2 2 agronomic practices in april 2009 this takyric solonetz wasteland was reclaimed for planting wolfberry with ridge cultivation and drip irrigation the ridge had a height of 0 5 m a width of 1 m at the top and an inter ridge distance of 3 m fig 1 drip irrigation lines with emitters spaced 0 2 m apart flow rate of 0 76 l h 1 at an operating pressure of 0 03 mpa 0 3 kg cm 2 were placed in the center of each raised ridge after constructing the ridges semi ellipsoid pits ground surface diameter of 0 2 m and depth of 0 2 m were dug beneath the emitters and filled with sand fig 1 wolfberry seedlings cultivar ningqi no 1 were transplanted into the sand pits in the center of the ridges at 1 m intervals on 25 april 2009 following the transplanting operation the ridges were mulched with white polyethylene film 2 3 experimental treatments in order to determine the optimal drip irrigation regime for wolfberry grown on these modified ridges five water treatments based on smp measured with tensiometers located at a depth of 0 2 m beneath a drip emitter fig 1a were used to trigger irrigations these smp threshold values were 5 kpa s1 10 kpa s2 15 kpa s3 20 kpa s4 25 kpa s5 each of the five treatments was replicated three times resulting in 15 plots and laid out permanently in a completely randomized block design each 12 m 12 m plot consisted of four raised beds each treatment including three plots was installed with one drip irrigation system which mainly consisted of valves pressure gauges a flow meter a screen filter a fertilizer tank and 12 drip lines 4 lines plot on 26 april 2009 20 mm of water was applied in 3 days to reduce the soil salinity near the plant and to provide a favorable soil moisture condition to promote survival of the wolfberry seedlings thereafter all treatments were irrigated uniformly by maintaining the smp higher than about 10 kpa to ensure uniform survival and growth while the seedlings were getting established water treatments based on different smp threshold values were initiated on 28 august 2009 irrigation applications from this time forward had 5 mm of water applied each time the smp decreased to the designated threshold value as a perennial plant in northwest china wolfberry generally germinates in april and leaves fall in october therby defining the growing season and the irrigation application period in the following two years 10 mm of water was applied at the beginning of the growing season 20 april 2010 14 april 2011 respectively to leach the salts brought near the surface during winter because of the lack of irrigation and upward water movement as a consequence of the freeze thaw cycle and evaporation thereafter irrigation events of 5 mm were triggered by the designated threshold smp irrigation water table 2 was pumped from a reservoir supplied with water from the yellow river the irrigation details are given in fig 2 and table 3 urea phosphoric acid and potassium nitrate were dissolved and applied with the irrigation water the same amount of fertilizer was applied to all treatments table 3 similar to local high yield wolfberry fields field management mainly included regular pruning trimming weeding and application of pesticides to control insects 2 4 soil sampling and analysis all treatments were sampled at the beginning and the end of each growing season 25 april and 28 october in 2009 13 april and 18 october in 2010 13 april and 16 october in 2011 respectively in addition treatments s1 s3 and s5 were also sampled at approximately 40 d intervals within growing seasons fig 2 sampling locations were close to but not within the sand filled niches at each location a hand auger 4 0 cm diameter with an extensible drill stem was used to collect soil samples at 10 cm intervals within the 0 40 cm layer and 20 cm intervals below 40 cm depth as shown in fig 1b and c a total of 62 soil samples were obtained in each transect and three replicate transects were sampled for each treatment fig 1b to avoid sampling the same locations at multiple times we marked the spots with labels after each sampling the soil water content was determined gravimetrically on the field moist subsamples after carefully removing the surface organic materials and fine roots soil volumetric water content was calculated by multiplying the gravimetric water content by real time soil bulk density the remaining soil subsamples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm sieve bao 2005 wang et al 2012 then the three replicates of soil samples were mixed to optimize the time consuming jobs of chemical analysis 2 4 1 soil salinity saturated soil paste was made for chemical analysis soil phs was measured with a ph meter phs 3c rex shanghai china then clear extracts of saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation 4000 rpm 30 min and analyzed for ece and ion concentrations the values of ece were measured with a conductivity meter dds 11 a rex shanghai china concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were measured by edta titration and na and k by flame photometry bao 2005 sar was calculated by molar concentration using the following formula 1 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 0 5 where a chemical element symbol indicates a concentration in mmolc l 1 2 4 2 crop evapotranspiration et in order to quantify the salt movement in soil transects a soil transect was divided into three zones root zone bare zone and deep zone fig 1 crop evapotranspiration et for treatments s1 s3 and s5 was calculated using the soil water balance equation as 2 e t δ s p i g r d where δs is the change soil water content in the profile mm p is the total precipitation mm i is the irrigation amount mm g is the capillary contribution from the ground water to the root zone mm r is the surface runoff mm d is the deep percolation mm see explanation below the δs was estimated by the space weighted mean method based on the soil samples above the 80 cm depth which is shown in fig 1b above the red dotted line in the root zone and bare zone it was therefore safe to ignore lateral seepage in soil water balance calculation in this study g and r were neglected due to the small amount of growing season rainfall and the groundwater table being more than a meter below the lowest soil measurement depth wang et al 1993 2 4 3 deep percolation soil water characteristic curve was measured using the high speed centrifuge method hitachi cr21 rotor no 60 the internal diameter and height of cutting rings were 5 cm we measured the root development in different years and found that plant roots basically grew in the 0 60 cm depth in the first and second years during the third year more than 99 of roots were found above 80 cm so the root zone in this study was considered to be 80 cm fig 1b and 80 cm was considered to be the depth at which water flowed out of the root zone the soil water fluxes q at 80 cm were determined using darcy s law 3 q k θ d φ d z 1 k θ φ 90 φ 70 z 90 z 70 1 where k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity φ70 is soil matric potential at 70 cm and φ90 is soil matric potential at 90 cm z70 70 cm z90 90 cm according to the previous studies on the saline sodic soils of northwest china wang et al 2012 the water potential at 70 and 90 cm was calculated using the characteristic curve of water content versus water potential at 70 90 cm depth for this soil 4 φ 1 4679 θ θ s 6 632 where φ is soil matric potential kpa and θ is soil water volumetric content cm3 cm 3 θs is the saturated water content 0 45 cm3 cm 3 obtained from actual measurement k θ for the 70 90 cm depth was calculated using the follow equation 5 k θ k s θ θ s m where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity at depth of 70 90 cm the ks was measured using the constant water head method with a markov bottle and found to be 11 mm d 1 which was much higher than the ks at the soil surface due to the occurrence of a higher percentage of sand at 70 90 cm table 1 the k θ was determined by intensive field observations after an irrigation event shao et al 2006 wang et al 2012 then the empirical coefficient m 9 4 was obtained by regression of eq 5 soil water fluxes were calculated using eqs 3 5 in the 70 90 cm depth a previous study showed that under ridge planting with drip irrigation deep percolation could be estimated from the water content data obtained at horizontal distances of 0 20 and 40 cm from the drip emitter wang et al 2012 therefore the spatial average soil water fluxes q were estimated using 6 q q 0 10 q 20 20 q 40 10 40 where q0 q20 and q40 are the soil water fluxes at 0 20 and 40 cm from the drip emitters during the three growing seasons the water content was measured four times in 2009 and five times in 2010 and 2011 so the total amount of deep percolation was calculated by 7 d 2009 i 1 2 3 t i q i q i 1 2 8 d 2010 2011 i 1 2 3 4 t i q i q i 1 2 where d is the total amount of deep percolation during the growing season and ti denotes the period between the two adjacent times for water sampling and q i and q i 1 are the spatial average soil water fluxes estimated using eq 6 at the sampling time of i or i 1 wang et al 2012 2 5 statistical analysis the average values of soil properties in each zone were calculated by spatial weighted mean taking soil ece in the root zone as an example the calculation formula is as follows 9 ec i j 0 10 20 30 40 k 10 20 30 40 60 ec i j k s j k j 0 10 20 30 40 k 10 20 30 40 60 s j k where ec i is the spatial weighted mean of soil salinity in root zone from the given transect i ec i j k is the ec of the soil sample from transect i j is the horizontal distance from drip emitter and k is the sampling depth s j k is the representative area of the soil sample analysis of variance anova was conducted and significance of differences among treatments was tested using the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 spss 11 5 statistical software spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and the figures were created using surfer 8 0 golden software inc co usa and sigmaplot 10 0 systat software inc ca usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water and salt movement taking treatment s3 15 kpa as an example the changes in spatial distribution of soil moisture and salinity ece in soil transects with sampling times are shown in figs 3 and 4 significant changes occurred in soil moisture distribution with time fig 3 indicating that the planting method combining drip irrigation with sand filled niches dramatically improved soil water infiltration performance of takyric solonetz before transplanting a relatively low but uniform soil moisture occurred in the soil profile due to the agronomic practices including deep plowing and ridge raising after transplanting the wetted areas beneath drip emitters expanded in both horizontal and vertical directions as the soil moisture front was pushed ahead with the application of 5 mm of water the soil wetting front did move to the depth of 80 cm beneath the drip emitter after transplanting in the first year during which a total of 284 mm of water sum of irrigation and precipitation was applied during the growing season and at the end of the second and third years the soil wetting front moved to the depth of 100 cm resulting from the 300 mm and 401 mm of water received in those two growing seasons respectively however soil moisture contents were always lower in the surface layer of the ridge slope and furrow fig 3 due to the intensive evaporation moisture movement governs salt redistribution after reclamation a desalted zone emerged gradually beneath the drip emitters and soil salts were prone to accumulate in the top layer of the ridge slope and furrow fig 4 this was the result of both lateral and vertical movement of the applied water from the drip emitter as well as the intense evaporation from the bare soil this finding was in accordance with the general observation that soil salts accumulate at the periphery of the wetted bulb under drip irrigation burt and isbell 2005 due to the low soil permeability only marginal changes of soil salinity occurred in the soil layers below 80 cm in sum this improved drip irrigation resulted in a significant redistribution of salts in the upper layers of the bed with salts tending to accumulate in the surface layers of the ridge slope and furrow it is clear from fig 4 that this salt redistribution trend was increasing with time the weighted means of soil salt content in different zones under different smp levels are shown in fig 5 where the temporal trend of soil salt movement during the three growing seasons is presented because of the smaller irrigation amount during the first growing season soil salinity in the root zone showed no significant changes during that time period under any of the smp treatments fig 5a soil salinity declined sharply at the beginning of the second growing season to an acceptable level ece around 5 ds m 1 under all treatments and then remained essentially constant through the remainder of the growing season among the various irrigation scheduling treatments s1 produced the lowest soil salinity in root zone the soil salt accumulation in ridge slope and furrow over the three years of the study was seen in the increasing mean soil ece in the bare zone fig 5b during the winters between growing seasons october to the next april soil salinity decreased slightly in the bare zone probably caused by the cessation of water application from the drip emitter and low evaporation rate in the winter soil salinity in the deep zone showed only a small increase over the three years of the study with most of that increase occurring in the third growing season soil ece changed from 2 6 ds m 1 before cultivation to mean values of 3 9 3 7 and 5 9 ds m 1 at the end of first second and third seasons respectively fig 5c soil salinity differences in the deep zone due to irrigation treatments were not significant in the first two seasons during the third season s1 had the greatest increase in salinity while s5 had the least this was probably because of the greater water application 405 mm with the s1 treatment than with the s5 treatment 190 mm table 3 mace and amerhein 2001 observed successful leaching reclamation of a sodic soil without amendments keren 1996 stated that reclamation under such conditions could only take place when soil profile drainage was good when leaching water was adequate and when a source of ca2 e g calcium carbonate was present as for this study there were two sources of ca2 the irrigation water and the dissolution of calcite present in the native soil zhang et al 2013 however drainage was not good enough to successfully leach soil salt down to deep layers below the wolfberry root zone because of the low permeability of the native soil and the low amount of drip irrigation applied in this study the 50 cm high ridges provided areas for salt accumulation in the top layers of the ridge slope and furrow figs 4 and 5 an additional analysis of the effects of different drip irrigation regimes on salt regulation is shown in fig 6 which gives the weighted mean soil ece in the root zone at the end of the three growing seasons irrigation with higher smp 5 10 and 15 kpa facilitated soil salt movement and resulted in lower soil salinity in the root zone at the end of the 2009 growing season fig 6a at the end of the 2010 growing season root zone soil salinity had decreased under all treatments this result could be explained by the greater irrigation and deep percolation amounts during 2010 table 4 at the end of the third growing season 2011 ece in the root zone continued to decline for the 5 kpa treatment but not for the other four treatments fig 6c of great importance for wolfberry root development and production is the finding that at the end of the third growing season the median values of ece in root zone for all irrigation treatments were at or below the salt tolerant threshold for wolfberry 8 9 ds m 1 and that variability in ece decreased with the increasing smp thresholds in addition to the increased soil water contact area and extended infiltration times that occur with the use of sand filled niches that we discussed in our previous studies zhang et al 2013 2017 another study also showed that the capillary barrier between coarse media sand filled niches and fine media native soil prevents salts from returning to the root zone berezniak et al 2017 this fact should also contribute partly to the low salinity environment in root zone 3 2 crop water consumption in the first growing season more of the water received as precipitation p and applied as irrigation i was stored in the soil values of δs ranging between 165 and 182 mm than was used in that year et accounted for less than 42 of the water applied as irrigation and received as precipitation and there were no significant differences in et due to irrigation treatments table 4 the low et during this first year was a result of the small perennial plants establishing themselves and requiring less water than larger established plants in the following two seasons crop et decreased as irrigation amounts decreased with the declining smp threshold for initiating irrigation this finding of reduced et when irrigating according to a lower smp threshold is similar to the results found with annual crops under drip irrigation but the et values observed in this study with the perennial wolfberry crop were lower than those reported for two annual crops kang and wan 2005 kang et al 2012 the amount of deep percolation declined as threshold smp decreased in the three growing seasons table 4 similar to the results reported by wang et al 2012 for an inland arid saline area of northwest china this finding implies that irrigating with a lower threshold smp could result in a reduction in deep percolation but since these deep percolation values in each season were less than 8 mm generally less than 3 of et it is safe to conclude that the percolation loss of applied water can be ignored when takyric solonetz is reclaimed with drip irrigation these low percolation values can be attributed to the low water amount applied by drip irrigation and the low permeability of the soil profile these deep percolation results are similar to those reported previously showing that drip irrigation distributed water uniformly while precisely controlling the amount of water applied thereby reducing evaporation and deep percolation batchelor et al 1996 ayars et al 1999 liu et al 2013 also stated that it was difficult for drip irrigation water to infiltrate to deep soil layers but rather permeates sideways and that different drip irrigation regimes strongly affected the distribution of soil water and salt in the root zone but had only a small impact on deep percolation the proportions of deep percolation to applied irrigation water d i were small i e 2 for all treatments in the first and third growing seasons and only slightly greater in the second season table 4 this is perhaps the reason for the lower salinity in root zone for all treatments in second season than in other seasons fig 6 i e more water passed down through the root zone the values of soil water change over the growing season δs in table 4 indicate greater soil water use less negative values for the s5 25 kpa smp irrigation threshold treatment than for the s1 and s3 treatments this is likely a result of the lower amount of irrigation water applied to the s5 treatment which stimulated the wolfberry plants to extract more stored soil water to meet et demand 3 3 crop growth and yield there were no significant effects of irrigation threshold smp treatment on wolfberry survival rate average 84 at the end of the establishment year 2009 or at the end of the second year average 81 table 5 however at the end of the third year the root zone soil salinity for the s5 25 kpa irrigation smp threshold treatment had risen to near the 8 9 ds m 1 wolfberry salt tolerance level and survival rate dropped to 72 7 survival rates at the end of the third year were not different for irrigation treatments s2 s3 and s4 where mean salinity had remained below the wolfberry salt tolerance level the significantly reduced survival rate of 56 8 observed for the s1 treatment at the end 2011 may be a result of decreased soil aeration due to the 405 mm of irrigation applied fruit yield likewise was not influenced by irrigation treatment during 2009 when plants were being established table 5 however in 2010 the effect of the reduced irrigation amounts that were a result of the increasingly negative smp used to trigger irrigation was clearly seen on wolfberry fruit yield fruit yield of 465 8 kg ha 1 was observed for the s1 treatment with 220 mm of irrigation applied compared with fruit yield of 395 1 kg ha 1 for the s5 treatment with 105 mm of irrigation applied in the third year of the study the lowest yields were obtained from the s1 treatment which had the most irrigation water applied but which suffered from lower plant survival as stated above the lower survival may have been related to soil aeration issues for the s2 s3 and s4 irrigation treatments yield was not significantly affected by the reduced irrigation amounts and averaged 879 4 kg ha 1 which was similar to yields obtained on local farms in the region yield for the s5 treatment was 809 5 kg ha 1 with 190 mm of applied irrigation which was 89 of the s2 yield 908 8 kg ha 1 with about 340 mm of irrigation water use efficiency was relatively low about 0 44 kg ha 1 mm 1 during 2009 when the wolfberry plants were being established water use efficiency increased in 2010 and increased further in 2011 as the wolfberry plants matured table 4 in both 2010 and 2011 water use efficiency increased as irrigation threshold smp decreased and amount of applied irrigation water decreased based on the yield and water use efficiency results a recommended drip irrigation strategy for wolfberry would be to irrigate when the smp falls to 20 kpa irrigating at this threshold would appear to keep soil salinity below the wolfberry salt tolerace level while providing sufficient water to maintain acceptable fruit yields 4 conclusions use of planting ridges in which highly impermeable takyric solonetz soil was replaced with sand in a small volume where wolfberry plants were transplanted in conjunction with drip irrigation with emitters placed in the sand plant area facilitated soil infiltration this system removed soil salt out of root zone although the salt in top soil layer could not be leached down to deeper layers because of the low permeability of the soil and the low irrigation amounts the ridged planting beds provided an area in the top layers of the ridge slope and the furrow for leached salt only a small increase in soil salinity was observed in the area below the root zone this salt redistribution trend increased over time the higher smp irrigation threshold facilitated soil salt movement and resulted in lower soil salinity in the root zone additionally the uniformity of soil salinity in root zone increased under higher smp crop et was affected by different drip regimes with a lower smp irrigation threshold resulting in reduced et we found that with this drip irrigation system used to reclaim a takyric solonetz percolation loss of applied water could be ignored after using this drip irrigation system for three years soil salinity in root zone under treatments of s1 s4 was reduced below 8 9 ds m 1 the salt tolerant threshold of wolfberry in sum for the impermeable solonetz we can maintain salt load below a dangerous level with a meager 5 mm water application using drip irrigation to permit wolfberry production considering wolfberry survival growth fruit yield and water use efficiency an smp irrigation threshold of 20 kpa was proposed to trigger drip irrigation acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

11209,field experiment was conducted in the southern gully region of the loess plateau to study the effects of different mulching measures on spring maize yield and nitrate leaching in dryland under the traditional tillage conditions so as to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area the four treatments included non mulching ck plastic film mulching pm1 plastic film mulching in fallow pm2 and straw mulching jm after 13 years of continuous application the yield of spring maize the nitrogen uptake by plants and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured the results showed that the soil moisture content and water storage capacity of three kinds of soil mulching treatments were all higher than those of non mulching ones soil water storage in the range of 0 300 cm of jm pm1 and pm2 increased by 11 8 10 6 and 8 8 respectively compared with ck compared with ck the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize the yield enhancement effect of pm1 was the most significant with a yield of 11 314 42 kg ha and an increase of 26 72 in addition to the jm treatment the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen in the range of 0 300 cm of pm1 and pm2 was less than that of ck but the increase of nitrate nitrogen of 80 20 of jm treatment was in the range of 0 100 cm therefore in the rain fed agriculture in the south of loess plateau mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage improve crop growth the yield enhancement effect of plastic mulching film was the best pm1 pm2 could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile and the three mulching measures could slow the deep leaching of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent keywords spring maize straw mulching plastic film mulching nitrate nitrogen 1 introduction in china about 21 7 of the total area is located in the semi arid region where the annual precipitation is in the range of 250 550 mm and the crop water requirement is in the range of 300 600 mm li 2007 annual precipitation shows large variations from year to year and uneven distribution within seasons in general around 60 70 of rainfall is concentrated during the months of june september wang et al 2012 therefore in dryland farming systems water stress and nutrient deficiency are the two major constraints for primary production leading to low and unstable crop yields li et al 2009 sietz et al 2011 in the loess plateau straw mulching and plastic film mulching are two common mulching practices that are widely used in crop production particularly maize production lin et al 2016 many studies have confirmed that plastic film mulching can reduce water vapor transfer from the soil li et al 1999 2013 and increase soil temperature by reducing heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground wu et al 2016 studies have indicated that mulching is conducive to crop growth by improving the soil water content and soil temperature in dryland agriculture cook et al 2006 mulching also has the benefit of improving soil physical conditions including the protection of topsoil stability de silva and cook 2003 these changes in the soil environment are good for crop root growth and the stronger ability of roots which results in increased absorption of soil water and nutrients clark et al 2003 nitrogen is essential for plant growth and viability and high yielding crops such as maize zea mays l are frequently treated with large amounts of n fertilizer to reach optimal yields jia et al 2014 however a higher n fertilizer input usually leads to nitrate nitrogen residue in soil furthermore nitrate nitrogen residue can leach down into the deep soil or loss by other ways due to limited irrigation and precipitation nitrate leaching in cultivated lands of northwestern china has been underestimated or even ignored for many years yang et al 2015 therefore efforts to harvest more rainfall to increase soil water storage and the optimization of n management to achieve higher crop yield have always been considered key steps in the sustainable development of dryland agriculture he et al 2016 however the research on the transformation of soil nitrogen especially the leaching of nitrate nitrogen is rare under different mulching measures studies have shown that under the conditions of mulching and straw mulching inorganic nitrogen can accumulate on the surface of the soil because of the change of soil temperature and moisture it is bound to change the soil nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen leaching effects therefore this paper aimed at different plastic film mulching and straw mulching taking spring maize as the research object discussed the nitrate leaching in soil under different mulching measures in the south of loess plateau 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted at the changwu experimental station 35 12 n 107 40 e and altitude 1206 m on the loess plateau in changwu county of shaanxi province china the climate is temperate semi arid with a mean

171 frost free days the mean annual precipitation from 1990 to 2012 was 571 74 mm of which approximately 55 fell during the growing season between july and september the rainfall during the experimental period was measured using an automatic weather station changwu experimental station meteorological observatory ws std1 england at the experimental site according to the usda textural classification system the soil has a silty loam texture which is derived from loess with a deep and even soil profile the soil water content and wilting moisture in the 0 10 m loess section were 21 16 0 86 and 7 46 0 65 mass water content respectively and the soil bulk density was 1 23 1 44 g cm3 wang et al 2015 the precipitation and average temperature during the test in 2016 are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment started in 2003 with a total of four treatments the treatments were a control with non mulching ck plastic film mulching pm1 plastic film mulching in fallow pm2 and straw mulching jm the ck treatment was not mulched during the entire growth stage the pm1 treatment was mulched with plastic film before sowing the pm2 treatment was plastic film mulching in fallow clean the mulch before sowing without mulching during the growth period the jm treatment was that when the corn was harvested the whole straw harvested in this plot was mulched evenly and the straw was closed when the corn was sowed and placed between the lines each treatment was replicated three times in 35 m2 plots 7 m 5 m in a randomized complete block design the test crop is a ripe spring corn a year the selection of varieties is pioneer 335 a planting pattern of alternating wide 60 cm and narrow 35 cm row spacing was used for each treatment the spring corn was sown on april 23 2016 and harvested on september 20 the test plastic film used for the 60 cm wide 0 015 mm thick polyethylene film fertilizers n 150 kg ha and p2o5 75 kg ha were spread over the soil surface and incorporated into the 0 20 cm soil layer using a rotary cultivator before sowing 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 grain yield each plot harvested more than one third of the ear after air drying the collected samples were threshed and the grain was weighted sub samples approximately 100 g of the air dried grain were dried to a constant weight in a fan oven at 75 c to estimate the grain water

different mulching measures on soil moisture at harvest stage different mulching measures had different effects on the moisture content of soil profiles at the harvest stage of spring maize fig 2 compared with ck the soil water content in the range of 0 200 cm was higher than that in the ck treatment there was no significant difference in the soil moisture content in the range of 200 300 cm the distribution of soil moisture in different treatments was similar in the whole profile the soil moisture in the range of 0 60 cm was consumed by spring maize and the soil water content showed a decreasing trend the water content in the range of 60 120 cm increased gradually under 120 cm the soil water content began to decline and soil water content in the range of 200 300 cm did not change significantly it was indicated that spring maize mainly used the soil moisture within the range of 0 200 cm so that the soil moisture in this area was consumed greatly the water content of soil profile at the harvest stage was jm pm2 pm1 from top to bottom which was related to the different movement of soil moisture under the three treatments the surface of the pm1 was exposed during the fallow period which increased the loss of soil water the surface of the land was in the semi mulching state during the growth period and the rainfall in may to june in the test site was small and the plant had a large amount of water consumption therefore resulting in a large amount of water loss however in july and august when the rainfall increased the leaf area of spring maize plants increased blocking most of the rainfall so that the soil moisture of pm1 was not replenished jm treatment and pm2 treatment resulted in less water loss due to increased surface mulching during fallow period and increased rainfall infiltration during early spring maize growth period therefore the soil profile moisture content of pm1 treatment was lower than that of other mulching treatment the water storage in the harvest period ranged from 713 to 797 mm in the range of 0 300 cm and the amount of water storage in order of jm pm2 pm1 ck table 1 the water storage capacity of jm pm2 and pm1 treatments increased by 11 7 10 6 and 6 2 respectively as compared with ck treatment indicated that jm treatment had the strongest effect on soil water storage in addition the water storage capacity of three kinds of soil mulching treatments during harvest increased from shallow to deep while the storage capacity of 60 120 cm in ck treatment was lower than the storage capacity of 0 60 cm and the ck storage capacity were lower than the mulching treatments the above results showed that mulching the ground can effectively increase the water storage capacity of the soil during harvest stage while non mulching treatment will increase the loss of soil water and reduce the soil water storage capacity at harvest stage different letters in the same row indicated that the data difference was significant at the 0 05 level 3 2 profile distribution and accumulation of soil nitrate under different mulching measures nitrate nitrogen data at the soil profile at harvest showed that the plastic film mulching significantly reduced nitrate nitrogen content in the soil profile fig 3 the content of no3 n in pm2 decreased in the whole profile the content of no3 n in pm1 fluctuated in the whole profile and the peak appeared at 140 cm 7 63 mg kg ck had two accumulation peaks in the whole profile the first accumulation peak was at 60 cm the nitrate content was 42 36 mg kg the second accumulation peak was at 180 cm with nitrate content of 15 27 mg kg compared with ck treatment jm treatment showed that the nitrate nitrogen content in the range of 0 50 cm was much higher than that in ck treatment with a cumulative peak at 40 cm 63 01 mg kg from below 50 cm jm treatment nitrate nitrogen concentration has been declining and nitrate content below 120 cm below ck treatment in the same experiment the peak value of ck treatment increased from 30 9 mg kg to 42 36 mg kg compared with the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage in 2007 yang 2009 and a new cumulated peak was formed at 180 cm in 2007 the peak value of jm treatment was 60 cm the content of soil nitrate nitrogen was 30 9 mg kg and the same depth of nitrate nitrogen content was 31 95 mg kg in 2016 the peak of pm1 treatment varied from 5 8 mg kg at 60 cm to 140 cm at 7 63 mg kg according to the accumulations of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile in the range of 0 300 cm during the harvest period in 2016 table 2 the accumulations of nitrate nitrogen in different treatments were jm ck pm1 pm2 in descending order except for jm treatment the other three treatments were significantly less than the ck accumulation the cumulative amount of 100 200 cm within the three mulching treatments were lower than the ck treatment indicated that mulching cultivation on the surface can significantly reduce the soil profile in the soil range of 100 200 cm nitrate accumulation compared with the data from 2007 yang 2009 the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile 0 300 cm ck pm1 and jm increased by 123 47 kg ha 79 25 kg ha and 389 57 kg ha respectively the increment of nitrate content in 80 20 of jm treatment was in the range of 0 100 cm indicated that straw mulching could significantly increase the accumulation of nitrate in shallow soil based on the data of distribution of nitrate nitrogen in soil profiles at harvest stage fig 3 it can be concluded that all the mulching measures can effectively reduce the leaching and accumulation of nitrate in soil different letters in the same row indicated that the data difference was significant at the 0 05 level 3 3 yield and n uptake of spring maize under different mulching measures mulching significantly increased biomass and grain yield in spring maize compared to non mulching table 3 after harvesting in 2016 the aboveground biomass of all treatments were pm1 jm pm2 ck in descending order among them the biomass of pm1 and ck was significantly different p 0 05 the biomass of which was increased by 28 05 compared with that of ck the difference between jm and ck was not statistically significant but the biomass of jm increased by 11 13 compared with ck treatment the yield of pm1 was the most significant with the yield of 11 314 42 kg ha compared with ck the yield of pm1 increased by 26 72 the yields of jm and pm2 were not significantly different from those of ck but the yield of both treatments were higher than that of ck by 9 2 and 5 respectively the biomass and grain yield of pm1 were significantly higher than those of jm and pm2 p 0 05 values followed by different letters in a column are significantly different among the treatments at the 5 level the nhi indicates the efficiency with which the crop utilizes the acquired n for grain production compared with the control treatment the plant nitrogen uptake and the grain nitrogen uptake except the pm2 were all greater than those of the ck treatment indicated that the mulching cultivation of the spring maize increased the nitrogen uptake by the spring maize plants meanwhile each mulching nitrogen index were higher than the control treatment indicated a higher nitrogen content in the leaves and stems of the control treatment more nitrogen is used for vegetative growth and mulching treatment can make plants absorb nitrogen more transfer more to the grain for reproductive growth 4 discussion the main form of nitrogen in rainfed farmland soil is nitrate nitrogen and water is the carrier of nitrate nitrogen in soil as for the influence of different mulching measures on soil water content and water storage capacity different researchers carried out relevant experimental studies in different regions studies zhang et al 2007 zribi et al 2015 had shown that mulching can increase soil water content and water storage capacity by reducing ineffective evaporation and raising the soil s deeper water to the crop available layer than bare soil cultivation straw mulching also helps to reduce ineffective evaporation and improve soil moisture zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 tested the planting and harvesting of maize under different plastic film mulching in arid highland of northern weibei upland the results showed that different types of plastic mulching had the same influence on soil water content compared with the non mulching the surface water content and soil water storage capacity increased significantly li et al 2016 studied the spring maize in heyang shaanxi province the results showed that straw mulching provided greater water conservation in our experiment the average water content of 0 300 cm soil layer in the period of harvest with plastic mulching plastic film mulching in fallow and straw mulching increased by 6 24 10 6 11 76 compared with non mulching treatment respectively in three kinds of mulching treatment the straw mulching had the best effect the water storage capacity of 0 300 cm increased by 11 8 compared with the non mulching treatment mulching significantly increased the emergence rate of maize increased the dry matter accumulation aboveground and promoted the growth and development of ear improve corn production plastic film mulching was significantly increasing the maize yield in the loess plateau zhang et al 2007 2011 wang et al 2015 different effects of straw mulching on spring maize yield have been reported some studies had shown that the low temperature effect due to straw mulching in early spring maize leads to a decrease in yield zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 but wang et al 2011 showed that straw mulching increased by 45 67 compared with no mulching and film mulching increased by 47 24 in this experiment plastic film mulching treatment increased by 23 72 of the yield compared with the control treatment in addition to improving the soil moisture status and increasing the yield the mulching measures also have a great impact on the leaching and transformation of soil nitrate nitrogen the mulching prevented the direct vertical infiltration of precipitation from the surface of the soil and most of the water can only infiltrate the trench to enhance the lateral movement of water and then increase the upward movement of water on the plastic film ridge reducing the nitrate nitrogen to the deep migration zhang et al 2012 moreover studies have found that soil mulching significantly increased maize n uptake efficiency and utilization efficiency compared with the non mulching treatment and the grain yield and total n uptake increase may decrease the nitrate nitrogen residue in soil in our study the contents and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profiles with plastic film mulching and plastic film mulching in fallow were significantly reduced the accumulations of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profiles of three kinds of mulching treatments in the range of 100 200 cm were lower than those of the non mulching ones in addition the three mulching treatments effectively increased the nitrogen uptake and the nitrogen harvest index of spring maize which is consistent with the previous studies zhang et al 2009 found that the residual nitrate nitrogen in soil was significantly increased when the nitrogen application rate was higher than 150 kg ha with or without straw mulching 0 200 cm section obvious accumulation peak straw mulching soil residual nitrate accumulation peak than the non mulching depth of about 40 cm in our experiment the nitrogen application rate was 150 kg ha the soil nitrate nitrogen content and accumulation in the range of 0 50 cm with straw mulching were significantly higher than the non mulching treatment and the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the range of 0 100 cm with straw mulching was significantly greater than the other treatments while the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the range of 100 200 cm in straw mulching treatment was less than that in non mulching treatment the results showed that straw mulching could significantly increase nitrate nitrogen content in the soil surface but did not cause downward leaching some studies have shown that straw mulching can significantly increase the nitrate nitrogen content of soil surface promote the supply of nitrogen reduce the residual nitrate nitrogen and reduce the leaching loss wang et al 2014 he et al 2016 this is mainly due to the continuous application of higher c n ratio straw which greatly increased the amount of bio available carbon in the soil provided sufficient energy for the activities of soil heterotrophic microorganisms and greatly stimulated the mineralization of soil nitrogen role mary et al 1996 recous et al 1999 therefore in arid and semi arid areas maize mulching cultivation can effectively reduce soil nitrate nitrogen leaching and accumulation 5 conclusion 1 in rainfed agriculture in the south of loess plateau the mulching measures can effectively increase the soil water content and water storage capacity and improve the crop growth 2 plastic film mulching is the best way to increase yield of corn increased by 23 72 of the yield compared with the non mulching 3 plastic film mulching plastic film mulching in fallow can significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profile and the three mulching measures can slow the deep leaching of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent acknowledgments this research was supported by national key r d program of china 2016yfd0800105 
11209,field experiment was conducted in the southern gully region of the loess plateau to study the effects of different mulching measures on spring maize yield and nitrate leaching in dryland under the traditional tillage conditions so as to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area the four treatments included non mulching ck plastic film mulching pm1 plastic film mulching in fallow pm2 and straw mulching jm after 13 years of continuous application the yield of spring maize the nitrogen uptake by plants and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured the results showed that the soil moisture content and water storage capacity of three kinds of soil mulching treatments were all higher than those of non mulching ones soil water storage in the range of 0 300 cm of jm pm1 and pm2 increased by 11 8 10 6 and 8 8 respectively compared with ck compared with ck the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize the yield enhancement effect of pm1 was the most significant with a yield of 11 314 42 kg ha and an increase of 26 72 in addition to the jm treatment the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen in the range of 0 300 cm of pm1 and pm2 was less than that of ck but the increase of nitrate nitrogen of 80 20 of jm treatment was in the range of 0 100 cm therefore in the rain fed agriculture in the south of loess plateau mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage improve crop growth the yield enhancement effect of plastic mulching film was the best pm1 pm2 could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile and the three mulching measures could slow the deep leaching of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent keywords spring maize straw mulching plastic film mulching nitrate nitrogen 1 introduction in china about 21 7 of the total area is located in the semi arid region where the annual precipitation is in the range of 250 550 mm and the crop water requirement is in the range of 300 600 mm li 2007 annual precipitation shows large variations from year to year and uneven distribution within seasons in general around 60 70 of rainfall is concentrated during the months of june september wang et al 2012 therefore in dryland farming systems water stress and nutrient deficiency are the two major constraints for primary production leading to low and unstable crop yields li et al 2009 sietz et al 2011 in the loess plateau straw mulching and plastic film mulching are two common mulching practices that are widely used in crop production particularly maize production lin et al 2016 many studies have confirmed that plastic film mulching can reduce water vapor transfer from the soil li et al 1999 2013 and increase soil temperature by reducing heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground wu et al 2016 studies have indicated that mulching is conducive to crop growth by improving the soil water content and soil temperature in dryland agriculture cook et al 2006 mulching also has the benefit of improving soil physical conditions including the protection of topsoil stability de silva and cook 2003 these changes in the soil environment are good for crop root growth and the stronger ability of roots which results in increased absorption of soil water and nutrients clark et al 2003 nitrogen is essential for plant growth and viability and high yielding crops such as maize zea mays l are frequently treated with large amounts of n fertilizer to reach optimal yields jia et al 2014 however a higher n fertilizer input usually leads to nitrate nitrogen residue in soil furthermore nitrate nitrogen residue can leach down into the deep soil or loss by other ways due to limited irrigation and precipitation nitrate leaching in cultivated lands of northwestern china has been underestimated or even ignored for many years yang et al 2015 therefore efforts to harvest more rainfall to increase soil water storage and the optimization of n management to achieve higher crop yield have always been considered key steps in the sustainable development of dryland agriculture he et al 2016 however the research on the transformation of soil nitrogen especially the leaching of nitrate nitrogen is rare under different mulching measures studies have shown that under the conditions of mulching and straw mulching inorganic nitrogen can accumulate on the surface of the soil because of the change of soil temperature and moisture it is bound to change the soil nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen leaching effects therefore this paper aimed at different plastic film mulching and straw mulching taking spring maize as the research object discussed the nitrate leaching in soil under different mulching measures in the south of loess plateau 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was

experimental period was measured using an automatic weather station changwu experimental station meteorological observatory ws std1 england at the experimental site according to the usda textural classification system the soil has a silty loam texture which is derived from loess with a deep and even soil profile the soil water content and wilting moisture in the 0 10 m loess section were 21 16 0 86 and 7 46 0 65 mass water content respectively and the soil bulk density was 1 23 1 44 g cm3 wang et al 2015 the precipitation and average temperature during the test in 2016 are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment started in 2003 with a total of four treatments the treatments were a control with non mulching ck plastic film mulching pm1 plastic film mulching in fallow pm2 and straw mulching jm the ck treatment was not mulched during the entire growth stage the pm1 treatment was mulched with plastic film before sowing the pm2 treatment was plastic film mulching in fallow clean the mulch before sowing without mulching during the growth period the jm treatment was that when the corn was harvested the whole straw harvested in this plot was mulched evenly and the straw was closed when the corn was sowed and placed between the lines each treatment was replicated three times in 35 m2 plots 7 m 5 m in a randomized complete block design the test crop is a ripe spring corn a year the selection of varieties is pioneer 335 a planting pattern of alternating wide 60 cm and narrow 35 cm row spacing was used for each treatment the spring corn was sown on april 23 2016 and harvested on september 20 the test plastic film used for the 60 cm wide 0 015 mm thick polyethylene film fertilizers n 150 kg ha and p2o5 75 kg ha were spread over the soil surface and incorporated into the 0 20 cm soil layer using a rotary cultivator before sowing 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 grain yield each plot harvested more than one third of the ear after air drying the collected samples were threshed and the grain was weighted sub samples approximately 100 g of the air dried grain were dried to a constant weight in a fan oven at 75 c to estimate the grain water

different mulching measures on soil moisture at harvest stage different mulching measures had different effects on the moisture content of soil profiles at the harvest stage of spring maize fig 2 compared with ck the soil water content in the range of 0 200 cm was higher than that in the ck treatment there was no significant difference in the soil moisture content in the range of 200 300 cm the distribution of soil moisture in different treatments was similar in the whole profile the soil moisture in the range of 0 60 cm was consumed by spring maize and the soil water content showed a decreasing trend the water content in the range of 60 120 cm increased gradually under 120 cm the soil water content began to decline and soil water content in the range of 200 300 cm did not change significantly it was indicated that spring maize mainly used the soil moisture within the range of 0 200 cm so that the soil moisture in this area was consumed greatly the water content of soil profile at the harvest stage was jm pm2 pm1 from top to bottom which was related to the different movement of soil moisture under the three treatments the surface of the pm1 was exposed during the fallow period which increased the loss of soil water the surface of the land was in the semi mulching state during the growth period and the rainfall in may to june in the test site was small and the plant had a large amount of water consumption therefore resulting in a large amount of water loss however in july and august when the rainfall increased the leaf area of spring maize plants increased blocking most of the rainfall so that the soil moisture of pm1 was not replenished jm treatment and pm2 treatment resulted in less water loss due to increased surface mulching during fallow period and increased rainfall infiltration during early spring maize growth period therefore the soil profile moisture content of pm1 treatment was lower than that of other mulching treatment the water storage in the harvest period ranged from 713 to 797 mm in the range of 0 300 cm and the amount of water storage in order of jm pm2 pm1 ck table 1 the water storage capacity of jm pm2 and pm1 treatments increased by 11 7 10 6 and 6 2 respectively as compared with ck treatment indicated that jm treatment had the strongest effect on soil water storage in addition the water storage capacity of three kinds of soil mulching treatments during harvest increased from shallow to deep while the storage capacity of 60 120 cm in ck treatment was lower than the storage capacity of 0 60 cm and the ck storage capacity were lower than the mulching treatments the above results showed that mulching the ground can effectively increase the water storage capacity of the soil during harvest stage while non mulching treatment will increase the loss of soil water and reduce the soil water storage capacity at harvest stage different letters in the same row indicated that the data difference was significant at the 0 05 level 3 2 profile distribution and accumulation of soil nitrate under different mulching measures nitrate nitrogen data at the soil profile at harvest showed that the plastic film mulching significantly reduced nitrate nitrogen content in the soil profile fig 3 the content of no3 n in pm2 decreased in the whole profile the content of no3 n in pm1 fluctuated in the whole profile and the peak appeared at 140 cm 7 63 mg kg ck had two accumulation peaks in the whole profile the first accumulation peak was at 60 cm the nitrate content was 42 36 mg kg the second accumulation peak was at 180 cm with nitrate content of 15 27 mg kg compared with ck treatment jm treatment showed that the nitrate nitrogen content in the range of 0 50 cm was much higher than that in ck treatment with a cumulative peak at 40 cm 63 01 mg kg from below 50 cm jm treatment nitrate nitrogen concentration has been declining and nitrate content below 120 cm below ck treatment in the same experiment the peak value of ck treatment increased from 30 9 mg kg to 42 36 mg kg compared with the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage in 2007 yang 2009 and a new cumulated peak was formed at 180 cm in 2007 the peak value of jm treatment was 60 cm the content of soil nitrate nitrogen was 30 9 mg kg and the same depth of nitrate nitrogen content was 31 95 mg kg in 2016 the peak of pm1 treatment varied from 5 8 mg kg at 60 cm to 140 cm at 7 63 mg kg according to the accumulations of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile in the range of 0 300 cm during the harvest period in 2016 table 2 the accumulations of nitrate nitrogen in different treatments were jm ck pm1 pm2 in descending order except for jm treatment the other three treatments were significantly less than the ck accumulation the cumulative amount of 100 200 cm within the three mulching treatments were lower than the ck treatment indicated that mulching cultivation on the surface can significantly reduce the soil profile in the soil range of 100 200 cm nitrate accumulation compared with the data from 2007 yang 2009 the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile 0 300 cm ck pm1 and jm increased by 123 47 kg ha 79 25 kg ha and 389 57 kg ha respectively the increment of nitrate content in 80 20 of jm treatment was in the range of 0 100 cm indicated that straw mulching could significantly increase the accumulation of nitrate in shallow soil based on the data of distribution of nitrate nitrogen in soil profiles at harvest stage fig 3 it can be concluded that all the mulching measures can effectively reduce the leaching and accumulation of nitrate in soil different letters in the same row indicated that the data difference was significant at the 0 05 level 3 3 yield and n uptake of spring maize under different mulching measures mulching significantly increased biomass and grain yield in spring maize compared to non mulching table 3 after harvesting in 2016 the aboveground biomass of all treatments were pm1 jm pm2 ck in descending order among them the biomass of pm1 and ck was significantly different p 0 05 the biomass of which was increased by 28 05 compared with that of ck the difference between jm and ck was not statistically significant but the biomass of jm increased by 11 13 compared with ck treatment the yield of pm1 was the most significant with the yield of 11 314 42 kg ha compared with ck the yield of pm1 increased by 26 72 the yields of jm and pm2 were not significantly different from those of ck but the yield of both treatments were higher than that of ck by 9 2 and 5 respectively the biomass and grain yield of pm1 were significantly higher than those of jm and pm2 p 0 05 values followed by different letters in a column are significantly different among the treatments at the 5 level the nhi indicates the efficiency with which the crop utilizes the acquired n for grain production compared with the control treatment the plant nitrogen uptake and the grain nitrogen uptake except the pm2 were all greater than those of the ck treatment indicated that the mulching cultivation of the spring maize increased the nitrogen uptake by the spring maize plants meanwhile each mulching nitrogen index were higher than the control treatment indicated a higher nitrogen content in the leaves and stems of the control treatment more nitrogen is used for vegetative growth and mulching treatment can make plants absorb nitrogen more transfer more to the grain for reproductive growth 4 discussion the main form of nitrogen in rainfed farmland soil is nitrate nitrogen and water is the carrier of nitrate nitrogen in soil as for the influence of different mulching measures on soil water content and water storage capacity different researchers carried out relevant experimental studies in different regions studies zhang et al 2007 zribi et al 2015 had shown that mulching can increase soil water content and water storage capacity by reducing ineffective evaporation and raising the soil s deeper water to the crop available layer than bare soil cultivation straw mulching also helps to reduce ineffective evaporation and improve soil moisture zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 tested the planting and harvesting of maize under different plastic film mulching in arid highland of northern weibei upland the results showed that different types of plastic mulching had the same influence on soil water content compared with the non mulching the surface water content and soil water storage capacity increased significantly li et al 2016 studied the spring maize in heyang shaanxi province the results showed that straw mulching provided greater water conservation in our experiment the average water content of 0 300 cm soil layer in the period of harvest with plastic mulching plastic film mulching in fallow and straw mulching increased by 6 24 10 6 11 76 compared with non mulching treatment respectively in three kinds of mulching treatment the straw mulching had the best effect the water storage capacity of 0 300 cm increased by 11 8 compared with the non mulching treatment mulching significantly increased the emergence rate of maize increased the dry matter accumulation aboveground and promoted the growth and development of ear improve corn production plastic film mulching was significantly increasing the maize yield in the loess plateau zhang et al 2007 2011 wang et al 2015 different effects of straw mulching on spring maize yield have been reported some studies had shown that the low temperature effect due to straw mulching in early spring maize leads to a decrease in yield zhang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 but wang et al 2011 showed that straw mulching increased by 45 67 compared with no mulching and film mulching increased by 47 24 in this experiment plastic film mulching treatment increased by 23 72 of the yield compared with the control treatment in addition to improving the soil moisture status and increasing the yield the mulching measures also have a great impact on the leaching and transformation of soil nitrate nitrogen the mulching prevented the direct vertical infiltration of precipitation from the surface of the soil and most of the water can only infiltrate the trench to enhance the lateral movement of water and then increase the upward movement of water on the plastic film ridge reducing the nitrate nitrogen to the deep migration zhang et al 2012 moreover studies have found that soil mulching significantly increased maize n uptake efficiency and utilization efficiency compared with the non mulching treatment and the grain yield and total n uptake increase may decrease the nitrate nitrogen residue in soil in our study the contents and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profiles with plastic film mulching and plastic film mulching in fallow were significantly reduced the accumulations of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profiles of three kinds of mulching treatments in the range of 100 200 cm were lower than those of the non mulching ones in addition the three mulching treatments effectively increased the nitrogen uptake and the nitrogen harvest index of spring maize which is consistent with the previous studies zhang et al 2009 found that the residual nitrate nitrogen in soil was significantly increased when the nitrogen application rate was higher than 150 kg ha with or without straw mulching 0 200 cm section obvious accumulation peak straw mulching soil residual nitrate accumulation peak than the non mulching depth of about 40 cm in our experiment the nitrogen application rate was 150 kg ha the soil nitrate nitrogen content and accumulation in the range of 0 50 cm with straw mulching were significantly higher than the non mulching treatment and the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the range of 0 100 cm with straw mulching was significantly greater than the other treatments while the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the range of 100 200 cm in straw mulching treatment was less than that in non mulching treatment the results showed that straw mulching could significantly increase nitrate nitrogen content in the soil surface but did not cause downward leaching some studies have shown that straw mulching can significantly increase the nitrate nitrogen content of soil surface promote the supply of nitrogen reduce the residual nitrate nitrogen and reduce the leaching loss wang et al 2014 he et al 2016 this is mainly due to the continuous application of higher c n ratio straw which greatly increased the amount of bio available carbon in the soil provided sufficient energy for the activities of soil heterotrophic microorganisms and greatly stimulated the mineralization of soil nitrogen role mary et al 1996 recous et al 1999 therefore in arid and semi arid areas maize mulching cultivation can effectively reduce soil nitrate nitrogen leaching and accumulation 5 conclusion 1 in rainfed agriculture in the south of loess plateau the mulching measures can effectively increase the soil water content and water storage capacity and improve the crop growth 2 plastic film mulching is the best way to increase yield of corn increased by 23 72 of the yield compared with the non mulching 3 plastic film mulching plastic film mulching in fallow can significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil profile and the three mulching measures can slow the deep leaching of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent acknowledgments this research
