17230,the purification performance of a forward osmosis fo membrane on natural organic matter nom contained in real surface water by was investigated systematically fo could reject the natural dissolved organic matter dom effectively with removal efficiencies of approximately 99 0 when the natural water samples e g raw surface water had lower fouling tendencies the active layer facing the draw solution al facing ds mode provided a higher water flux than that in the alternative membrane orientation because the isoflux point occurred later in the process it was found that the concentration of calcium ions had a more severe effect on decreasing the fouling flux of the fo membrane than that of the organic foulant furthermore the concentrated feed solution had a more significant effect on the fouling flux decline of the natural dom containing more small molecules than natural dom containing more macromolecules additionally the fouling that occurred in the al facing ds orientation was compensated by the reduced internal concentration polarization icp level based on the occurrence of the critical compensation point it was also revealed that the permeation drag caused by the water flux and the chemical interactions induced by the feed solution ph and the calcium ion concentration played a significant role in the adsorption of small natural dom molecules in the porous structure of the fo membrane based on the analysis of the interfacial free energies the interactions between the natural dom and the surface of the support layer dominated the initial fouling of the fo membrane while subsequent fouling was controlled by the interaction between the approaching dom molecules and the already adsorbed dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis surface water fouling internal concentration polarization interfacial energy 1 introduction nanofiltration nf is an attractive treatment technology for producing potable water from natural surface water since it can provide an excellent rejection of micropollutants and natural organic matter nom however the toughest problem for nf utilization is associated with the disposal of the concentrated water therefore there is an urgent need for investigation of an ideal reclamation treatment with a high retention efficiency and a low energy loss for the processing of concentrated water using nf in recent years forward osmosis fo or fo based processes have become increasingly popular as a promising energy efficient alternative to conventional pressure driven membrane technologies fo harnesses differences in the natural osmotic pressure across a semi permeable membrane to produce high quality pure water by regenerating the diluted draw solution ds fo offers many potential advantages including lower hydraulic pressure mcginnis and elimelech 2007 higher rejection efficiency achilli et al 2009 reduced fouling propensity cornelissen et al 2008 mi and elimelech 2010 shaffer et al 2015 and higher water recovery martinetti et al 2009 consequently fo has been proposed for versatile applications in water purification such as seawater and brackish water desalination akther et al 2015 mccutcheon et al 2006 zhao et al 2012 wastewater treatment achilli et al 2009 cornelissen et al 2008 li et al 2019 and algae biomass separation hoover et al 2011 zou et al 2011 while fouling by fo is less severe and less irreversible than that by nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes the performance of fo in practical water purification can potentially be affected by the membrane orientation the inherent internal concentration polarization icp in the porous membrane support membrane fouling by dissolved organic matter dom and certain unfavorable conditions since the active layer and the supporting layer of the fo membrane can both face the feed solution fo fouling could occur on different membrane surfaces she et al reported that foulants with relatively small sizes could enter into the porous support layer and cause internal clogging and enhanced icp in the active layer that faces the draw solution al facing ds mode she et al 2016 although the active layer facing the feed solution al facing fs mode tends to have a lower fouling tendency and superior fouling reversibility this mode may be less suited for treating feed solutions with a lower fouling tendency and may require a high mechanical stability of the membrane as compared to the al facing ds orientation she et al 2012b therefore the selection of the membrane orientation for fo applications should take into account the effect of the fouling potential of the feed solution the icp and the membrane stability zhao et al reported that selection of the membrane orientation could depend on the occurrence of the isoflux point defined to be where the fouling water fluxes in both orientations become equal zhao et al 2011 many researchers observed that more severe fo membrane fouling occurred at higher initial flux levels previous researchers she et al 2012a she et al 2013 tang et al 2010 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 systematically investigated the effects of icp and humic acid fouling on the decline of the fo flux they attributed the exacerbated fouling at the higher water flux to the enhanced icp in the support structure and the greater permeation drag force towards the membrane surface the researchers also observed that the critical flux concept the idea that significant membrane fouling could occur when the flux was above a certain value is also applicable in fo processes kim et al 2015 tang et al 2010 zou et al 2013 mi and elimelech 2008 reported that alginate fouling of the fo membrane was significantly enhanced by the calcium ions in the feed solution this enhancement can be attributed to the binding of calcium to the carboxylic functional groups of the alginate that promotes the development of a fouling layer on the membrane surface she et al 2013 found that humic acid fouling was more severe compared to alginate fouling because of the stronger intermolecular interactions between the humic acid and mg2 ions however systematic studies on the fo performance for dom containing real surface water purification are still limited in fact applications of fo as a potential purification treatment of concentrated water in nf for surface water are determined largely by the source of the feed water the water composition and the nature of the potential fouling materials sutzkover gutman and hasson 2010 dom characteristics that might affect membrane fouling include molecular weight distribution hydrophobicity and the chemical properties related to the interaction forces between nom molecules and the membrane surface carroll et al 2000 cho et al 1999 hong and elimelech 1997 in our previous study it was found that the more hydrophobic humic compounds of low molecular weights such as tannic acid could induce more severe fo fouling than the hydrophilic polysaccharides macromolecules such as alginate wang et al 2016 thelin et al 2013 studied the fo membrane fouling behavior by nom in surface water in the al facing ds orientation it was reported that the water flux decreased with the foulant deposition on the membrane the concentration of nom of which the composition remains stable had a minor effect on the fo fouling tendency in addition the increased ionic strength in the porous supporting layer exacerbated the membrane fouling valladares linares et al 2012 focused on identification of the nom fractions in the secondary wastewater effluent and seawater that might cause fo membrane fouling it was found that high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec combined with peak fitting approaches can better characterize the organic foulants that were deposited on or transported through the active layer of the fo membrane in addition to dom characteristics membrane surface properties could also greatly influence the foulant membrane interaction during the fo processes the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory developed by van oss 1993 is now extensively used to explain the chemical interactions between the membrane surface and the foulants by determining the membrane surface free energy jin et al 2009 motsa et al 2014 she et al 2016 jin et al 2009 studied alginate fouling in seawater ro desalination under the impacts of major ions and evaluated correlations between acid base free energies and fouling it was revealed that divalent ions could form bridges between the carboxylic groups on the membrane surface and the groups in alginate resulting in an increase in the alginate membrane adhesion force motsa et al 2014 investigated the effects on the fo fouling propensity of alginate and predicted the membrane fouling trends using the xdlvo approach it was found that the initial fouling rate correlated strongly with the interfacial free energies of adhesion between alginate and membrane for both fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro modes however the later deposition of alginate particles mainly depended on the interfacial interactions between newly deposited and already deposited organics when fo processes are used to treat complicated natural dom the effects on distinguishing purification behaviors must be clearly elucidated to the best of our knowledge so far only a few systematic studies on the fo of natural surface water purification in drinking water treatment have been done for the practical application of fo the availability of the evaluation method of the selection of membrane orientation need to be further investigated during the reclamation treatment of nf concentrated water by fo process the ionic strength and dom concentration in the feed would simultaneously increase thus the multiple concentration effects on fo filtration also need to be studied therefore the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the fo purification efficiency of the natural surface water in which dom was enriched by microfiltration mf nf processes and to investigate several key factors influencing the purification process such as the physical parameters flux level and membrane orientation and the feed solution chemistry specifically to explore the mechanisms of the natural dom membrane interactions on fo fouling the membrane samples and dom were characterized through advanced contact angle measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo test unit a bench scale cross flow unit was designed for fo experiments more detailed description of this fo system are given in our previous studies wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the fo membrane unit has two symmetrical channels on both sides of the membrane within which plastic mesh spacers were inserted two variable speed peristaltic pumps were used to pump co current crossflows and to maintain the crossflow velocities of the feed and the draw solutions a water bath was used for maintaining the temperatures of the feed and the draw solution a digital scale was used to measure the permeate water flux 2 2 test solutions unless otherwise specified all chemicals and reagents used in this study were of the analytical grade milli q water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare all working solutions nacl sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was used as the draw solute the raw water used in this study was drawn from four surface water resources in china namely the tai lake hereafter named natural water sample 1 the huangpu river natural water sample 2 the yellow river natural water sample 3 and the qingcaosha reservoir natural water sample 4 typical characteristics of the raw water are given in table 1 and table s1 the water samples with the initial total organic carbon toc concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l were enriched by a bench mf nf hybrid process and filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane 2 3 fo membrane the flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane obtained from hydration technology inc hti usa was used in this study membrane samples were stored at 4 c and then soaked in milli q water at 4 c for at least 24 h before each experiment the membrane had an asymmetric structure and its active layer was mechanically supported by an embedded polyester mesh both sides of the fo membrane were made of similar cta material the water and solute nacl transport coefficients of the active layer of the membrane were 1 14 10 12m s pa and 2 31 10 7m s respectively the solute resistivity k representing the extent of the internal concentration polarization icp in fo was 4 05 105 s m for the active layer facing the draw solution configuration and 2 69 105 s m for the alternative configuration more detailed membrane characteristics are described in our previous study wang et al 2014 2 4 test protocol for each fo experiment a new membrane coupon was first equilibrated with the draw solution and the background electrolyte of composition identical to that used for the subsequent fouling test except that foulants were not added for at least 30 min the tested water sample was then added to the feed tank and the following fouling experiment continued for 8 h in each fouling test the ph value of the feed solution was relatively stable throughout the experimental stages to obtain reliable flux data each experiment was repeated at least once depending on how critical the data is unless otherwise stated the following reference testing conditions were adopted for the fouling tests feed solution natural water samples as described in table 1 and table s1 draw solution concentrated nacl solution 2 0 m cross flow velocity for both fs and ds 17 4 cm s temperature 22 1 c since the osmotic driving force for the fo flux kept decreasing because of the dilution of the draw solution and the icp the flux decline in the fouling experiments was caused not only by membrane fouling but also by the decrease in the apparent osmotic driving force baseline tests were therefore conducted to quantify the flux decline each baseline test was performed under conditions identical to the corresponding fouling test without natural dom in the feed solution the measured fouling flux j fouling was divided by its corresponding baseline flux j baseline to obtain a normalization flux which solely represented the extent of membrane fouling similar methodology was adopted in prior studies wang et al 2014 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 molecular weight and organic hydrophilicity fractionation molecular weight analysis for foulants was performed using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc waters e2695 usa with an ultraviolet absorbance uva detector waters 2489 usa and a toc specific detector modified sievers 900 turbo usa similar analytical methodology was employed in prior studies kawasaki et al 2011 wang et al 2014 chromatograms were analyzed via peak fitting techniques to determine the area under each peak origin software was used for this analysis chow et al 2008 huang et al 2017 amberlite xad 8 and xad 4 were used to separate the foulants into four groups strongly

resistance values was described in our previous study wang et al 2016 2 5 4 natural dom extraction experiment to analyze the fouling behavior of natural dom on the membrane surface an extraction procedure was used to determine the actual amount of doms adsorbed onto the membrane at the completion of a fouling test the fouled membrane was soaked in a naoh solution of 400 ml ph 10 5 with mild sonication at 25 c for 20 min a sufficient amount of time for the foulants to reach desorption equilibrium then the quantity and composition of total doms was determined by a toc analyzer uv spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrometer 2 5 5 the solute resistivity k for icp analysis in our study the extent of icp in fo can be evaluated by the solute resistivity k within the membrane porous layer in the al facing ds mode gray et al 2006 zhao and zou 2011 the solute resistivity k can be defined by the following eq 1 lee et al 1981 1 k l τ ε d s s d s where l is the membrane thickness τ is the tortuosity of the membrane porous support layer ε is porosity of the porous support layer s is a structural parameter and ds is the diffusion coefficient of the solute the k values

surface free energy measurements calculations of the total interaction energy surface free energy of cohesion and adhesion between the natural dom and the membrane could be performed using xdlvo theory the detailed determination methods are shown in the supporting information 2 5 7 analysis of other items dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed on filtered samples 0 45 μm in a toc analyzer toc l csh shimadzu japan ultraviolet absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm uv254 was measured by a uv spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa suva was then calculated using the ratios of uv254 to doc which

observe the structure and morphology of the fouled fo membrane the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem of the extraction solution from the fouled fo membranes was recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer f 4500 hitachi japan and a 4 ml 1 cm path length cuvette following the method described by huang et al 2012 and chen et al 2003 the data were analyzed by excel 2010 microsoft company

hydrophilic hydrophobic fractions of natural dom characteristics of the hydrophilic hydrophobic fractions in the four natural dom categories are presented in figure s1 and figure s2 analysis of the characteristics of the natural dom mentioned above is exhibited in the supporting information 3 1 2 the molecular weight distribution of natural dom characteristics of the molecular weight mw distributions of four natural dom categories 15 mg c l as doc concentration for each sample have been determined by the hplc uva toc system the results are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 based on the peak splitting analysis the natural dom was separated into three major fractions with different mw sizes xiao et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 i biopolymers with high mw 50 000 da 30 000 000 da ii humic substances and protein degradation products with medium mw 2000 50000 da and iii humic substances and their breakdown products with low mw 500 2000 da seen in fig 2 b in natural water sample 1 and sample 2 the apparent molecular weight of toc amwtoc of the peak top of the macromolecules was estimated to be 1004680 106 da and 1092586 106 da respectively the amwtoc of the macromolecular peak top in natural water sample 3 and sample 4 was 539195 105 da and 588644 105 da respectively this difference suggested that the amw of macromolecules in these two water samples was lower than that of natural water sample 1 and sample 2 as shown in fig 1 a the uva detector exhibited low peak responses for all of the macromolecules in the four natural water sources indicating that the natural water contained fewer low uva macromolecules which mainly consisted of hydrophilic compounds seen in figure s3 such as polysaccharides proteins and amino sugars as shown in fig 2 a the medium mw organics constituted a high proportion 80 of the uva intensity for all water samples suggesting that these molecules had more aromatic structures or unsaturated bonds π bonds with a higher uv254 absorbance such as humic substances and protein degradation products as shown in fig 1 b the amwtoc of the peak top of the low mw organics followed the order natural water sample 2 natural water sample 1 natural water sample 3 natural water sample 4 moreover except for natural water sample 2 the toc area proportion of the low mw fractions in the other three raw water samples was above 70 indicating that the tested surface water samples could have contained more organic matter with a low mw fig 2 b according to figure s3 the hydrophilic fraction dominated in the medium mw organics in the four water samples in natural water sample 2 sample 3 and sample 4 the low mw organics consisted largely of v hpo and n hpi fractions 3 2 effect of membrane orientation and the initial toc concentration of natural dom the effect of the membrane orientation on the fo performance is shown in figure s4 figure s5 and fig 3 in this test there was no remarkable change in the baseline flux under conditions identical to the corresponding fouling test thus the initial fluxes were similar in all the baseline tests seen in figure s4 the isoflux point i e the equal water flux point seems to have occurred as coined by zhao et al 2011 in the al facing ds mode and the al facing fs mode with initial toc concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l as reported by zhao et al the selection of the membrane orientation can be determined by the occurrence of the isoflux point the al facing fs mode was preferable when treated with the feed solution with a high fouling tendency because the isoflux point occurred earlier and vice versa as shown in figure s5 there was no isoflux point observed during the fo filtration of non concentrated natural water samples i e the fouling flux in the al facing ds mode was higher than that in the al facing fs mode throughout the 8 h fo experiments this suggested that the al facing ds mode could be more favorable when purifying natural surface water samples with low initial toc concentrations when natural water concentrated to the initial toc concentration of 10 mg l fig 3 the reduction of the fouling flux in the al facing fs mode was minor amounting to 0 01 0 01 0 03 and 0 01 for natural water sample 1 natural water sample 2 natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 respectively however the decline of the fouling flux in the alternative mode was obvious compared to the non concentrated water samples the reduction rates of the fouling flux of natural water sample 1 natural water sample 2 natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 were 0 17 0 22 0 27 and 0 30 respectively as a result the isoflux point occurred at an early stage of the fo filtration t 20 min of natural water sample 4 suggesting that the al facing fs mode could be more favorable for this sample when using the 10 mg l initial toc concentration as the initial toc concentration of the feed solution increased to 20 mg l the isoflux point occurred before half of the 8 h filtrations of all water samples and the occurrence time was t 10 min for natural water sample 4 t 120 min for natural water sample 1 t 180 min for natural water sample 2 and t 240 min for natural water sample 3 respectively because the isoflux points occurred earlier the al facing fs mode seemed to be more favorable for the high fo flux performance when using the 20 mg l initial toc concentration overall the occurrence of the isoflux point can be a fast and simple index for preliminarily selecting the favorable fo membrane orientation moreover for the practical treatment of natural surface waters using fo the selection of membrane orientation should take into account the effect of dom retention icp and membrane stability rather than any single factor she et al 2016 further synthetic evaluation of the membrane orientation selection should be conducted in addition to the isoflux point method the normalized flux during the purification of natural dom by the fo membrane is illustrated in fig 4 according to the negligible flux reduction 5 in the al facing fs orientation the al facing fs mode was preferable for the fo filtration of the high concentration feed and the concentrated water in nf at the expense of a more severe inherent icp and flux inefficiency the al facing ds mode showed a notably different fouling flux performance under the tested initial toc concentration of the four natural dom categories for the non concentrated raw water samples the normalized flux suffered a minor reduction 20 at the initial stage t 60 min then stabilized at the corresponding normalized flux level until the end of the fo filtration the normalized flux decline for the four natural dom categories after the fo filtration was more than 20 when the initial toc concentration increased to 10 mg l noting that the normalized flux reduction for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 was nearly 30 according to the conclusion of our previous study wang et al 2014 the more obvious flux loss for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 could be partially related to the higher calcium ion concentration as shown in table s1 in addition for both natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 the normalized flux increased gradually after the initial drastic drop and particularly showed a larger growth from 0 52 to 0 7 for natural water sample 4 this result was probably ascribed to the compensating icp effect which was explicated in our previous study wang et al 2016 the reduced icp caused by the initial faster flux decrease resulted in an increase in the effective driving force and thus compensated for the subsequent fo membrane fouling when the initial toc concentration increased to 20 mg l the final reduction of the normalized flux for all tested natural dom increased to more than 30 and nearly 40 for natural water sample 2 and natural water sample 4 moreover the normalized flux of the four natural dom categories showed different reduction trends with the increased initial toc concentration it was suggested that the critical initial toc concentration could occur for the fo filtration of natural water samples above which the feed could induce more significant membrane fouling this observation indicated that the efficiency of the fo filtration of natural water could be effectively enhanced if the initial toc concentration of feed were controlled under the critical value as expected the results showed that there was no apparent difference in the removal efficiency of natural dom with all the initial toc concentrations tested in the two fo membrane orientations stably attaining over 99 0 during the 8h filtration which was similar to the removal presented in previous studies on organic fouling wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the adsorption and retention of natural dom by the fo membrane with different membrane orientations are shown in figure s6 and figure s7 for each initial toc concentration tested based on the high retentions the fo membranes had a good purification efficiency of natural dom with different initial toc concentrations in both membrane orientations as shown in figure s7 the adsorption behavior of natural dom in the al facing ds mode was different from that found in our previous study on the fo fouling by tannic acid wang et al 2016 the increased initial toc concentration had a minor effect on the adsorption of natural dom during the entire filtration furthermore the limited dom adsorption of the four natural water samples had a distinguishable influence on the fouling flux which can be attributed to the distinct fouling behavior caused by various characteristics of natural dom to further analyze the fouling behavior of natural dom on the membrane surface a close scrutiny of the fouled membrane support layer tested with a natural dom with an initial toc concentration of 10mg l in the feed was shown by sem images in figure s8 as shown in figure s8 the dom fouling layer possessed sparse and loose structures possibly due to the minor accumulation of dom on the surface of the support layer and no hydraulic pressure applied during fo for natural water sample 4 only a slight deposition of an organic fouling layer packed with nacl crystals was observed on the membrane surface the extraction solution from the fouled membrane was also analyzed and shown in table s2 and figure s9 to elucidate the composition of the organic fouling layer as shown in table s2 the order of the uv254 and suva values of the dom in the extraction solution was similar to that of raw water suggesting that the aromatic compounds in the water samples such as humic substances adsorbed onto the fo membrane in addition the suva value of the extraction solution was lower than that of the raw water seen in table 1 suggesting that the proportion of aromatic dom in the fouling layer was minor compared to that in the raw water the eem of dom in the extraction solution was analyzed as shown in figure s9 there were two major protein like peaks located at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 230 300 350 nm peak b and 275 300 350 nm peak t in the extracted dom which can be designated as the fluorescence peaks of tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances this result indicated that the proteins in the water samples adsorbed onto the fo membrane since peak b is often associated with low molecular weight protein like matter marhaba et al 2000 it was suggested that more protein like doms with low mws were in the fouling layer due to the stronger fluorescence intensities of peak b compared to that of peak t as mentioned in section 3 1 2 compared to natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 contained more organic macromolecules with higher molecular weights according to the observation in our previous study wang et al 2016 and the analysis of the natural dom fouling behavior mentioned above these macromolecules such as alginate and proteins that accumulated on the membrane surface likely formed a loose fluid like cake layer with strong mobility and less adsorption which increased the thickness of the support layer this enhanced the hydraulic resistance to permeate water through the membrane resulting in a flux decline due to the minor effect on the fo fouling caused by the macromolecules wang et al 2016 the flux reduction of natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 during the entire filtration toc 10 mg l and the initial stage toc 20 mg l was lower than the other two water samples on the other hand natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 contained higher proportions of low mw dom such as humic compounds including tannic acid and their breakdown products leading to a greater foulant adsorption within the porous support layer and thus a reduction of the support layer porosity caused by the pore clogging based on eq 1 the decreased support layer porosity caused a greater structural parameter s and thus increased solute resistivity k this fouling behavior eventually aggravated icp and induced a more severe flux decline under the higher initial toc concentrations for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 3 3 effect of the draw solution concentration and the initial flux level the effect of the initial flux level i e the initial draw solution concentrations of nacl on the purification of natural water by fo under the initial toc concentration of 10 mg l is evaluated over an initial flux range of 8 36 l m2 h i e 0 5 4 0 m nacl as draw solution the results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a the initial fouling flux level of the four natural water samples increased with increasing draw solution concentrations due to the greater apparent osmotic driving force across the membrane caused by the greater concentration difference between the ds and fs however the higher initial flux level at the greater ds concentrations i e 2 m and 4 m induced a faster fouling flux drop at the early stage of the filtration of four water samples t 1 h then the flux decline became slower when the ds concentration increased to 4 m the order of the rate of the initial fouling flux reduction could be described as follows natural water sample 4 natural water sample 3 natural water sample 1 natural water sample 2 this result was similar to the order of the proportion of dom with a low mw in natural water samples seen in fig 2 b suggesting that the rate of the initial fouling flux decline was related to the relative concentration of small molecules in the water as mentioned in a previous study a greater permeation drag induced by the higher initial flux has a significant effect on the small molecules entrapped in the porous support layer therefore natural water sample 4 which contained a higher proportion of low molecular dom caused the most severe fo membrane fouling and the fastest flux decline however the lower proportion of low molecular dom contained in natural water sample 2 induced the slowest flux decline overall this result suggests that greater ds concentrations might play a greater role in the fouling flux of lower molecular dom contained in natural water by the fo membrane in fig 5 b the notable normalized flux loss 20 occurred when the ds concentration increased to 1 m for the four water samples it is noteworthy that the normalized flux of natural water sample 2 increased gradually after 4h due to the compensating icp effect which has a more favorable effect on the water flux than membrane fouling the time point of 4h was defined as the critical compensation point representing the equilibrium moment between the two effects of compensating icp and membrane fouling at the critical compensation point the normalized flux which was decreased by membrane fouling would be equivalent to that when increased by the compensating icp when the ds concentration increased to 2 m the critical compensation point occurred at 1 5h for natural water sample 3 and 0 5h for natural water sample 4 meanwhile the corresponding fouling flux was 15 5 l m2 h and 14 2 l m2 h respectively it was suggested that the more decreased the initial fouling flux and consequently the more reduced the icp the earlier the critical compensation point occurred i e the less time it took for the effect of compensating icp to exceed the effect of membrane fouling on the flux at the end of fo filtration when the ds concentration increased to 4 m natural water sample 4 had the highest flux reduction 50 among the four water samples the critical compensation point for natural water sample 1 natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 occurred at 5h 4 5h and 3 5h respectively the corresponding fouling fluxes meanwhile were 18 3 l m2 h 16 4 l m2 h and 13 4 l m2 h this result verifies the interrelation between the critical compensation point and the fouling flux level the compensation effect of the reduced icp on the membrane fouling depends on its initial weakening degree the critical flux defined as a flux above which significant membrane fouling occurred when the corresponding final normalized flux decreased to 0 8 or lower observed by our previous study wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 also occurred for the four water samples it was indicated that natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 were prone to induce severe membrane fouling due to the lower critical flux the fo membrane in the al facing ds mode could efficiently reject the natural dom above 99 0 for all the ds concentrations tested over the 8 h filtration suggesting that there was no significant effect of the initial flux level on the removal of the natural dom in the feed as shown in figure s10 the retention of natural dom by the fo membranes was all above 94 under the tested ds concentrations indicating that the increased initial flux level had a minor effect on the retention efficiency of natural dom however the adsorption of the natural dom was maximal when the ds concentration increased to 4 m for all the feed water samples tested resulting in the corresponding minimal retention this result suggested that the increased permeation drag induced by the higher initial flux promoted the adsorption of natural dom within the porous support layer to further elucidate the adsorption behavior of natural dom during the 8 h fo filtration the membrane resistances when the ds concentration was 4 m were also measured and shown in figure s11 as shown in figure s11 the total membrane resistance rt of natural water sample 4 was the highest due to its minimal final fouling flux for all the water samples the fouling resistance rp was notably higher than the fouling resistance rs which indicated that more natural dom were entrapped within the porous support layer in order to further analyze the mechanism of the effect of the initial flux level on the filtration of four water samples by fo the ratio of ki k0 was proposed to reflect the degree of icp during fo membrane fouling by water samples in the ratio of ki k0 the terms ki and k0 presented the solute resistivities of the foulant water at the end of the filtration and the baseline water at the start of the filtration respectively the larger the ratio the more severe the icp caused by the foulant water the ki and k0 were determined by eq 2 the result is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the ki k0 of four water samples was greater than 1 0 which suggested that the icp caused by the membrane fouling was more severe than the inherent icp during the filtration of pure water under the influence of the initial flux the ki k0 of natural water sample 4 increased notably with the increasing initial concentration of ds indicating that the greater permeation drag caused by the increased initial flux had a significant effect on the icp induced by membrane fouling according to the results of our previous experiments and the analysis of membrane resistances in figure s11 the greater permeation drag had a more pronounced impact on the small molecules such as tannic acid entrapped in the porous layer than that on the transport of alginate macromolecules toward the fo membrane support layer the results above are consistent with the characteristics of the molecular weight distribution of natural water sample 4 which contained a larger proportion of small molecules in contrast the ki k0 of natural water sample 1 had an indistinct growth trend with the increase of the initial ds concentration due to the relatively higher proportion of macromolecules contained in this sample 3 4 effect of ionic strength due to the increased ionic strength in the concentrated natural water the effect of the ionic strength calcium ions on the fo performance was illustrated for both raw and concentrated water samples in addition in order to identify the different influences on the fo membrane fouling by the initial concentration of toc and calcium ions in the feed solution the concentration of calcium ions in the tested water samples was adjusted to the identical level seen in table s1 as the same kind of water with toc concentration of 20 mg l the results are shown in fig 7 the baseline flux was no obvious change under conditions identical to the corresponding fouling test thus the initial fluxes were similar in all the baseline tests seen in figure s12 and figure s13 the effect of adding calcium ions on the fo flux in the purification of raw and concentrated water samples with a 10 mg l initial toc concentration is illustrated in fig 7 a for the non concentrated raw water the fo flux decreased dramatically as the ca2 concentration increased and the most severe flux reduction was approximately 20 for natural water sample 4 according to the decreasing trend of the normalized fluxes the critical compensation point was only present at 1 h for natural water sample 3 then the normalized flux increased from 0 64 to 0 70 the more notable flux reduction extent for natural water sample 4 was partially ascribed to the higher ca2 concentration 7 2 mm in the feed which could induce more severe fo membrane fouling on the other hand as the results discussed in our previous study wang et al 2016 the calcium ions had a more significant effect on the fo fouling by the small tannic acid like organic molecules compared to that by the macro alginate like molecules accordingly the increased ca2 concentration could cause a more severe fo flux loss due to the higher concentration proportion of low mw dom of natural water sample 4 as shown in fig 7 a when the initial toc concentration was 10 mg l the normalized flux reductions for all the water samples were minor after the calcium ions were added into the feed this observation suggests that the increased ca2 concentration had a minor effect on the fouling flux in fo under the higher initial toc concentration of the natural water this effect was attributed to the lower initial fouling flux level before the addition of the calcium ions and the limited availability of carboxylic functional groups in natural dom which can further bind with the added calcium ions the permeate flux declined as the initial toc concentration increased from the raw level to 20 mg l under the condition of identical ca2 concentration clearly shown as the fouling flux in fig 7 b unlike the results observed before the addition of calcium ions the lower initial toc concentration could induce severe fo membrane fouling under the effect of high ca2 concentration for natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 the more severe normalized flux reduction 10 occurred as the initial toc concentration increased under the condition of identical ca2 concentrations however minor normalized flux decline 5 occurred for the other two water samples this observation could be ascribed to the higher ca2 concentration added into natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 which had a more significant effect on the flux reduction compared to the increased initial toc concentration since the concentration of toc and calcium ions increased simultaneously in the concentrated water in nf more analysis was performed in fig 8 which focused on the different effects of the increased toc and calcium ion concentrations on the normalized flux reduction at the end of fo filtration as shown in fig 8 when the concentration factor was 4 the normalized flux loss of natural water sample 2 was 16 under the effect of a ca2 concentration which was higher than that 14 under the effect of an initial toc concentration as the concentration factor increased to 8 for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 the decline of the normalized flux was notably higher 17 and 20 respectively under the effect of a ca2 concentration than that 5 and 7 respectively under the effect of an initial toc concentration with the exception of natural water sample 1 for similar concentration factors the higher normalized flux reduction occurred under the influence of a ca2 concentration compared to an initial toc concentration this result indicated that the removal of hardness ions such as calcium and magnesium ions from the feed solution was favorable to alleviate the effect of the water sample concentration on the performance of fo filtration no significant effect of increasing the concentration of ca2 on natural dom removal by the fo membrane was observed the natural dom removal for all the ca2 concentrations studied was over 99 0 figure s14 shows the adsorption and retention of the dom contained in the four natural water samples by the fo membrane before and after the addition of calcium with the initial toc concentration of 5 mg l or 2 mg l and 10 mg l in feed for comparison figure s14 also shows the adsorption and retention of each water sample when the initial toc concentration was 20 mg l in figure s14 except for natural water sample 1 there was no apparent difference among the dom retention efficiency after the addition of calcium all remaining above 94 however the adsorption of natural dom before and after adding calcium for the four water samples was different for natural water sample 1 the adsorption of natural dom after calcium addition at both toc concentrations was higher than that before calcium addition and the adsorption of dom at the end of filtration was similar to that when the initial toc concentration was 20 mg l 30 μg cm2 this differs from the result of the previous tannic acid fouling experiment under the influence of calcium ionic strength wang et al 2014 the result may be attributed to the lower flux decline after calcium addition for this sample leading to the less reduced permeation drag that did not countervail the favorable effect of the higher calcium concentration on increasing the dom adsorption for natural water sample 4 the dom adsorption after adding calcium was slightly lower than that before adding calcium under the tested toc concentrations as a previous study explained wang et al 2016 the effect of the limited dom adsorption on the more severe flux decline was related to more dom with lower molecular weight compounds contained in natural water sample 4 the higher ca2 concentration caused the formation of more small coiled calcium micromolecule complexes resulting in the more compact fouling layer of small molecules within the porous support layer as discussed in section 3 2 severe internal clogging reduced the porosity of the support layer consequently enhancing the structural parameter s and thus increasing the solute resistivity k i e more severe icp together these effects led to a more severe flux reduction after calcium addition 3 5 fouling mechanisms of natural dom in order to further explore the mechanism of the influence of natural dom on the performance of the fo process the initial toc concentration and the ionic strength of the four raw water samples were adjusted to be similar to that in the initial condition a toc concentration at 2 mg l an ionic strength at about 7 2 mm nacl and a ca2 concentration at about 1 1 mm the initial toc concentration was adjusted with milli q water while the total conductivity was adjusted by adding nacl and the ca2 concentration was adjusted by adding cacl2 the adjusted water sample was used as the feed solution and 2 m nacl was used as ds based on these conditions the approximated effect of natural dom on the fo performance is illustrated in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a compared with the other two water samples the fouling flux of natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 decreased more significantly in the early stage of filtration t 2 h the normalized flux of natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 seen in fig 9 b remained relatively stable and reached 0 9 at the end of the filtration however for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 the normalized flux increased gradually due to the compensating icp effect the result showed that the fo membrane rejected the four natural dom categories at or above 99 0 under the tested conditions as fig 9 c shows there was a minor difference in the adsorption and retention of the natural dom by the fo membrane by the end of the filtration the dom adsorption for natural water sample 1 gradually increased to 20 μg cm2 and thus the retention for this water decreased to the minimal value 88 compared with the other three water samples xdlvo theory was used to elucidate the effect of natural dom on the filtration performance of the fo membrane the cohesive free energy of the four natural dom categories and the membrane are listed in table s3 and table s4 according to the free energy of cohesion shown in table s3 it was revealed that the cohesive free energy of dom in the four natural water samples was negative indicating that these natural dom in the feed solutions were hydrophobic unstable and favored coagulation the negative cohesive free energy of dom in raw water can be ranked as follows natural water sample 4 natural water sample 2 natural water sample 3 natural water sample 1 this predicted that the dom in natural water sample 4 had a more negative hydrophobic energy of cohesion which was possibly attributed to the lower mw humic organic molecules in this water that generally showed the stronger hydrophobic cohesion energy as reported by other study jermann et al 2008 in addition the dom in natural water sample 1 had a less negative energy of cohesion suggesting that the dom in this raw water solution was more hydrophilic which agreed with the result that natural water sample 1 contained more hydrophilic macromolecular organic matter seen in section 3 1 2 in addition the higher acid base component of surface tension γ ab of the dom in natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 indicated that there were stronger interaction forces between the chemical bonds of molecules during the coagulation of these natural dom molecules resulting in the dense fouling layer and thus a more severe flux decline in the fo filtration meanwhile the acid base component was obviously lower for natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 suggesting that the natural dom in the two water samples could be prone to form a loose fouling layer and thus a less notable flux reduction the free energy of adhesion shown in table 2 signifies the interaction energy between the foulant and the membrane surface during membrane filtration the more negative free energy of adhesion indicated the greater the foulant membrane attraction and the easier it was for the foulants to be adsorbed within the membrane pore or deposited on the membrane surface as presented in table 2 for the support layer the free energy of adhesion of natural water sample 4 was the highest most negative value suggesting that the stronger attraction between the dom in this water sample and the membrane and thus the easily occurred adsorption on the membrane that caused the membrane fouling the adhesion free energy of dom in natural water sample 1 was the lowest which indicated that the dom can induce less severe membrane fouling in addition considering the free energy of adhesion for the support layer and the active layer of the fo membrane the adhesion free energy between the support layer and the natural dom was stronger than the active layer signifying that more natural dom fouling could occur on the support layer compared to the active layer this is consistent with the trend of the fouling flux decline in both membrane orientations permeation drag forces brought the dom molecules close to the membrane surface but the chemical interactions caused the actual binding of the dom to the membrane therefore the adhesion free energy between the natural dom and the membrane support layer was likely to dictate the initial membrane flux decline as shown in fig 9 a the initial flux decline of natural water sample 4 decreased more significantly which is in good agreement with the result that the free energy of adhesion between the dom in this water and the membrane support layer was stronger this indicated that the increasingly negative free energy of adhesion could induce more severe initial flux decline likewise the initial flux reduction of natural water sample 1 sample decreased less obviously strongly suggesting once again that the influence of the adhesion free energy on the initial flux decrease however as filtration progressed the fo membrane surface gradually became covered with foulants hence the free energy of cohesion between approaching foulant molecules in the feed and the already adsorbed foulants controlled the subsequent fouling flux decline as shown in fig 9 a after the 8 h filtration the higher flux decline of natural water sample 4 signified that the more negative cohesion energy can cause the more notable flux decline overall the four natural dom categories have a distinguishing fouling behavior during fo filtration fig 10 illustrates the interaction mechanisms involved in the fouling of the natural dom because the lower mw humic organic molecules contained in natural water sample 4 had stronger attractive interactions the adhesion free energy with the surface of the membrane support layer these small dom molecules were favorably entrapped in the porous support layer under the effect of the permeation drag caused by the initial flux on the other hand the adsorbed organic foulants tended to form a more compact fouling layer even with a minor adsorption amount which was attributed to the greater attractive hydrophobic interactions negative cohesion energy and acid base ab interactions γ ab amongst the dom molecules however due to the lower adhesion free energy between the dom molecules and the membrane support layer more hydrophilic dom macromolecules contained in natural water sample 1 have deposited on the surface of the support layer under the permeation drag force and gradually formed a looser fouling layer influenced by minor attractive interactions among the dom macromolecules although the attractive interactions between the dom and the surface of the membrane support layer were similar similar adhesion energy values for natural water sample 2 and natural water sample 3 more small dom molecules contained in natural water sample 3 were more easily trapped in the porous structure under the identical permeation drag force level thus forming the denser fouling layer this observation was ascribed to the stronger acid base ab interactions amongst the dom foulants causing a more severe initial flux decline compared to natural water sample 2 in addition due to the icp that occurred in the fo process the greater initial flux reduction for natural water sample 3 and sample 4 reduced the icp effect and compensated for the subsequent flux loss induced by membrane fouling and thus reduced the flux decline the compensating icp may have some effect on the purification of natural dom by fo 4 conclusion the purpose of this study was to investigate the physical and chemical factors influencing water fluxes and retention behaviors of natural dom contained in four real surface water samples by the fo membrane it was observed that the selection of membrane orientation was influenced by the concentration of the natural dom when using fo membranes for purifying feed solutions with lower fouling tendencies such as raw surface water and concentrated water of lower concentrations the al facing ds was more preferable to obtain a higher flux level depending on the isoflux points that were not observed the appearance of a critical compensation point suggested the effect of membrane fouling on the subsequent flux decline would be compensated by that of the reduced icp as caused by the previously decreased flux in the al facing ds mode the concentration degree of natural dom had a more significant impact on the flux decline of natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 which contained more small dom molecules under similar concentration factors the concentrated ca2 level played a more significant role in the fo flux reduction than the increased initial toc concentration the permeation drag caused by water fluxes and chemical interactions induced by the feed solution s ph and calcium ion concentrations played important roles in the adsorption of smaller natural dom molecules in the porous structure of the fo membrane the interactions between the natural dom and the surface of the support layer dominated the initial fouling of the fo membrane while subsequent fouling was governed by the interaction between the approaching dom molecules and the already adsorbed dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17230,the purification performance of a forward osmosis fo membrane on natural organic matter nom contained in real surface water by was investigated systematically fo could reject the natural dissolved organic matter dom effectively with removal efficiencies of approximately 99 0 when the natural water samples e g raw surface water had lower fouling tendencies the active layer facing the draw solution al facing ds mode provided a higher water flux than that in the alternative membrane orientation because the isoflux point occurred later in the process it was found that the concentration of calcium ions had a more severe effect on decreasing the fouling flux of the fo membrane than that of the organic foulant furthermore the concentrated feed solution had a more significant effect on the fouling flux decline of the natural dom containing more small molecules than natural dom containing more macromolecules additionally the fouling that occurred in the al facing ds orientation was compensated by the reduced internal concentration polarization icp level based on the occurrence of the critical compensation point it was also revealed that the permeation drag caused by the water flux and the chemical interactions induced by the feed solution ph and the calcium ion concentration played a significant role in the adsorption of small natural dom molecules in the porous structure of the fo membrane based on the analysis of the interfacial free energies the interactions between the natural dom and the surface of the support layer dominated the initial fouling of the fo membrane while subsequent fouling was controlled by the interaction between the approaching dom molecules and the already adsorbed dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis surface water fouling internal concentration polarization interfacial energy 1 introduction nanofiltration nf is an attractive treatment technology for producing potable water from natural surface water since it can provide an excellent rejection of micropollutants and natural organic matter nom however the toughest problem for nf utilization is associated with the disposal of the concentrated water therefore there is an urgent need for investigation of an ideal reclamation treatment with a high retention efficiency and a low energy loss for the processing of concentrated water using nf in recent years forward osmosis fo or fo based processes have become increasingly popular as a promising energy efficient alternative to conventional pressure driven membrane technologies fo harnesses differences in the natural osmotic pressure across a semi permeable membrane to produce high quality pure water by regenerating the diluted draw solution ds fo offers many potential advantages including lower hydraulic pressure mcginnis and elimelech 2007 higher rejection efficiency achilli et al 2009 reduced fouling propensity cornelissen et al 2008 mi and elimelech 2010 shaffer et al 2015 and higher water recovery martinetti et al 2009 consequently fo has been proposed for versatile applications in water purification such as seawater and brackish water desalination akther et al 2015 mccutcheon et al 2006 zhao et al 2012 wastewater treatment achilli et al 2009 cornelissen et al 2008 li et al 2019 and algae biomass separation hoover et al 2011 zou et al 2011 while fouling by fo is less severe and less irreversible than that by nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes the performance of fo in practical water purification can potentially be affected by the membrane orientation the inherent internal concentration polarization icp in the porous membrane support membrane fouling by dissolved organic matter dom and certain unfavorable conditions since the active layer and the supporting layer of the fo membrane can both face the feed solution fo fouling could occur on different membrane surfaces she et al reported that foulants with relatively small sizes could enter into the porous support layer and cause internal clogging and enhanced icp in the active layer that faces the draw solution al facing ds mode she et al 2016 although the active layer facing the feed solution al facing fs mode tends to have a lower fouling tendency and superior fouling reversibility this mode may be less suited for treating feed solutions with a lower fouling tendency and may require a high mechanical stability of the membrane as compared to the al facing ds orientation she et al 2012b therefore the selection of the membrane orientation for fo applications should take into account the effect of the fouling potential of the feed solution the icp and the membrane stability zhao et al reported that selection of the membrane orientation could depend on the occurrence of the isoflux point defined to be where the fouling water fluxes in both orientations become equal zhao et al 2011 many researchers observed that more severe fo membrane fouling occurred at higher initial flux levels previous researchers she et al 2012a she et al 2013 tang et al 2010 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 systematically investigated the effects of icp and humic acid fouling on the decline of the fo flux they attributed the exacerbated fouling at the higher water flux to the enhanced icp in the support structure and the greater permeation drag force towards the membrane surface the researchers also observed that the critical flux concept the idea that significant membrane fouling could occur when the flux was above a certain value is also applicable in fo processes kim et al 2015 tang et al 2010 zou et al 2013 mi and elimelech 2008 reported that alginate fouling of the fo membrane was significantly enhanced by the calcium ions in the feed solution this enhancement can be attributed to the binding of calcium to the carboxylic functional groups of the alginate that promotes the development of a fouling layer on the membrane surface she et al 2013 found that humic acid fouling was more severe compared to alginate fouling because of the stronger intermolecular interactions between the humic acid and mg2 ions however systematic studies on the fo performance for dom containing real surface water purification are still limited in fact applications of fo as a potential purification treatment of concentrated water in nf for surface water are determined largely by the source of the feed water the water composition and the nature of the potential fouling materials sutzkover gutman and hasson 2010 dom characteristics that might affect membrane fouling include molecular weight distribution hydrophobicity and the chemical properties related to the interaction forces between nom molecules and the membrane surface carroll et al 2000 cho et al 1999 hong and elimelech 1997 in our previous study it was found that the more hydrophobic humic compounds of low molecular weights such as tannic acid could induce more severe fo fouling than the hydrophilic polysaccharides macromolecules such as alginate wang et al 2016 thelin et al 2013 studied the fo membrane fouling behavior by nom in surface water in the al facing ds orientation it was reported that the water flux decreased with the foulant deposition on the membrane the concentration of nom of which the composition remains stable had a minor effect on the fo fouling tendency in addition the increased ionic strength in the porous supporting layer exacerbated the membrane fouling valladares linares et al 2012 focused on identification of the nom fractions in the secondary wastewater effluent and seawater that might cause fo membrane fouling it was found that high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec combined with peak fitting approaches can better characterize the organic foulants that were deposited on or transported through the active layer of the fo membrane in addition to dom characteristics membrane surface properties could also greatly influence the foulant membrane interaction during the fo processes the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory developed by van oss 1993 is now extensively used to explain the chemical interactions between the membrane surface and the foulants by determining the membrane surface free energy jin et al 2009 motsa et al 2014 she et al 2016 jin et al 2009 studied alginate fouling in seawater ro desalination under the impacts of major ions and evaluated correlations between acid base free energies and fouling it was revealed that divalent ions could form bridges between the carboxylic groups on the membrane surface and the groups in alginate resulting in an increase in the alginate membrane adhesion force motsa et al 2014 investigated the effects on the fo fouling propensity of alginate and predicted the membrane fouling trends using the xdlvo approach it was found that the initial fouling rate correlated strongly with the interfacial free energies of adhesion between alginate and membrane for both fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro modes however the later deposition of alginate particles mainly depended on the interfacial interactions between newly deposited and already deposited organics when fo processes are used to treat complicated natural dom the effects on distinguishing purification behaviors must be clearly elucidated to the best of our knowledge so far only a few systematic studies on the fo of natural surface water purification in drinking water treatment have been done for the practical application of fo the availability of the evaluation method of the selection of membrane orientation need to be further investigated during the reclamation treatment of nf concentrated water by fo process the ionic strength and dom concentration in the feed would simultaneously increase thus the multiple concentration effects on fo filtration also need to be studied therefore the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the fo purification efficiency of the natural surface water in which dom was enriched by microfiltration mf nf processes and to investigate several key factors influencing the purification process such as the physical parameters flux level and membrane orientation and the feed solution chemistry specifically to explore the mechanisms of the natural dom membrane interactions on fo fouling the membrane samples and dom were characterized through advanced contact angle measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo test unit a bench scale cross flow unit was designed for fo experiments more detailed description of this fo system are given in our previous studies wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the fo membrane unit has two symmetrical channels on both sides of the membrane within which plastic mesh spacers were inserted two variable speed peristaltic pumps were used to pump co current crossflows and to maintain the crossflow velocities of the feed and the draw solutions a water bath was used for maintaining the temperatures of the feed and the draw solution a digital scale was used to measure the permeate water flux 2 2 test solutions unless otherwise specified all chemicals and reagents used in this study were of the analytical grade milli q water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare all working solutions nacl sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was used as the draw solute the raw water used in this study was drawn from four surface water resources in china namely the tai lake hereafter named natural water sample 1 the huangpu river natural water sample 2 the yellow river natural water sample 3 and the qingcaosha reservoir natural water sample 4 typical characteristics of the raw water are given in table 1 and table s1 the water samples with the initial total organic carbon toc concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l were enriched by a bench mf nf hybrid process and filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane 2 3 fo membrane the flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane obtained from hydration technology inc hti usa was used in this study membrane samples were stored at 4 c and then soaked in milli q water at 4 c for at least 24 h before each experiment the membrane had an asymmetric structure and its active layer was mechanically supported by an embedded polyester mesh both sides of the fo membrane were made of similar cta material the water and solute nacl transport coefficients of the active layer of the membrane were 1 14 10 12m s pa and 2 31 10 7m s respectively the solute resistivity k representing the extent of the internal concentration polarization icp in fo was 4 05 105 s m for the active layer facing the draw solution configuration and 2 69 105 s m for the alternative configuration more detailed membrane characteristics are described in our previous study wang et al 2014 2 4 test protocol for each fo experiment a new membrane coupon was first equilibrated with the draw solution and the background electrolyte of composition identical to that used for the subsequent fouling test except that foulants were not added for at least 30 min the tested water sample was then added to the feed tank and the following fouling experiment continued for 8 h in each fouling test the ph value of the feed solution was relatively stable throughout the experimental stages to obtain reliable flux data each experiment was repeated at least once depending on how critical the data is unless otherwise stated the following reference testing conditions were adopted for the fouling tests feed solution natural water samples as described in table 1 and table s1 draw solution concentrated nacl solution 2 0 m cross flow velocity for both fs and ds 17 4 cm s temperature 22 1 c since the osmotic driving force for the fo flux kept decreasing because of the dilution of the draw solution and the icp the flux decline in the fouling experiments was caused not only by membrane fouling but also by the decrease in the apparent osmotic driving force baseline tests were therefore conducted to quantify the flux decline each baseline test was performed under conditions identical to the corresponding fouling test without natural dom in the feed solution the measured fouling flux j fouling was divided by its corresponding baseline flux j baseline to obtain a normalization flux which solely represented the extent of membrane fouling similar methodology was adopted in prior studies wang et al 2014 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 molecular weight and organic hydrophilicity fractionation

determination of the foulant removal retention and adsorption for purification experiments with natural dom the removal retention and adsorption of dom were measured based on the toc measurements

resistance values was described in our previous study wang et al 2016 2 5 4 natural dom extraction experiment to analyze the fouling behavior of natural dom on the membrane surface an extraction procedure was used to determine the actual amount of doms adsorbed onto the membrane at the completion of a fouling test the fouled membrane was soaked in a naoh solution of 400 ml ph 10 5 with mild sonication at 25 c for 20 min a sufficient amount of time for the foulants to reach desorption equilibrium then the quantity and composition of total doms was determined by a toc analyzer uv spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrometer 2 5 5 the solute resistivity k for icp analysis in our study the extent of icp in fo can be evaluated by the solute resistivity k within the membrane

hydrophilic hydrophobic fractions of natural dom characteristics of the hydrophilic hydrophobic fractions in the four natural dom categories are presented in figure s1 and figure s2 analysis of the characteristics of the natural dom mentioned above is exhibited in the supporting information 3 1 2 the molecular weight distribution of natural dom characteristics of the molecular weight mw distributions of four natural dom categories 15 mg c l as doc concentration for each sample have been determined by the hplc uva toc system the results are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 based on the peak splitting analysis the natural dom was separated into three major fractions with different mw sizes xiao et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 i biopolymers with high mw 50 000 da 30 000 000 da ii humic substances and protein degradation products with medium mw 2000 50000 da and iii humic substances and their breakdown products with low mw 500 2000 da seen in fig 2 b in natural water sample 1 and sample 2 the apparent molecular weight of toc amwtoc of the peak top of the macromolecules was estimated to be 1004680 106 da and 1092586 106 da respectively the amwtoc of the macromolecular peak top in natural water sample 3 and sample 4 was 539195 105 da and 588644 105 da respectively this difference suggested that the amw of macromolecules in these two water samples was lower than that of natural water sample 1 and sample 2 as shown in fig 1 a the uva detector exhibited low peak responses for all of the macromolecules in the four natural water sources indicating that the natural water contained fewer low uva macromolecules which mainly consisted of hydrophilic compounds seen in figure s3 such as polysaccharides proteins and amino sugars as shown in fig 2 a the medium mw organics constituted a high proportion 80 of the uva intensity for all water samples suggesting that these molecules had more aromatic structures or unsaturated bonds π bonds with a higher uv254 absorbance such as humic substances and protein degradation products as shown in fig 1 b the amwtoc of the peak top of the low mw organics followed the order natural water sample 2 natural water sample 1 natural water sample 3 natural water sample 4 moreover except for natural water sample 2 the toc area proportion of the low mw fractions in the other three raw water samples was above 70 indicating that the tested surface water samples could have contained more organic matter with a low mw fig 2 b according to figure s3 the hydrophilic fraction dominated in the medium mw organics in the four water samples in natural water sample 2 sample 3 and sample 4 the low mw organics consisted largely of v hpo and n hpi fractions 3 2 effect of membrane orientation and the initial toc concentration of natural dom the effect of the membrane orientation on the fo performance is shown in figure s4 figure s5 and fig 3 in this test there was no remarkable change in the baseline flux under conditions identical to the corresponding fouling test thus the initial fluxes were similar in all the baseline tests seen in figure s4 the isoflux point i e the equal water flux point seems to have occurred as coined by zhao et al 2011 in the al facing ds mode and the al facing fs mode with initial toc concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l as reported by zhao et al the selection of the membrane orientation can be determined by the occurrence of the isoflux point the al facing fs mode was preferable when treated with the feed solution with a high fouling tendency because the isoflux point occurred earlier and vice versa as shown in figure s5 there was no isoflux point observed during the fo filtration of non concentrated natural water samples i e the fouling flux in the al facing ds mode was higher than that in the al facing fs mode throughout the 8 h fo experiments this suggested that the al facing ds mode could be more favorable when purifying natural surface water samples with low initial toc concentrations when natural water concentrated to the initial toc concentration of 10 mg l fig 3 the reduction of the fouling flux in the al facing fs mode was minor amounting to 0 01 0 01 0 03 and 0 01 for natural water sample 1 natural water sample 2 natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 respectively however the decline of the fouling flux in the alternative mode was obvious compared to the non concentrated water samples the reduction rates of the fouling flux of natural water sample 1 natural water sample 2 natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 were 0 17 0 22 0 27 and 0 30 respectively as a result the isoflux point occurred at an early stage of the fo filtration t 20 min of natural water sample 4 suggesting that the al facing fs mode could be more favorable for this sample when using the 10 mg l initial toc concentration as the initial toc concentration of the feed solution increased to 20 mg l the isoflux point occurred before half of the 8 h filtrations of all water samples and the occurrence time was t 10 min for natural water sample 4 t 120 min for natural water sample 1 t 180 min for natural water sample 2 and t 240 min for natural water sample 3 respectively because the isoflux points occurred earlier the al facing fs mode seemed to be more favorable for the high fo flux performance when using the 20 mg l initial toc concentration overall the occurrence of the isoflux point can be a fast and simple index for preliminarily selecting the favorable fo membrane orientation moreover for the practical treatment of natural surface waters using fo the selection of membrane orientation should take into account the effect of dom retention icp and membrane stability rather than any single factor she et al 2016 further synthetic evaluation of the membrane orientation selection should be conducted in addition to the isoflux point method the normalized flux during the purification of natural dom by the fo membrane is illustrated in fig 4 according to the negligible flux reduction 5 in the al facing fs orientation the al facing fs mode was preferable for the fo filtration of the high concentration feed and the concentrated water in nf at the expense of a more severe inherent icp and flux inefficiency the al facing ds mode showed a notably different fouling flux performance under the tested initial toc concentration of the four natural dom categories for the non concentrated raw water samples the normalized flux suffered a minor reduction 20 at the initial stage t 60 min then stabilized at the corresponding normalized flux level until the end of the fo filtration the normalized flux decline for the four natural dom categories after the fo filtration was more than 20 when the initial toc concentration increased to 10 mg l noting that the normalized flux reduction for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 was nearly 30 according to the conclusion of our previous study wang et al 2014 the more obvious flux loss for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 could be partially related to the higher calcium ion concentration as shown in table s1 in addition for both natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 the normalized flux increased gradually after the initial drastic drop and particularly showed a larger growth from 0 52 to 0 7 for natural water sample 4 this result was probably ascribed to the compensating icp effect which was explicated in our previous study wang et al 2016 the reduced icp caused by the initial faster flux decrease resulted in an increase in the effective driving force and thus compensated for the subsequent fo membrane fouling when the initial toc concentration increased to 20 mg l the final reduction of the normalized flux for all tested natural dom increased to more than 30 and nearly 40 for natural water sample 2 and natural water sample 4 moreover the normalized flux of the four natural dom categories showed different reduction trends with the increased initial toc concentration it was suggested that the critical initial toc concentration could occur for the fo filtration of natural water samples above which the feed could induce more significant membrane fouling this observation indicated that the efficiency of the fo filtration of natural water could be effectively enhanced if the initial toc concentration of feed were controlled under the critical value as expected the results showed that there was no apparent difference in the removal efficiency of natural dom with all the initial toc concentrations tested in the two fo membrane orientations stably attaining over 99 0 during the 8h filtration which was similar to the removal presented in previous studies on organic fouling wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the adsorption and retention of natural dom by the fo membrane with different membrane orientations are shown in figure s6 and figure s7 for each initial toc concentration tested based on the high retentions the fo membranes had a good purification efficiency of natural dom with different initial toc concentrations in both membrane orientations as shown in figure s7 the adsorption behavior of natural dom in the al facing ds mode was different from that found in our previous study on the fo fouling by tannic acid wang et al 2016 the increased initial toc concentration had a minor effect on the adsorption of natural dom during the entire filtration furthermore the limited dom adsorption of the four natural water samples had a distinguishable influence on the fouling flux which can be attributed to the distinct fouling behavior caused by various characteristics of natural dom to further analyze the fouling behavior of natural dom on the membrane surface a close scrutiny of the fouled membrane support layer tested with a natural dom with an initial toc concentration of 10mg l in the feed was shown by sem images in figure s8 as shown in figure s8 the dom fouling layer possessed sparse and loose structures possibly due to the minor accumulation of dom on the surface of the support layer and no hydraulic pressure applied during fo for natural water sample 4 only a slight deposition of an organic fouling layer packed with nacl crystals was observed on the membrane surface the extraction solution from the fouled membrane was also analyzed and shown in table s2 and figure s9 to elucidate the composition of the organic fouling layer as shown in table s2 the order of the uv254 and suva values of the dom in the extraction solution was similar to that of raw water suggesting that the aromatic compounds in the water samples such as humic substances adsorbed onto the fo membrane in addition the suva value of the extraction solution was lower than that of the raw water seen in table 1 suggesting that the proportion of aromatic dom in the fouling layer was minor compared to that in the raw water the eem of dom in the extraction solution was analyzed as shown in figure s9 there were two major protein like peaks located at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 230 300 350 nm peak b and 275 300 350 nm peak t in the extracted dom which can be designated as the fluorescence peaks of tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances this result indicated that the proteins in the water samples adsorbed onto the fo membrane since peak b is often associated with low molecular weight protein like matter marhaba et al 2000 it was suggested that more protein like doms with low mws were in the fouling layer due to the stronger fluorescence intensities of peak b compared to that of peak t as mentioned in section 3 1 2 compared to natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 contained more organic macromolecules with higher molecular weights according to the observation in our previous study wang et al 2016 and the analysis of the natural dom fouling behavior mentioned above these macromolecules such as alginate and proteins that accumulated on the membrane surface likely formed a loose fluid like cake layer with strong mobility and less adsorption which increased the thickness of the support layer this enhanced the hydraulic resistance to permeate water through the membrane resulting in a flux decline due to the minor effect on the fo fouling caused by the macromolecules wang et al 2016 the flux reduction of natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 during the entire filtration toc 10 mg l and the initial stage toc 20 mg l was lower than the other two water samples on the other hand natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 contained higher proportions of low mw dom such as humic compounds including tannic acid and their breakdown products leading to a greater foulant adsorption within the porous support layer and thus a reduction of the support layer porosity caused by the pore clogging based on eq 1 the decreased support layer porosity caused a greater structural parameter s and thus increased solute resistivity k this fouling behavior eventually aggravated icp and induced a more severe flux decline under the higher initial toc concentrations for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 3 3 effect of the draw solution concentration and the initial flux level the effect of the initial flux level i e the initial draw solution concentrations of nacl on the purification of natural water by fo under the initial toc concentration of 10 mg l is evaluated over an initial flux range of 8 36 l m2 h i e 0 5 4 0 m nacl as draw solution the results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a the initial fouling flux level of the four natural water samples increased with increasing draw solution concentrations due to the greater apparent osmotic driving force across the membrane caused by the greater concentration difference between the ds and fs however the higher initial flux level at the greater ds concentrations i e 2 m and 4 m induced a faster fouling flux drop at the early stage of the filtration of four water samples t 1 h then the flux decline became slower when the ds concentration increased to 4 m the order of the rate of the initial fouling flux reduction could be described as follows natural water sample 4 natural water sample 3 natural water sample 1 natural water sample 2 this result was similar to the order of the proportion of dom with a low mw in natural water samples seen in fig 2 b suggesting that the rate of the initial fouling flux decline was related to the relative concentration of small molecules in the water as mentioned in a previous study a greater permeation drag induced by the higher initial flux has a significant effect on the small molecules entrapped in the porous support layer therefore natural water sample 4 which contained a higher proportion of low molecular dom caused the most severe fo membrane fouling and the fastest flux decline however the lower proportion of low molecular dom contained in natural water sample 2 induced the slowest flux decline overall this result suggests that greater ds concentrations might play a greater role in the fouling flux of lower molecular dom contained in natural water by the fo membrane in fig 5 b the notable normalized flux loss 20 occurred when the ds concentration increased to 1 m for the four water samples it is noteworthy that the normalized flux of natural water sample 2 increased gradually after 4h due to the compensating icp effect which has a more favorable effect on the water flux than membrane fouling the time point of 4h was defined as the critical compensation point representing the equilibrium moment between the two effects of compensating icp and membrane fouling at the critical compensation point the normalized flux which was decreased by membrane fouling would be equivalent to that when increased by the compensating icp when the ds concentration increased to 2 m the critical compensation point occurred at 1 5h for natural water sample 3 and 0 5h for natural water sample 4 meanwhile the corresponding fouling flux was 15 5 l m2 h and 14 2 l m2 h respectively it was suggested that the more decreased the initial fouling flux and consequently the more reduced the icp the earlier the critical compensation point occurred i e the less time it took for the effect of compensating icp to exceed the effect of membrane fouling on the flux at the end of fo filtration when the ds concentration increased to 4 m natural water sample 4 had the highest flux reduction 50 among the four water samples the critical compensation point for natural water sample 1 natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 occurred at 5h 4 5h and 3 5h respectively the corresponding fouling fluxes meanwhile were 18 3 l m2 h 16 4 l m2 h and 13 4 l m2 h this result verifies the interrelation between the critical compensation point and the fouling flux level the compensation effect of the reduced icp on the membrane fouling depends on its initial weakening degree the critical flux defined as a flux above which significant membrane fouling occurred when the corresponding final normalized flux decreased to 0 8 or lower observed by our previous study wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 also occurred for the four water samples it was indicated that natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 were prone to induce severe membrane fouling due to the lower critical flux the fo membrane in the al facing ds mode could efficiently reject the natural dom above 99 0 for all the ds concentrations tested over the 8 h filtration suggesting that there was no significant effect of the initial flux level on the removal of the natural dom in the feed as shown in figure s10 the retention of natural dom by the fo membranes was all above 94 under the tested ds concentrations indicating that the increased initial flux level had a minor effect on the retention efficiency of natural dom however the adsorption of the natural dom was maximal when the ds concentration increased to 4 m for all the feed water samples tested resulting in the corresponding minimal retention this result suggested that the increased permeation drag induced by the higher initial flux promoted the adsorption of natural dom within the porous support layer to further elucidate the adsorption behavior of natural dom during the 8 h fo filtration the membrane resistances when the ds concentration was 4 m were also measured and shown in figure s11 as shown in figure s11 the total membrane resistance rt of natural water sample 4 was the highest due to its minimal final fouling flux for all the water samples the fouling resistance rp was notably higher than the fouling resistance rs which indicated that more natural dom were entrapped within the porous support layer in order to further analyze the mechanism of the effect of the initial flux level on the filtration of four water samples by fo the ratio of ki k0 was proposed to reflect the degree of icp during fo membrane fouling by water samples in the ratio of ki k0 the terms ki and k0 presented the solute resistivities of the foulant water at the end of the filtration and the baseline water at the start of the filtration respectively the larger the ratio the more severe the icp caused by the foulant water the ki and k0 were determined by eq 2 the result is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the ki k0 of four water samples was greater than 1 0 which suggested that the icp caused by the membrane fouling was more severe than the inherent icp during the filtration of pure water under the influence of the initial flux the ki k0 of natural water sample 4 increased notably with the increasing initial concentration of ds indicating that the greater permeation drag caused by the increased initial flux had a significant effect on the icp induced by membrane fouling according to the results of our previous experiments and the analysis of membrane resistances in figure s11 the greater permeation drag had a more pronounced impact on the small molecules such as tannic acid entrapped in the porous layer than that on the transport of alginate macromolecules toward the fo membrane support layer the results above are consistent with the characteristics of the molecular weight distribution of natural water sample 4 which contained a larger proportion of small molecules in contrast the ki k0 of natural water sample 1 had an indistinct growth trend with the increase of the initial ds concentration due to the relatively higher proportion of macromolecules contained in this sample 3 4 effect of ionic strength due to the increased ionic strength in the concentrated natural water the effect of the ionic strength calcium ions on the fo performance was illustrated for both raw and concentrated water samples in addition in order to identify the different influences on the fo membrane fouling by the initial concentration of toc and calcium ions in the feed solution the concentration of calcium ions in the tested water samples was adjusted to the identical level seen in table s1 as the same kind of water with toc concentration of 20 mg l the results are shown in fig 7 the baseline flux was no obvious change under conditions identical to the corresponding fouling test thus the initial fluxes were similar in all the baseline tests seen in figure s12 and figure s13 the effect of adding calcium ions on the fo flux in the purification of raw and concentrated water samples with a 10 mg l initial toc concentration is illustrated in fig 7 a for the non concentrated raw water the fo flux decreased dramatically as the ca2 concentration increased and the most severe flux reduction was approximately 20 for natural water sample 4 according to the decreasing trend of the normalized fluxes the critical compensation point was only present at 1 h for natural water sample 3 then the normalized flux increased from 0 64 to 0 70 the more notable flux reduction extent for natural water sample 4 was partially ascribed to the higher ca2 concentration 7 2 mm in the feed which could induce more severe fo membrane fouling on the other hand as the results discussed in our previous study wang et al 2016 the calcium ions had a more significant effect on the fo fouling by the small tannic acid like organic molecules compared to that by the macro alginate like molecules accordingly the increased ca2 concentration could cause a more severe fo flux loss due to the higher concentration proportion of low mw dom of natural water sample 4 as shown in fig 7 a when the initial toc concentration was 10 mg l the normalized flux reductions for all the water samples were minor after the calcium ions were added into the feed this observation suggests that the increased ca2 concentration had a minor effect on the fouling flux in fo under the higher initial toc concentration of the natural water this effect was attributed to the lower initial fouling flux level before the addition of the calcium ions and the limited availability of carboxylic functional groups in natural dom which can further bind with the added calcium ions the permeate flux declined as the initial toc concentration increased from the raw level to 20 mg l under the condition of identical ca2 concentration clearly shown as the fouling flux in fig 7 b unlike the results observed before the addition of calcium ions the lower initial toc concentration could induce severe fo membrane fouling under the effect of high ca2 concentration for natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 the more severe normalized flux reduction 10 occurred as the initial toc concentration increased under the condition of identical ca2 concentrations however minor normalized flux decline 5 occurred for the other two water samples this observation could be ascribed to the higher ca2 concentration added into natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 which had a more significant effect on the flux reduction compared to the increased initial toc concentration since the concentration of toc and calcium ions increased simultaneously in the concentrated water in nf more analysis was performed in fig 8 which focused on the different effects of the increased toc and calcium ion concentrations on the normalized flux reduction at the end of fo filtration as shown in fig 8 when the concentration factor was 4 the normalized flux loss of natural water sample 2 was 16 under the effect of a ca2 concentration which was higher than that 14 under the effect of an initial toc concentration as the concentration factor increased to 8 for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 the decline of the normalized flux was notably higher 17 and 20 respectively under the effect of a ca2 concentration than that 5 and 7 respectively under the effect of an initial toc concentration with the exception of natural water sample 1 for similar concentration factors the higher normalized flux reduction occurred under the influence of a ca2 concentration compared to an initial toc concentration this result indicated that the removal of hardness ions such as calcium and magnesium ions from the feed solution was favorable to alleviate the effect of the water sample concentration on the performance of fo filtration no significant effect of increasing the concentration of ca2 on natural dom removal by the fo membrane was observed the natural dom removal for all the ca2 concentrations studied was over 99 0 figure s14 shows the adsorption and retention of the dom contained in the four natural water samples by the fo membrane before and after the addition of calcium with the initial toc concentration of 5 mg l or 2 mg l and 10 mg l in feed for comparison figure s14 also shows the adsorption and retention of each water sample when the initial toc concentration was 20 mg l in figure s14 except for natural water sample 1 there was no apparent difference among the dom retention efficiency after the addition of calcium all remaining above 94 however the adsorption of natural dom before and after adding calcium for the four water samples was different for natural water sample 1 the adsorption of natural dom after calcium addition at both toc concentrations was higher than that before calcium addition and the adsorption of dom at the end of filtration was similar to that when the initial toc concentration was 20 mg l 30 μg cm2 this differs from the result of the previous tannic acid fouling experiment under the influence of calcium ionic strength wang et al 2014 the result may be attributed to the lower flux decline after calcium addition for this sample leading to the less reduced permeation drag that did not countervail the favorable effect of the higher calcium concentration on increasing the dom adsorption for natural water sample 4 the dom adsorption after adding calcium was slightly lower than that before adding calcium under the tested toc concentrations as a previous study explained wang et al 2016 the effect of the limited dom adsorption on the more severe flux decline was related to more dom with lower molecular weight compounds contained in natural water sample 4 the higher ca2 concentration caused the formation of more small coiled calcium micromolecule complexes resulting in the more compact fouling layer of small molecules within the porous support layer as discussed in section 3 2 severe internal clogging reduced the porosity of the support layer consequently enhancing the structural parameter s and thus increasing the solute resistivity k i e more severe icp together these effects led to a more severe flux reduction after calcium addition 3 5 fouling mechanisms of natural dom in order to further explore the mechanism of the influence of natural dom on the performance of the fo process the initial toc concentration and the ionic strength of the four raw water samples were adjusted to be similar to that in the initial condition a toc concentration at 2 mg l an ionic strength at about 7 2 mm nacl and a ca2 concentration at about 1 1 mm the initial toc concentration was adjusted with milli q water while the total conductivity was adjusted by adding nacl and the ca2 concentration was adjusted by adding cacl2 the adjusted water sample was used as the feed solution and 2 m nacl was used as ds based on these conditions the approximated effect of natural dom on the fo performance is illustrated in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a compared with the other two water samples the fouling flux of natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 decreased more significantly in the early stage of filtration t 2 h the normalized flux of natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 seen in fig 9 b remained relatively stable and reached 0 9 at the end of the filtration however for natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 the normalized flux increased gradually due to the compensating icp effect the result showed that the fo membrane rejected the four natural dom categories at or above 99 0 under the tested conditions as fig 9 c shows there was a minor difference in the adsorption and retention of the natural dom by the fo membrane by the end of the filtration the dom adsorption for natural water sample 1 gradually increased to 20 μg cm2 and thus the retention for this water decreased to the minimal value 88 compared with the other three water samples xdlvo theory was used to elucidate the effect of natural dom on the filtration performance of the fo membrane the cohesive free energy of the four natural dom categories and the membrane are listed in table s3 and table s4 according to the free energy of cohesion shown in table s3 it was revealed that the cohesive free energy of dom in the four natural water samples was negative indicating that these natural dom in the feed solutions were hydrophobic unstable and favored coagulation the negative cohesive free energy of dom in raw water can be ranked as follows natural water sample 4 natural water sample 2 natural water sample 3 natural water sample 1 this predicted that the dom in natural water sample 4 had a more negative hydrophobic energy of cohesion which was possibly attributed to the lower mw humic organic molecules in this water that generally showed the stronger hydrophobic cohesion energy as reported by other study jermann et al 2008 in addition the dom in natural water sample 1 had a less negative energy of cohesion suggesting that the dom in this raw water solution was more hydrophilic which agreed with the result that natural water sample 1 contained more hydrophilic macromolecular organic matter seen in section 3 1 2 in addition the higher acid base component of surface tension γ ab of the dom in natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 indicated that there were stronger interaction forces between the chemical bonds of molecules during the coagulation of these natural dom molecules resulting in the dense fouling layer and thus a more severe flux decline in the fo filtration meanwhile the acid base component was obviously lower for natural water sample 1 and natural water sample 2 suggesting that the natural dom in the two water samples could be prone to form a loose fouling layer and thus a less notable flux reduction the free energy of adhesion shown in table 2 signifies the interaction energy between the foulant and the membrane surface during membrane filtration the more negative free energy of adhesion indicated the greater the foulant membrane attraction and the easier it was for the foulants to be adsorbed within the membrane pore or deposited on the membrane surface as presented in table 2 for the support layer the free energy of adhesion of natural water sample 4 was the highest most negative value suggesting that the stronger attraction between the dom in this water sample and the membrane and thus the easily occurred adsorption on the membrane that caused the membrane fouling the adhesion free energy of dom in natural water sample 1 was the lowest which indicated that the dom can induce less severe membrane fouling in addition considering the free energy of adhesion for the support layer and the active layer of the fo membrane the adhesion free energy between the support layer and the natural dom was stronger than the active layer signifying that more natural dom fouling could occur on the support layer compared to the active layer this is consistent with the trend of the fouling flux decline in both membrane orientations permeation drag forces brought the dom molecules close to the membrane surface but the chemical interactions caused the actual binding of the dom to the membrane therefore the adhesion free energy between the natural dom and the membrane support layer was likely to dictate the initial membrane flux decline as shown in fig 9 a the initial flux decline of natural water sample 4 decreased more significantly which is in good agreement with the result that the free energy of adhesion between the dom in this water and the membrane support layer was stronger this indicated that the increasingly negative free energy of adhesion could induce more severe initial flux decline likewise the initial flux reduction of natural water sample 1 sample decreased less obviously strongly suggesting once again that the influence of the adhesion free energy on the initial flux decrease however as filtration progressed the fo membrane surface gradually became covered with foulants hence the free energy of cohesion between approaching foulant molecules in the feed and the already adsorbed foulants controlled the subsequent fouling flux decline as shown in fig 9 a after the 8 h filtration the higher flux decline of natural water sample 4 signified that the more negative cohesion energy can cause the more notable flux decline overall the four natural dom categories have a distinguishing fouling behavior during fo filtration fig 10 illustrates the interaction mechanisms involved in the fouling of the natural dom because the lower mw humic organic molecules contained in natural water sample 4 had stronger attractive interactions the adhesion free energy with the surface of the membrane support layer these small dom molecules were favorably entrapped in the porous support layer under the effect of the permeation drag caused by the initial flux on the other hand the adsorbed organic foulants tended to form a more compact fouling layer even with a minor adsorption amount which was attributed to the greater attractive hydrophobic interactions negative cohesion energy and acid base ab interactions γ ab amongst the dom molecules however due to the lower adhesion free energy between the dom molecules and the membrane support layer more hydrophilic dom macromolecules contained in natural water sample 1 have deposited on the surface of the support layer under the permeation drag force and gradually formed a looser fouling layer influenced by minor attractive interactions among the dom macromolecules although the attractive interactions between the dom and the surface of the membrane support layer were similar similar adhesion energy values for natural water sample 2 and natural water sample 3 more small dom molecules contained in natural water sample 3 were more easily trapped in the porous structure under the identical permeation drag force level thus forming the denser fouling layer this observation was ascribed to the stronger acid base ab interactions amongst the dom foulants causing a more severe initial flux decline compared to natural water sample 2 in addition due to the icp that occurred in the fo process the greater initial flux reduction for natural water sample 3 and sample 4 reduced the icp effect and compensated for the subsequent flux loss induced by membrane fouling and thus reduced the flux decline the compensating icp may have some effect on the purification of natural dom by fo 4 conclusion the purpose of this study was to investigate the physical and chemical factors influencing water fluxes and retention behaviors of natural dom contained in four real surface water samples by the fo membrane it was observed that the selection of membrane orientation was influenced by the concentration of the natural dom when using fo membranes for purifying feed solutions with lower fouling tendencies such as raw surface water and concentrated water of lower concentrations the al facing ds was more preferable to obtain a higher flux level depending on the isoflux points that were not observed the appearance of a critical compensation point suggested the effect of membrane fouling on the subsequent flux decline would be compensated by that of the reduced icp as caused by the previously decreased flux in the al facing ds mode the concentration degree of natural dom had a more significant impact on the flux decline of natural water sample 3 and natural water sample 4 which contained more small dom molecules under similar concentration factors the concentrated ca2 level played a more significant role in the fo flux reduction than the increased initial toc concentration the permeation drag caused by water fluxes and chemical interactions induced by the feed solution s ph and calcium ion concentrations played important roles in the adsorption of smaller natural dom molecules in the porous structure of the fo membrane the interactions between the natural dom and the surface of the support layer dominated the initial fouling of the fo membrane while subsequent fouling was governed by the interaction between the approaching dom molecules and the already adsorbed dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are man made chemicals with useful properties including being resistant to most degradation processes acting as surfactants and being repellent to both water and oil these physicochemical properties have led to pfass being used extensively in various industries such as the metal plating and photolithography industries and during the production of cleaning products hydraulic fluids pesticides semiconductors and textiles kissa 2001 rahman et al 2014 increasing awareness of the potential toxicities of pfass to humans and the persistence of pfass in the environment led to restrictions on the use of some pfass being imposed so a limited number of pfas products are now in use perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are included in the stockholm convention unep 2019a and it has been proposed that perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs should be added unep 2019b demand for compounds with similar properties to pfass that have been banned has led to chemically similar alternatives being developed and these novel pfass have been detected in various environmental matrices oecd 2015 wang et al 2017 it is generally assumed that industrial plants are major sources of pfass to the aquatic environment because of the widespread industrial use of pfass dauchy et al 2017 gebbink et al 2017 kemi 2017 rahman et al 2014 wang et al 2013 2014 little information is readily available on the amounts of pfass produced around the world mainly because such information is considered confidential by the manufacturers however it has been estimated from publicly available information that as much as 5510 t of pfass will have been produced across the world between 2016 and 2030 oecd 2015 wang et al 2014 major sources of pfass to the environment include plants producing biocides cosmetics electronic equipment foam based fire fighting chemicals paper synthetic chemicals and polymers and textiles kemi 2017 pfoa and pfos have previously been used in more applications and in larger quantities than the other pfass however pfoa and pfos can now only be used in few applications so alternative fluorinated substances have been developed these include short chain pfass fluorotelomers and perfluoropolyethers one such compound 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoro 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 heptafluoropropoxy propanoic acid genx was introduced by dupont in 2010 pan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 others such as 3h perfluoro 3 3 methoxy propoxy propanoic acid adona have also been in use for several years janousek et al 2019 wang et al 2013 alternative pfass use has increased as pfoa and pfos use has gradually been phased out in japan the usa and western european countries heydebreck et al 2015 janousek et al 2019 land et al 2018 nakayama et al 2019 industrial effluent has been found to be the main source of alternative pfass to the aquatic environment in these countries dauchy et al 2017 gebbink et al 2017 novel pfass such as genx have been detected downstream of a fluorochemical plant in the netherlands at concentrations up to 812 ng l 1 gebbink et al 2017 other alternative pfass such as fluorotelomers have been found to contribute 99 of the 3 kg d 1 of pfass discharged into a river in france from a fluorochemical plant dauchy et al 2017 moving to alternative pfass has been predicted to be much slower in other countries wang et al 2014 in studies in korea kim et al 2016 2012 kwon et al 2017 and china heydebreck et al 2015 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2016 legacy pfass were found still to be in wide industrial use even after they were included in the stockholm convention industries that use pfass e g the ceramic electronic and synthetic polymer industries have undergone marked growth since regulations of pfass were introduced there is therefore a need to update information on the use of legacy and novel pfass by industries in countries like korea with growing economies and to assess the impacts these industries have on pfass concentrations in the aquatic environment the aim of this study was to determine whether the use of pfass at korean industrial plants reflects changes in regulations and to assess the extent to which regulations have affected pfass emissions to the aquatic environment previous studies were focused on particular industries at the national scale kim et al 2016 2012 but this intensive study was focused on a single industrial complex containing more than 70 industrial plants producing ceramics electronic equipment electroplated metals polymers textiles and other items the concentrations of 28 legacy and novel pfass in raw wastewater samples from the industrial plants effluent samples from wastewater treatment plants and water samples from the river receiving wastewater from the industrial complex were determined and the results were compared with the results of previous studies to assess temporal changes in pfass use 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials the

methanol and milli q water were purchased from j t baker phillipsburg nj usa 2 2 sample preparation the samples were extracted and cleaned up to allow pfass to be determined using a method described by kim et al 2020 with minor modifications briefly a 100 ml or 10 2 or 0 2 ml as appropriate aliquot of a water sample was passed through a glass microfiber filter whatman gf f 0 45 μm pores 47 mm diameter ge healthcare bio sciences pittsburgh pa usa the sample was then spiked with 50 μl of a solution containing each internal standard at a concentration of 100 ng ml 1 a solid phase extraction cartridge oasis wax 200 mg 6 cm3 waters milford ma usa was conditioned with in sequence 4 ml of meoh containing 0 1 ammonia 4 ml of meoh and 4 ml of water the sample was loaded onto the cartridge then the cartridge was washed with 6 ml of 25 mm ammonium acetate and then dried for 30 min the cartridge was then eluted with meoh containing 0 1 ammonia the extract was evaporated to 500 μl using a turbo vap ii system caliper life sciences hopkinton ma usa the extract was then diluted with 1 ml of meoh then 50 μl of a mixture of recovery standards each at a concentration of 100 ng ml 1 were added 2 3 instrumental analysis the pfas concentrations in the extracts were determined by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using an agilent 1200 hplc system with a 6460 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa a binary mobile phase gradient 2 mm ammonium acetate in water and methanol was used and the mass spectrometer

long 3 5 μm particles agilent technologies to prevent pfass contamination during instrumental analysis polytetrafluoroethylene parts in the pump autosampler and solvent line were replaced with polyethylene and stainless steel parts the instrumental conditions quantification limits and other information are shown in tables s2 and s3 2 4 sample collection and industry classification samples of industrial wastewater and river water were collected on six different days in a two week period in may 2018 a schematic showing the locations of the sampling points is shown in fig 1 a total of 79 influent and 66 effluent wastewater samples were collected from 77 industrial plants at an industrial complex in the upper midstream part of the nakdong river only 66 effluent samples were collected because wastewater from 13 of the plants is discharged directly to a mixed industrial and domestic wastewater treatment plant mwtp more than 77 influent samples were collected because three influent samples were collected from one industrial plant the selected industrial plants were suspected of emitting pfass and were broadly classed as producing and or processing advanced electronic equipment n 14 batteries n 4 chemicals n 4 general electronic equipment n 6 glass and ceramics n 10 metals n 15 polymers n 7 and textiles n 17 general descriptions of the processes used and the products of each type of industrial plant are shown in table 1 the industrial plants that were selected are in the largest industrial complex in south korea this complex has been operating since 1969 wastewater from the industrial complex is discharged into the nakdong river through two mwtps both mwtps use conventional treatment processes a grit chamber primary sedimentation a bioreactor secondary sedimentation sand filtration and uv treatment but the bioreactor in mwtp 1 is a daewoo nutrient removal system and the bioreactor in mwtp 2 uses advanced oxidation processes the effects of industrial wastewater emissions on pfass concentrations in the aquatic environment receiving the wastewater were assessed by analyzing river water samples collected from two sampling points one upstream and the other downstream of the industrial complex after the first sampling campaign conducted in may 2018 additional river water samples were collected on one day in august and another day in october 2019 on each sampling day river water samples were collected at 18 sites upstream of near and downstream of the industrial complex at each sampling site a 1 l water sample was collected using the grab sampling method the water samples were stored at 20 c in polypropylene containers until they were analyzed 2 5 quality assurance quality control the correlation coefficients r2 for the calibration curves for all 28 pfass were 0 99 each calibration curve had at least five points with the range of 0 1 to 200 ng ml 1 individual pfass were quantified using the internal standard method and the internal standards are listed in table s2 the volume of each sample was selected to ensure that the concentrations of the pfass in the prepared sample extract were within the calibration curve concentration ranges see table s2 the relative standard deviations of the relative response factors for the compounds in the calibration solutions were all within 15 a procedural blank sample hplc grade water was analyzed with every batch n 10 of samples and an instrumental blank was also analyzed to assess contamination during the experimental and analytical procedures the concentrations of each target compound in the blank samples were below the method detection limit defined as the concentration giving a signal to noise ratio of 3 the limits of detection for the target compounds were 0 86 10 7 ng l 1 to assess the accuracy and precision of determination of target pfas in industrial wastewater samples the target pfass were spiked in triplicate into a composite sample of industrial wastewater each 200 ml composite sample was spiked with 5 ng of each of the 28 native standards 5 ng and the concentrations were determined accuracy and precision in the determination of spiked standards were calculated by subtracting the concentrations of residues in the composite samples that were not spiked detailed accuracy and precision information are presented in the supplementary material table s2 the recoveries for all of the samples were 84 5 21 3 mean std deviation for perfluoro n 1 2 13c2 hexanoic acid 84 3 13 2 for perfluoro n 1 2 3 4 13c4 octanoic acid 85 3 13 0 for perfluoro n 1 2 3 4 5

defined as the pfass concentration ng l 1 multiplied by the daily flow rate m3 d 1 for the wastewater treatment plant or river as shown in eq 1 1 pfass daily mass load ng d 1 c i f i 10 3 l m 3 where ci is the pfass concentration at site i industrial wastewater treatment plant iwtp mwtp or river ng l 1 and fi is the daily flow rate at the site i m3 d 1 the contributions of pfass in industrial wastewater to pfass in mwtp effluent and surface water were calculated using eq 2 the contributions of the iwtp effluents to the influents of the two mwtps and from the effluents of the two mwtps to the river water were calculated 2 contribution of industrial wastewater to pfass in mwtp effluent or surface water i 1 n c e i f e i i 1 n c r i f r i 100 in eq 2 ce i is the pfass concentration in

at the iwtps and mwtps and for the river water samples are shown in table 2 the pfass dfs and concentrations for the influent and effluent wastewater samples were not markedly different of the 28 pfass compounds that were analyzed 19 and 18 were detected in the iwtp influent and effluent samples respectively the mean total pfass concentrations in the iwtp influent and effluent samples were 7290 ng l 1 range limit of quantification to 479 000 ng l 1 and 5180 ng l 1 range limit of quantification to 229 000 ng l 1 respectively these results agreed well with the results of a previous study in which negligible removal efficiencies were found for pfass during wastewater treatment processes huset et al 2008 as shown in table 2 pfass with fewer than eight carbon atoms were detected more often and at higher concentrations than pfass with eight or more carbon atoms the pfcas pfba and pfhxa had dfs of 49 71 for the influent samples and 51 76 for the effluent samples pfhxs had the highest dfs of the pfsas 90 for the influent samples and 57 for the effluent samples high pfhxs concentrations were found in both the influent and effluent industrial wastewater samples the highest pfhxs concentration in the influent samples was 469 μg l 1 and the mean was 10 8 μg l 1 in previous studies pfos and pfoa were the dominant pfass in river water lam et al 2016 and wastewater treatment plant samples kim et al 2016 kwon et al 2017 but in this study other pfass with less than seven carbon atoms were found at higher concentrations than pfos and pfoa the dominance of these homologs in the industrial wastewater samples corresponded with the concentrations of these homologs recently found in nakdong river water park et al 2018 industrial wastewater in south korea has not previously been found to contain ftss but ftss were found in lake water rain river water and snow in south korea in one previous study kim and kannan 2007 we detected 6 2 fts in one river sample from river site b 12 iwtp influent samples df 15 one iwtp effluent sample and the mwtp 1 influent sample another fts 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecane sulfonate was detected in one sample in each group of influent and effluent samples the 6 2 fts concentrations in the influent and effluent samples ranged from below the limit of detection to 145 ng l 1 mean 39 9 ng l 1 and from below the limit of detection to 2 35 ng l 1 respectively the 6 2 fts concentrations and dfs were probably lower in the iwtp effluent samples than the iwtp influent samples because of a combination of degradation and sorption to sludge wang et al 2011 emerging pfass f53b genx and adona were not detected in any of the samples f53b is used as a pfos alternative wang et al 2013 the pfoa alternatives genx and adona wang et al 2013 have previously been detected in river water gebbink et al 2017 heydebreck et al 2015 pan et al 2018 sun et al 2016 and drinking water gebbink et al 2017 in other countries however these compounds do not seem to have been used in south korea when this study was performed this is probably because other pfass e g pfbs pfhxs and pfhxa are available and appear to have been the preferred replacements for pfoa and pfos in the industrial complex used in this study 3 2 concentrations and distributions of pfass in the samples from each type of industry and the amounts of pfass emitted by each type of industry the pfass patterns in wastewater emitted by the different industry types were investigated by assessing the concentrations and patterns of pfass with different chemical structures pfcas pfsas and ftss in the different samples and the results are shown in fig 2 samples with pfass concentrations 1 µg l 1 were found in the advanced electronic metal polymer and textile plant wastewaters compared to other types of industries advanced electronics had a higher proportion of samples n 14 with pfass concentrations 100 ng l 1 64 n 9 and 1 µg l 1 35 n 5 the pfass patterns in the advanced electronic plant samples had relatively high pfsa contributions compared with the patterns in the other types of industries three of the five samples with total pfass concentrations 1 µg l 1 were dominated by pfsa 90 the metal polymer and textile plant samples with pfass concentrations 1 µg l 1 did not have particularly high pfsas contributions however the pfca contributions were higher than the other pfas contributions for all of the textile plant samples in which pfass were detected n 18 but not for three samples that had low pfas concentrations from sites t 15 t 16 and t 18 the polymer plant samples had high fts contributions the 6 2 fts contribution was particularly high and this fts had higher dfs and contributions for the polymer plant samples than for the other plant samples pfcas were the dominant pfass in the iwtp influent samples for the other types of industrial plants general electronic glass and ceramic battery and chemical plants that had low pfass concentrations the concentrations of individual pfcas and pfsas for each type of industrial plant are shown in fig 3 the data varied widely so median values were used like in a previous study of pollutants in industrial wastewater kim et al 2016 the median short chain pfca concentrations were higher than the median longer chain pfca concentrations for most industry types in particular the pfba concentration was about 10 times higher than the concentrations of the other pfcas that were detected the glass and ceramic textile and general electronic plant samples had the three highest median pfba concentrations 145 120 and 115 ng l 1 respectively the samples from all of the industry types contained pfpea but the median concentrations for all of the industry types except the polymer industry were 10 ng l 1 pfhxa was detected in fewer samples but at higher median concentrations than pfpea the highest median pfhxa concentrations were found in the advanced electronic plant samples 40 3 ng l 1 and textile industry samples 29 2 ng l 1 the legacy pfas pfoa is being phased out and was found at concentrations of 10 ng l 1 however one metal industry sample contained pfoa at a concentration of 1000 ng l 1 the variations in pfoa concentrations may have been caused by differences in raw materials and processes used in the different industries the median pfsa concentrations were slightly lower than the median concentrations of the corresponding pfcas for every industry type fig 3 however the pfsa pattern was different from the pfca pattern particularly in that the pfhxs concentrations in the advanced electronic plant samples were high the median pfhxs concentration for the advanced electronic plant samples was not markedly different from the median pfhxs concentration for the other industry types but the advanced electronic plant samples had the highest mean pfhxs concentration because the pfhxs concentrations were almost 100 times higher in two samples than in the other samples fig 3c and 3d the advanced electronic industry wastewater samples also contained high concentrations of pfbs pfpes and pfos two thirds of the samples in which pfpes was detected were samples from solar panel and monitor display manufacturing plants solar panel manufacturing involves semiconductor photolithography processes that involve the use of products containing pfhxs giesy and kannan 2002 lin et al 2009 pfhxs was the dominant pollutant in the advanced electronic industry wastewater samples and the pfbs and pfos concentrations were 1 4 of the pfhxs concentrations pfoa was found at concentrations of 15 4 ng l 1 in two of the influent samples the impact of the industrial complex on the nakdong river was assessed by calculating the relative contributions of pfass in industrial wastewater to the pfas loads in mwtp wastewater and river water using eq 2 the iwtp effluents and uncharacterized wastewater influents were assumed to be the sources of pfass to the mwtps upstream river water at site a and the effluents from the mwtps were assumed to be the sources of pfass to the downstream river water uncharacterized non point sources of pfass would have also supplied pfass to the river water the estimated relative contributions of the industrial complex and other pfass sources to the pfas loads in the mwtp wastewater and river water at site b are shown in fig 4 the mwtps are used to treat domestic sewage and industrial wastewater from industrial plants we studied and others industrial plants in the industrial complex contributed 99 of the pfass entering the mwtps pfhxs and some short chain pfass were mainly emitted by industrial plants whereas pfos and pfoa were mainly from other sources including domestic sewage wastewater discharged from the mwtps contributed 30 of the total pfass mass load in the downstream river water at site b pfass contamination of the river water upstream of the mwtps where there are no point sources such as industrial plants and wastewater treatment plants contributed 5 of the total pfass mass load in the downstream river water the remainder 60 of the total pfass mass load in the downstream river water had unidentified sources such as industrial and residential areas within the river catchment the industrial complex we studied is clearly an important source of pfass to the nakdong river catchment but other sources are also important 3 3 temporal changes in the pfas concentrations the pfas mass loads in industrial wastewater discharged into the environment in korea have been estimated in previous studies kim et al 2012 estimated the amounts of pfass discharged into the aquatic environment in korea in 2010 using data for selected treatment plants receiving domestic and industrial wastewater they estimated that industrial wastewater contributed 23 of pfass emitted into the aquatic environment kim et al 2016 studied 25 iwtps and estimated the amounts of pfass discharged by chemical electronic metal paper and textile plants in korea in both studies c8 pfass pfoa and pfos contributed at least 70 of the amounts of pfass discharged kim et al 2012 2016 these studies were performed after pfos was included in the stockholm convention but alternatives to pfos were not included in the studies kim et al 2016 did not include pfbs even though in previous studies it had already been found that pfbs was used widely particularly in the electronics industry we compared the results of this study with the results of previous studies to assess temporal changes in pfas use and concentrations in water receiving wastewater temporal changes in pfas emissions from industrial plants were assessed using the relative contributions of individual pfass to the total pfas concentrations in industrial wastewater in this study and in 2012 kim et al 2016 to allow the data to be compared advanced electronics and general electronics were combined as electronics and data for only eight pfcas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfunda pfdoda and pftrda and three pfsas pfhxs pfos and pfds that were included in the 2012 data were considered as shown in fig 5 the relative contributions of pfass with more than seven carbon atoms to the total pfas concentrations in wastewater discharged by most industry types decreased between 2012 and this study the pfca contributions to the total pfas concentrations had changed particularly markedly for the chemical and textile industries the dominant pfas species discharged by chemical plants and textile plants in 2012 were pfoa 49 of the total pfass concentration and pfhpa 60 of the total pfass concentration respectively but the dominant pfass species discharged by both chemical plants and textile plants in 2018 was pfhxa 84 95 of the total pfass concentration for the metal industry pfdoda was the dominant homolog in 2012 but pfoa was the dominant homolog in 2018 the metal industry is the only one of the industry types we studied that still predominantly uses a c8 homolog the pfsa use patterns also changed markedly between 2012 and 2018 the pfhxs contributions to the total pfsa concentrations in the samples for all of the industry types were higher in 2018 than 2012 and pfhxs was the dominant homolog for all of the industry types except the textile industry in 2018 pfos was the dominant pfsa for the textile industry pfds was detected in 2012 but was not detected in our textile industry samples the change from using long chain pfass to using shorter chain pfass was intended to decrease the concentrations of long chain pfass in environmental media however the concentrations of the replacement pfass in environmental media are likely to increase because of the change industrial wastewater has been discharged into the nakdong river for many years so the concentrations of pollutants in nakdong river water have been monitored in numerous studies temporal changes in pfas concentrations in nakdong river water caused by changes in pfass use in industrial plants were assessed by comparing pfas concentrations found in nakdong river water samples between 2007 and 2019 and the results are shown in fig 6 it was not possible to directly compare concentrations of pfcas with fewer than six carbon atoms because these compounds were not analyzed in the earlier studies cho et al 2010 lam et al 2016 some different compounds were analyzed in the different studies but the results indicated that pfas concentrations in nakdong river water increased between 2007 and 2018 cho et al 2010 although it was not possible to account for seasonal variations due the results clearly indicated that pfass use has changed over time in response to international regulations restricting the use of pfos in 2009 the mean concentrations of pfass with more than seven carbon atoms decreased over time but the concentration of pfass with fewer than seven carbon atoms increased between 2007 and 2018 this trend was most pronounced for pfhxs for which the mean concentrations increased from 7 8 ng l 1 in 2007 cho et al 2010 to 100 ng l 1 in 2017 and 2018 kim et al 2020 however the mean pfhxs concentration had decreased by two orders of magnitude in 2019 probably because of the decision by industrial companies to eliminate pfhxs from manufacturing processes after an incident in june 2018 in which tap water was contaminated with pfhxs yong et al 2020 moe 2018 in contrast the mean pfos concentration decreased from 52 ng l 1 in 2007 to 2 ng l 1 in 2017 2019 this would have been caused by decreases in pfos use in industrial plants caused by regulation of pfos use as shown in fig 6 the concentrations of pfass with more than eight carbon atoms also decreased over time and these pfass were hardly detected in the samples collected in 2018 and 2019 however the concentrations of pfoa which was recently added to the list of persistent organic pollutants regulated by the stockholm convention pfhpa and pfhxa did not change markedly over time as the mean concentrations of these compounds were of the same order of magnitude between 2007 and 2019 the use of restricted compounds in industrial plants has clearly decreased over time but these compounds will probably continue to be released into the environment by old products and landfills the co occurrence of legacy novel and short chain pfass in the environment makes it challenging to understand the environmental fates and toxicities of pfass although c 7 pfass were intended to be safer alternatives to regulated compounds like pfoa and pfos evidence for this is limited whereas some acute studies have reported that c 7 pfass are less toxic than longer chain homologs li et al 2020 other studies have reported that c 7 pfass are as toxic as the compounds they were intended to replace kwiatkowski et al 2020 lee et al 2020 also since shorter chain homologs are less liable to removal from the aqueous phase and persist longer than their longer chain homologs kwiatkowski et al 2020 li et al 2020 chronic effects of these compounds are a major concern additional toxicity data is therefore required to establish the environmental benefits of shifting to shorter chain homologs 4 conclusions the concentrations of various pfass in wastewater discharged from 77 industrial plants at an industrial complex in korea and in the river water receiving the wastewater were determined legacy long chain pfass and short chain pfass were detected in wastewater discharged from the different industrial plants the relative contributions of pfos to the total pfas mass loads discharged were markedly lower in this study than in a study performed in 2012 pfos and pfoa are being phased out and replaced with short chain pfass by many industrial companies however novel pfass such as adona and genx were not detected in the industrial effluent samples suggesting that they were not used at any of the industrial plants that were studied the preferred replacements of long chain pfass at the industrial plants that were studied up to 2018 appear to have been pfhxs and pfbs because the concentrations of these pfass in river water increased between 2007 and 2018 however the total pfas concentrations in the water from the river receiving effluent from the industrial plants were lower in 2019 than in 2018 probably because various industrial companies decided to discontinue the use of pfhxs the pfhxs concentration in river water had decreased within a few months of that decision being made however it should be noted that about 60 of the mass load at the downstream sampling site was from other sources not characterized in this study the results indicate that changes in pfas use patterns at industrial plants strongly affect pfas concentrations in the water of rivers receiving effluent from industrial plants the concentrations and fates of pfass that are being used to replace previously used pfass should be investigated

17231,concentrations of 28 novel and legacy perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in wastewater from 77 industrial plants in the largest industrial complex in korea were determined the industrial plants were of eight types advanced electronic battery chemical general electronic glass and ceramic metal polymer and textile pfas concentrations in river water receiving the wastewater were determined to assess the impact of wastewater from the industrial complex only 19 and nine target pfass were detected in untreated industrial wastewater and river water respectively novel pfass such as f53b 6 2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate were not detected the mean pfass concentration in industrial wastewater treatment plant effluent was 5 18 µg l the mean total pfass concentration was highest in advanced electronic plant effluent second highest in general electronic plant effluent and lowest in battery and chemical plant effluents perfluorohexane sulfonate was the dominant homolog being detected in effluent from plants of all classes and contributing 96 of total discharged pfass by mass perfluorooctane sulfonate included in the stockholm convention use has decreased markedly since previous studies perfluorooctane sulfonate has largely been replaced by pfass with fewer than seven carbon atoms a similar change was found for river water receiving industrial wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluoroalkyl substances pfass emerging pfass industrial wastewater emission source river 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are man made chemicals with useful properties including being resistant to most degradation processes acting as surfactants and being repellent to both water and oil these physicochemical properties have led to pfass being used extensively in various industries such as the metal plating and photolithography industries and during the production of cleaning products hydraulic fluids pesticides semiconductors and textiles kissa 2001 rahman et al 2014 increasing awareness of the potential toxicities of pfass to humans and the persistence of pfass in the environment led to restrictions on the use of some pfass being imposed so a limited number of pfas products are now in use perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are included in the stockholm convention unep 2019a and it has been proposed that perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs should be added unep 2019b demand for compounds with similar properties to pfass that have been banned has led to chemically similar alternatives being developed and these novel pfass have been detected in various environmental matrices oecd 2015 wang et al 2017 it is generally assumed that industrial plants are major sources of pfass to the aquatic environment because of the widespread industrial use of pfass dauchy et al 2017 gebbink et al 2017 kemi 2017 rahman et al 2014 wang et al 2013 2014 little information is readily available on the amounts of pfass produced around the world mainly because such information is considered confidential by the manufacturers however it has been estimated from publicly available information that as much as 5510 t of pfass will have been produced across the world between 2016 and 2030 oecd 2015 wang et al 2014 major sources of pfass to the environment include plants producing biocides cosmetics electronic equipment foam based fire fighting chemicals paper synthetic chemicals and polymers and textiles kemi 2017 pfoa and pfos have previously been used in more applications and in larger quantities than the other pfass however pfoa and pfos can now only be used in few applications so alternative fluorinated substances have been developed these include short chain pfass fluorotelomers and perfluoropolyethers one such compound 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoro 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 heptafluoropropoxy propanoic acid genx was introduced by dupont in 2010 pan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 others such as 3h perfluoro 3 3 methoxy propoxy propanoic acid adona have also been in use for several years janousek et al 2019 wang et al 2013 alternative pfass use has increased as pfoa and pfos use has gradually been phased out in japan the usa and western european countries heydebreck et al 2015 janousek et al 2019 land et al 2018 nakayama et al 2019 industrial effluent has been found to be the main source of alternative pfass to the aquatic environment in these countries dauchy et al 2017 gebbink et al 2017 novel pfass such as genx have been detected downstream of a fluorochemical plant in the netherlands at concentrations up to 812 ng l 1 gebbink et al 2017 other alternative pfass such as fluorotelomers have been found to contribute 99 of the 3 kg d 1 of pfass discharged into a river in france from a fluorochemical plant dauchy et al 2017 moving to alternative pfass has been predicted to be much slower in other countries wang et al 2014 in studies in korea kim et al 2016 2012 kwon et al 2017 and china heydebreck et al 2015 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2016 legacy pfass were found still to be in wide industrial use even after they were included in the stockholm convention industries that use pfass e g the ceramic electronic and synthetic polymer industries have undergone marked growth since regulations of pfass were introduced there is therefore a need to update information on the use of legacy and novel pfass by industries in countries like korea with growing economies and to assess the impacts these industries have on pfass concentrations in the aquatic environment the aim of this study was to determine whether the use of pfass at korean industrial plants reflects changes in regulations and to assess the extent to which regulations have affected pfass emissions to the aquatic environment previous studies were focused on particular industries at the national scale kim et al 2016 2012 but this intensive study was focused on a single industrial complex containing more than 70 industrial plants producing ceramics electronic equipment electroplated metals polymers textiles and other items the concentrations of 28 legacy and novel pfass in raw wastewater samples from the industrial plants effluent samples from wastewater treatment plants and water samples from the river receiving wastewater from the industrial complex were determined and the results were compared with the results of previous studies to assess temporal changes in pfass use 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials the

methanol and milli q water were purchased from j t baker phillipsburg nj usa 2 2 sample preparation the samples were extracted and cleaned up to allow pfass to be determined using a method described by kim et al 2020 with minor modifications briefly a 100 ml or 10 2 or 0 2 ml as appropriate aliquot of a water sample was passed through a glass microfiber filter whatman gf f 0 45 μm pores 47 mm diameter ge healthcare bio sciences pittsburgh pa usa the sample was then spiked with 50 μl of a solution containing each internal standard at a concentration of 100 ng ml 1 a solid phase extraction cartridge oasis wax 200 mg 6 cm3 waters milford ma usa was conditioned with in sequence 4 ml of meoh containing 0 1 ammonia 4 ml of meoh and 4 ml of water the sample was loaded onto the cartridge then the cartridge was washed with 6 ml of 25 mm ammonium acetate and then dried for 30 min the cartridge was then eluted with meoh containing 0 1 ammonia the extract was evaporated to 500 μl using a turbo vap ii system caliper life sciences hopkinton ma usa the extract was then diluted with 1 ml of meoh then 50 μl of a mixture of recovery standards each at a concentration of 100 ng ml 1 were added 2 3 instrumental analysis the pfas concentrations in the extracts were determined by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using an agilent 1200 hplc system with a 6460 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa a binary mobile phase gradient 2 mm ammonium acetate in water and methanol was used and the mass spectrometer

long 3 5 μm particles agilent technologies to prevent pfass contamination during instrumental analysis polytetrafluoroethylene parts in the pump autosampler and solvent line were replaced with polyethylene and stainless steel parts the instrumental conditions quantification limits and other information are shown in tables s2 and s3 2 4 sample collection and industry classification samples of industrial wastewater and river water were collected on six different days in a two week period in may 2018 a schematic showing the locations of the sampling points is shown in fig 1 a total of 79 influent and 66 effluent wastewater samples were collected from 77 industrial plants at an industrial complex in the upper midstream part of the nakdong river only 66 effluent samples were collected because wastewater from 13 of the plants is discharged directly to a mixed industrial and domestic wastewater treatment plant mwtp more than 77 influent samples were collected because three influent samples were collected from one industrial plant the selected industrial plants were suspected of emitting pfass and were broadly classed as producing and or processing advanced electronic equipment n 14 batteries n 4 chemicals n 4 general electronic equipment n 6 glass and ceramics n 10 metals n 15 polymers n 7 and textiles n 17 general descriptions of the processes used and the products of each type of industrial plant are shown in table 1 the industrial plants that were selected are in the largest industrial complex in south korea this complex has been operating since 1969 wastewater from the industrial complex is discharged into the nakdong river through two mwtps both mwtps use conventional treatment processes a grit chamber primary sedimentation a bioreactor secondary sedimentation sand filtration and uv treatment but the bioreactor in mwtp 1 is a daewoo nutrient removal system and the bioreactor in mwtp 2 uses advanced oxidation processes the effects of industrial wastewater emissions on pfass concentrations in the aquatic environment receiving the wastewater were assessed by analyzing river water samples collected from two sampling points one upstream and the other downstream of the industrial complex after the first sampling campaign conducted in may 2018 additional river water samples were collected on one day in august and another day in october 2019 on each sampling day river water samples were collected at 18 sites upstream of near and downstream of the industrial complex at each sampling site a 1 l water sample was collected using the grab sampling method the water samples were stored at 20 c in polypropylene containers until they were analyzed 2 5 quality assurance quality control the correlation coefficients r2 for the calibration curves for all 28 pfass were 0 99 each calibration curve had at least five points with the range of 0 1 to 200 ng ml 1 individual pfass were quantified using the internal standard method and the internal standards are listed in table s2 the volume of each sample was selected to ensure that the concentrations of the pfass in the prepared sample extract were within the calibration curve concentration ranges see table s2 the relative standard deviations of the relative response factors for the compounds in the calibration solutions were all within 15 a procedural blank sample hplc grade water was analyzed with every batch n 10 of samples and an instrumental blank was also analyzed to assess contamination during the experimental and analytical procedures the concentrations of each target compound in the blank samples were below the method detection limit defined as the concentration giving a signal to noise ratio of 3 the limits of detection for the target compounds were 0 86 10 7 ng l 1 to assess the accuracy and precision of determination of target pfas in industrial wastewater samples the target pfass were spiked in triplicate into a composite sample of industrial wastewater each 200 ml composite sample was spiked with 5 ng of each of the 28 native standards 5 ng and the concentrations were determined accuracy and precision in the determination of spiked standards were calculated by subtracting the concentrations of residues in the composite samples that were not spiked detailed accuracy and precision information are presented in the supplementary material table s2 the recoveries for all of the samples were 84 5 21 3 mean std deviation for perfluoro n 1 2 13c2 hexanoic acid 84 3 13 2 for perfluoro n 1 2 3 4 13c4 octanoic acid 85 3 13 0 for perfluoro n 1 2 3 4 5

defined as the pfass concentration ng l 1 multiplied by the daily flow rate m3 d 1 for the wastewater treatment plant or river as shown in eq 1 1 pfass daily mass load ng d 1 c i f i 10 3 l m 3 where ci is the pfass concentration at site i industrial wastewater treatment plant iwtp mwtp or river ng l 1 and fi is the daily flow rate at the site i m3 d 1 the contributions of pfass in industrial wastewater to pfass in mwtp effluent and surface water were calculated using eq 2 the contributions of the iwtp effluents to the influents of the two mwtps and from the effluents of the two mwtps to the river water were calculated 2 contribution of industrial wastewater to pfass in mwtp effluent or surface water i 1 n c e i f e i i 1 n c r i f r i 100 in eq 2 ce i is the pfass concentration in

at the iwtps and mwtps and for the river water samples are shown in table 2 the pfass dfs and concentrations for the influent and effluent wastewater samples were not markedly different of the 28 pfass compounds that were analyzed 19 and 18 were detected in the iwtp influent and effluent samples respectively the mean total pfass concentrations in the iwtp influent and effluent samples were 7290 ng l 1 range limit of quantification to 479 000 ng l 1 and 5180 ng l 1 range limit of quantification to 229 000 ng l 1 respectively these results agreed well with the results of a previous study in which negligible removal efficiencies were found for pfass during wastewater treatment processes huset et al 2008 as shown in table 2 pfass with fewer than eight carbon atoms were detected more often and at higher concentrations than pfass with eight or more carbon atoms the pfcas pfba and pfhxa had dfs of 49 71 for the influent samples and 51 76 for the effluent samples pfhxs had the highest dfs of the pfsas 90 for the influent samples and 57 for the effluent samples high pfhxs concentrations were found in both the influent and effluent industrial wastewater samples the highest pfhxs concentration in the influent samples was 469 μg l 1 and the mean was 10 8 μg l 1 in previous studies pfos and pfoa were the dominant pfass in river water lam et al 2016 and wastewater treatment plant samples kim et al 2016 kwon et al 2017 but in this study other pfass with less than seven carbon atoms were found at higher concentrations than pfos and pfoa the dominance of these homologs in the industrial wastewater samples corresponded with the concentrations of these homologs recently found in nakdong river water park et al 2018 industrial wastewater in south korea has not previously been found to contain ftss but ftss were found in lake water rain river water and snow in south korea in one previous study kim and kannan 2007 we detected 6 2 fts in one river sample from river site b 12 iwtp influent samples df 15 one iwtp effluent sample and the mwtp 1 influent sample another fts 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecane sulfonate was detected in one sample in each group of influent and effluent samples the 6 2 fts concentrations in the influent and effluent samples ranged from below the limit of detection to 145 ng l 1 mean 39 9 ng l 1 and from below the limit of detection to 2 35 ng l 1 respectively the 6 2 fts concentrations and dfs were probably lower in the iwtp effluent samples than the iwtp influent samples because of a combination of degradation and sorption to sludge wang et al 2011 emerging pfass f53b genx and adona were not detected in any of the samples f53b is used as a pfos alternative wang et al 2013 the pfoa alternatives genx and adona wang et al 2013 have previously been detected in river water gebbink et al 2017 heydebreck et al 2015 pan et al 2018 sun et al 2016 and drinking water gebbink et al 2017 in other countries however these compounds do not seem to have been used in south korea when this study was performed this is probably because other pfass e g pfbs pfhxs and pfhxa are available and appear to have been the preferred replacements for pfoa and pfos in the industrial complex used in this study 3 2 concentrations and distributions of pfass in the samples from each type of industry and the amounts of pfass emitted by each type of industry the pfass patterns in wastewater emitted by the different industry types were investigated by assessing the concentrations and patterns of pfass with different chemical structures pfcas pfsas and ftss in the different samples and the results are shown in fig 2 samples with pfass concentrations 1 µg l 1 were found in the advanced electronic metal polymer and textile plant wastewaters compared to other types of industries advanced electronics had a higher proportion of samples n 14 with pfass concentrations 100 ng l 1 64 n 9 and 1 µg l 1 35 n 5 the pfass patterns in the advanced electronic plant samples had relatively high pfsa contributions compared with the patterns in the other types of industries three of the five samples with total pfass concentrations 1 µg l 1 were dominated by pfsa 90 the metal polymer and textile plant samples with pfass concentrations 1 µg l 1 did not have particularly high pfsas contributions however the pfca contributions were higher than the other pfas contributions for all of the textile plant samples in which pfass were detected n 18 but not for three samples that had low pfas concentrations from sites t 15 t 16 and t 18 the polymer plant samples had high fts contributions the 6 2 fts contribution was particularly high and this fts had higher dfs and contributions for the polymer plant samples than for the other plant samples pfcas were the dominant pfass in the iwtp influent samples for the other types of industrial plants general electronic glass and ceramic battery and chemical plants that had low pfass concentrations the concentrations of individual pfcas and pfsas for each type of industrial plant are shown in fig 3 the data varied widely so median values were used like in a previous study of pollutants in industrial wastewater kim et al 2016 the median short chain pfca concentrations were higher than the median longer chain pfca concentrations for most industry types in particular the pfba concentration was about 10 times higher than the concentrations of the other pfcas that were detected the glass and ceramic textile and general electronic plant samples had the three highest median pfba concentrations 145 120 and 115 ng l 1 respectively the samples from all of the industry types contained pfpea but the median concentrations for all of the industry types except the polymer industry were 10 ng l 1 pfhxa was detected in fewer samples but at higher median concentrations than pfpea the highest median pfhxa concentrations were found in the advanced electronic plant samples 40 3 ng l 1 and textile industry samples 29 2 ng l 1 the legacy pfas pfoa is being phased out and was found at concentrations of 10 ng l 1 however one metal industry sample contained pfoa at a concentration of 1000 ng l 1 the variations in pfoa concentrations may have been caused by differences in raw materials and processes used in the different industries the median pfsa concentrations were slightly lower than the median concentrations of the corresponding pfcas for every industry type fig 3 however the pfsa pattern was different from the pfca pattern particularly in that the pfhxs concentrations in the advanced electronic plant samples were high the median pfhxs concentration for the advanced electronic plant samples was not markedly different from the median pfhxs concentration for the other industry types but the advanced electronic plant samples had the highest mean pfhxs concentration because the pfhxs concentrations were almost 100 times higher in two samples than in the other samples fig 3c and 3d the advanced electronic industry wastewater samples also contained high concentrations of pfbs pfpes and pfos two thirds of the samples in which pfpes was detected were samples from solar panel and monitor display manufacturing plants solar panel manufacturing involves semiconductor photolithography processes that involve the use of products containing pfhxs giesy and kannan 2002 lin et al 2009 pfhxs was the dominant pollutant in the advanced electronic industry wastewater samples and the pfbs and pfos concentrations were 1 4 of the pfhxs concentrations pfoa was found at concentrations of 15 4 ng l 1 in two of the influent samples the impact of the industrial complex on the nakdong river was assessed by calculating the relative contributions of pfass in industrial wastewater to the pfas loads in mwtp wastewater and river water using eq 2 the iwtp effluents and uncharacterized wastewater influents were assumed to be the sources of pfass to the mwtps upstream river water at site a and the effluents from the mwtps were assumed to be the sources of pfass to the downstream river water uncharacterized non point sources of pfass would have also supplied pfass to the river water the estimated relative contributions of the industrial complex and other pfass sources to the pfas loads in the mwtp wastewater and river water at site b are shown in fig 4 the mwtps are used to treat domestic sewage and industrial wastewater from industrial plants we studied and others industrial plants in the industrial complex contributed 99 of the pfass entering the mwtps pfhxs and some short chain pfass were mainly emitted by industrial plants whereas pfos and pfoa were mainly from other sources including domestic sewage wastewater discharged from the mwtps contributed 30 of the total pfass mass load in the downstream river water at site b pfass contamination of the river water upstream of the mwtps where there are no point sources such as industrial plants and wastewater treatment plants contributed 5 of the total pfass mass load in the downstream river water the remainder 60 of the total pfass mass load in the downstream river water had unidentified sources such as industrial and residential areas within the river catchment the industrial complex we studied is clearly an important source of pfass to the nakdong river catchment but other sources are also important 3 3 temporal changes in the pfas concentrations the pfas mass loads in industrial wastewater discharged into the environment in korea have been estimated in previous studies kim et al 2012 estimated the amounts of pfass discharged into the aquatic environment in korea in 2010 using data for selected treatment plants receiving domestic and industrial wastewater they estimated that industrial wastewater contributed 23 of pfass emitted into the aquatic environment kim et al 2016 studied 25 iwtps and estimated the amounts of pfass discharged by chemical electronic metal paper and textile plants in korea in both studies c8 pfass pfoa and pfos contributed at least 70 of the amounts of pfass discharged kim et al 2012 2016 these studies were performed after pfos was included in the stockholm convention but alternatives to pfos were not included in the studies kim et al 2016 did not include pfbs even though in previous studies it had already been found that pfbs was used widely particularly in the electronics industry we compared the results of this study with the results of previous studies to assess temporal changes in pfas use and concentrations in water receiving wastewater temporal changes in pfas emissions from industrial plants were assessed using the relative contributions of individual pfass to the total pfas concentrations in industrial wastewater in this study and in 2012 kim et al 2016 to allow the data to be compared advanced electronics and general electronics were combined as electronics and data for only eight pfcas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfunda pfdoda and pftrda and three pfsas pfhxs pfos and pfds that were included in the 2012 data were considered as shown in fig 5 the relative contributions of pfass with more than seven carbon atoms to the total pfas concentrations in wastewater discharged by most industry types decreased between 2012 and this study the pfca contributions to the total pfas concentrations had changed particularly markedly for the chemical and textile industries the dominant pfas species discharged by chemical plants and textile plants in 2012 were pfoa 49 of the total pfass concentration and pfhpa 60 of the total pfass concentration respectively but the dominant pfass species discharged by both chemical plants and textile plants in 2018 was pfhxa 84 95 of the total pfass concentration for the metal industry pfdoda was the dominant homolog in 2012 but pfoa was the dominant homolog in 2018 the metal industry is the only one of the industry types we studied that still predominantly uses a c8 homolog the pfsa use patterns also changed markedly between 2012 and 2018 the pfhxs contributions to the total pfsa concentrations in the samples for all of the industry types were higher in 2018 than 2012 and pfhxs was the dominant homolog for all of the industry types except the textile industry in 2018 pfos was the dominant pfsa for the textile industry pfds was detected in 2012 but was not detected in our textile industry samples the change from using long chain pfass to using shorter chain pfass was intended to decrease the concentrations of long chain pfass in environmental media however the concentrations of the replacement pfass in environmental media are likely to increase because of the change industrial wastewater has been discharged into the nakdong river for many years so the concentrations of pollutants in nakdong river water have been monitored in numerous studies temporal changes in pfas concentrations in nakdong river water caused by changes in pfass use in industrial plants were assessed by comparing pfas concentrations found in nakdong river water samples between 2007 and 2019 and the results are shown in fig 6 it was not possible to directly compare concentrations of pfcas with fewer than six carbon atoms because these compounds were not analyzed in the earlier studies cho et al 2010 lam et al 2016 some different compounds were analyzed in the different studies but the results indicated that pfas concentrations in nakdong river water increased between 2007 and 2018 cho et al 2010 although it was not possible to account for seasonal variations due the results clearly indicated that pfass use has changed over time in response to international regulations restricting the use of pfos in 2009 the mean concentrations of pfass with more than seven carbon atoms decreased over time but the concentration of pfass with fewer than seven carbon atoms increased between 2007 and 2018 this trend was most pronounced for pfhxs for which the mean concentrations increased from 7 8 ng l 1 in 2007 cho et al 2010 to 100 ng l 1 in 2017 and 2018 kim et al 2020 however the mean pfhxs concentration had decreased by two orders of magnitude in 2019 probably because of the decision by industrial companies to eliminate pfhxs from manufacturing processes after an incident in june 2018 in which tap water was contaminated with pfhxs yong et al 2020 moe 2018 in contrast the mean pfos concentration decreased from 52 ng l 1 in 2007 to 2 ng l 1 in 2017 2019 this would have been caused by decreases in pfos use in industrial plants caused by regulation of pfos use as shown in fig 6 the concentrations of pfass with more than eight carbon atoms also decreased over time and these pfass were hardly detected in the samples collected in 2018 and 2019 however the concentrations of pfoa which was recently added to the list of persistent organic pollutants regulated by the stockholm convention pfhpa and pfhxa did not change markedly over time as the mean concentrations of these compounds were of the same order of magnitude between 2007 and 2019 the use of restricted compounds in industrial plants has clearly decreased over time but these compounds will probably continue to be released into the environment by old products and landfills the co occurrence of legacy novel and short chain pfass in the environment makes it challenging to understand the environmental fates and toxicities of pfass although c 7 pfass were intended to be safer alternatives to regulated compounds like pfoa and pfos evidence for this is limited whereas some acute studies have reported that c 7 pfass are less toxic than longer chain homologs li et al 2020 other studies have reported that c 7 pfass are as toxic as the compounds they were intended to replace kwiatkowski et al 2020 lee et al 2020 also since shorter chain homologs are less liable to removal from the aqueous phase and persist longer than their longer chain homologs kwiatkowski et al 2020 li et al 2020 chronic effects of these compounds are a major concern additional toxicity data is therefore required to establish the environmental benefits of shifting to shorter chain homologs 4 conclusions the concentrations of various pfass in wastewater discharged from 77 industrial plants at an industrial complex in korea and in the river water receiving the wastewater were determined legacy long chain pfass and short chain pfass were detected in wastewater discharged from the different industrial plants the relative contributions of pfos to the total pfas mass loads discharged were markedly lower in this study than in a study performed in 2012 pfos and pfoa are being phased out and replaced with short chain pfass by many industrial companies however novel pfass such as adona and genx were not detected in the industrial effluent samples suggesting that they were not used at any of the industrial plants that were studied the preferred replacements of long chain pfass at the industrial plants that were studied up to 2018 appear to have been pfhxs and pfbs because the concentrations of these pfass in river water increased between 2007 and 2018 however the total pfas concentrations in the water from the river receiving effluent from the industrial plants were lower in 2019 than in 2018 probably because various industrial companies decided to discontinue the use of pfhxs the pfhxs concentration in river water had decreased within a few months of that decision being made however it should be noted that about 60 of the mass load at the downstream sampling site was from other sources not characterized in this study the results indicate that changes in pfas use patterns at industrial plants strongly affect pfas concentrations in the water of rivers receiving effluent from industrial plants the concentrations and fates of pfass that are being used to replace previously used pfass should be investigated

nitrification denitrification process anammox process shows great advantages of no requirement for the external electron donor low energy consumption high nitrogen loading rate and small excess sludge production kartal et al 2010 in 2007 anammox process was successfully put into full scale use for the nitrogen removal from reject liquor of anaerobic sludge digestion in rotterdam for the first time van der star et al 2007 according to the incomplete survey more than 200 full scale anammox facilities have come into being around the world so far to some extent anammox process has been acknowledged as an updating technology for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters cao et al 2017 lu et al 2019 the application of anammox process still faces serious challenges because of the slow growth and high

also retain high density bacterial cells to ensure the function continuation tang et al 2017 kang et al 2019a the immobilized functional bacteria endow the anammox sludge with the metabolic potential for biological nitrogen removal while the supporting conditions promote the transformation of potential to performance and mass transfer is the key condition liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 anaob live in the form of individual cell and their size is in micro scale in nature whose substrate uptake generally banlances their cell metabolism after the long term natural evolution van niftrik et al 2008 obviously the granulation of bacterial cells breaks such a banlance because bacterial cells take in substrates through the surface and the surface of bacterial granules is dramatically reduced with the progress of granulation process the nitrogen removal performance of anammox granule is frequently limited by the mass transfer shi et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 so far most of the researches are focused on the microbial community little information is available about the mass transfer of anammox granules permeability is an important index to the mass transfer of anammox granule xing et al 2015 the anammox granule with good permeability means that the waterflow can penetrate the interior and the convective mass transfer can take place otherwise the substrate can only enter the anammox granule by molecular diffusion li and yuan 2002 according to the diffusion formula the diffusion time of a molecule is proportional to the square of distance for example it takes about 0 08 10 3 s for an ammonium ion to migrate 1 µm while 80 s for an ammonium ion to migrate 1 mm with a difference of 106 times between them rumble 2018 anaob cells are in micron scale while the anammox granules are in millimeter dimension hence the substrate diffusion time of millimeter dimensione granules was greatly prolonged leading to the shortage of substrate supply and the inhibition of microbial activity tan et al 2020 the mass transfer efficiency of convection could be 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of diffusion or even higher it is reported that floc sludge and aerobic granular sludge present the fine mass transfer due to the good permeability tsou et al 2002 liu et al 2010 pan et al 2016 but little information has been observed on the permeability of anammox granule granule size is an important parameter impacting the efficient working of bioreactor lu et al 2013 found that the specific activity of anammox granule was limited when the particle size exceeded 4 mm zhu et al 2018 observed that the anammox granule exhibited the maximum activity with the granule size of 0 5 0 9 mm although the granule size has been reported to exert a significant effect on the mass transfer the effect of granule size on permeability remains to be revealed since the efficient mass transfer is the essential factor for the potential activity of anammox granule it is helpful to establish the relationship between permeability and granule size so as to optimize anammox granule in this study anammox granules with stable composition and structures were withdrawn from a long term steady state bioreactor the objectives were 1 to investigate the size distribution of anammox granules 2 to determine the permeability of anammox granules with different sizes 3 to observe the pore structure of

dynamic image system sympatec gmbh germany 2 ml anammox sludges were taken from the bioreactor then dispersed by a stirrer device and moved to the flow cell the measured granule diameter referred to diameter of a circle of equal projection area eqpc and was expressed as xi i meant the volume fraction the granule size distribution was represented by cumulative volume distribution function q xi which was defined as the fraction of granule volume with diameter less than xi to all granule volume each samples was determined in triplicate kang et al 2019a 2 3 determination of permeability anammox granules with different sizes were taken for the determination of permeability each granule was photographed by a stereoscope discovery v8 zeiss germany and the size of granules was analyzed by image j software then the density of each granule was determined with a pycnometer shown in supplementary files afterwards the actual settling velocities of anammox granules with different sizes were determined by settling experiments and the corrected stoke s formula 1 was used to calculate the predicted settling velocities of equal diameter and density impermeable spheres the ratio of two settling velocities was denoted as γ the fluid can pass through the granules when γ is greater than 1 while it cannot pass through the granules when γ is less than 1 based on the γ the fluid collection efficiency can be estimated which is defined as the ratio of the interior flow passing through the granule to the flow approaching it the higher the fluid collection efficiency the better

micro ct scanco medical ag was applied to observe the three dimension pore structure of anammox granule anammox granules were placed in a plastic tube and fixed on a sample stage then the anammox granule was scanned layer by layer at a voltage of 50 kv and a current of 160 µa with the pixel resolution of 5 µm the scanning projections were recorded by a detector 3072 400 the photosentitive unit

statistical analysis yu et al 2018 2 5 determination of eps the series of sieves the sieve pores were 0 2 mm 0 5 mm 1 0 mm 1 5 mm 2 0 mm and 3 0 mm respectively were used to separate anammox granules with different sizes and a modified heat extraction method was applied to extract eps from the anammox granules with different sizes li et al 2016 10 ml anammox granule was washed with nacl solution wt 0 05 for 3 times anammox granule was then transferred to a beaker and 20 ml nacl solution wt 0 05 preheated 70 c was added followed by the incubation of mixture in 60 c water bath for 30 min and the mixture was stirred every 10 min during incubation to optimize mass transfer and improve extraction efficiency afterwards the soulution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane the collected filtrate was considered as eps extracted from anammox granule finally the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents in eps were determined by the lowry method using egg albumin as the standard peterson et al 1977 and the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard masuko et al 2005 2 6 transmission electron microscope tem tem was applied to observe the distribution of bacterial cells and eps in the surface layer and interior of anammox granule with different sizes the samples were placed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution and fixed overnight at 4 c after rinsed with 0 1 mol l and ph 7 0 phosphate buffer solution samples were fixed using osmium acid solution for 1 2 h then rinsed with phosphoric acid buffer again after dehydrated with gradient concentration of ethanol solution 50 70 80 90 95 and 100 the samples were treated with acetone for 20 min then the samples were treated with a mixture of embedding medium spurr and acetone with volume ratio of 1 1 and 3 1 for 1 h and 3 h respectively afterwards the samples were treated with pure embedding medium spurr overnight finally the surface layer and the

analysis the concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and vss were determined according to the standard methods apha 2017 the morphology of anammox granule was observed and photographed by a stereoscope discovery v8 zeiss germany t test was conducted on spss 22 0 p 0 05 means 95 significant level while p 0 01 means 99 significant level the fluid velocity and flow line distribution in a simplified granule model was simulated by ansys fluent 15 0 software using eulerian model with granule diameter of 2 mm and pore size of 50 µm in the flow field of 0 05 m s 3 results 3 1 performance of anammox reactor the anammox granules were withdrawn from the steady state anammox granular sludge bed reactor as shown in table 1 the influent concentrations of ammonium nitrite and total nitrogen tn were 296 1 12 5 mg l 351 8 14 7 mg l and 647 9 20 6 mg l the corresponding removal efficiencies reached 99 4 0 5 99 7 0 2 and 90 4 1 1 respectively the effluent concentrations of ammonium nitrite and tn were 1 6 1 4 mg l 0 9 0 6 mg l and 62 0 6 4 mg l the nitrogen loading rate nlr and the nitrogen removal rate nrr were 10 4 0 3 kg m3 d and 10 3 0 3 kg m3 d respectively and the ratio of nitrite consumption to ammonium consumption and nitrate production to ammonium consumption were 1 20 0 06 and 0 23 0 03 respectively which were close to the values of 1 32 and 0 26 reported in the previous literature strous et al 1998 3 2 size distribution of anammox granules the anammox granules are the self immobilized microbial aggregates with the size greater than 200 µm de kreuk et al 2007 kang et al 2019a the granule size is an important factor impacting the bioreactor performance using qicpic dynamic image system the size distribution of anammox granule was determined quantitively fig 1 based on the average granule size the anammox granules could be divided into 6 groups 200 500 µm i 500 1000 µm ii 1000 1500 µm iii 1500 2000 µm iv 2000 3000 µm v and 3000 µm vi as shown in fig 1 the proportion of granule group i to v rose from 0 61 to 59 94 while the proportion of granule group vi fell to 7 62 granule group v accounted for the top proportion 59 94 which was the main gradation of control granule and granule group iv was the second which accounted for the proportion of 24 36 3 3 permeability of anammox granules water is the carrier of substrate mainly ammonium and nitrite in the amammox granule settling experiments are the effective way to study the permeability of waterflow in the amammox granule and the penetrating flow in amammox granule can be evaluated by comparing the actual settling velocity of amammox granules with the predicted settling velocity of impermeable spheres with the same diameter and density li and yuan 2002 mu et al 2006 as shown in fig 2 a the settling velocities of anammox granules in water varied from 0 5 to 3 0 cm s the average settling velocity was 1 7 0 6 cm s and the ratios of actual observed to predicted settling velocities γ were in the range of 0 7 2 4 with an average γ of 1 1 0 3 from the overall trend the actual settling velocities of anammox granules rose with the increase of granule size which was in agreement with the predictions for porous but impermeable objects from the stoke s law however when the granule size was 0 2 1 5 mm from granule group i to iii and 2 0 4 0 mm from granule group v to vi the actual observed values deviate from the predicted values greatly and the γ values were 1 4 0 4 more than 1 and 0 9 0 1 less than 1 respectively indicating that compared with large granules small granules were much easier for fluid to pass through according to li et al 2002 amammox granules are considered permeable when 3 4 of fluid pass through the granule interior as shown in fig 2b the diameter of permeable granules was basically distributed below 1 5 mm and the permeability of anammox granules declined dramatically with the increase of granule size the fluid collection efficiency of granules in granule group i to iii fell from 39 4 to 9 3 and the permeability of anammox granules with diameter larger than 1 5 mm could be negligible the fluid collection efficiency of granules in granule group iv to vi was 0 3 4 pore structure of anammox granules the granule pores are the flow channels inside the anammox granule thus the permeability is closely related to the pore structure pore size and its distribution mu et al 2006 the three dimension pore structure of anammox granules in different sizes was observed by micro ct the 3d reconstructed images and profiles were shown in fig 3 in the profiles the red part was mainly composed of functional bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances eps and the blue part was the pore channels inside the anammox granule as seen in fig 3 a lot of pores were observed in the anammox granules among them the pore space of granule group i to iii was distributed evenly and the pore channels were radially connected from the surface to the interior with the increase of granule size the radial distribution of granule pores varied significantly the proportion of surface layer pores of granule group iv to vi declined gradually while the proportion of internal pores rose relatively meanwhile the connectivity between the surface layer and the granule interior declined and large cavities appeared in the interior of granule group v and vi to further analyze the three dimension pore structure of anammox granules quantitively avizo software was applied to extract the information of pore structure and the granule porosity pore size and its distribution were calculated as shown in fig 4 the porosity of granule group i to v declined from 88 to 75 while the porosity of granule group vi rose back to 84 based on the pore size the granule pores could be divided into 4 ranges 0 5 µm 5 50 µm 50 100 µm and 100 µm the granule pores of 100 µm and 50 100 µm accounted for the largest proportion in granule group i to iv 70 as for granule group v and vi the pores of 50 100 µm and 5 50 µm 100 µm and 50 100 µm accounted for the largest proportion 70 respectively from the perspective of variation trend the proportion of 100 µm pores in granule group i to v showed a downward trend with a decrease from 51 6 to 23 8 while the proportion of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm pores rose from 0 1 and 0 3 to 10 9 and 33 5 respectively and the proportion of 100 µm pores in granule group vi rose back to 40 0 the proportion of other pores declined fig 4 the results indicated that with the increase of granule size the surface layer of anammox granule became dense due to the proportion increase of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm pores fig 4 while the granule interior became sparse with an overall decrease in the granule porosity however the porosity of granule group vi rose back due to the formation of large cavities detailed mechanism was discussed in section 4 2 3 5 composition of anammox granules anammox granule was mainly composed of bacterial cells eps and pores the content and distribution of bacterial cells and eps greatly affect the pore structure of anammox granule kang et al 2019b the biomass of anammox granules in different sizes was shown in fig 5 a the biomass of granule group i to v rose from 5 6 10 2 g vss g wet sludge to 6 7 10 2 g vss g wet sludge while the counterpart of granule group vi declined to 6 2 10 2 g vss g wet sludge in addition the contents of protein pn and polysaccharide ps two macro components of eps were shown in fig 5b the eps content of granule group i to v rose gradually from 88 4 mg g vss to 240 3 mg g vss while granule group vi declined to 210 3 mg g vss among them the pn content of granule group i to v rose from 68 8 mg g vss to 190 5 mg g vss and granule group vi declined to 167 4 mg g vss the ps content of granule group i to v rose from 19 7 mg g vss to 49 8 mg g vss and the granule group vi declined to 42 9 mg g vss on the whole the ratio of pn to ps showed an upward trend with the increase of granule size transmission electron microscope tem was applied to observe the distribution of bacterial cells and eps in the surface layer and granule interior granule group ii iv and vi as shown in fig 6 the density of anaob cells in the surface layer rose significantly with the increase of granule size in the zoogloea with diameter of 5 8 µm the cell number rose from 10 20 in granule group ii to 50 100 in granule group vi as for granule group vi the cells inside the zoogloea were densely packed with small pore space fig 6a c further observation showed that the electron density between the bacterial cells also rose indicating an increase of eps content fig 6d f however it is worth noting that the cell density and eps content in the granule interior declined with the increase of granule size fig s2 especially for granule group vi where the anaob cells were dispersely distributed and almost no zoogloea was seen the eps content was significantly reduced with the presence of a large number of cavities beside the bacterial cells which were consistent with the experimental results shown in fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 correlation between permeability and size of anammox granule the overall activity of sludge bed is one of the greatest concerns for environmental engineers which determines the process performance directly in the anammox sludge bed reactor anaob and their associated bacteria mainly exist in the form of granular sludge and the number and intrinsic activity of immobilized functional bacteria in the anammox granule determine the nitrogen removal potential on the other hand the supporting conditions are also required to transform the potential into performance for the nitrogen removal mass transfer is the key condition liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 the permeability of anammox granule represents the ability for the fluid to pass through which directly determines the mass transfer pattern and nitrogen removal efficiency ren 2008 the granule with excellent permeability indicates that the waterflow can penetrate the granule interior and the convective mass transfer can take place without the convective mass transfer substrate can only be transported by molecular diffusion which was driven by concentration gradient li and yuan 2002 the efficiency of convective mass transfer is much higher than that of molecular diffusion therefore permeability is a synergistic mass transfer mechanism of anammox granule which plays an important role in the granule activity and the reactor performance xing et al 2015 it is necessary to investigate the permeability of anammox granules so as to understand the mass transfer of anammox granules and to provide important information for optimizing the anammox process in this study the anammox granular sludge bed reactor was operated steadily for over 20 months and the anaob had already gone through 20 generations therefore the anammox granule was in the steady state and it was found that the permeability of anammox granule was negatively correlated with the granule size the permeability almost disappeared when the granule size exceeded 1 5 mm compared with large granules small granules exhibited better mass transfer based on the findings of this study controlling the size of anammox granules in a proper range could be an efficient way for mass transfer besides achieving alternation of external pressure by realizing the circulation of granular sludge in the reactor might be effective for promoting the convection of waterflow in anammox granules which needs further investigation 4 2 pore structure linking permeability with size of anammox granule 4 2 1 relationship between permeability and pore structure the permeability of anammox granule is closely related to the pore structure mu et al 2006 liu et al 2010 according to the pore size the water in the granule pores could be divided into bound water the pore diameter is less than 0 1 µm capillary water the pore diameter is 0 1 µm 1 mm and gravity water the pore diameter is greater than 1 mm bound water has no mobility which is not affected by gravity and pressure therefore the contribution of bound water to mass transfer is negiligible capillary water can migrate under the drive of external force it is reported that the capillary effect gradually appears with the pore size of 0 1 1 mm becomes strong with the pore size of 0 05 0 1 mm and reaches the maximum with the pore size of 5 µm 50 µm gravity water has good mobility under gravity huang and li 2012 in this study it was determined that capillary pores accounted for 99 7 in anammox granules fig 4 and the effect of capillary force is significant the water flow velocity declines with the increase of hydraulic pressure when water flows through the anammox granule which has a pushing effect on the capillary water in the granule pores and the water flow velocity rises with the decrease of hydraulic pressure when water flows out the anammox granule which has a pumping effect on the capillary water in the granule pores the capillary water convection can be driven in anammox granules when the pushing and pumping effects are stronger than the capillary force and thus endows the anammox granule with permeability the capillary force rises with the decrease of pore size an et al 2016 ren et al 2008 found that aerobic granular sludge in size of 1 5 mm could exhibit permeability when the pore size was larger than 50 250 µm as shown in fig 7 ansys fluent 15 0 was applied to simulate the fluid velocity and flow line distribution in a simplified model it was observed that a small amount of fluid passed through the granule pores with granule diameter of 2 mm and pore size of 50 µm in the flow field of 0 05 m s in this study with the increase of granule size the surface layer of anammox granule became dense with the decrease of pore size the pore proportion of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm rose significantly figs 3 and 4 which led to the poor permeability of anammox granules because of the enhanced capillary force fig 2 4 2 2 relationship between pore structure and granule size micro ct has been widely applied in the study of pore structure of different materials soil bone cement etc using micro ct in situ information could be obtained non destructively about the granule porosity pore size pore distribution and pore connectivity cnudde and boone 2013 the results of this study showed that the spatial distribution of granule pores changed largely with the increase of granule size the surface layer of anammox granule became denser while the granule interior became sparser with an overall decrease of granule porosity the granule porosity with the size over 3 mm rose anammox granule is mainly composed of bacterial cells eps and pores jia et al 2017 anaob are the core component which determine the specific anammox activity in essence eps is the secretory macro molecular organic matter which constructs the skeleton of anammox granule hou et al 2015 granule pores are mass transfer channels the pore size and its distribution determine the mass transfer capacity liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 the increase of granule size originates from the growth and reproduction of functional bacteria mainly anaob vlaeminck et al 2010 within the anammox granule the proliferation of bacterial cells will result in the space occupation leading to a denser granule structure wang et al 2020 the mass transfer deteriorated with the increase of granule size causing the lack of substrate in the granule interior eps was consumed and even the bacterial cells were hydrolyzed producing granule cavities fig 3 the surface layer of anammox granule contacts directly with the aqueous substrate the bacterial cells in the surface layer takes on the vigorous metabolism and reproduction in this study it was observed that the density of bacterial cells in the surface layer rose continuously with the increase of granule size fig 5 thus occupying the pore space eps is mainly composed of protein pn and polysaccharide ps which plays important roles in the formation stablization and gowth of anammox granule jia et al 2017 it is reported that pn contained a large amount of hydrophobic amino acids with loose structure which could fully expose the internal hydropholic groups and help to maintain the structural stability of anammox granule hou et al 2015 in the granular sludge bed reactor collision occurs between granules with the drive of waterflow and airflow the contact points of granule collision are often on the granule surface the larger the granules the greater the momentum and the stronger the collision the results of this study showed that the content of eps mainly pn rose with the increase of granule size and eps was mainly distributed in the surface layer of anammox granule fig 5 6 which was conducive to maintaining the structure of anammox granule however the increase of eps content could occupy the pore space and reduce the granule porosity it can be concluded that cell proliferation and eps secretion were the main causes for the variation of pore structure in different anammox granules 5 conclusion 1 the permeability was negatively correlated with the size of anammox granule and the permeability almost disappeared when the granule size exceeded 1 5 mm 2 with the increase of granule size the pore distribution varied significantly the surface layer of anammox granule became denser while the granule interior became sparser the denser surface layer reduced the permeability of anammox granule 3 the content of biomass and eps rose with the increase of granule size and the pore plugging of surface layer by cell proliferation and eps secretion was the main cause for the permeability deterioration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

focused on the microbial community little information is available about the mass transfer of anammox granules permeability is an important index to the mass transfer of anammox granule xing et al 2015 the anammox granule with good permeability means that the waterflow can penetrate the interior and the convective mass transfer can take place otherwise the substrate can only enter the anammox granule by molecular diffusion li and yuan 2002 according to the diffusion formula the diffusion time of a molecule is proportional to the square of distance for example it takes about 0 08 10 3 s for an ammonium ion to migrate 1 µm while 80 s for an ammonium ion to migrate 1 mm with a difference of 106 times between them rumble 2018 anaob cells are in micron scale while the anammox granules are in millimeter dimension hence the substrate diffusion time of millimeter dimensione granules was greatly prolonged leading to the shortage of substrate supply and the inhibition of microbial activity tan et al 2020 the mass transfer efficiency of convection could be 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of diffusion or even higher it is reported that floc sludge and aerobic granular sludge present the fine mass transfer due to the good permeability tsou et al 2002 liu et al 2010 pan et al 2016 but little information has been observed on the permeability of anammox granule granule size is an important parameter impacting the efficient working of bioreactor lu et al 2013 found that the specific activity of anammox granule was limited when the particle size exceeded 4 mm zhu et al 2018 observed that the anammox granule exhibited the maximum activity with the granule size of 0 5 0 9 mm although the granule size has been reported to exert a significant effect on the mass transfer the effect of granule size on permeability remains to be revealed since the efficient mass transfer is the essential factor for the potential activity of anammox granule it is helpful to establish the relationship between permeability and granule size so as to optimize anammox granule in this study anammox granules with stable composition and structures were withdrawn from a long term steady state bioreactor the objectives were 1 to investigate the size distribution of anammox granules 2 to determine the permeability of anammox granules with different sizes 3 to observe the pore structure of anammox granules 4 to reveal the relationships between permeability and granular size with pores as medium the results of this study are helpful to understand the mass transfer of anammox granules and optimize the performance of anammox reactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox granular sludge the anammox granular sludge used in this study was withdrawn from a lab scale bioreactor which have woked steadily for over 2 years the bioreactor was made of plexiglass column with an internal diameter of 4 cm and a working volume of 1 0 l fig s1 the reactor was divided into three parts distribution zone reaction zone and settling zone the synthetic wastewater was continuously pumped to the distribution zone by the peristaltic pump the fluid went upwards through the anammox granular sludge bed in the reaction zone the three phase separator was installed in the setting zone to separate the sludge from the mixed liquid releasing supernatant and gas parts of the supernatant were recycled to the distribution zone from the center of setting zone at a recycle ratio of 7 5 the reactor was operated at 35 c with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 6 h the influent ph was controlled at 7 5 0 2 and the ratio of height to diameter was 20 with superficial velocity of 4 4 m h in reaction zone the synthetic wastewater was used as the influent the composition was g l khco3 0

dynamic image system sympatec gmbh germany 2 ml anammox sludges were taken from the bioreactor then dispersed by a stirrer device and moved to the flow cell the measured granule diameter referred to diameter of a circle of equal projection area eqpc and was expressed as xi i meant the volume fraction the granule size distribution was represented by cumulative volume distribution function q xi which was defined as the fraction of granule volume with diameter less than xi to all granule volume each samples was determined in triplicate kang et al 2019a 2 3 determination of permeability anammox granules with different sizes were taken for the determination of permeability each granule was photographed by a stereoscope discovery v8 zeiss germany and the size of granules was analyzed by image j software then the density of each granule was determined with a pycnometer shown in supplementary files afterwards the actual settling velocities of anammox granules with different sizes were determined by settling experiments and the corrected stoke s formula 1 was used to calculate the predicted settling velocities of equal diameter and density impermeable spheres the ratio of two settling velocities was denoted as γ the fluid can pass through the granules when γ is greater than 1 while it cannot pass through the granules when γ is less than 1 based on the γ the fluid collection efficiency can be estimated which is defined as the ratio of the interior flow passing through the granule to the flow approaching it the higher the fluid collection efficiency the better the permeability the detailed calculations were shown in supplementary files li and yuan 2002 mu et al 2006 1 u s 4 g ρ a ρ 1 d 3 ρ 1 c d where us the predicted terminal settling velocity cm s d the

micro ct scanco medical ag was applied to observe the three dimension pore structure of anammox granule anammox granules were placed in a plastic tube and fixed on a sample stage then the anammox granule was scanned layer by layer at a voltage of 50 kv and a current of 160 µa with the pixel resolution of 5 µm the scanning projections were recorded by a detector 3072 400 the photosentitive unit size was 48 µm the scanning projections collected were used for the reconstruction of three dimension structure and image j and avizo software were applied for 3d visualization pore division and statistical analysis yu et al 2018 2 5 determination of eps the series of sieves the sieve pores were 0 2 mm 0 5 mm 1 0 mm 1 5 mm 2 0 mm and 3 0 mm respectively were used to separate anammox granules with different sizes and a modified heat extraction method was applied to extract eps from the anammox granules with different sizes li et al 2016 10 ml anammox granule was washed with nacl solution wt 0 05 for 3 times anammox granule was then transferred to a beaker and 20 ml nacl solution wt 0 05 preheated 70 c was added followed by the incubation of mixture in 60 c water bath for 30 min and the mixture was stirred every 10 min during incubation to optimize mass transfer and improve extraction efficiency afterwards the soulution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane the collected filtrate was considered as eps extracted from anammox granule finally the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents in eps were determined by the lowry method using egg albumin as the standard peterson et al 1977 and the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard masuko et al 2005 2 6 transmission electron microscope tem tem was applied to observe the distribution of bacterial cells and eps in the surface layer and interior of anammox granule with different sizes the samples were placed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution and fixed overnight at 4 c after rinsed with 0 1 mol l and ph 7 0 phosphate buffer solution samples were fixed using osmium acid solution for 1 2 h then rinsed with phosphoric acid buffer again after dehydrated with gradient concentration of ethanol solution 50 70 80 90 95 and 100 the samples were treated with acetone for 20 min then the samples were treated with a mixture of embedding medium spurr and acetone with volume ratio of 1 1 and 3 1 for 1 h and 3 h respectively afterwards the samples were treated with pure embedding medium spurr overnight finally the surface layer and the interior of embedded samples were sectioned by ultra microtome leica em uc7 obtaining 70 90 nm sections and observed by hitachi h 7650 transmission electron microscope after staining 2 7 other analysis the concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and vss were determined according to the standard methods apha 2017 the morphology of anammox granule was observed and photographed by a stereoscope discovery v8 zeiss germany t test was conducted on spss 22 0 p 0 05 means 95 significant level while p 0 01 means 99 significant level the fluid velocity and flow line distribution in a simplified granule model was simulated by ansys fluent 15 0 software using eulerian model with granule diameter of 2 mm and pore size of 50 µm in the flow field of 0 05 m s 3 results 3 1 performance of anammox reactor the anammox granules were withdrawn from the steady state anammox granular sludge bed reactor as shown in table 1 the influent concentrations of ammonium nitrite and total nitrogen tn were 296 1 12 5 mg l 351 8 14 7 mg l and 647 9 20 6 mg l the corresponding removal efficiencies reached 99 4 0 5 99 7 0 2 and 90 4 1 1 respectively the effluent concentrations of ammonium nitrite and tn were 1 6 1 4 mg l 0 9 0 6 mg l and 62 0 6 4 mg l the nitrogen loading rate nlr and the nitrogen removal rate nrr were 10 4 0 3 kg m3 d and 10 3 0 3 kg m3 d respectively and the ratio of nitrite consumption to ammonium consumption and nitrate production to ammonium consumption were 1 20 0 06 and 0 23 0 03 respectively which were close to the values of 1 32 and 0 26 reported in the previous literature strous et al 1998 3 2 size distribution of anammox granules the anammox granules are the self immobilized microbial aggregates with the size greater than 200 µm de kreuk et al 2007 kang et al 2019a the granule size is an important factor impacting the bioreactor performance using qicpic dynamic image system the size distribution of anammox granule was determined quantitively fig 1 based on the average granule size the anammox granules could be divided into 6 groups 200 500 µm i 500 1000 µm ii 1000 1500 µm iii 1500 2000 µm iv 2000 3000 µm v and 3000 µm vi as shown in fig 1 the proportion of granule group i to v rose from 0 61 to 59 94 while the proportion of granule group vi fell to 7 62 granule group v accounted for the top proportion 59 94 which was the main gradation of control granule and granule group iv was the second which accounted for the proportion of 24 36 3 3 permeability of anammox granules water is the carrier of substrate mainly ammonium and nitrite in the amammox granule settling experiments are the effective way to study the permeability of waterflow in the amammox granule and the penetrating flow in amammox granule can be evaluated by comparing the actual settling velocity of amammox granules with the predicted settling velocity of impermeable spheres with the same diameter and density li and yuan 2002 mu et al 2006 as shown in fig 2 a the settling velocities of anammox granules in water varied from 0 5 to 3 0 cm s the average settling velocity was 1 7 0 6 cm s and the ratios of actual observed to predicted settling velocities γ were in the range of 0 7 2 4 with an average γ of 1 1 0 3 from the overall trend the actual settling velocities of anammox granules rose with the increase of granule size which was in agreement with the predictions for porous but impermeable objects from the stoke s law however when the granule size was 0 2 1 5 mm from granule group i to iii and 2 0 4 0 mm from granule group v to vi the actual observed values deviate from the predicted values greatly and the γ values were 1 4 0 4 more than 1 and 0 9 0 1 less than 1 respectively indicating that compared with large granules small granules were much easier for fluid to pass through according to li et al 2002 amammox granules are considered permeable when 3 4 of fluid pass through the granule interior as shown in fig 2b the diameter of permeable granules was basically distributed below 1 5 mm and the permeability of anammox granules declined dramatically with the increase of granule size the fluid collection efficiency of granules in granule group i to iii fell from 39 4 to 9 3 and the permeability of anammox granules with diameter larger than 1 5 mm could be negligible the fluid collection efficiency of granules in granule group iv to vi was 0 3 4 pore structure of anammox granules the granule pores are the flow channels inside the anammox granule thus the permeability is closely related to the pore structure pore size and its distribution mu et al 2006 the three dimension pore structure of anammox granules in different sizes was observed by micro ct the 3d reconstructed images and profiles were shown in fig 3 in the profiles the red part was mainly composed of functional bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances eps and the blue part was the pore channels inside the anammox granule as seen in fig 3 a lot of pores were observed in the anammox granules among them the pore space of granule group i to iii was distributed evenly and the pore channels were radially connected from the surface to the interior with the increase of granule size the radial distribution of granule pores varied significantly the proportion of surface layer pores of granule group iv to vi declined gradually while the proportion of internal pores rose relatively meanwhile the connectivity between the surface layer and the granule interior declined and large cavities appeared in the interior of granule group v and vi to further analyze the three dimension pore structure of anammox granules quantitively avizo software was applied to extract the information of pore structure and the granule porosity pore size and its distribution were calculated as shown in fig 4 the porosity of granule group i to v declined from 88 to 75 while the porosity of granule group vi rose back to 84 based on the pore size the granule pores could be divided into 4 ranges 0 5 µm 5 50 µm 50 100 µm and 100 µm the granule pores of 100 µm and 50 100 µm accounted for the largest proportion in granule group i to iv 70 as for granule group v and vi the pores of 50 100 µm and 5 50 µm 100 µm and 50 100 µm accounted for the largest proportion 70 respectively from the perspective of variation trend the proportion of 100 µm pores in granule group i to v showed a downward trend with a decrease from 51 6 to 23 8 while the proportion of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm pores rose from 0 1 and 0 3 to 10 9 and 33 5 respectively and the proportion of 100 µm pores in granule group vi rose back to 40 0 the proportion of other pores declined fig 4 the results indicated that with the increase of granule size the surface layer of anammox granule became dense due to the proportion increase of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm pores fig 4 while the granule interior became sparse with an overall decrease in the granule porosity however the porosity of granule group vi rose back due to the formation of large cavities detailed mechanism was discussed in section 4 2 3 5 composition of anammox granules anammox granule was mainly composed of bacterial cells eps and pores the content and distribution of bacterial cells and eps greatly affect the pore structure of anammox granule kang et al 2019b the biomass of anammox granules in different sizes was shown in fig 5 a the biomass of granule group i to v rose from 5 6 10 2 g vss g wet sludge to 6 7 10 2 g vss g wet sludge while the counterpart of granule group vi declined to 6 2 10 2 g vss g wet sludge in addition the contents of protein pn and polysaccharide ps two macro components of eps were shown in fig 5b the eps content of granule group i to v rose gradually from 88 4 mg g vss to 240 3 mg g vss while granule group vi declined to 210 3 mg g vss among them the pn content of granule group i to v rose from 68 8 mg g vss to 190 5 mg g vss and granule group vi declined to 167 4 mg g vss the ps content of granule group i to v rose from 19 7 mg g vss to 49 8 mg g vss and the granule group vi declined to 42 9 mg g vss on the whole the ratio of pn to ps showed an upward trend with the increase of granule size transmission electron microscope tem was applied to observe the distribution of bacterial cells and eps in the surface layer and granule interior granule group ii iv and vi as shown in fig 6 the density of anaob cells in the surface layer rose significantly with the increase of granule size in the zoogloea with diameter of 5 8 µm the cell number rose from 10 20 in granule group ii to 50 100 in granule group vi as for granule group vi the cells inside the zoogloea were densely packed with small pore space fig 6a c further observation showed that the electron density between the bacterial cells also rose indicating an increase of eps content fig 6d f however it is worth noting that the cell density and eps content in the granule interior declined with the increase of granule size fig s2 especially for granule group vi where the anaob cells were dispersely distributed and almost no zoogloea was seen the eps content was significantly reduced with the presence of a large number of cavities beside the bacterial cells which were consistent with the experimental results shown in fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 correlation between permeability and size of anammox granule the overall activity of sludge bed is one of the greatest concerns for environmental engineers which determines the process performance directly in the anammox sludge bed reactor anaob and their associated bacteria mainly exist in the form of granular sludge and the number and intrinsic activity of immobilized functional bacteria in the anammox granule determine the nitrogen removal potential on the other hand the supporting conditions are also required to transform the potential into performance for the nitrogen removal mass transfer is the key condition liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 the permeability of anammox granule represents the ability for the fluid to pass through which directly determines the mass transfer pattern and nitrogen removal efficiency ren 2008 the granule with excellent permeability indicates that the waterflow can penetrate the granule interior and the convective mass transfer can take place without the convective mass transfer substrate can only be transported by molecular diffusion which was driven by concentration gradient li and yuan 2002 the efficiency of convective mass transfer is much higher than that of molecular diffusion therefore permeability is a synergistic mass transfer mechanism of anammox granule which plays an important role in the granule activity and the reactor performance xing et al 2015 it is necessary to investigate the permeability of anammox granules so as to understand the mass transfer of anammox granules and to provide important information for optimizing the anammox process in this study the anammox granular sludge bed reactor was operated steadily for over 20 months and the anaob had already gone through 20 generations therefore the anammox granule was in the steady state and it was found that the permeability of anammox granule was negatively correlated with the granule size the permeability almost disappeared when the granule size exceeded 1 5 mm compared with large granules small granules exhibited better mass transfer based on the findings of this study controlling the size of anammox granules in a proper range could be an efficient way for mass transfer besides achieving alternation of external pressure by realizing the circulation of granular sludge in the reactor might be effective for promoting the convection of waterflow in anammox granules which needs further investigation 4 2 pore structure linking permeability with size of anammox granule 4 2 1 relationship between permeability and pore structure the permeability of anammox granule is closely related to the pore structure mu et al 2006 liu et al 2010 according to the pore size the water in the granule pores could be divided into bound water the pore diameter is less than 0 1 µm capillary water the pore diameter is 0 1 µm 1 mm and gravity water the pore diameter is greater than 1 mm bound water has no mobility which is not affected by gravity and pressure therefore the contribution of bound water to mass transfer is negiligible capillary water can migrate under the drive of external force it is reported that the capillary effect gradually appears with the pore size of 0 1 1 mm becomes strong with the pore size of 0 05 0 1 mm and reaches the maximum with the pore size of 5 µm 50 µm gravity water has good mobility under gravity huang and li 2012 in this study it was determined that capillary pores accounted for 99 7 in anammox granules fig 4 and the effect of capillary force is significant the water flow velocity declines with the increase of hydraulic pressure when water flows through the anammox granule which has a pushing effect on the capillary water in the granule pores and the water flow velocity rises with the decrease of hydraulic pressure when water flows out the anammox granule which has a pumping effect on the capillary water in the granule pores the capillary water convection can be driven in anammox granules when the pushing and pumping effects are stronger than the capillary force and thus endows the anammox granule with permeability the capillary force rises with the decrease of pore size an et al 2016 ren et al 2008 found that aerobic granular sludge in size of 1 5 mm could exhibit permeability when the pore size was larger than 50 250 µm as shown in fig 7 ansys fluent 15 0 was applied to simulate the fluid velocity and flow line distribution in a simplified model it was observed that a small amount of fluid passed through the granule pores with granule diameter of 2 mm and pore size of 50 µm in the flow field of 0 05 m s in this study with the increase of granule size the surface layer of anammox granule became dense with the decrease of pore size the pore proportion of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm rose significantly figs 3 and 4 which led to the poor permeability of anammox granules because of the enhanced capillary force fig 2 4 2 2 relationship between pore structure and granule size micro ct has been widely applied in the study of pore structure of different materials soil bone cement etc using micro ct in situ information could be obtained non destructively about the granule porosity pore size pore distribution and pore connectivity cnudde and boone 2013 the results of this study showed that the spatial distribution of granule pores changed largely with the increase of granule size the surface layer of anammox granule became denser while the granule interior became sparser with an overall decrease of granule porosity the granule porosity with the size over 3 mm rose anammox granule is mainly composed of bacterial cells eps and pores jia et al 2017 anaob are the core component which determine the specific anammox activity in essence eps is the secretory macro molecular organic matter which constructs the skeleton of anammox granule hou et al 2015 granule pores are mass transfer channels the pore size and its distribution determine the mass transfer capacity liu et al 2010 xu et al 2019 the increase of granule size originates from the growth and reproduction of functional bacteria mainly anaob vlaeminck et al 2010 within the anammox granule the proliferation of bacterial cells will result in the space occupation leading to a denser granule structure wang et al 2020 the mass transfer deteriorated with the increase of granule size causing the lack of substrate in the granule interior eps was consumed and even the bacterial cells were hydrolyzed producing granule cavities fig 3 the surface layer of anammox granule contacts directly with the aqueous substrate the bacterial cells in the surface layer takes on the vigorous metabolism and reproduction in this study it was observed that the density of bacterial cells in the surface layer rose continuously with the increase of granule size fig 5 thus occupying the pore space eps is mainly composed of protein pn and polysaccharide ps which plays important roles in the formation stablization and gowth of anammox granule jia et al 2017 it is reported that pn contained a large amount of hydrophobic amino acids with loose structure which could fully expose the internal hydropholic groups and help to maintain the structural stability of anammox granule hou et al 2015 in the granular sludge bed reactor collision occurs between granules with the drive of waterflow and airflow the contact points of granule collision are often on the granule surface the larger the granules the greater the momentum and the stronger the collision the results of this study showed that the content of eps mainly pn rose with the increase of granule size and eps was mainly distributed in the surface layer of anammox granule fig 5 6 which was conducive to maintaining the structure of anammox granule however the increase of eps content could occupy the pore space and reduce the granule porosity it can be concluded that cell proliferation and eps secretion were the main causes for the variation of pore structure in different anammox granules 5 conclusion 1 the permeability was negatively correlated with the size of anammox granule and the permeability almost disappeared when the granule size exceeded 1 5 mm 2 with the increase of granule size the pore distribution varied significantly the surface layer of anammox granule became denser while the granule interior became sparser the denser surface layer reduced the permeability of anammox granule 3 the content of biomass and eps rose with the increase of granule size and the pore plugging of surface layer by cell proliferation and eps secretion was the main cause for the permeability deterioration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

17233,roughly ¼ of u s residents 80 million people lack access to sanitary sewers and are required to treat their wastewater through a permitted onsite wastewater treatment system owts the vast

of septic systems requiring investment in expensive advanced owts the confluence of lack of sewer unsuitable geology and poverty can lead households to have no feasible option for treating wastewater in many such communities households discharge raw sewage onto the ground through what are commonly called straight pipes here we present the first effort to synthesize available evidence documenting the scope of straight pipe use in the u s including estimates of close to 50 straight pipe use in some counties despite reports that straight pipes are widespread and troubling preliminary evidence of adverse health effects there has been no national effort to estimate the use or impacts of straight pipes there are various disincentives that discourage the reporting of straight pipes by both residents and government actors we propose ways to improve quantification of straight pipes and increase knowledge of their adverse effects we identify the characteristics of areas with large

and repair of such systems despite applicable regulations governing the containment treatment and discharge of domestic wastewater in rural areas of the united states a variety of documents including trade publications eddy 2000a mckenzie 2000 agency reports epa region 4 2002 helland 2004 journal articles carrera and flowers 2018 izenberg et al 2013 mckenna et al 2017 and popular media ballesteros 2017 tavernise 2016 indicate that surface discharge of raw sewage from homes with or without solids settling through what are commonly called straight pipes is common in many poor rural communities and presents substantial risk to the environment and public health the scope of this study is limited to the united states but a brief review revealed that surface discharge of raw sewage has also been reported in many other wealthy counties including canada javorsky 2018 luck 2018 and over 20 countries in europe eea 2020 istenic et al 2015 systematic data on straight pipe prevalence and impacts are not available in the united states either because existing surveys do not include relevant descriptors in questionnaires or survey participation is not sufficient to capture what is often

pipe data at the state level helland 2004 on a national level the decennial u s census collected data on wastewater from 1940 to 1990 census the wording of the question used until 1990 did not clearly

natural subsurface biodegradation processes beal et al 2005 given the reliance of septic systems on soil as a treatment matrix some soil and geological conditions inherently preclude the use of conventional septic systems including impermeable clay layers high water tables rocky soils shallow bedrock karst topography and steep gradients these conditions are common throughout the u s bockheim

left with no affordable options for onsite wastewater treatment given no viable alternative residents or communities throughout the u s sometimes choose to discharge untreated sewage directly into streams trenches or onto the ground a practice referred to as straight piping many straight pipes discharge sewage from individual homes but there are some clusters of homes that have a community line

wastewater management impossible for much of the remaining 75 based on the authors experience in rural alabama the cost of a proper owts can approach or exceed the worth of a mobile home conventional septic systems can be installed for as little as 3000 in alabama but advanced engineered systems are likely to be at least 5000 and can exceed 10 000 mobile homes and heir properties may be more at

barriers to problem recognition and solutions while many u s counties may have zero or negligible numbers of straight pipes the results of the few detailed investigations over the last 30 years table 1 indicate that straight pipes are present in unsewered areas with a diverse range of geologic topographic and sociodemographic conditions and in non negligible numbers where data exist additionally the variability from county to county table 1 and community to community precludes simple approaches to estimating straight pipe occurrence in addition to a lack of available data to determine the number and locations of straight pipes there has also been very little effort spent to identify the adverse effects of straight pipes on the environment and public health or to estimate the costs and benefits of remediation straight pipes are a serious problem that has received inadequate attention from scientific and regulatory bodies in addition to lack of knowledge barriers to eliminating straight pipes include owts cost poverty soil conditions and the lack of appropriate assistance programs 3 1 difficulties in determining straight pipe scope straight pipe users have clear motivations

funds to address straight pipe issues should place temporary moratoria on penalties for anyone who applies to the funding program for help replacing their straight pipe with a permitted system government entities have mixed incentives for reporting and replacing straight pipe systems employees of a county health department responsible for reporting straight pipes typically do not have access to resources to assist households with installation of a permitted system and hence cannot help poor residents finance a permitted owts health department employees who report a straight pipe may find that the household faces fines or homelessness the straight pipe remains unresolved and or adverse work related consequences e g ongoing need to report on an unresolved issue politicians and government agencies have played essential roles in the states with the most information on straight pipes nc denr 2010 eastern kentucky pride 2020 sewell 2018 2020 sometimes non governmental

rather than quantifying the problem researchers investigating straight pipes have been restricted to small surveys due to the challenges of conducting site by site inspections on private property and limited funding researchers are also restricted ethically from revealing spatial location details publicly since straight pipes are usually illegal the lessons from the states with the most straight pipe data al ky mn and nc indicate that widespread acknowledgement of straight pipes requires both 1 a local actor motivated to publicize straight pipes often with the assistance of media and 2 a funding source to find and replace straight pipes with permitted systems 3 2 difficulties in characterizing straight pipe impacts in addition to difficulties in collecting data on straight pipe presence there have been few efforts to map the extent of their impact a number of studies have documented increases in fecal bacteria in surface water downstream of straight pipes cantor et al 2017 elliott et al 2017 brannan et al 2013 the discharge of pathogens and other wastewater contaminants into the environment has clear implications for human health and the environment bartram and cairncross 2010 coffey et al 2015 cutler and miller 2005 hammer and spears 2016 but the varied exposure pathways can be difficult to characterize for example direct discharge to a perennial stream adjacent to a home in appalachia has relatively clear exposure pathways associated with downstream water use and contaminated sediments in contrast exposure pathways for straight pipe discharges adjacent to homes vary greatly discharge down a heavily wooded slope may prevent human exposure until the wastewater infiltrates or is flushed by precipitation to downstream waters however discharge to a trench swale pit or other open area can create clear risks of direct exposure to children and the possibility that children or household pets track pathogens and other contaminants back into the home while much research on gastrointestinal pathogen and helminth exposure from poor sanitation has been conducted in developing countries brown et al 2013 knee et al 2018 norman et al 2010 comparatively little has been done in rural areas of high income countries research to understand health effects exposure pathways and environmental impacts in the diverse settings with straight pipes is needed to encourage investment in solutions 3 3 difficulties in developing solutions without adequate funding and the political will to identify straight pipes determine their effects and replace them with owts the situation is unlikely to improve policymakers must understand the scope and nature of the problem to consider the costs and benefits of solutions and be able to identify funding sources to address it research on straight pipes is stunted by a lack of education on owts and limited governmental grants for this applied research while straight pipes are present in many contexts some are due to a legacy of historical discrimination communities that were excluded during 20th century periods of federal investment in sanitation infrastructure typically cannot afford to connect now that subsidies have ceased national research council 2002 in fact municipal utility bylaws often require that new customers fully bear the cost to connect continuing to penalize residents for prior discriminatory practices aiken 1987 anderson 2008 gasteyer et al 2016 older properties that were not subject to building inspections at the time of construction are common in some rural settings ingraham 2014 especially where access to the banking system is limited or so called heir property is prevalent and such properties may never have been inspected or permitted izenberg et al 2013 redlining and exploitive practices of contractors have reduced financial resources and forced communities to use inadequate systems and enforcement of straight pipe regulations through punitive fines impairs the ability of residents to purchase a permitted system carrera and flowers 2018 straight piping is not only an environmental issue but also a social economic and political issue that will require partnerships to resolve 4 a path forward the obvious essential condition for addressing a straight pipe is knowledge of its existence two complementary approaches are needed first new and emerging remote sensing technologies such as drones with infrared sensors that can detect temperature changes ferrara et al 2017 lega et al 2014 should be applied to catalog the presence of straight pipes and ensure that the data are available these technical approaches must be supplemented by efforts to address the various disincentives that prevent stakeholders from revealing straight pipes section 3 1 and leverage the existing local knowledge of straight pipes in addition to the scope of straight pipe use improved understanding of the effects on human health and the environment are needed section 3 2 our limited knowledge suggests that straight pipe discharges are largely a rural problem driven by three enabling conditions unfavorable geology limiting sub surface discharge of effluent lack of economic resources to gain access to alternative systems and the failure or inability of state and local governments to address the issue in these situations the relevant local stakeholders should receive support and guidance from government and research entities with more knowledge and resources the availability of funding for replacing straight pipes with permitted wastewater systems is essential some states have allocated funding for specific situations nc denr 2010 but realistically federal funding will be needed for 1 permitted owts 2 expansion of sewer and 3 decentralized clustered systems a new federal program providing up to 20 000 per home for owts rural septic tank access act passes in farm bill vote 2018 was recently signed into law health departments and local governments should explore how these funds could be used to solve their straight pipe problems the usda also recently funded a pilot project in one alabama county to provide permitted owts to households with straight pipes and other failing systems powell 2018 funding for a more diverse set of solutions including connection to sewers and decentralized clustered systems has been proposed in the decentralized wastewater grant act of 2020 booker 2020 5 conclusion straight pipes are a widespread problem in the u s that has been largely neglected by both researchers and government if current and pending federal programs are successful in eliminating straight pipes in select areas scaling up these solutions more broadly would likely gain political support documentation of adverse health and environmental outcomes may be just as essential researchers from a diverse array of disciplines e g engineering microbiology sociology organizational behavior

17233,roughly ¼ of u s residents 80 million people lack access to sanitary sewers and are required to treat their wastewater through a permitted onsite wastewater treatment system owts the vast majority use conventional septic systems with subsurface infiltration which work well under most conditions however certain geologic conditions e g impermeable soil high water table can preclude use of septic systems requiring investment in expensive advanced owts the confluence of lack of sewer unsuitable geology and poverty can lead households to have no feasible option for treating wastewater in many such communities households discharge raw sewage onto the ground through what are commonly called straight pipes here we present the first effort to synthesize available evidence documenting the scope of straight pipe use in the u s including estimates of close to 50 straight pipe use in some counties despite reports that straight pipes are widespread and troubling preliminary evidence of adverse health effects there has been no national effort to estimate the use or impacts of straight pipes there are various disincentives that discourage the reporting of straight pipes by both residents and government actors we propose ways to improve quantification of straight pipes and increase knowledge of their adverse effects we identify the characteristics of areas with large proportions of straight pipes and describe the role of new and pending government programs in encouraging reporting and providing solutions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fecal pathogen exposure pathways failing septic systems water sanitation and hygiene wash clean water act decentralized wastewater treatment nonpoint source pollution 1 introduction the water sanitation and hygiene wash challenges of low and middle income countries lmics are well documented including the discharge of untreated household wastewater from both centralized and decentralized systems baum et al 2013 peal et al 2014 in the united states and other wealthy countries centralized sewer systems are regulated and generally compliant with treatment requirements and discharge permits eea 2020 stoddard et al 2002 in rural areas wastewater is primarily managed on site generally via septic systems with sub surface discharge these systems are approved for use with inspections tied to real estate transactions e g new construction or ownership and or utility connections and typically are not monitored thereafter state departments of public health generally oversee the design installation and repair of such systems despite applicable regulations governing the containment treatment and discharge of domestic wastewater in rural areas of the united states a variety of documents including trade publications eddy 2000a mckenzie 2000 agency reports epa region 4 2002 helland 2004 journal articles carrera and flowers 2018 izenberg et al 2013 mckenna et al 2017 and popular media ballesteros 2017 tavernise 2016 indicate that surface discharge of raw sewage from homes with or without solids settling through what are commonly called straight pipes is common in many poor rural communities and presents substantial risk to the environment and public health the scope of this study is limited to the united states but a brief review revealed that surface discharge of raw sewage has also been reported in many other wealthy counties including canada javorsky 2018 luck 2018 and over 20 countries in europe eea 2020 istenic et al 2015 systematic data on straight pipe prevalence and impacts are not available in the united states either because existing surveys do not include relevant descriptors in questionnaires or survey participation is not sufficient to capture what is often a localized problem this limits data aggregation and documentation of remaining sanitation gaps in the u s we are aware of only one state minnesota in which there was an effort to aggregate straight pipe data at the state level helland 2004 on a national level the decennial u s census collected data on wastewater from 1940 to 1990 census the wording of the question used until 1990 did not clearly differentiate a straight pipe from a functioning permitted owts u s census bureau 1990 u s census bureau 2000 is this building connected to a public sewer yes connected to public sewer no connected to septic tank or cesspool no use other means the terms septic tank and cesspool are likely to be misunderstood by interviewees a septic tank without a drainfield that enables infiltration into the subsurface is essentially useless for pathogen reduction and cesspool to most lay people refers not to a designed subsurface wastewater infiltration system but to an open pit of sewage rural sampling through american housing survey ahs relies on this same flawed question and is then used by the joint monitoring programme jmp to estimate u s sanitation coverage estimates although global sanitation criteria define toilets that flush to the surface without treatment as unimproved bartram et al 2014 jmp data state that 99 88 of rural residents of the united states had at least basic sanitation in

outhouses and similar conditions is essential they have been described by others baldwin 1999 eddy 2004 gasteyer and vaswani 2004 mckenzie 2002 pressley 1999 and are beyond the scope of this piece in summary despite reports of straight pipes from diverse sources and geographic areas of the u s no national estimate of straight pipe use is available and the potential data sources do not include questions that could accurately estimate the use of straight pipes straight pipes are often dismissed as unfortunate anecdotes and the broader environmental engineering community generally is either unaware of the issue or assumes these cases are rare and isolated in the u s we present the first effort to synthesize available evidence documenting the scope and impacts of straight pipe use in the united states describe what is known and what is not known about straight pipe occurrence and effects and identify barriers and potential solutions to addressing these challenges 2 summary of evidence for widespread use of straight pipes between 75 and 80 of the u s population relies on municipal sewage systems for wastewater treatment with the remainder 65 80 million people responsible for managing their own wastewater onsite epa 2014 owts primarily conventional septic systems are used by more than 60 of rural residents thus owts are more common in more rural states lafond 2015 lusk et al 2017 a conventional septic system includes a tank for sedimentation of solids with liquid effluent discharged into a drain field that achieves further treatment through filtration sorption and natural subsurface biodegradation processes beal et al 2005 given the reliance of septic systems on soil as a treatment matrix some soil and geological conditions inherently preclude the use of conventional septic systems including impermeable clay layers high water tables rocky soils shallow bedrock karst topography and steep gradients these conditions are common throughout the u s bockheim and hartemink 2013 cox et al 2019 hughes et al 2005 while wealthier populations in these regions can afford expensive alternative onsite wastewater treatment systems owts poorer rural residents are left with no affordable options for onsite wastewater treatment given no viable alternative residents or communities throughout the u s sometimes choose to discharge untreated sewage directly into streams trenches or onto the ground a practice referred to as straight piping many straight pipes discharge sewage from individual homes but there are some clusters of homes that have a community line in which all of the homes are connected to a central large straight pipe that discharges into a local stream cantor et al 2017 use of permitted owts is typically enforced during property construction

presence there have been few efforts to map the extent of their impact a number of studies have documented increases in fecal bacteria in surface water downstream of straight pipes cantor et al 2017 elliott et al 2017 brannan et al 2013 the discharge of pathogens and other wastewater contaminants into the environment has clear implications for human health and the environment bartram and cairncross 2010 coffey et al 2015 cutler and miller 2005 hammer and spears 2016 but the varied exposure pathways can be difficult to characterize for example direct discharge to a perennial stream adjacent to a home in appalachia has relatively clear exposure pathways associated with downstream water use and contaminated sediments in contrast exposure pathways for straight pipe discharges adjacent to homes vary greatly discharge down a heavily wooded slope may prevent human exposure until the wastewater infiltrates or is flushed by precipitation to downstream waters however discharge to a trench swale pit or other open area can create clear risks of direct exposure to children and the possibility that children or household pets track pathogens and other contaminants back into the home while much research on gastrointestinal pathogen and helminth exposure from poor sanitation has been conducted in developing countries brown et al 2013 knee et al 2018 norman et al 2010 comparatively little has been done in rural areas of high income countries research to understand health effects exposure pathways and environmental impacts in the diverse settings with straight pipes is needed to encourage investment in solutions 3 3 difficulties in developing solutions without adequate funding and the political will to identify straight pipes determine their effects and replace them with owts the situation is unlikely to improve policymakers must understand the scope and nature of the problem to consider the costs and benefits of solutions and be able to identify funding sources to address it research on straight pipes is stunted by a lack of education on owts and limited governmental grants for this applied research while straight pipes are present in many contexts some are due to a legacy of historical discrimination communities that were excluded during 20th century periods of federal investment in sanitation infrastructure typically cannot afford to connect now that subsidies have ceased national research council 2002 in fact municipal utility bylaws often require that new customers fully bear the cost to connect continuing to penalize residents for prior discriminatory practices aiken 1987 anderson 2008 gasteyer et al 2016 older properties that were not subject to building inspections at the time of construction are common in some rural settings ingraham 2014 especially where access to the banking system is limited or so called heir property is prevalent and such properties may never have been inspected or permitted izenberg et al 2013 redlining and exploitive practices of contractors have reduced financial resources and forced communities to use inadequate systems and enforcement of straight pipe regulations through punitive fines impairs the ability of residents to purchase a permitted system carrera and flowers 2018 straight piping is not only an environmental issue but also a social economic and political issue that will require partnerships to resolve 4 a path forward the obvious essential condition for addressing a straight pipe is knowledge of its existence two complementary approaches are needed first new and emerging remote sensing technologies such as drones with infrared sensors that can detect temperature changes ferrara et al 2017 lega et al 2014 should be applied to catalog the presence of straight pipes and ensure that the data are available these technical approaches must be supplemented by efforts to address the various disincentives that prevent stakeholders from revealing straight pipes section 3 1 and leverage the existing local knowledge of straight pipes in addition to the scope of straight pipe use improved understanding of the effects on human health and the environment are needed section 3 2 our limited knowledge suggests that straight pipe discharges are largely a rural problem driven by three enabling conditions unfavorable geology limiting sub surface discharge of effluent lack of economic resources to gain access to alternative systems and the failure or inability of state and local governments to address the issue in these situations the relevant local stakeholders should receive support and guidance from government and research entities with more knowledge and resources the availability of funding for replacing straight pipes with permitted wastewater systems is essential some states have allocated funding for specific situations nc denr 2010 but realistically federal funding will be needed for 1 permitted owts 2 expansion of sewer and 3 decentralized clustered systems a new federal program providing up to 20 000 per home for owts rural septic tank access act passes in farm bill vote 2018 was recently signed into law health departments and local governments should explore how these funds could be used to solve their straight pipe problems the usda also recently funded a pilot project in one alabama county to provide permitted owts to households with straight pipes and other failing systems powell 2018 funding for a more diverse set of solutions including connection to sewers and decentralized clustered systems has been proposed in the decentralized wastewater grant act of 2020 booker 2020 5 conclusion straight pipes are a widespread problem in the u s that has been largely neglected by both researchers and government if current and pending federal programs are successful in eliminating straight pipes in select areas scaling up these solutions more broadly would likely gain political support documentation of adverse health and environmental outcomes may be just as essential researchers from a diverse array of disciplines e g engineering microbiology sociology organizational behavior

17234,supercritical water is a benign reaction medium to convert organic matters through supercritical water gasification and supercritical water oxidation into flammable gaseous and harmless substances respectively this work systematically summarizes main chemical reactions of some typical organic compounds in supercritical water with or without oxidant for the first time these compounds include hydrocarbons proteins cellulose lignins phenols alcohols aldehydes ketones organic acids and some n cl br f s and p containing organic matters their main conversion pathways reaction processes intermediate products final products and influence factors are analyzed deeply this information helps to understand and predict corresponding reaction mechanisms and to better achieve objective products in supercritical water gasification and supercritical water oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords supercritical water gasification oxidation free radical chemical reaction 1 introduction under normal conditions water is a polar solvent that can dissolve most inorganic salts while it is slightly soluble or insoluble for gases and most organic matters its density dielectric constant ion product viscosity thermal conductivity diffusion coefficient and dissolution performance change significantly at supercritical state t 374 c p 22 1 mpa ding et al 2014b huelsman and savage 2012 karakuş et al 2013 savage 1999 selvi gökkaya et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 supercritical water scw has small amounts of hydrogen bonds a low dielectric constant similar to that of polar organic solvent a high diffusion coefficient and a low viscosity akizuki et al 2011 savage 1999 wang et al 2017 thus scw has good dissolving ability which makes organic matter oxygen and scw mutually soluble so greatly reducing mass transfer resistance and becoming an ideal reaction medium on the contrary inorganic substances especially salts have very low solubility in scw and so can be easily separated moreover the temperature and pressure of scw can be changed to control reaction environment coordinate reaction rate and chemical balance and adjust the selective activity of catalyst chakinala et al 2013 to date the two most typical applications of scw are supercritical water gasification scwg and supercritical water oxidation scwo modell started to study hydrogen production by scwg of glucose and wood in the 1970s modell 1977 1980 scwg usually refers to a biomass conversion process into a hydrogen rich gas including h2 co2 ch4 and co etc in scw 400 700 c peterson et al 2008 the degradation of organic matters in scwg can be summarized by eq 1 but intermediate reaction processes may involve various complex reactions such as hydrolysis cracking and polymerization notably the reactions that significantly affect gaseous products distribution mainly include steam reforming water gas shift and methanation reactions see eqs 2 6 and minor hydrogenation reaction see eq 7 can also occur in scwg bogdan et al 2018 ding et al 2014a nanda et al 2019 weiss hortala et al 2010 1 organic compounds h 2 o h 2 c o 2 co c h 4 other small molecules 2 c h x o y 2 y h 2 o 2 y x 2 h 2 c o

reaction processes but also participates in the water gas shift reaction at the same time so providing a large amount of h free radical and increasing hydrogen yield and reducing coking production jin et al 2016 scwg can overcome the shortcomings of traditional air based gasification such as high energy consumption drying procedures castello and fiori 2012 till now scwg has developed into an effective method to convert wet biomass e g organic wastewater into a hydrogen rich mixture gas in the hydrogen production field scwo is a heat based organic waste treatment process in which oxidants commonly are h2o2 o2 and air in scwo most hydrocarbons are oxidized into co2 and h2o and their conversion rates can exceed 99 999 within 1 min schanzenbächer et al 2002 nitrogen atoms in n containing compounds are commonly converted into no3 nh4 and other organic n in liquid products and nh3 n2 and n2o in gaseous products in scwo al duri et al 2016 yang et al 2017 other heteroatoms e g cl s and p are converted into corresponding inorganic acids i e hcl h2so4 and h3po4 which can be further neutralized into organic salts lin et al 2019 veriansyah et al 2005 wang et al 2011 at present considerable amounts of articles have reported the effects of some operating parameters e g oxidation coefficient catalyst reaction temperature residence time and reactant concentration on the degradation rate of organic matter in scwo and hydrogen production capacity in scwg they have made important contributions to understanding conversion mechanisms of organic matters in scw moreover according to many articles the reactions of organic compound conversion in scw includes hydrolysis pyrolysis dehydration hydrogenation polymerization isomerization and other types of reactions resulting in the formation of a large number of various intermediate products in the oxidation gasification process therefore in order to better understand the mechanism of organic matter conversion in scw we search for relevant papers published mainly in the past decade and summarize chemical reactions of different types of organic compounds e g hydrocarbons and heteroatom containing compounds and their intermediate products mainly in scwg and scwo in detail compare the reaction processes of organic compounds with the same functional group analyze bond fracture characteristics of reactants with different functional groups and review distribution characteristics of intermediate products and final products to the best of our knowledge this is documented for the first time this information helps to clarify reaction mechanism establish reaction kinetics and predict reaction processes of organic compounds in scw 2 free radical reactions free radicals refer to atoms or groups with unpaired electrons formed by the cleavage of covalent bonds under certain conditions they are key species of triggering free radical reactions of which the elementary steps mainly involve initiation propagation and termination processes boock and klein 1993 vogel et al 2005 scw exhibits weak electrolyte characteristics so it prefers to free radical reactions but inhibits ionic reactions kruse and dinjus 2007 also free radical reactions easily occur under high temperature conditions bühler et al 2002 thereby scw is very suitable for these reactions in fact main reaction mechanisms of organic matters in scwg and scwo can be attributed to free radical reactions al duri and alsoqyani 2017 patwardhan et al 2013 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 although the concentration of initial free radicals is always low the rate constants of free radical reactions are generally high which causes the concentration of the reactants to decay faster zhang et al 2013a when large amounts of initial reactants exist in the reaction system the production rate of free radicals is far higher than their consumption rate so the whole reaction process is like a chain continuous circulation until the reactants are almost oxidized and or decomposed into final products vogel et al 2005 eventually the free radical termination reactions dominate to produce stable products table 1 shows some specific free radical reactions that occur in scw including various reaction types such as decomposition addition isomerization substitution β scission coupling and disproportionation boock and klein 1993 bühler et al 2002 fujii et al 2011 gong et al 2014 obviously h ho2 and oh are the most important free radicals in free radical reactions they are the most significant products in initial reactions and the promoters of the propagation process water is a good source of hydrogen atom which provides large amounts of h and oh eq 9 also the very low hydrogen bond content in scw makes free radicals take hydrogen from h2o more conveniently h can generate h2 through h abstraction reaction eq 20 and coupling reaction eq 29 so playing an important role in scwg in scwo the initial reaction of free radicals produced by reactants is closely related to o2 if it is used as the oxidant see eqs 10 11 gong et al 2014 o2 and h2o can react at the preheating stage and produces active free radicals such as oh oh free radicals have strong oxidation ability which can react with almost all kinds of organic compounds however the reaction rate of o2 and h2o is slow making o2 less active than hydrogen peroxide ren et al 2019 also the activation energy of o2 oxidation is high which means that o2 is more suitable at a higher temperature thus more researchers use h2o2 as an oxidant in their scwo experiments h2o2 and ho2 are main unstable substances in free radical reactions although the activity of ho2 is lower than that of oh due to its relative low abundance ho2 has become an important chain carrier in propagation reactions the decomposition of h2o2 contributes to the majority of oh sources and h2o2 can be regenerated by the h abstraction of ho2 at the same time which makes oh continuously renew from the reservoir compound h2o2 vogel et al 2005 moreover the reaction rate of h2o2 decompose eq 13 in scw is fast and thus a large number of oh can be accumulated weiss hortala et al 2010 hence h2o2 can greatly accelerate the oxidation rate of organic compounds improve the reaction rate constant and become an effective oxidant though it faces the high cost problem notably too high h2o2 concentration may not effectively improve the degradation efficiency of reactants this is can be explained by the fact that high concentration of h2o2 causes quenching reaction between oh and h2o2 so affecting the chain transfer reaction of oh lin et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to determine the optimal oxidant amount in experiments and the mixing time of oxidant and reactant needs to be controlled carefully as well as listed in table 1 the propagation process in scw is the most complicated and rich in free radical types so resulting in amounts of different liquid phase intermediates which are commonly generated by superposition of multi step free radical reactions thus the formation mechanism of intermediates in scw can be explained in addition isomerization and substitution of free radicals are more popular during propagation bühler et al 2002 and almost all free radicals produced by the initial reactions can attack the weak chemical bond of c h and takes place h abstraction reactions eqs 16 20 based on the free radical reaction principle h2 is formed by the combination of h and h eq 29 while co is formed by the decomposition of cho free radicals and then most of co is further oxidized by oh to produce co2 the peroxide rooh eq 28 produced in the termination process is relatively active and is easy to decompose into small organic compounds e g formic acid and acetic acid and then they are oxidized into co2 and h2o finally gong et al 2014 obviously free radical chain reactions have a significant impact on the formation of intermediate products and thus seriously affect the degradation pathways of reactants therefore in order to deeply understand the reaction pathways of different compounds in scw gasification and oxidation decomposition mechanisms of some typical organic compounds and their intermediates are summarized and analyzed below 3 hydrocarbons conversions hydrocarbons can be simply divided into alkanes alkenes and aromatics among these three types of hydrocarbons there are few studies on the reactions of alkenes in scw typically alkenes can undergo isomerization hydration and hydrogenation reactions in scw akizuki et al akizuki et al 2011 studied the conversion of 1 octene in sub and supercritical water 250 450 11 33 mpa catalyzed by tio2 and main products were 2 octene produced by the double bond isomerization reaction of 1 octene and dehydration reaction of 2 octanol and 2 octanol formed by the hydration reaction of 1 octene alshammari s work demonstrates that with the addition of oxidants and the increase of reaction time alkenes can be converted into alkanes by hydrogenation via partial oxidation in scw alshammari and hellgardt 2015 as for alkanes the research mainly focus on long chain alkanes e g dodecane zaker et al 2018 and hexadecane alshammari and hellgardt 2016 and long chain alkanes degrade much faster than do aromatics in scw since aromatic compounds tend to accumulate for a longer time guan et al 2012 recently some studies show the potential for hydrogen production through scwg of heavy hydrocarbons and report different key kinetic data for instance in the n hexadecane scwg at 525 605 c and 22 mpa the pre exponential frequency factor and the reaction activation energy are 7 36 1014 s 1 and 263 68 kj mol 1 respectively alshammari and hellgardt 2016 picou et al picou et al 2011 carried out the non catalytic scwg of 1 dodecane at 530 699 c and 24 mpa and found that reformation reaction had the largest pre exponential frequency factor and activation energy i e 1 75 108 s 1 and 197 3 kj mol 1 compared with water gas shift reaction 4 16 103 s 1 and 107 4 kj mol 1 and pyrolysis 10 03 s 1 and 60 6 kj mol 1 moreover the pre exponential frequency factors and activation energies of reformation reaction 2 20 109 s 1 and 226 30 kj mol 1 and pyrolysis 1 12 103 s 1 and 96 04 kj mol 1 are reported for the n dodecane scwg at 626 705 c and 24 mpa lee et al 2009 hexadecane can crack into smaller n alkanes and 1 alkenes hydrocarbons ranging from c15 to c1 under sub and supercritical conditions highly reactive long chain free radicals e g primary and secondary hexadecyl radicals generated in this process possibly undergo a series of reactions mainly including β scission hydrogen abstraction isomerization and addition and increasing reaction temperature can enhance the formation of 1 alkenes via β scission while increasing pressure can improve the formation n alkanes via h abstraction alshammari and hellgardt 2016 finally the reaction process is terminated by the combination of smaller free radicals to form stable products and thus the whole process is far less complicated than that of aromatic hydrocarbons therefore some aromatic hydrocarbons especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs with chemical stability such as naphthalene phenanthrene anthracene and pyrene are focused on below they are typical refractory intermediate products of biomass coal oil and other substances during supercritical water gasification decomposition arcelus arrillaga et al 2017 bai et al 2020 jin et al 2016 if they are not treated well char and tar can be formed which seriously reduce gasification efficiency in the scwg process of pahs the method of ring cracking is a key in current and future research because it is a decisive step affecting complete gasification of reactants yu et al 2016a at present scw is an effective reaction environment to promote the cleavage of aromatic rings into small molecules because it can effectively weaken c c bond energy in the aromatic rings for example the energy barrier of ring opening reaction of anthracene can be reduced from 776 7 to 218 5 kj mol jin et al 2016 in the past decade many scholars have used pahs as model compounds to explore the cracking of rings and their reaction mechanisms in scwg han et al 2019 jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2013c in pahs scwg polycyclic structures are first transformed into low ring and small ring structures e g three rings and five rings through deformation and fracture and then break to form linear chains and finally produce small molecules via bond fracture more specifically there are two different explanations in detail the first one is shown in fig 2 a hydrogen atom in scw is added to the c atom on a ring which causes the c ring c ring bond to break and oh in scw connect with another c atom at the same time jin et al 2016 then the c ring c ring bond on the middle ring of pahs can also crack and bond and the lower structure can be twisted until the middle benzene ring is completely destroyed another explanation is that the breakage of pahs is due to that h on the outer ring is easily attacked by highly reactive oh radicals or h2o molecule and thus h abstraction occurs han et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 as indicated in fig 2b when aromatic ring loses hydrogen it becomes distorted and unstable and is prone to crack then it can be transformed into a macro ring or multi ring structure composed of three rings and five rings these rings are further opened by the breaking of the c c bond due to the continued attack of oh radicals it is also believed that after these rings are broken some linear chains are formed and then the c c bonds are broken to form some small molecules in addition oh and h radicals in scw play an important role in promoting and breaking the bonds in the whole process some scholars have studied the scwo of pahs in early years onwudili and williams 2007 xu et al 2011 xu et al 2003 yang and hildebrand 2006 and the first reaction on rings is oxygen invasion taking naphthalene as an example the five main intermediate products for oxygen to invade naphthalene rings are 1 4 naphthoquinone 1 naphthol phthalic anhydride coumarin and chromone xu et al 2011 they then mainly convert into salicylaldehyde dibenzofuran fluorenone and xanthone after one ring cracking and further break into chains and are oxidized into acids h2o and co2 finally in addition isomerization and hydrogen addition also take place during the cracking process of pahs in scw wang et al wang et al 2012 obtained hydrogenation products i e tetralin and decalin by the ring opening reaction of naphthalene and found that rh and mo ni were active for hydrogenation reaction and hy zeolite and mo ni promoted isomerization and ring opening reaction cheng et al cheng et al 2009 used fe2 moo4 3 to catalyze naphthalene hydrogenation in subcritical water for tetralin production and found that h d exchange reaction also occurred during the reaction process both phenanthrene and anthracene belong to pahs containing three rings the three rings center of anthracene is in a straight line and anthracene is an isomer of phenanthrene in anthracene scwg jin et al jin et al 2015 confirmed that major liquid products at 700 c and 25 mpa were benzene and naphthalene followed by fluorene 9 10 dihydro anthracene 2 methyl naphthalene and 3 phenyltoluene k2co3 could effectively reduce the amount of benzene and naphthalene and appropriate temperatures for benzene and naphthalene scwgs were thought to be 700 c and 650 c respectively yeletsky et al yeletsky et al 2019 adopted nimo sio2 to catalyze the cracking of phenanthrene in scw at 425 c and 23 mpa and found that reactions took place preferentially in the central ring of phenanthrene and the catalyst could promote the hydrogenation of polycyclic hydrocarbons in scw there are three main liquid products including dihydrophenanthrene produced by hydrogenation and benzophenone and xanthine formed via oxidation based on intermediate products and reactions mentioned in several literatures jin et al 2015 wang et al 2012 yeletsky et al 2019 potential degradation pathways of phenanthrene anthracene and naphthalene in scw are deduced as displayed in fig 3 some connections among the three typical pahs degradation in scw are speculated obviously the degradation processes of pahs in scw mainly involve hydrogenation contraction ring opening and dealkylation changing from polycyclic to monocyclic to carbon chain first of all for aromatic hydrocarbons with three rings one way is the middle ring hydrogenation which forms dihydrophenanthrene etc then the unstable middle ring is contracted to produce compounds such as fluorine so resulting in ring opening eventually another way is the outer ring c c bond breaking of pahs which produces double aromatic ring products and then follow naphthalene degradation network till now adding k2co3 jin et al 2015 nimo wang et al 2012 yeletsky et al 2019 iron oxide han et al 2019 or oxidant arcelus arrillaga et al 2017 has been proved to be effective in reducing the content of intermediate products and in greatly improving gasification effect of aromatic hydrocarbons the addition of a small amount of oxidant oxidation coefficient 0 2 can promote the production of ring opening products and inhibit the formation of polymers thereby increasing h2 yield wang et al 2016b according to scwg experiments of the mixture of naphthalene phenol and acetic acid the content of phenolic compounds should be reduced sufficiently in biomass coal scwg because phenolic compounds can cause the cross linking reaction of pahs wang et al 2018b 4 conversions of o containing organic matters in scw 4 1 cellulose proteins and lignins biomass has played an important role in global renewable energy utilization and is considered as the fourth largest energy resource after coal oil and natural gas kerolli mustafa et al 2015 biomass scwg for hydrogen production is technically and economically feasible and has a promising future caputo et al 2016 kang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 scwg can directly convert high moisture of biomass without high energy consumption drying processes so has received widespread attention in recent years zhu et al 2016 biomass contains large amounts of complex macromolecular substances such as proteins celluloses hemicelluloses and lignins the interior of these macromolecules is a complicated network formed by covalent bonds intermolecular bridges and van der waals forces thus studying degradation pathways of these complex molecules in scwg is of great significance for optimizing reaction system and future market application celluloses are the most abundant parts of biomass they can be considered as glucose polymer by d glucose subunits linked together by β 1 4 glycosidic bonds and contains hydrogen bonds and van der waals force sandeep et al kumar and gupta 2008 reported that celluloses could partially dissolve in subcritical water at 302 c and completely dissolve at 330 c the addition of acids e g mineral acids or solid acids enzymes e g cellobiohydrolase and supported metal catalysts e g pt γ al2o3 and ru husy si al 20 is favorable for the hydrolysis of celluloses dhepe and fukuoka 2008 jalak and vaeljamaee 2010 tyufekchiev et al 2018 yang et al 2011 fig 4 displays potential degradation pathways of celluloses scwg cellulose initially hydrolyzes into oligomers and monomers in scwg and further hydrolyzes to form glucose which can isomerize and produce fructose as temperature increases hydrolysates can convert into some intermediates e g phenols dimers and furfurals and low molecular matters e g acids aldehydes ketones and alcohols by a variety of reactions e g dehydration condensation isomerization polymerization and ultimately decompose to produce gases mainly consisting of h2 ch4 co and co2 ding et al 2014a fang et al 2008 yin et al 2017 glucose is the most major hydrolysis product of cellulose under high temperature and high pressure conditions and its subsequent degradation reaction mechanism is crucial to reveal the complete degradation of cellulose which has attracted much attention of many researchers in scwg without catalyst glucose is easily dehydrated to form furfural and 5 hydroxymethyl furfural and then undergoes various reactions e g decomposition isomerization and condensation to form 7 hydroxy 1 indanone 2 vinylfuran 2 methyl 5 hydroxybenzofuran 3 hydroxy benzaldehyde 1 3 hydroxyphenyl ethanone 2 naphthalenol 2 methyl 1 4 benzenediol hydroquinone and resorcinol and other refractory aromatic liquid products which inhibit further gasification susanti et al 2012 in order to reduce tar production and improve gasification efficiency many researchers add koh ding et al 2014a naoh onwudili and williams 2009 ni based catalysts huang et al 2019 yin et al 2017 pt based catalysts fang et al 2008 and a small amount of oxidant jin et al 2010 lu et al 2008 one explanation is that catalyst can lead to the formation of more gasification compounds such as hydroxylated ketones aldehydes and acids while oxidant can accelerate the decomposition of aldehydes so inhibiting the production of tar char and other polymers improved products are mainly composed of unsaturated hydrocarbons with low carbon numbers cyclic and non cyclic ketones aldehydes carboxylic acids and their alkylated and hydroxylated derivatives and there is no furfural formation so greatly improving the degradation rate of glucose in addition kobiro et al kobiro et al 2013 proved that sugars e g glucose and polysaccharides were also effective hydrogen sources and could supply hydrogen free radicals h which promote the dehydroxylation reduction of alcohols in scw and catalyze the hydrogenation reduction of olefins proteins are the main components of sewage sludge microalgae and some other biomass fig 5 illustrates potential degradation pathways in scwg of proteins in the scwg process proteins are commonly hydrolyzed to amino acids and peptides first and then amino acids take place deamination to produce ammonia and organic acids and decarboxylation to generate carbonic acid and amines changi et al 2012a sato et al 2004 sheehan and savage 2020 as a result of maillard reaction amino acids can also react with carbonyl compounds to form n heterocyclic compounds such as indole pyrimidine pyrrole and pyridine so causing the production of free radical scavengers which inhibit the gas production in scwg ma et al 2017 peterson et al 2010 qian et al 2015 xu et al 2019 peptides can be decomposed into aromatic hydrocarbons aldehydes diketopiperazines and aliphatic amines etc ma et al 2017 therefore using amino acids as model compounds to study their gasification in scw is helpful for revealing the degradation pathways of proteins in scwg and the effect of nitrogen on biomass scwg amino acid molecules have various structures so scwg difficulty and their products are quite different according to the research on glycine and alanine scwg dileo et al 2008 samanmulya et al 2014 su et al 2015 the main products of glycine are ammonia methylamine glycolic acid and formic acid while the products of alanine mainly include ammonia ethylamine propanoic acid diacetone alcohol n ethyl propanamide as for amino acids with more complex structures hydrothermal reaction products of phenylalanine are phenylethylamine styrene and phenylethanol changi et al 2012b which are formed by the decarboxylation and deamination of phenylalanine and the hydration of styrene respectively samanmulya s group has carried out many scwg experiments of amino acids in the past decade including glycine alanine histidine aminobutyric acid and serine etc samanmulya et al 2017a b samanmulya et al 2014 among them the gasification efficiencies of aminobutyric acid glycine and alanine in scw are almost the same and that of serine is the highest however the gasification efficiency of histidine is relatively low due to the formation of stable intermediate 4 methylimidazole in the research of caputo et al caputo et al 2016 gasification resistance is in the order of glycine leucine glutamic acid and the easy gasification of glutamic acid is due to the existence of two carboxyl groups moreover ch4 increases in the order of leucine glutamic acid glycine owing to the number of methyl groups in the molecules this is consistent with the explanation of methane source in samanmulya s research samanmulya et al 2014 however h2 concentration follows an opposite order at present there are few studies on degradation behavior of amino acids with much more complex structures under high temperature and high pressure conditions the research on the interaction between amino acids and other organic compounds is also being developed such as amino acids and phenol su et al 2015 amino acids and glucose caputo et al 2016 peterson et al 2010 alkali salts and some metals have become catalyst research focus for amino acid scwg the addition of salts nano3 k2co3 and k2hpo4 may accelerate the decomposition of amino acids chakinala et al 2010 changi et al 2012b 0 1wt na2co3 xu et al 2009 or ni azadi et al 2013 dileo et al 2008 is also effective for increasing hydrogen production in glycine scwg lee lee et al 2015 proposed that ni pt ac and ni pd ac effectively reformed c2 hydrocarbons intermediates produced in valine to h2 and co2 the research on the degradations of different amino acids with various catalysts shows a good development prospect the chemical structure of lignin is mainly composed of repeating units of glyceraldehyde and guaiacol fig 6 indicates potential degradation pathways of lignins scwg lignins contain many oxygen containing functional groups including hydroxyl group carboxyl group carbonyl group ether bond and ester bond etc when lignin decomposes in scw without catalyst ether bond and ester bond are easy to hydrolyze and form phenolic compounds and aldehydes e g formaldehyde yong and matsumura 2012 in more detail the phenolic components that lignins are first degraded in scwg mainly include catechols guaiacols and syringols intermediate products e g alcohols aromatics and aldehydes are derived from the denaturation of these phenols and finally converted into simple gases including h2 co co2 and ch4 etc however in the scwg process phenolic compounds and aldehydes may be condensed or cross linked to form high molecular condensation products for example phenol and formaldehyde take place condensation reaction to form phenolic resin these condensation products together with other refractory phenolic derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons lead to the formation of char and tar jin et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 isomerization is the main reaction of phenol conversion and other reactions are cracking alkylation and condensation the cracking of alkyl groups attached to phenol molecules results in the release of gas hydrocarbons and alkoxyphenol researchers commonly use phenol as a model compound of lignin to analyze its scwg process and detailed mechanism explanation can be seen in the following section in recent years the positive or negative synergistic effect between phenol as a refractory intermediate and other compound has attracted more attention such as glucose and phenol castello et al 2015 phenol and acetic acid wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2013b phenol and naphthalene wang et al 2017 and phenol and cyclohexanol bogdan et al 2018 based on the above analyses fig 7 illustrates the potential reaction processes of polymers in scwg first polymers hydrolyze into oligomers and monomers and the monomers then decompose in scw through isomerization dehydration condensation and hydrolysis etc to produce intermediate products further the intermediate products can polymerize together with some substances that no longer decompose to form char and tar finally the intermediate products can directly undergo gas production reactions such as steam reforming water gas shift and methanation to produce gases e g co co2 h2 and ch4 or be also decomposed pyrolyzed and hydrothermally converted into other intermediate products and then generate gas by steam reforming reaction and so on in addition some metal catalysts e g ru ru γ al2o3 pt pt γ al2o3 raney ni ni α al2o3 ru c ni silica alumina ni mgo ni ceo2 al2o3 ni al2o3 ni ac nila al2o3 and niru al2o3 are commonly used in monomer degradation process azadi et al 2013 ding et al 2014b fang et al 2008 hossain et al 2019 hossain et al 2017 methanation reaction catalysts are mainly ni rh ru pd pt and active carbon etc and the order of catalytic performance for ch4 selectivity is ru rh pt pd ni chakinala et al 2012 azadi et al 2013 furthermore the catalysts for the water gas shift reaction are main alkaline catalysts including ni ru naoh koh k2co3 khco3 nahco3 and natural alkali etc akgül and kruse 2012 guan et al 2016 lee et al 2015 onwudili and williams 2009 xia et al 2014 4 2 phenols as one kind of difficult degradation compounds phenolic compounds are widely used in papermaking textile pharmaceutical petrochemical and other industries martin sanchez et al 2017 they are also regarded as intermediates in scwg of biomass coal and municipal sludge ma et al 2017 wang et al 2018c wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020b phenols can be produced by two main pathways in scw qian et al 2015 one is the cleavage of aryl ether bond in lignin decomposition in scw and another pathway is the condensation or cyclization of sugar produced by cellulose hydrolysis the degradation behavior of phenol in scw has drawn much attention and many researchers focus on phenol scwo with catalysts such as activated carbon matsumura et al 2002 cuo al2o3 yu and savage 2000 2001 mno2 tio2 de silva et al 2017 carulite 150 zhang and savage 1998 and mno2 yu and savage 2001 to improve the degradation efficiency of phenol in scwo phenol is mainly attacked by ho2 ho and o2 to produce c6h5o which is called phenoxy free radical the free radical further stimulates reactions and leads to the ring opening reaction of phenoxy free radical major free radical reactions of phenol in the initiation process can be expressed by following eqs 31 34 31 c 6 h 5 oh c 6 h 5 o h 32 c 6 h 5 oh o 2 c 6 h 5 o h o 2 33 c 6 h 5 oh ho 2 c 6 h 5 o h 2 o 2 34 c 6 h 5 oh oh c 6 h 5 o h 2 o isomerism as one unique characteristic of phenoxy has a great influence on its reaction mechanism phenoxy can exist in three isomeric forms in scw there are three possible reaction pathways of phenoxy free radicals including coupling to form dimer hydroxylation to form phenylglycol and ring opening gopalan and savage 1994 however the main routes of phenol degradation are dimer formation reaction and ring opening reaction dimerization is the result of free radical recombination and free radical chain tautomerization high concentration of phenol enhances dimerization matsumura et al 2000 the ring opening process may be explained by that ho2 is added to phenoxy free radicals to form hydroperoxides then the weak o o bond in the hydroperoxides breaks and finally β scission occurs gopalan and savage 1994 guan et al guan et al 2011 reported that the formation of dimers is due to the action of oxygen and phenol free radicals while the cracking of phenol ring is the result of oxygen attacking the ring the latter leads to the formation of maleic acid which is then further oxidized into unstable oxalic acid in scw and further transformed into gaseous co2 fig 8 indicates the distribution of degradation products of phenol scwo thus aldehydes and acids such as formic acid glyoxal oxalic acid propionic acid succinic acid and maleic acid have been detected as ring opening intermediate products produced monocyclic products mainly include p benzoquinone catechol hydroquinone resorcinol and so on and large amounts of dimer products formed by polymerization are majorly diphenyl ether and dibenzofuran etc ghoreishi et al 2015 in the past decade phenol scwg for hydrogen production has been widely concerned in fact phenol is an intermediate product which is difficult to be gasified completely without catalyst the conversion rate of phenol in scwg at 750 c can reach up to 98 bogdan et al 2018 hence many researchers have conducted catalytic scwg of phenol and table 2 lists some experimental results ni based catalysts can effectively prevent the polymerization of phenol or its intermediates wang et al 2019 phenol can almost be gasified completely even at a low temperature of 450 c with the ni co ni zn graphitized carbon black bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst jia et al 2017 ni20zn15 is beneficial to ch4 production while ni20co15 is more favorable for h2 production showing much high phenol gasification activity however due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles and the decrease of atom concentration on catalyst surface catalyst activity can be greatly reduced after reactions hossain et al 2019 jia et al 2017 in the future the study of phenol degradation catalysts can focus on finding a better carrier support to improve the stability of ni based catalysts as for other catalysts ru graphitized carbon black and ru ceo2 can stably exist in scw and are not easily inactivated in scwg guan et al 2016 yu et al 2016b ru ceo2 can obviously promote hydrogenation reaction and inhibit the formation of dimers e g dibenzofuran and pahs moreover bogdan bogdan et al 2018 proposed a non catalytic method that is the phenol was initially converted into cyclohexanol by catalytic hydrogenation which is more conducive to the formation of gaseous products liquid products of phenol scwg include benzene toluene o cresol 2 ethylphenol naphthalene biphenyl phenylphenols and dibenzofuran etc huelsman and savage 2012 one type of intermediate compounds are decomposition products containing simple structure such as benzene and another one is phenol dimer such as dibenzofuran notably benzene and dibenzofuran have the highest content among them which are formed by dehydrogenation and dimerization respectively more specifically the formation of dibenzofuran can be explained by the combination of phenol and o phenoxy and then intramolecular dehydration benzene is a main product of phenol pyrolysis which is produced by the substitution of hydroxyl with h atom released from the formation of other free radicals e g phenoxy huelsman and savage 2012 fig 9 elucidates potential reaction pathway of phenol scwg thus the whole process of phenol scwg is accompanied by cracking ring opening polymerization and other reactions among them benzene participates in the combination of large amounts of rings and thus forms many dense ring networks with the increase of temperature and reaction time polymerization products difficult to decompose are finally formed so leading to the formation of tar yong and matsumura 2014 furthermore the mixture of n containing substances should be avoided in phenol scwg because ammonia will inhibit the formation of hydrogen and the degradation of phenol this is mainly due to the formation of more stable nitrogen polycyclic compounds wang et al 2018c many endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs belong to phenols with complex structures which can simulate the hormones and disturb endocrine system even under trace concentrations such as bisphenol a bpa bisphenol e bpe nonylphenol np and octylphenol op scw can provide an ideal environment to degrade or transform them into environmentally friendly substances scwo of bpa np and op at 400 c 24 mpa for 0 5 6 min have much higher degradation rates compared with other processes and degradation rate constants of toc follow the order of np 0 331 min 1 op 0 271 min 1 bpa 0 236 min 1 yang et al 2019a among them bpa can generate phenol isopropyl phenol hydroquinone benzoquinone and hydroxybenzoic acid etc after oh attacks the hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring and the c c bond between two aromatic rings yang et al 2019c other researchers also find that the decompositions of bpa and bpe in high temperature water at 250 350 c are effective and environmentally friendly routes to the synthesis of 4 isopropenylphenol and 4 vinylphenol respectively hunter et al 2004 savage et al 2006 4 3 alcohols some studies have reported oxidation mechanisms and kinetics of typical alcohols in scwo such as methanol brock et al 1996 vogel et al 2005 ethanol koido et al 2010 schanzenbächer et al 2002 and isopropanol queiroz et al 2013 table 3 shows main liquid and gas products and kinetic data in scwo of some alcohols thus alcohols are easy to be converted into ketones acids or aldehydes in scwo more specifically formaldehyde is the main intermediate product of methanol scwo while acetic acid acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are major intermediate products in ethanol scwo but acetic acid acetaldehyde formaldehyde acetone and low carbon number alcohols for isopropanol scwo in the vogel et al s study on methanol scwo methanol can also be synthesized into ether through acid catalysis during the preheating process in subcritical water vogel et al 2005 as the number of carbon atom in alcohols increases the composition of intermediate products of alcohols scwo becomes more complex and the carbon chain length of products may reduce or keep constant overall alcohols scwo trends to reduce carbon chain length and finally form co2 and water via a series of intermediate products methanol is the most difficult to oxidize in alcohols boock and klein 1993 and its conversion rate is only about 65 at 538 c and 24 6 mpa brock et al 1996 at the same conditions the conversion rate of methanol is lower than that of ethanol and isopropanol due to the influence of oh hydroxyl α h on the c atom connecting with alcohol is more active and easier to be attacked by o2 to form ho2 free radicals in scwo of the three alcohols large amounts of active free radicals take place interaction which is manifested as dehydrogenation cracking polymerization and other reaction forms fig 10 elucidates the oxidation degradation pathway of typical alcohols in scw methanol reacts mainly with oh but less with ho2 dagaut et al 1996 at a typical scw reaction pressure in scwo with h2o2 oh for degrading alcohol is majorly derived from the decomposition of h2o2 however except from h2o2 fujii et al fujii et al 2011 pointed out that free radical reaction i e ho2 h2o oh h2o2 effectively enhanced oh formation when pressure continues to rise reaction pathway analysis shows that the fastest reaction of alcohol consumption is due to the attack of oh and produced various free radicals generate ketones aldehydes and acids after propagation and termination reactions ketones can be further oxidized into acids by ho2 attack and aldehydes can be converted by oh and ho2 to form acids or hco acids can take place decarboxylation to produce co2 while hco generate co and finally be oxidized into co2 these radicals are unstable intermediates which react much faster with alcohols than does water or oxygen so accelerating the propagation of reaction chains in recent years the research focus of alcohols has transferred to hydrogen production by scwg or as an auxiliary fuel of hydrothermal flame in scwo in scwg major reactions are bond breaking of reactants and chain reactions initiated mainly by h and oh electron donating properties of the oh can improve gasification efficiency by stabilizing intermediate free radicals formed at the same time h can attack the hydroxyl group on moleculars to produce water together with other free radicals formation concomitantly and h can attack the h atom or combine with other h to produce h2 due to harsh gasification conditions carbonyl compounds especially aldehydes which are expected to be the intermediate products of alcohol gasification are unstable under such extreme conditions wang et al 2010 they are easy to decompose into h2 and co at high temperature and high pressure conditions and then undergo water gas shift reaction and methanation reaction taking methanol scwg as an example its reaction pathway is illustrated in fig 11 for scwg of alcohols with different carbon chain lengths the gasification efficiency of methanol is the lowest but that of ethanol is the highest the former can reach 25 at 550 c for 140 min dileo and savage 2006 while the latter can be 76 3 at 550 c 25 mpa for 50 min therdthianwong et al 2011a however gasification efficiency decreases slightly with an increase in carbon chain length after c 2 this may be due to the formation of intermediate compounds tar and char via polymerization reactions chakinala et al 2013 furthermore ni al2o3 and ni cezro2 al2o3 have significant effects on ethanol reforming decomposition acetaldehyde decomposition water gas shift reaction and carbon monoxide methanation therdthianwong et al 2011b glycerol containing three hydroxyl groups so it has a more complex degradation process and products in scwg a simple kinetics study was done by guo et al guo et al 2012 and the apparent activation energy and apparent pre exponential factor for glycerol scwg at 487 600 25 mpa are 104 5 kj mol and 105 90 s 1 respectively in scwg glycerol dehydrates first to form acrolein and hydroxyacetone and then the c c bond breaks during pyrolysis to generate c1 and c2 compounds such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde guo et al 2012 pairojpiriyakul et al pairojpiriyakul et al 2014 analyzed comprehensively products in glycerol scwg from 450 to 575 at 25 mpa and major gaseous products were h2 co2 co ch4 with some traces of c2h6 c2h4 c3h8 and c3h6 liquid products included acetaldehyde acetol methanol acetic acid propionaldehyde allyl alcohol acetone acrolein ethanol ethylene glycol and acrylic acid etc but main components were acetaldehyde and acetol the number increase of hydroxyl groups can improve carbon gasification efficiency because it can reduce the formation of hydrocarbons and increase the formation of co and thus leads to the subsequent production of more co2 and h2 chakinala et al 2013 therefore this kind of alcohol with multiple hydroxyl groups is an excellent raw material for hydrogen production typical representative glycerin of polyhydroxy alcohol has become the research hotspot of hydrogen production by scwg in recent years the treatment process in scw has significant energy demand at the startup stage if some real organic wastes treated do not have enough intrinsic heat value auxiliary heat operation will result in a high operation cost active alcohols can release large amounts of ho2 and oh free radicals and form synergistic oxidation effect and a high reaction heat zhang et al 2015 so accelerating the scwo rates of some refractory substances this is called a co oxidation phenomenon and added alcohols are called co fuels nowadays using organic solvent as auxiliary fuel to help start up operation or as co fuel to improve the degradation of reactants in scwo of some organic wastes has become a good solution to overcome the high cost of scwo common alcohols such as methanol shimoda et al 2016 zhang et al 2019c ethanol ploeger et al 2006 and isopropanol abelleira et al 2013 bermejo et al 2008 cabeza et al 2014 can accelerate oxidation degradation of reactants especially to improve the removal rate of refractory intermediates in scwo shimoda et al shimoda et al 2016 studied the mixing effect of ammonia and methanol in scwo of which initial concentrations were both 2 9 mmol l and found that methanol could promote the oxidation of nh3 n to form n2o fig 12 shows main reaction pathway of methanol in scw to accelerate oxidative degradation of nh3 n and the fastest reaction is nh3 oh nh2 h2o as can be seen in this figure thus ammonia and methanol share generated free radicals and promote mutual oxidation reactions to realize the decomposition of nh3 n zhang et al zhang et al 2019b compared the positive effect and exothermic performance of methanol and isopropanol as the auxiliary fuel of ammonia and concluded that methanol was superior to isopropanol qian et al qian et al 2019 pointed out that in addition to the reason of free radicals alcohols not only inhibited the formation of refractory products e g non nitrogen and nitrogen aromatic compounds but also promoted the formation of easily degradable substances e g non nitrogen open chain compounds zhang et al zhang et al 2019c also confirmed that methanol had the function of co oxidation in scwo of methanol acetic acid and phenol and improved the decomposition of phenol in their report methanol was first oxidized to produce large amounts of active intermediates i e ho2 and oh this caused a series of subsequent proliferation reactions including the oxidative decarboxylation of acid and the ring opening reaction of phenol ethanol releases the most amount of ho2 in the same time compared with ethanol and isopropanol and ho2 can affect the concentration of oh according to ho2 h2o oh h2o2 so ethanol is believed to have the strongest co oxidation effect among the three alcohols above qian et al 2019 4 4 aldehydes ketones and acids aldehydes ketones and acids are considered as typical intermediate products in scwg of model compounds and real biomass see eq 35 they are the precursors of generating co2 and h2o in scwo and h2 and co2 in scwg hence this section comprehensively describes these three types of compounds 35 hydrocarbons h 2 o aldehydes ketones acids other products co h 2 c h 4 c o 2 other gases and intermediates there are few studies on the reactions of aldehydes and ketones as reactants in scw and they often appear in forms of intermediates in articles ketones have strong activity and can be transformed into polymers coke resin carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide etc alcohols and ketones can be converted into each other through dehydrogenation and hydrogenation yang et al 2012 acetic acid can be transformed into acetone via bimolecular decarboxylation at the same time ketones can also be converted into carboxylic acids by c c cleavage in the presence of oxidant yang et al 2012 although most reaction products in scw are generated through free radical reactions the formation of aldehydes e g acetaldehyde and formaldehyde is ascribed to high density of ion reactions bühler et al 2002 aldehydes are also special compounds which are intermediate redox states of organic carbon and can generally become the precursors of carboxylic acids via disproportionation akgül et al akgül and kruse 2013 reported that formaldehyde participates in two competitive disproportionation reactions in subcritical water one is self disproportionation eq 36 which produces methanol and formic acid through oxidation reduction reaction between two kinds of formaldehydes another one is cross disproportionation eq 37 which forms methanol and carbonic acid via oxidation reduction reaction between formaldehyde and formic acid and then carbonic acid is easily decomposed into co2 and h2o herein formic acid is the hydrogenation agent for formaldehyde reduction and excessive formic acid promotes cross disproportionation in scwg aldehydes are important sources of h2 eq 39 kobiro et al 2013 it is significant to increase the content of aldehydes in intermediate products of scwg which helps to improve final h2 production fan fan et al 2018 proposed that adding formic acid to formaldehyde scwg would increase gasification efficiency and hydrogen efficiency this can be explained by the fact that formic acid promotes the self decomposition of formaldehyde eq 39 to generate h2 and induces free radical reactions of generated methanol eqs 36 37 to produce more h2 eqs 40 41 fan et al 2018 36 2 hcho h 2 o c h 3 oh hcooh 37 hcho hcooh h 2 o c h 3 oh c o 2 h 2 o 38 rc h 2 cho rc h 3 co 39 hcho h 2 co 40 c h 3 oh h 2 o c o 2 3 h 2 41 c h 3 oh co 2 h 2 decarboxylation and dehydration are two main types of reaction pathways of organic acids in scw watanabe et al 2001 xu et al 2009 as shown by eqs 42 43 however decarboxylation is more favorable and dominant reaction in scwg and is also the main approach to remove o from acid in the form of co2 formic acid scwg can produce amounts of h2 and co2 eq 44 xu et al 2009 while acetic acid scwg leads to much ch4 and co2 products eq 45 overall as the content of c atoms in the acids increases the general trend of the hydrocarbons yield is oscillating and rising after scwg chakinala et al 2013 chakinala chakinala et al 2013 found that with the increase of acid chain length from c1 to c8 gasification efficiency began to decline sharply and then became relatively stable acetic acid can be detected in liquid products of long chain acids above c2 scwg and some other products such as acetone benzene toluene are also found chakinala et al 2013 this shows that formic acid can be completely gasified while long chain acids c 2 are difficult to be fully gasified and easier to be converted into short chain acids by c c bond breaking in reactions that is conversion occurs towards the trend of forming acetic acid 42 rcooh c o 2 rh 43 rcooh h 2 o r co 44 hcooh c o 2 h 2 45 c h 3 cooh c h 4 c o 2 moreover the production of benzene and toluene also indicates that aromatization reaction occurs during the degradation of long chain acids acetic acid is indeed a very stable intermediate product and quite difficult to degrade in scwg hashimoto et al 2010 wang et al 2018b however many researchers add acetic acid to scwg reactions to promote the degradation of refractory compounds such as naphthalene and phenol this is mainly because that active free radicals ch3coo ch3 cooh and coch3 generated during acetic acid decomposition can stimulate the decomposition of other refractory substances wang et al 2018b the gasification of linear carboxylic acid in scw majorly starts from the breaking of the o h bond of carboxyl group and then β scission is the main reaction of fractionation and gas formation chakinala et al 2013 the influences of catalyst are commonly explored to improve the degradation of other complex acids gong gong et al 2017 used fecl3 as a catalyst to enhanceh2 production of humic acid which are very difficult to degrade in scwg ptsnx c and activated carbon can promote the decarboxylation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids into fuel series hydrocarbons in subcritical or supercritical water fu et al 2011 yeh et al 2015 5 n containing organic compounds conversions n containing organic compounds often appear in conversion products of algae protein and other substances due to n containing model compounds are much more hydrothermally stable there are few studies on scwg of n containing model compounds to the best of our knowledge the scwg of n containing model compounds requires very high temperatures 550 750 up to 500 even with catalysts guo et al 2013 guo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 it is a challenge to study the scwg of these compounds in the future in scwo many n containing groups can stabilize free radicals for example the free radical rno of nitrogen oxide is much stable n containing cyclic organic compounds can be called free radical scavengers which hinder further free radical reactions caputo et al 2016 thus denitrogenation is one of key research directions of scwo there are several major forms of n in organic compounds including nh2 no2 n heterocyclic n n and their mixture with more than two types of n containing forms different n containing functional groups can generate different oxidation products under scwo condition however they are all expected to be oxidized into n2 finally ammonia is one kind of stable intermediate product which is difficult to degrade in almost all nitrogen compounds scwo benjamin and savage 2005 temperature plays a decisive role in nh3 n degradation nh3 n can be oxidized into n2 at a high temperature over 500 c qian et al 2015 and its conversion rate increases rapidly above 550 c du et al 2013 therefore the further oxidation of ammonia becomes the rate limiting step for the complete oxidation of n containing compounds to form n2 adding auxiliary fuel may be an effective way when the methanol concentration is more than twice the initial nh3 concentration the nh3 conversion to n2o can be increased by 50 60 wt and the presence of methanol can also increase the yields of no3 and no2 cabeza et al 2014 various n containing functional groups or existing forms make reaction pathways different scwo products of n containing substances are mainly nitrogen nitrate ammonia almost without nitrite and nitrogen oxide yang et al 2017 and they can be shown by the following eqs 46 50 46 n h 2 n h 4 47 n o 2 n o 3 48 n o 2 n h 2 n 2 others 49 n n oh no others 50 n heterocyclic compounds n h 4 others the c n bond energy is smaller than that of c c bond so the c n bond in nitrobenzene or aniline first breaks and forms benzene ring yang et al 2018 oh free radical is considered to be main oxidant in scwo its diffusion coefficient is far greater than that of nitrobenzene in scw huang et al 2015 the effective collision frequency of free radicals such as oh and ho2 in scw increases which makes free radical reaction easier to occur and is conducive to the oxidation and degradation of nitrobenzene tan et al tan et al 2020 reported that n containing organic compounds had better denitrification effects than inorganic compounds because they could produce more active radicals this means that nitro and amino groups are easily attacked by oh to produce more amino radicals nh2 and nitro radicals no2 yang et al yang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 proposed that amino functional group was easier to be attacked than nitro functional group when nitro and amino groups are present at the same time thus according to their conclusions the potential degradation pathway of 2 nitroaniline scwo can be shown in fig 13 nh2 in 2 nitroaniline first reacts with oh to form nh2 and then no2 is removed in the form of no2 and the two active radicals continue to react to generate n2 this is consistent with the yang et al s finding that organic n makes a predominant contribution to the formation of n2 at the early stage of scwo while inorganic n nh4 and no3 makes a minor contribution to the conversion of n2 at the late stage yang et al 2020 pyridine quinoline quinazoline and pyrimidine are important n containing heterocyclic compounds and they are usually first oxidized into corresponding derivatives in scwo and then polycyclic compounds are decomposed into monocyclic compounds and further split to open rings as a result liquid phase composition is very complex and few polycyclic intermediates may also be formed by some free radicals coupling dong et al 2015 for example naphthalene biphenyl and phenanthrene are formed by polymerization of phenyl and benzyl etc gong et al 2016 the oxidative degradation of these heterocyclic compounds can be summarized into four steps including hydroxylation to generate derivative alcohols oxidative reforming to form carbonyl and cyclolysis oh reattacks to take place deamination decarboxylation and rearrangement reaction and finally mineralization to form co2 h2o and nh3 gong et al 2016 till now the f 0 value the magnitude of the attack power of oh free radical of c and n atoms in pyridine has been calculated the f 0 value of the n atom is much higher than that of the c atom so the n atom is much easier to be attacked by oh to take place fracture yang and shen 2019 the bond energy of c n is 305 kj mol l lower than 332 kj mol l of c c hence it can be believed that c n bond fracture plays a dominating role in the ring opening process of n heterocyclic compounds meanwhile n atom has strong electron attraction ability and thus the electron cloud density of pyridine ring is relatively low gong et al 2016 this makes nucleophilic substitution reaction take place at α or γ position of the n atom pyrimidine with one more n atom than pyridine is easier to be oxidized and degraded due to its lower electron cloud density similarly the benzene ring in quinazoline and quinoline can be easily oxidized because of the low electron cloud density of the pyridine pyrimidine ring in them quinazoline has more n atoms than quinoline so its benzene ring is more easily oxidized and opened fig 14 displays potential reaction pathways of quinazoline and pyrimidine in scwo based on identification of intermediate products apparently there are two ring open pathways of quinazoline in scwo the first one is that more n atoms in the pyrimidine ring of quinazoline lead to a lower an electron cloud density so that the benzene ring in quinazoline is first attacked by oh and o2 to open the ring and form pyrimidine then the pyrimidine ring begins to cleave to form n containing chain products such as carbamate and oxalic acid and finally to form gases the other ring open pathway is that the pyrimidine ring is opened earlier than the benzene ring according to the appearance of benzene naphthalene methylbenzene etc in intermediate products gong et al gong et al 2016 inferred two types of possibilities for ring opening however in the study of scwo quinoline by ren et al ren et al 2019 there is just one possibility that benzene ring is opened first and the opening of the pyridine ring is a little slower therefore this inconsistence of different ring open orders requires to deep research in subsequent work to date the decomposition of diazonium group compounds in scwo has hardly been reported compared with the aromatic group the azo bond n n is easier to be broken so the oh radical is more likely to attack n n first in reactions which makes macromolecular compounds split into relatively small compounds yang et al 2017 meanwhile the presence of cl in compounds can promote the degradation of n containing compounds and the higher cl content in amino n compounds leads to more nh4 formation yang et al 2017 one possible explanation is that cl can react with some metals and thus released transition metal ions e g fe3 mn2 and cu2 play a catalytic role in reactions n containing substances derived from industrial living such as sludge and wastewater have more complex scwo processes compared with model compounds cabeza et al 2013 du et al 2013 li et al 2019 lin et al 2017 liquid phase intermediates after scwo can be classified into five types including non nitrogen open chain compounds nitrogen open chain compounds non nitrogen aromatic compounds nitrogen aromatic compounds and non aromatic ring compounds among them the non nitrogen open chain compounds are composed of aliphatic acids and small amounts of aliphatic hydrocarbons and esters qian et al 2015 the proportion of nitrogen open chain compounds is relatively low and almost all of them are amide compounds non nitrogen aromatic compounds are mainly oxygen containing aromatic derivatives which are mainly composed of phenols phenol and its methyl substituents acids phenylacetic acid alcohols phenylethanol and ketones acetophenone ma et al 2017 n containing aromatic compounds can be decomposed from macromolecules to pyridine indole pyrazine and derivatives substituted by methyl and amino groups changi et al 2012a qian et al 2016 however pyridine is difficult to be oxidized so the content of pyridine and its derivatives in the n aromatic compounds in liquid phase are relatively high n heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine can be formed by maillard reaction between protein degradation products and cellulose decomposition products and they can steadily reduce the number of free radicals as free radical scavengers with the increase of temperature and oxidant part of pyridine decomposes to form ammonia du et al 2013 and other pyridine can combine with the benzene ring to form fused ring compounds such as quinoline the other liquid phase products of wastewater scwo are non aromatic ring compounds but the content is much low most of non aromatic ring compounds are cyclic ketonic compounds including cyclopentanone cyclohexanone pyrrolidone and piperidone and they are intermediates of maillard reaction or sugar hydrolysis reaction and their further dehydrogenation can form phenols qian et al 2015 6 halogen atom s and p containing organic compounds conversions 6 1 cl br and f containing compounds cl containing organic compounds such as chloroalkyls chloroaromatic hydrocarbons and macromolecule polymers are important chemicals or intermediates in industry high toxicity and low biodegradability of these compounds can result in great environmental harm subcritical or supercritical fluid is an effective medium to remove chlorine from organic matters catalytic dechlorination can selectively break one or more c cl bond and thus reduces their toxicity soler et al 2018 many researchers have studied the dechlorination effect of chlorinated compounds in subcritical or supercritical water akimoto et al 2002 kubatova et al 2003 kubatova et al 2002 scw is an effective environment for the dechlorination of cl containing organic compounds scwo can convert organic chlorine into hcl and dissolve it in water meanwhile transforms organic carbon into gaseous product co2 some researchers adopt h2o2 as oxidant to explore the degradation kinetics of o dichlorobenzene o dcb in scw lin et al 2019 wang et al 2018a during o dcb scwo 5 chloro 2 pentanone 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 pentanone 2 hexanone 2 pentanone and 3 4 dichlorophenol and other intermediates are produced in scwo experiments of chlorobenzene liu liu and pan 2012 detected some intermediate by products that were not completely oxidized such as benzene 4 methyl 3 penten 2 one and 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 pentanone while shimokawa shimokawa et al 2010 used tio2 nanoparticles photocatalysis to obtain intermediate products with smaller molecular weight such as aliphatic c2 c4 ketone aldehyde alcohol and carboxylic acid without aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives fe zro2 can catalyze the reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzene in scw at 410 500 without adding any oxidant and cause h2o to crack more h in the presence of fe wei et al 2009 as shown in eq 51 moreover zr4 o2 lewis acid base pairs significantly promote the fracture of c cl bond on the chlorobenzene aromatic ring and accelerate the formation of hcl eq 52 wei et al 2009 this shows that catalyst can greatly improve the degradation efficiency of cl containing compounds in scw 51 2 h 2 o fe zr o 2 2 h 2 oh 52 2 h c 6 h 5 cl c 6 h 6 hcl as for cl and o containing organic compounds hashimoto hashimoto et al 2010 studied the oxidative degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in sub and supercritical water and found that the dechlorination effect increased with reaction time and temperature and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and acetic acid were main degradation intermediates however 2 4 dcp can almost completely disappear and transform into inorganic chlorine in scw at 400 c the first reaction pathway of 2 4 dcp decomposition leads to the formation of dimers and some macromolecular compounds such as dichlorophenoxyphenols and 5 dichloro 2 hydroxyacetophene then in scwo these compounds take place secondary oxidation to form ring opening products and monocyclic compounds such as phenol 2 methylphenol 2 4 dichloro 6 methylphenol which can eventually be oxidized into co2 lee et al 2005 moreover naoh is proved to be an effective catalyst for the dechlorination of 2 chlorophenol and can significantly reduce the formation of dimers in scwo lee et al 2002 the dechlorination of complex compounds commonly occurs in subcritical water because it is easier to achieve dechlorination than supercritical water kubatova et al 2002 takeshita et al takeshita et al 2004 treated polyvinyl chloride with subcritical water 200 350 c and obtained good dechlorination effect and no harmful chlorinated organic compounds were produced in liquid and gas components the corresponding reaction principle is regarded to release hcl in polyvinyl chloride and form a polyene structure of ch ch n then the formed hcl immediately dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid and the polyene structure further generates low molecular weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds through cyclization hydrolysis and other reactions soler et al soler et al 2018 conducted dechlorination experiments of polyvinyl chloride electric wires at 200 300 c and confirmed that when the residues after dechlorination was subjected to high temperature pyrolysis the emission of hcl and the formation of chlorobenzene and chlorophenol decreased while the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased with the dechlorination temperature increasing this shows that subcritical water treatment is an effective dechlorination method which can reduce the formation of chlorinated compounds in the subsequent heat treatment process this finding is also consistent with their experiments on debromination of printed circuit boards at 225 275 c soler et al 2017 both the efficiencies of debromination and dichlorination increase with an increase in process temperature the maximum debromination efficiency of 63 6 and the maximum dechlorination efficiency of 95 96 are obtained at 275 c and 300 c respectively soler et al 2018 soler et al 2017 obviously final conversion products of halogen elements during the degradation of compounds in scw are commonly hcl and hbr etc due to steric hindrance compared with high valent atoms monovalent atoms are easier to be exposed and attacked by free radicals in most seizure reactions therefore h can combine with cl and br to form hcl and hbr f is also a halogen element which is the most electronegative element making fluorochemicals have unique physiochemical properties perfluorochemicals pfcs such as perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos perfluorohexanesulfonate pfhs and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa have been widely used in many industrial processes and commercial products including polymer additives surfactants fire fighting foams and pesticides etc pfcs have recently received much attention because they are recognized as refractory environmental contaminants and commonly dominant in wastewater sludge schultz et al 2003 zhu et al 2012 using scw can effectively degrade pfcs and realize defluorination hori et al hori et al 2008 conducted the decomposition of pfhs in sub supercritical water with fe catalyst at 150 380 c 21 2 26 4 mpa for 6h and found that pfhs could be decomposed to f and so4 2 ions in the aqueous phase and small amounts of h2 co2 and cf3h were detected in the gas phase in addition to catalyst adding o2 can also enhance the decomposition of pfcs with the addition of o2 in the decomposition of c6h5 3s cf3so3 a substitute for pfos in subcritical water at 372 c for 6 h the f yield can reach up to 93 6 indicating that nearly all f atoms in cf3so3 are transformed into f ions hori and yokota 2015 o2 can also suppress the formation of cf3h and benzene in addition ca oh 2 can effectively defluorinate pfcs under thermal conditions by forming caf2 wang et al 2011 in general using scw to defluorinate aims to release fluorine from complex fluoroorganic compounds and convert it into f ion which can be recycled 6 2 s containing compounds in recent years the research on coal scwg of for hydrogen production has drawn much attention however s containing compounds in coal utilization processes can cause air pollution and reactor corrosion li et al 2015 yang et al 2020a besides some residual oil also contains many varieties of s containing compounds such as homologues of thiophene yuan et al 2005 using scw to remove sulfur from heavy oil asphalt and other raw materials has great development potential presently demirbas demirbas 2016 used a partial oxidation method to desulfurize residual oil with catalyst in scw and the desulfurization efficiency could reach up to 60 scw can effectively transform original sulfide into smaller sulfide so the studies on transformation pathways of the s element in scw can provide an important theoretical basis for the control of s containing pollutants in following utilization fig 15 illustrates sulfur distribution differences in gas liquid and solid phases after coal scwg and pyrolysis thus s containing gases after coal pyrolysis include h2s and so2 however scw can provide abundant h free radicals to generate more h2s and inhibit the formation of so2 and organic sulfur meanwhile scw also promotes the decomposition of sulfate and pyrite and oh free radical improves the oxidation of s 2 and coke in supercritical fluid meng et al 2016 these finding is consistent with of the conclusion of chen et al chen et al 2015 they studied the influence of pressure temperature and oxidation coefficient on the distribution of s in solid liquid and gas products after lignite scwg and found that so4 2 and s2o3 2 were main sulfur components in liquid fraction while the contents of s2 hs so3 2 and hso3 were very low and h2s was the only sulfur compound detected in gaseous products pathardhan et al patwardhan et al 2013 also pointed out that scw could effectively convert sulfur in the form of sulfides e g aliphatic aromatic and cyclic into h2s in the presence of α hydrogen and weak the s r bond as listed by eqs 53 57 at the initiation stage c s bonds are usually the weakest bonds in the system 53 r 1 c h 2 s r 2 r 1 c h 2 s r 2 54 r 1 c h 2 s r 2 r 1 c h 2 r 2 s at the propagation stage α c h is the easiest to abstract 55 r 2 rh r 2 h r 56 r r 1 c h 2 s r 2 rh r 1 c hs r 2 57 r 1 c hs r 2 r 1 ch s r 2 at present it is also a hot spot to explore desulfurization mechanism of alkyl sulfur compounds in scw such as hexyl sulfide class et al 2019 kida et al 2014 hexanethiol kang et al 2020 and isopropylthiobenzene wang et al 2016a water plays important roles in the scw decomposition of alkyl sulfide it is not only the reactant for the hydrolysis of important intermediates e g thioaldehyde and thioaectone but also the source of many h atoms needed for desulfurization to form h2s and the h transfer catalyst of desulfurization and decomposition of some intermediates thiols it is proposed that alkanes can lead to the selective cleavage of the c s bond and thus promote the decomposition and desulfurization process by forming aliphatic radicals attacking α h on isopropylthiobenzene wang et al 2016a similarly the isopropyl group in isopropylthiobenzene can act in the same way as alkane so improving the desulfurization of isopropylthiobenzene in scw till now there are few scw desulfurization catalysts ates et al ates et al 2014 studied the effects of zno moo3 and mos2 on the desulfurization of heavy oil in scw and found that zno had the best removal effect on dibenzothiophene but its main structure and composition changed and thus resulted in activity decrease due to sulfurization reaction therefore researchers can focus on the research regarding catalytic desulfurization effect and catalyst activity and stability in the future after s containing substances scwo sulfur is only released into liquid products and there is hardly s containing substance in gas products sulfide thiosulfate sulfite and sulfate are main sulfur components in liquid products among which sulfate is dominant due to different reactants sometimes the content of sulfide or thiosulfate is rich when reactants are methylmercaptan ma et al 2013 iron sulfide ma et al 2012 sulfur coal wang and zhu 2003 and thiirane ma et al 2013 if scwo is carried out at a high temperature with a long reaction time it is likely that sulfur can be completely converted into sulfate 6 3 p containing compounds representative p containing organic compounds such as tributhyl phosphate tbp and other organophosphate flame retardants opfrs are widely used in various fields for example tbp is usually used as a raw material for herbicides fungicides plasticizers and other products while most opfrs can be found in furnitures textiles electronics and other processing chemicals however with the development of phosphorus chemical industry environmental pollution is becoming more and more severe therefore several treatment methods of p containing organic compounds such as ultraviolet persulfate advanced oxidation processes aops photocatalytic oxidation and scwo have been reported in recent years antonopoulou et al 2017 kosari et al 2018 ou et al 2017 this section mainly summarizes some studies on scwo of tbp and other opfrs tbp can be successfully decomposed and achieve toc removal rate of 99 in scwo at 480 c 50 mpa for 100 min without any catalyst kosari et al 2018 the decomposition efficiency of tbp in scwo can reach the maximum value of 79 4 with fe2o3 at 405 c for 70 min and the order of catalytic performance is fe2o3 cuo mgo ag2o zno kosari et al 2018 the most abundant byproduct of tbp scwo is h3po4 followed by other compounds such as butanol monobutylphosphate mbp and dibutylphosphate dbp besides golmohammadi et al golmohammadi et al 2018 reported that the order of catalytic performance was ceo2 co3o4 cr2o3 mno2 now there is very little research on scwo of other opfrs yang et al yang et al 2019b investigated the decomposition of 14 opfrs in scwo with temperature varying from 350 to 550 c at 24 mpa for 1 6 min with 300 of excess oxygen they found that aryl and chloro opfrs like 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate and tris 1 3 dichloro phosphate achieved higher toc degradation rates than the alkyl ones e g tripropyl phosphate in summary conceivable degradation pathways of opfrs can generally contain hydroxylation ring cleavage and mineralization for aryl ones compared with hydroxylation carbonylation and mineralization for alkyl and chloro ones yang et al 2019b to the best of our knowledge the research on scwo of tbp and opfrs with or without catalyst is quite scarce and thus require further exploration 7 conclusions heavy hydrocarbons o and n containing organic compounds have good prospects for hydrogen production by scwg for some compounds containing heteroatoms e g cl br f s and p the research hotspot is to use excellent properties of scw to realize the removal of heteroatoms and the goal of environmental friendliness scwo is a very effective method to degrade most organic compounds under proper conditions free radicals play an important role in scwg and scwo and are related to complex chemical reactions intermediate products reaction pathways and reaction mechanisms it is of great significance to develop effective catalysts

17234,supercritical water is a benign reaction medium to convert organic matters through supercritical water gasification and supercritical water oxidation into flammable gaseous and harmless substances respectively this work systematically summarizes main chemical reactions of some typical organic compounds in supercritical water with or without oxidant for the first time these compounds include hydrocarbons proteins cellulose lignins phenols alcohols aldehydes ketones organic acids and some n cl br f s and p containing organic matters their main conversion pathways reaction processes intermediate products final products and influence factors are analyzed deeply this information helps to understand and predict corresponding reaction mechanisms and to better achieve objective products in supercritical water gasification and supercritical water oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords supercritical water gasification oxidation free radical chemical reaction 1 introduction under normal conditions water is a polar solvent that can dissolve most inorganic salts while it is slightly soluble or insoluble for gases and most organic matters its density dielectric constant ion product viscosity thermal conductivity diffusion coefficient and dissolution performance change significantly at supercritical state t 374 c p 22 1 mpa ding et al 2014b huelsman and savage 2012 karakuş et al 2013 savage 1999 selvi gökkaya et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 supercritical water scw has small amounts of hydrogen bonds a low dielectric constant similar to that of polar organic solvent a high diffusion coefficient and a low viscosity akizuki et al 2011 savage 1999 wang et al 2017 thus scw has good dissolving ability which makes organic matter oxygen and scw mutually soluble so greatly reducing mass transfer resistance and becoming an ideal reaction medium on the contrary inorganic substances especially salts have very low solubility in scw and so can be easily separated moreover the temperature and pressure of scw can be changed to control reaction environment coordinate reaction rate and chemical balance and adjust the selective activity of catalyst chakinala et al 2013 to date the two most typical applications of scw are supercritical water gasification scwg and supercritical water oxidation scwo modell started to study hydrogen production by scwg of glucose and wood in the 1970s modell 1977 1980 scwg usually refers to a biomass conversion process into a hydrogen rich gas including h2 co2 ch4 and co etc in scw 400 700 c peterson et al 2008 the degradation of organic matters in scwg can be summarized by eq 1 but intermediate reaction processes may involve various complex reactions such as hydrolysis cracking and polymerization notably the reactions that significantly affect gaseous products distribution mainly include steam reforming water gas shift and methanation reactions see eqs 2 6 and minor hydrogenation reaction see eq 7 can also occur in scwg bogdan et al 2018 ding et al 2014a nanda et al 2019 weiss hortala et al 2010 1 organic compounds h 2 o h 2 c o 2 co c h 4 other small molecules 2 c h x o y 2 y h 2 o 2 y x 2 h 2 c o

reaction processes but also participates in the water gas shift reaction at the same time so providing a large amount of h free radical and increasing hydrogen yield and reducing coking production jin et al 2016 scwg can overcome the shortcomings of traditional air based gasification such as high energy consumption drying procedures castello and fiori 2012 till now scwg has developed into an effective method to convert wet biomass e g organic wastewater into a hydrogen rich mixture gas in the hydrogen production field scwo is a heat based organic waste treatment process in which oxidants commonly are h2o2 o2 and air in scwo most hydrocarbons are oxidized into co2 and h2o and their conversion rates can exceed 99 999 within 1 min schanzenbächer et al 2002 nitrogen atoms in n containing compounds are commonly converted into no3 nh4 and other organic n in liquid products and nh3 n2 and n2o in gaseous products in scwo al duri et al 2016 yang et al 2017 other heteroatoms e g cl s and p are converted into corresponding inorganic acids i e hcl h2so4 and h3po4 which can be further neutralized into organic salts lin et al 2019 veriansyah et al 2005 wang et al 2011 at present considerable amounts of articles have reported the effects of some operating parameters e g oxidation coefficient catalyst reaction temperature residence time and reactant concentration on the degradation rate of organic matter in scwo and hydrogen production capacity in scwg they have made important contributions to understanding conversion mechanisms of organic matters in scw moreover according to many articles the reactions of organic compound conversion in scw includes hydrolysis pyrolysis dehydration hydrogenation polymerization isomerization and other types of reactions resulting in the formation of a large number of various intermediate products in the oxidation gasification process therefore in order to better understand the mechanism of organic matter conversion in scw we search for relevant papers published mainly in the past decade and summarize chemical reactions of different types of organic compounds e g hydrocarbons and heteroatom containing compounds and their intermediate products mainly in scwg and scwo in detail compare the reaction processes of organic compounds with the same functional group analyze bond fracture characteristics of reactants with different functional groups and review distribution characteristics of intermediate products and final products to the best of our knowledge this is documented for the first time this information helps to clarify reaction mechanism establish reaction kinetics and predict reaction processes of organic compounds in scw 2 free radical reactions free radicals refer to atoms or groups with unpaired electrons formed by the cleavage of covalent bonds under certain conditions they are key species of triggering free radical reactions of which the elementary steps mainly involve initiation propagation and termination processes boock and klein 1993 vogel et al 2005 scw exhibits weak electrolyte characteristics so it prefers to free radical reactions but inhibits ionic reactions kruse and dinjus 2007 also free radical reactions easily occur under high temperature conditions bühler et al 2002 thereby scw is very suitable for these reactions in fact main reaction mechanisms of organic matters in scwg and scwo can be attributed to free radical reactions al duri and alsoqyani 2017 patwardhan et al 2013 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 although the concentration of initial free radicals is always low the rate constants of free radical reactions are generally high which causes the concentration of the reactants to decay faster zhang et al 2013a when large amounts of initial reactants exist in the reaction system the production rate of free radicals is far higher than their consumption rate so the whole reaction process is like a chain continuous circulation until the reactants are almost oxidized and or decomposed into final products vogel et al 2005 eventually the free radical termination reactions dominate to produce stable products table 1 shows some specific free radical reactions that occur in scw including various reaction types such as decomposition addition isomerization substitution β scission coupling and disproportionation boock and klein 1993 bühler et al 2002 fujii et al 2011 gong et al 2014 obviously h ho2 and oh are the most important free radicals in free radical reactions they are the most significant products in initial reactions and the promoters of the propagation process water is a good source of hydrogen atom which provides large amounts of h and oh eq 9 also the very low hydrogen bond content in scw makes free radicals take hydrogen from h2o more conveniently h can generate h2 through h abstraction reaction eq 20 and coupling reaction eq 29 so playing an important role in scwg in scwo the initial reaction of free radicals produced by reactants is closely related to o2 if it is used as the oxidant see eqs 10 11 gong et al 2014 o2 and h2o can react at the preheating stage and produces active free radicals such as oh oh free radicals have strong oxidation ability which can react with almost all kinds of organic compounds however the reaction rate of o2 and h2o is slow making o2 less active than hydrogen peroxide ren et al 2019 also the activation energy of o2 oxidation is high which means that o2 is more suitable at a higher temperature thus more researchers use h2o2 as an oxidant in their scwo experiments h2o2 and ho2 are main unstable substances in free radical reactions although the activity of ho2 is lower than that of oh due to its relative low abundance ho2 has become an important chain carrier in propagation reactions the decomposition of h2o2 contributes to the majority of oh sources and h2o2 can be regenerated by the h abstraction of ho2 at the same time which makes oh continuously renew from the reservoir compound h2o2 vogel et al 2005 moreover the reaction rate of h2o2 decompose eq 13 in scw is fast and thus a large number of oh can be accumulated weiss hortala et al 2010 hence h2o2 can greatly accelerate the oxidation rate of organic compounds improve the reaction rate constant and become an effective oxidant though it faces the high cost problem notably too high h2o2 concentration may not effectively improve the degradation efficiency of reactants this is can be explained by the fact that high concentration of h2o2 causes quenching reaction between oh and h2o2 so affecting the chain transfer reaction of oh lin et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to determine the optimal oxidant amount in experiments and the mixing time of oxidant and reactant needs to be controlled carefully as well as listed in table 1 the propagation process in scw is the most complicated and rich in free radical types so resulting in amounts of different liquid phase intermediates which are commonly generated by superposition of multi step free radical reactions thus the formation mechanism of intermediates in scw can be explained in addition isomerization and substitution of free radicals are more popular during propagation bühler et al 2002 and almost all free radicals produced by the initial reactions can attack the weak chemical bond of c h and takes place h abstraction reactions eqs 16 20 based on the free radical reaction principle h2 is formed by the combination of h and h eq 29 while co is formed by the decomposition of cho free radicals and then most of co is further oxidized by oh to produce co2 the peroxide rooh eq 28 produced in the termination process is relatively active and is easy to decompose into small organic compounds e g formic acid and acetic acid and then they are oxidized into co2 and h2o finally gong et al 2014 obviously free radical chain reactions have a significant impact on the formation of intermediate products and thus seriously affect the degradation pathways of reactants therefore in order to deeply understand the reaction pathways of different compounds in scw gasification and oxidation decomposition mechanisms of some typical organic compounds and their intermediates are summarized and analyzed below 3 hydrocarbons conversions hydrocarbons can be simply divided into alkanes alkenes and aromatics among these three types of hydrocarbons there are few studies on the reactions of alkenes in scw typically alkenes can undergo isomerization hydration and hydrogenation reactions in scw akizuki et al akizuki et al 2011 studied the conversion of 1 octene in sub and supercritical water 250 450 11 33 mpa catalyzed by tio2 and main products were 2 octene produced by the double bond isomerization reaction of 1 octene and dehydration reaction of 2 octanol and 2 octanol formed by the hydration reaction of 1 octene alshammari s work demonstrates that with the addition of oxidants and the increase of reaction time alkenes can be converted into alkanes by hydrogenation via partial oxidation in scw alshammari and hellgardt 2015 as for alkanes the research mainly focus on long chain alkanes e g dodecane zaker et al 2018 and hexadecane alshammari and hellgardt 2016 and long chain alkanes degrade much faster than do aromatics in scw since aromatic compounds tend to accumulate for a longer time guan et al 2012 recently some studies show the potential for hydrogen production through scwg of heavy hydrocarbons and report different key kinetic data for instance in the n hexadecane scwg at 525 605 c and 22 mpa the pre exponential frequency factor and the reaction activation energy are 7 36 1014 s 1 and 263 68 kj mol 1 respectively alshammari and hellgardt 2016 picou et al picou et al 2011 carried out the non catalytic scwg of 1 dodecane at 530 699 c and 24 mpa and found that reformation reaction had the largest pre exponential frequency factor and activation energy i e 1 75 108 s 1 and 197 3 kj mol 1 compared with water gas shift reaction 4 16 103 s 1 and 107 4 kj mol 1 and pyrolysis 10 03 s 1 and 60 6 kj mol 1 moreover the pre exponential frequency factors and activation energies of reformation reaction 2 20 109 s 1 and 226 30 kj mol 1 and pyrolysis 1 12 103 s 1 and 96 04 kj mol 1 are reported for the n dodecane scwg at 626 705 c and 24 mpa lee et al 2009 hexadecane can crack into smaller n alkanes and 1 alkenes hydrocarbons ranging from c15 to c1 under sub and supercritical conditions highly reactive long chain free radicals e g primary and secondary hexadecyl radicals generated in this process possibly undergo a series of reactions mainly including β scission hydrogen abstraction isomerization and addition and increasing reaction temperature can enhance the formation of 1 alkenes via β scission while increasing pressure can improve the formation n alkanes via h abstraction alshammari and hellgardt 2016 finally the reaction process is terminated by the combination of smaller free radicals to form stable products and thus the whole process is far less complicated than that of aromatic hydrocarbons therefore some aromatic hydrocarbons especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs with chemical stability such as naphthalene phenanthrene anthracene and pyrene are focused on below they are typical refractory intermediate products of biomass coal oil and other substances during supercritical water gasification decomposition arcelus arrillaga et al 2017 bai et al 2020 jin et al 2016 if they are not treated well char and tar can be formed which seriously reduce gasification efficiency in the scwg process of pahs the method of ring cracking is a key in current and future research because it is a decisive step affecting complete gasification of reactants yu et al 2016a at present scw is an effective reaction environment to promote the cleavage of aromatic rings into small molecules because it can effectively weaken c c bond energy in the aromatic rings for example the energy barrier of ring opening reaction of anthracene can be reduced from 776 7 to 218 5 kj mol jin et al 2016 in the past decade many scholars have used pahs as model compounds to explore the cracking of rings and their reaction mechanisms in scwg han et al 2019 jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2013c in pahs scwg polycyclic structures are first transformed into low ring and small ring structures e g three rings and five rings through deformation and fracture and then break to form linear chains and finally produce small molecules via bond fracture more specifically there are two different explanations in detail the first one is shown in fig 2 a hydrogen atom in scw is added to the c atom on a ring which causes the c ring c ring bond to break and oh in scw connect with another c atom at the same time jin et al 2016 then the c ring c ring bond on the middle ring of pahs can also crack and bond and the lower structure can be twisted until the middle benzene ring is completely destroyed another explanation is that the breakage of pahs is due to that h on the outer ring is easily attacked by highly reactive oh radicals or h2o molecule and thus h abstraction occurs han et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 as indicated in fig 2b when aromatic ring loses hydrogen it becomes distorted and unstable and is prone to crack then it can be transformed into a macro ring or multi ring structure composed of three rings and five rings these rings are further opened by the breaking of the c c bond due to the continued attack of oh radicals it is also believed that after these rings are broken some linear chains are formed and then the c c bonds are broken to form some small molecules in addition oh and h radicals in scw play an important role in promoting and breaking the bonds in the whole process some scholars have studied the scwo of pahs in early years onwudili and williams 2007 xu et al 2011 xu et al 2003 yang and hildebrand 2006 and the first reaction on rings is oxygen invasion taking naphthalene as an example the five main intermediate products for oxygen to invade naphthalene rings are 1 4 naphthoquinone 1 naphthol phthalic anhydride coumarin and chromone xu et al 2011 they then mainly convert into salicylaldehyde dibenzofuran fluorenone and xanthone after one ring cracking and further break into chains and are oxidized into acids h2o and co2 finally in addition isomerization and hydrogen addition also take place during the cracking process of pahs in scw wang et al wang et al 2012 obtained hydrogenation products i e tetralin and decalin by the ring opening reaction of naphthalene and found that rh and mo ni were active for hydrogenation reaction and hy zeolite and mo ni promoted isomerization and ring opening reaction cheng et al cheng et al 2009 used fe2 moo4 3 to catalyze naphthalene hydrogenation in subcritical water for tetralin production and found that h d exchange reaction also occurred during the reaction process both phenanthrene and anthracene belong to pahs containing three rings the three rings center of anthracene is in a straight line and anthracene is an isomer of phenanthrene in anthracene scwg jin et al jin et al 2015 confirmed that major liquid products at 700 c and 25 mpa were benzene and naphthalene followed by fluorene 9 10 dihydro anthracene 2 methyl naphthalene and 3 phenyltoluene k2co3 could effectively reduce the amount of benzene and naphthalene and appropriate temperatures for benzene and naphthalene scwgs were thought to be 700 c and 650 c respectively yeletsky et al yeletsky et al 2019 adopted nimo sio2 to catalyze the cracking of phenanthrene in scw at 425 c and 23 mpa and found that reactions took place preferentially in the central ring of phenanthrene and the catalyst could promote the hydrogenation of polycyclic hydrocarbons in scw there are three main liquid products including dihydrophenanthrene produced by hydrogenation and benzophenone and xanthine formed via oxidation based on intermediate products and reactions mentioned in several literatures jin et al 2015 wang et al 2012 yeletsky et al 2019 potential degradation pathways of phenanthrene anthracene and naphthalene in scw are deduced as displayed in fig 3 some connections among the three typical pahs degradation in scw are speculated obviously the degradation processes of pahs in scw mainly involve hydrogenation contraction ring opening and dealkylation changing from polycyclic to monocyclic to carbon chain first of all for aromatic hydrocarbons with three rings one way is the middle ring hydrogenation which forms dihydrophenanthrene etc then the unstable middle ring is contracted to produce compounds such as fluorine so resulting in ring opening eventually another way is the outer ring c c bond breaking of pahs which produces double aromatic ring products and then follow naphthalene degradation network till now adding k2co3 jin et al 2015 nimo wang et al 2012 yeletsky et al 2019 iron oxide han et al 2019 or oxidant arcelus arrillaga et al 2017 has been proved to be effective in reducing the content of intermediate products and in greatly improving gasification effect of aromatic hydrocarbons the addition of a small amount of oxidant oxidation coefficient 0 2 can promote the production of ring opening products and inhibit the formation of polymers thereby increasing h2 yield wang et al 2016b according to scwg experiments of the mixture of naphthalene phenol and acetic acid the content of phenolic compounds should be reduced sufficiently in biomass coal scwg because phenolic compounds can cause the cross linking reaction of pahs wang et al 2018b 4 conversions of o containing organic matters in scw 4 1 cellulose proteins and lignins biomass has played an important role in global renewable energy utilization and is considered as the fourth largest energy resource after coal oil and natural gas kerolli mustafa et al 2015 biomass scwg for hydrogen production is technically and economically feasible and has a promising future caputo et al 2016 kang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 scwg can directly convert high moisture of biomass without high energy consumption drying processes so has received widespread attention in recent years zhu et al 2016 biomass contains large amounts of complex macromolecular substances such as proteins celluloses hemicelluloses and lignins the interior of these macromolecules is a complicated network formed by covalent bonds intermolecular bridges and van der waals forces thus studying degradation pathways of these complex molecules in scwg is of great significance for optimizing reaction system and future market application celluloses are the most abundant parts of biomass they can be considered as glucose polymer by d glucose subunits linked together by β 1 4 glycosidic bonds and contains hydrogen bonds and van der waals force sandeep et al kumar and gupta 2008 reported that celluloses could partially dissolve in subcritical water at 302 c and completely dissolve at 330 c the addition of acids e g mineral acids or solid acids enzymes e g cellobiohydrolase and supported metal catalysts e g

degradation pathways of celluloses scwg cellulose initially hydrolyzes into oligomers and monomers in scwg and further hydrolyzes to form glucose which can isomerize and produce fructose as

dehydration condensation isomerization polymerization and ultimately decompose to produce gases mainly consisting of h2 ch4 co and co2 ding et al 2014a fang et al 2008 yin et al 2017 glucose is the most major hydrolysis product of cellulose under high temperature and high pressure conditions and its subsequent degradation reaction mechanism is crucial to reveal the complete degradation of cellulose which has attracted much attention of many researchers in scwg without catalyst glucose is easily dehydrated to form furfural and 5 hydroxymethyl furfural and then undergoes various reactions e g decomposition isomerization and condensation to form 7 hydroxy 1 indanone 2 vinylfuran 2 methyl 5 hydroxybenzofuran 3 hydroxy benzaldehyde 1 3 hydroxyphenyl ethanone 2 naphthalenol 2 methyl 1 4 benzenediol hydroquinone and resorcinol and other refractory aromatic liquid products which inhibit further gasification susanti et al 2012 in order to reduce tar production and improve gasification efficiency many researchers add koh ding et al 2014a naoh onwudili and williams 2009 ni based catalysts huang et al 2019 yin et al 2017 pt based catalysts fang et al 2008 and a small amount of oxidant jin et al 2010 lu et al 2008 one explanation is that catalyst can lead to the formation of more gasification compounds such as hydroxylated ketones aldehydes and acids while oxidant can accelerate the decomposition of aldehydes so inhibiting the production of tar char and other polymers improved products are mainly composed of unsaturated hydrocarbons with low carbon numbers cyclic and non cyclic ketones aldehydes carboxylic acids and their alkylated and hydroxylated derivatives and there is no furfural formation so greatly improving the degradation rate of glucose in addition kobiro et al kobiro et al 2013 proved that sugars e g glucose and polysaccharides were also effective hydrogen sources and could supply hydrogen free radicals h which promote the dehydroxylation reduction of alcohols in scw and catalyze the hydrogenation reduction of olefins proteins are the main components of sewage sludge microalgae and some other biomass fig 5 illustrates potential degradation pathways in scwg of proteins in the scwg process proteins are commonly hydrolyzed to amino acids and peptides first and then amino acids take place deamination to produce ammonia and organic acids and decarboxylation to generate carbonic acid and amines changi et al 2012a sato et al 2004 sheehan and savage 2020 as a result of maillard reaction amino acids can also react with carbonyl compounds to form n heterocyclic compounds such as indole pyrimidine pyrrole and pyridine so causing the production of free radical scavengers which inhibit the gas production in scwg ma et al 2017 peterson et al 2010 qian et al 2015 xu et al 2019 peptides can be decomposed into aromatic hydrocarbons aldehydes diketopiperazines and aliphatic amines etc ma et al 2017 therefore using amino acids as model compounds to study their gasification in scw is helpful for revealing the degradation pathways of proteins in scwg and the effect of nitrogen on biomass scwg amino acid molecules have various structures so scwg difficulty and their products are quite different according to the research on glycine and alanine scwg dileo et al 2008 samanmulya et al 2014 su et al 2015 the main products of glycine are ammonia methylamine glycolic acid and formic acid while the products of alanine mainly include ammonia ethylamine propanoic acid diacetone alcohol n ethyl propanamide as for amino acids with more complex structures hydrothermal reaction products of phenylalanine are phenylethylamine styrene and phenylethanol changi et al 2012b which are formed by the decarboxylation and deamination of phenylalanine and the hydration of styrene respectively samanmulya s group has carried out many scwg experiments of amino acids in the past decade including glycine alanine histidine aminobutyric acid and serine etc samanmulya et al 2017a b samanmulya et al 2014 among them the gasification efficiencies of aminobutyric acid glycine and alanine in scw are almost the same and that of serine is the highest however the gasification efficiency of histidine is relatively low due to the formation of stable intermediate 4 methylimidazole in the research of caputo et al caputo et al 2016 gasification resistance is in the order of glycine leucine glutamic acid and the easy gasification of glutamic acid is due to the existence of two carboxyl groups moreover ch4 increases in the order of leucine glutamic acid glycine owing to the number of methyl groups in the molecules this is consistent with the explanation of methane source in samanmulya s research samanmulya et al 2014 however h2 concentration follows an opposite order at present there are few studies on degradation behavior of amino acids with much more complex structures under high temperature and high pressure conditions the research on the interaction between amino acids and other organic compounds is also being developed such as amino acids and phenol su et al 2015 amino acids and glucose caputo et al 2016 peterson et al 2010 alkali salts and some metals have become catalyst research focus for amino acid scwg the addition of salts nano3 k2co3 and k2hpo4 may accelerate the decomposition of amino acids chakinala et al 2010 changi et al 2012b 0 1wt na2co3 xu et al 2009 or ni azadi et al 2013 dileo et al 2008 is also effective for increasing hydrogen production in glycine scwg lee lee et al 2015 proposed that ni pt ac and ni pd ac effectively reformed c2 hydrocarbons intermediates produced in valine to h2 and co2 the research on the degradations of different amino acids with various catalysts shows a good development prospect the chemical structure of lignin is mainly composed of repeating units of glyceraldehyde and guaiacol fig 6 indicates potential degradation pathways of lignins scwg lignins contain many oxygen containing functional groups including hydroxyl group carboxyl group carbonyl group ether bond and ester bond etc when lignin decomposes in scw without catalyst ether bond and ester bond are easy to hydrolyze and form phenolic compounds and aldehydes e g formaldehyde yong and matsumura 2012 in more detail the phenolic components that lignins are first degraded in scwg mainly include catechols guaiacols and syringols intermediate products e g alcohols aromatics and aldehydes are derived from the denaturation of these phenols and finally converted into simple gases including h2 co co2 and ch4 etc however in the scwg process phenolic compounds and aldehydes may be condensed or cross linked to form high molecular condensation products for example phenol and formaldehyde take place condensation reaction to form phenolic resin these condensation products together with other refractory phenolic derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons lead to the formation of char and tar jin et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 isomerization is the main reaction of phenol conversion and other reactions are cracking alkylation and condensation the cracking of alkyl groups attached to phenol molecules results in the release of gas hydrocarbons and alkoxyphenol researchers commonly use phenol as a model compound of lignin to analyze its scwg process and detailed mechanism explanation can be seen in the following section in recent years the positive or negative synergistic effect between phenol as a refractory intermediate and other compound has attracted more attention such as glucose and phenol castello et al 2015 phenol and acetic acid wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2013b phenol and naphthalene wang et al 2017 and phenol and cyclohexanol bogdan et al 2018 based on the above analyses fig 7 illustrates the potential reaction processes of polymers in scwg first polymers hydrolyze into oligomers and monomers and the monomers then decompose in scw through isomerization dehydration condensation and hydrolysis etc to produce intermediate products further the intermediate products can polymerize together with some substances that no longer decompose to form char and tar finally the intermediate products can directly undergo gas production reactions such as steam reforming water gas shift and methanation to produce gases e g co co2 h2 and ch4 or be also decomposed pyrolyzed and hydrothermally converted into other intermediate products and then generate gas by steam reforming reaction and so on in addition some metal catalysts e g ru ru γ al2o3 pt pt γ al2o3 raney ni ni α al2o3 ru c ni silica alumina ni mgo ni ceo2 al2o3 ni al2o3 ni ac nila al2o3 and niru al2o3 are commonly used in monomer degradation process azadi et al 2013 ding et al 2014b fang et al 2008 hossain et al 2019 hossain et al 2017 methanation reaction catalysts are mainly ni rh ru pd pt and active carbon etc and the order of catalytic performance for ch4 selectivity is ru rh pt pd ni chakinala et al 2012 azadi et al 2013 furthermore the catalysts for the water gas shift reaction are main alkaline catalysts including ni ru naoh koh k2co3 khco3 nahco3 and natural alkali etc akgül and kruse 2012 guan et al 2016 lee et al 2015 onwudili and williams 2009 xia et al 2014 4 2 phenols as one kind of difficult degradation compounds phenolic compounds are widely used in papermaking textile pharmaceutical petrochemical and other industries martin sanchez et al 2017 they are also regarded as intermediates in scwg of biomass coal and municipal sludge ma et al 2017 wang et al 2018c wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020b phenols can be produced by two main pathways in scw qian et al 2015 one is the cleavage of aryl ether bond in lignin decomposition in scw and another pathway is the condensation or cyclization of sugar produced by cellulose hydrolysis the degradation behavior of phenol in scw has drawn much attention and many researchers focus on phenol scwo with catalysts such as activated carbon matsumura et al 2002 cuo al2o3 yu and savage 2000 2001 mno2 tio2 de silva et al 2017 carulite 150 zhang and savage 1998 and mno2 yu and savage 2001 to improve the degradation efficiency of phenol in scwo phenol is mainly attacked by ho2 ho and o2 to produce c6h5o which is called phenoxy free radical the free radical further stimulates reactions and leads to the ring opening reaction of phenoxy free radical major free radical reactions of phenol in the initiation process can be expressed by following eqs 31 34 31 c 6 h 5 oh c 6 h 5 o h 32 c 6 h 5 oh o 2 c 6 h 5 o h o 2 33 c 6 h 5 oh ho 2 c 6 h 5 o h 2 o 2 34 c 6 h 5 oh oh c 6 h 5 o h 2 o isomerism as one unique characteristic of phenoxy has a great influence on its reaction mechanism phenoxy can exist in three isomeric forms in scw there are three possible reaction pathways of phenoxy free radicals including coupling to form dimer hydroxylation to form phenylglycol and ring opening gopalan and savage 1994 however the main routes of phenol degradation are dimer formation reaction and ring opening reaction dimerization is the result of free radical recombination and free radical chain tautomerization high concentration of phenol enhances dimerization matsumura et al 2000 the ring opening process may be explained by that ho2 is added to phenoxy free radicals to form hydroperoxides then the weak o o bond in the hydroperoxides breaks and finally β scission occurs gopalan and savage 1994 guan et al guan et al 2011 reported that the formation of dimers is due to the action of oxygen and phenol free radicals while the cracking of phenol ring is the result of oxygen attacking the ring the latter leads to the formation of maleic acid which is then further oxidized into unstable oxalic acid in scw and further transformed into gaseous co2 fig 8 indicates the distribution of degradation products of phenol scwo thus aldehydes and acids such as formic acid glyoxal oxalic acid propionic acid succinic acid and maleic acid have been detected as ring opening intermediate products produced monocyclic products mainly include p benzoquinone catechol hydroquinone resorcinol and so on and large amounts of dimer products formed by polymerization are majorly diphenyl ether and dibenzofuran etc ghoreishi et al 2015 in the past decade phenol scwg for hydrogen production has been widely concerned in fact phenol is an intermediate product which is difficult to be gasified completely without catalyst the conversion rate of phenol in scwg at 750 c can reach up to 98 bogdan et al 2018 hence many researchers have conducted catalytic scwg of phenol and table 2 lists some experimental results ni based catalysts can effectively prevent the polymerization of phenol or its intermediates wang et al 2019 phenol can almost be gasified completely even at a low temperature of 450 c with the ni co ni zn graphitized carbon black bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst jia et al 2017 ni20zn15 is beneficial to ch4 production while ni20co15 is more favorable for h2 production showing much high phenol gasification activity however due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles and the decrease of atom concentration on catalyst surface catalyst activity can be greatly reduced after reactions hossain et al 2019 jia et al 2017 in the future the study of phenol degradation catalysts can focus on finding a better carrier support to improve the stability of ni based catalysts as for other catalysts ru graphitized carbon black and ru ceo2 can stably exist in scw and are not easily inactivated in scwg guan et al 2016 yu et al 2016b ru ceo2 can obviously promote hydrogenation reaction and inhibit the formation of dimers e g dibenzofuran and pahs moreover bogdan bogdan et al 2018 proposed a non catalytic method that is the phenol was initially converted into cyclohexanol by catalytic hydrogenation which is more conducive to the formation of gaseous products liquid products of phenol scwg include benzene toluene o cresol 2 ethylphenol naphthalene biphenyl phenylphenols and dibenzofuran etc huelsman and savage 2012 one type of intermediate compounds are decomposition products containing simple structure such as benzene and another one is phenol dimer such as dibenzofuran notably benzene and dibenzofuran have the highest content among them which are formed by dehydrogenation and dimerization respectively more specifically the formation of dibenzofuran can be explained by the combination of phenol and o phenoxy and then intramolecular dehydration benzene is a main product of phenol pyrolysis which is produced by the substitution of hydroxyl with h atom released from the formation of other free radicals e g phenoxy huelsman and savage 2012 fig 9 elucidates potential reaction pathway of phenol scwg thus the whole process of phenol scwg is accompanied by cracking ring opening polymerization and other reactions among them benzene participates in the combination of large amounts of rings and thus forms many dense ring networks with the increase of temperature and reaction time polymerization products difficult to decompose are finally formed so leading to the formation of tar yong and matsumura 2014 furthermore the mixture of n containing substances should be avoided in phenol scwg because ammonia will inhibit the formation of hydrogen and the degradation of phenol this is mainly due to the formation of more stable nitrogen polycyclic compounds wang et al 2018c many endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs belong to phenols with complex structures which can simulate the hormones and disturb endocrine system even under trace concentrations such as bisphenol a bpa bisphenol e bpe nonylphenol np and octylphenol op scw can provide an ideal environment to degrade or transform them into environmentally friendly substances scwo of bpa np and op at 400 c 24 mpa for 0 5 6 min have much higher degradation rates compared with other processes and degradation rate constants of toc follow the order of np 0 331 min 1 op 0 271 min 1 bpa 0 236 min 1 yang et al 2019a among them bpa can generate phenol isopropyl phenol hydroquinone benzoquinone and hydroxybenzoic acid etc after oh attacks the hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring and the c c bond between two aromatic rings yang et al 2019c other researchers also find that the decompositions of bpa and bpe in high temperature water at 250 350 c are effective and environmentally friendly routes to the synthesis of 4 isopropenylphenol and 4 vinylphenol respectively hunter et al 2004 savage et al 2006 4 3 alcohols some studies have reported oxidation mechanisms and kinetics of typical alcohols in scwo such as methanol brock et al 1996 vogel et al 2005 ethanol koido et al 2010 schanzenbächer et al 2002 and isopropanol queiroz et al 2013 table 3 shows main liquid and gas products and kinetic data in scwo of some alcohols thus alcohols are easy to be converted into ketones acids or aldehydes in scwo more specifically formaldehyde is the main intermediate product of methanol scwo while acetic acid acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are major intermediate products in ethanol scwo but acetic acid acetaldehyde formaldehyde acetone and low carbon number alcohols for isopropanol scwo in the vogel et al s study on methanol scwo methanol can also be synthesized into ether through acid catalysis during the preheating process in subcritical water vogel et al 2005 as the number of carbon atom in alcohols increases the composition of intermediate products of alcohols scwo becomes more complex and the carbon chain length of products may reduce or keep constant overall alcohols scwo trends to reduce carbon chain length and finally form co2 and water via a series of intermediate products methanol is the most difficult to oxidize in alcohols boock and klein 1993 and its conversion rate is only about 65 at 538 c and 24 6 mpa brock et al 1996 at the same conditions the conversion rate of methanol is lower than that of ethanol and isopropanol due to the influence of oh hydroxyl α h on the c atom connecting with alcohol is more active and easier to be attacked by o2 to form ho2 free radicals in scwo of the three alcohols large amounts of active free radicals take place interaction which is manifested as dehydrogenation cracking polymerization and other reaction forms fig 10 elucidates the oxidation degradation pathway of typical alcohols in scw methanol reacts mainly with oh but less with ho2 dagaut et al 1996 at a typical scw reaction pressure in scwo with h2o2 oh for degrading alcohol is majorly derived from the decomposition of h2o2 however except from h2o2 fujii et al fujii et al 2011 pointed out that free radical reaction i e ho2 h2o oh h2o2 effectively enhanced oh formation when pressure continues to rise reaction pathway analysis shows that the fastest reaction of alcohol consumption is due to the attack of oh and produced various free radicals generate ketones aldehydes and acids after propagation and termination reactions ketones can be further oxidized into acids by ho2 attack and aldehydes can be converted by oh and ho2 to form acids or hco acids can take place decarboxylation to produce co2 while hco generate co and finally be oxidized into co2 these radicals are unstable intermediates which react much faster with alcohols than does water or oxygen so accelerating the propagation of reaction chains in recent years the research focus of alcohols has transferred to hydrogen production by scwg or as an auxiliary fuel of hydrothermal flame in scwo in scwg major reactions are bond breaking of reactants and chain reactions initiated mainly by h and oh electron donating properties of the oh can improve gasification efficiency by stabilizing intermediate free radicals formed at the same time h can attack the hydroxyl group on moleculars to produce water together with other free radicals formation concomitantly and h can attack the h atom or combine with other h to produce h2 due to harsh gasification conditions carbonyl compounds especially aldehydes which are expected to be the intermediate products of alcohol gasification are unstable under such extreme conditions wang et al 2010 they are easy to decompose into h2 and co at high temperature and high pressure conditions and then undergo water gas shift reaction and methanation reaction taking methanol scwg as an example its reaction pathway is illustrated in fig 11 for scwg of alcohols with different carbon chain lengths the gasification efficiency of methanol is the lowest but that of ethanol is the highest the former can reach 25 at 550 c for 140 min dileo and savage 2006 while the latter can be 76 3 at 550 c 25 mpa for 50 min therdthianwong et al 2011a however gasification efficiency decreases slightly with an increase in carbon chain length after c 2 this may be due to the formation of intermediate compounds tar and char via polymerization reactions chakinala et al 2013 furthermore ni al2o3 and ni cezro2 al2o3 have significant effects on ethanol reforming decomposition acetaldehyde decomposition water gas shift reaction and carbon monoxide methanation therdthianwong et al 2011b glycerol containing three hydroxyl groups so it has a more complex degradation process and products in scwg a simple kinetics study was done by guo et al guo et al 2012 and the apparent activation energy and apparent pre exponential factor for glycerol scwg at 487 600 25 mpa are 104 5 kj mol and 105 90 s 1 respectively in scwg glycerol dehydrates first to form acrolein and hydroxyacetone and then the c c bond breaks during pyrolysis to generate c1 and c2 compounds such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde guo et al 2012 pairojpiriyakul et al pairojpiriyakul et al 2014 analyzed comprehensively products in glycerol scwg from 450 to 575 at 25 mpa and major gaseous products were h2 co2 co ch4 with some traces of c2h6 c2h4 c3h8 and c3h6 liquid products included acetaldehyde acetol methanol acetic acid propionaldehyde allyl alcohol acetone acrolein ethanol ethylene glycol and acrylic acid etc but main components were acetaldehyde and acetol the number increase of hydroxyl groups can improve carbon gasification efficiency because it can reduce the formation of hydrocarbons and increase the formation of co and thus leads to the subsequent production of more co2 and h2 chakinala et al 2013 therefore this kind of alcohol with multiple hydroxyl groups is an excellent raw material for hydrogen production typical representative glycerin of polyhydroxy alcohol has become the research hotspot of hydrogen production by scwg in recent years the treatment process in scw has significant energy demand at the startup stage if some real organic wastes treated do not have enough intrinsic heat value auxiliary heat operation will result in a high operation cost active alcohols can release large amounts of ho2 and oh free radicals and form synergistic oxidation effect and a high reaction heat zhang et al 2015 so accelerating the scwo rates of some refractory substances this is called a co oxidation phenomenon and added alcohols are called co fuels nowadays using organic solvent as auxiliary fuel to help start up operation or as co fuel to improve the degradation of reactants in scwo of some organic wastes has become a good solution to overcome the high cost of scwo common alcohols such as methanol shimoda et al 2016 zhang et al 2019c ethanol ploeger et al 2006 and isopropanol abelleira et al 2013 bermejo et al 2008 cabeza et al 2014 can accelerate oxidation degradation of reactants especially to improve the removal rate of refractory intermediates in scwo shimoda et al shimoda et al 2016 studied the mixing effect of ammonia and methanol in scwo of which initial concentrations were both 2 9 mmol l and found that methanol could promote the oxidation of nh3 n to form n2o fig 12 shows main reaction pathway of methanol in scw to accelerate oxidative degradation of nh3 n and the fastest reaction is nh3 oh nh2 h2o as can be seen in this figure thus ammonia and methanol share generated free radicals and promote mutual oxidation reactions to realize the decomposition of nh3 n zhang et al zhang et al 2019b compared the positive effect and exothermic performance of methanol and isopropanol as the auxiliary fuel of ammonia and concluded that methanol was superior to isopropanol qian et al qian et al 2019 pointed out that in addition to the reason of free radicals alcohols not only inhibited the formation of refractory products e g non nitrogen and nitrogen aromatic compounds but also promoted the formation of easily degradable substances e g non nitrogen open chain compounds zhang et al zhang et al 2019c also confirmed that methanol had the function of co oxidation in scwo of methanol acetic acid and phenol and improved the decomposition of phenol in their report methanol was first oxidized to produce large amounts of active intermediates i e ho2 and oh this caused a series of subsequent proliferation reactions including the oxidative decarboxylation of acid and the ring opening reaction of phenol ethanol releases the most amount of ho2 in the same time compared with ethanol and isopropanol and ho2 can affect the concentration of oh according to ho2 h2o oh h2o2 so ethanol is believed to have the strongest co oxidation effect among the three alcohols above qian et al 2019 4 4 aldehydes ketones and acids aldehydes ketones and acids are considered as typical intermediate products in scwg of model compounds and real biomass see eq 35 they are the precursors of generating co2 and h2o in scwo and h2 and co2 in scwg hence this section comprehensively describes these three types of compounds 35 hydrocarbons h 2 o aldehydes ketones acids other products co h 2 c h 4 c o 2 other gases and intermediates there are few studies on the reactions of aldehydes and ketones as reactants in scw and they often appear in forms of intermediates in articles ketones have strong activity and can be transformed into polymers coke resin carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide etc alcohols and ketones can be converted into each other through dehydrogenation and hydrogenation yang et al 2012 acetic acid can be transformed into acetone via bimolecular decarboxylation at the same time ketones can also be converted into carboxylic acids by c c cleavage in the presence of oxidant yang et al 2012 although most reaction products in scw are generated through free radical reactions the formation of aldehydes e g acetaldehyde and formaldehyde is ascribed to high density of ion reactions bühler et al 2002 aldehydes are also special compounds which are intermediate redox states of organic carbon and can generally become the precursors of carboxylic acids via disproportionation akgül et al akgül and kruse 2013 reported that formaldehyde participates in two competitive disproportionation reactions in subcritical water one is self disproportionation eq 36 which produces methanol and formic acid through oxidation reduction reaction between two kinds of formaldehydes another one is cross disproportionation eq 37 which forms methanol and carbonic acid via oxidation reduction reaction between formaldehyde and formic acid and then carbonic acid is easily decomposed into co2 and h2o herein formic acid is the hydrogenation agent for formaldehyde reduction and excessive formic acid promotes cross disproportionation in scwg aldehydes are important sources of h2 eq 39 kobiro et al 2013 it is significant to increase the content of aldehydes in intermediate products of scwg which helps to improve final h2 production fan fan et al 2018 proposed that adding formic acid to formaldehyde scwg would increase gasification efficiency and hydrogen efficiency this can be explained by the fact that formic acid promotes the self decomposition of formaldehyde eq 39 to generate h2 and induces free radical reactions of generated methanol eqs 36 37 to produce more h2 eqs 40 41 fan et al 2018 36 2 hcho h 2 o c h 3 oh hcooh 37 hcho hcooh h 2 o c h 3 oh c o 2 h 2 o 38 rc h 2 cho rc h 3 co 39 hcho h 2 co 40 c h 3 oh h 2 o c o 2 3 h 2 41 c h 3 oh co 2 h 2 decarboxylation and dehydration are two main types of reaction pathways of organic acids in scw watanabe et al 2001 xu et al 2009 as shown by eqs 42 43 however decarboxylation is more favorable and dominant reaction in scwg and is also the main approach to remove o from acid in the form of co2 formic acid scwg can produce amounts of h2 and co2 eq 44 xu et al 2009 while acetic acid scwg leads to much ch4 and co2 products eq 45 overall as the content of c atoms in the acids increases the general trend of the hydrocarbons yield is oscillating and rising after scwg chakinala et al 2013 chakinala chakinala et al 2013 found that with the increase of acid chain length from c1 to c8 gasification efficiency began to decline sharply and then became relatively stable acetic acid can be detected in liquid products of long chain acids above c2 scwg and some other products such as acetone benzene toluene are also found chakinala et al 2013 this shows that formic acid can be completely gasified while long chain acids c 2 are difficult to be fully gasified and easier to be converted into short chain acids by c c bond breaking in reactions that is conversion occurs towards the trend of forming acetic acid 42 rcooh c o 2 rh 43 rcooh h 2 o r co 44 hcooh c o 2 h 2 45 c h 3 cooh c h 4 c o 2 moreover the production of benzene and toluene also indicates that aromatization reaction occurs during the degradation of long chain acids acetic acid is indeed a very stable intermediate product and quite difficult to degrade in scwg hashimoto et al 2010 wang et al 2018b however many researchers add acetic acid to scwg reactions to promote the degradation of refractory compounds such as naphthalene and phenol this is mainly because that active free radicals ch3coo ch3 cooh and coch3 generated during acetic acid decomposition can stimulate the decomposition of other refractory substances wang et al 2018b the gasification of linear carboxylic acid in scw majorly starts from the breaking of the o h bond of carboxyl group and then β scission is the main reaction of fractionation and gas formation chakinala et al 2013 the influences of catalyst are commonly explored to improve the degradation of other complex acids gong gong et al 2017 used fecl3 as a catalyst to enhanceh2 production of humic acid which are very difficult to degrade in scwg ptsnx c and activated carbon can promote the decarboxylation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids into fuel series hydrocarbons in subcritical or supercritical water fu et al 2011 yeh et al 2015 5 n containing organic compounds conversions n containing organic compounds often appear in conversion products of algae protein and other substances due to n containing model compounds are much more hydrothermally stable there are few studies on scwg of n containing model compounds to the best of our knowledge the scwg of n containing model compounds requires very high temperatures 550 750 up to 500 even with catalysts guo et al 2013 guo et al 2015 liu et al 2016 it is a challenge to study the scwg of these compounds in the future in scwo many n containing groups can stabilize free radicals for example the free radical rno of nitrogen oxide is much stable n containing cyclic organic compounds can be called free radical scavengers which hinder further free radical reactions caputo et al 2016 thus denitrogenation is one of key research directions of scwo there are several major forms of n in organic compounds including nh2 no2 n heterocyclic n n and their mixture with more than two types of n containing forms different n containing functional groups can generate different oxidation products under scwo condition however they are all expected to be oxidized into n2 finally ammonia is one kind of stable intermediate product which is difficult to degrade in almost all nitrogen compounds scwo benjamin and savage 2005 temperature plays a decisive role in nh3 n degradation nh3 n can be oxidized into n2 at a high temperature over 500 c qian et al 2015 and its conversion rate increases rapidly above 550 c du et al 2013 therefore the further oxidation of ammonia becomes the rate limiting step for the complete oxidation of n containing compounds to form n2 adding auxiliary fuel may be an effective way when the methanol concentration is more than twice the initial nh3 concentration the nh3 conversion to n2o can be increased by 50 60 wt and the presence of methanol can also increase the yields of no3 and no2 cabeza et al 2014 various n containing functional groups or existing forms make reaction pathways different scwo products of n containing substances are mainly nitrogen nitrate ammonia almost without nitrite and nitrogen oxide yang et al 2017 and they can be shown by the following eqs 46 50 46 n h 2 n h 4 47 n o 2 n o 3 48 n o 2 n h 2 n 2 others 49 n n oh no others 50 n heterocyclic compounds n h 4 others the c n bond energy is smaller than that of c c bond so the c n bond in nitrobenzene or aniline first breaks and forms benzene ring yang et al 2018 oh free radical is considered to be main oxidant in scwo its diffusion coefficient is far greater than that of nitrobenzene in scw huang et al 2015 the effective collision frequency of free radicals such as oh and ho2 in scw increases which makes free radical reaction easier to occur and is conducive to the oxidation and degradation of nitrobenzene tan et al tan et al 2020 reported that n containing organic compounds had better denitrification effects than inorganic compounds because they could produce more active radicals this means that nitro and amino groups are easily attacked by oh to produce more amino radicals nh2 and nitro radicals no2 yang et al yang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 proposed that amino functional group was easier to be attacked than nitro functional group when nitro and amino groups are present at the same time thus according to their conclusions the potential degradation pathway of 2 nitroaniline scwo can be shown in fig 13 nh2 in 2 nitroaniline first reacts with oh to form nh2 and then no2 is removed in the form of no2 and the two active radicals continue to react to generate n2 this is consistent with the yang et al s finding that organic n makes a predominant contribution to the formation of n2 at the early stage of scwo while inorganic n nh4 and no3 makes a minor contribution to the conversion of n2 at the late stage yang et al 2020 pyridine quinoline quinazoline and pyrimidine are important n containing heterocyclic compounds and they are usually first oxidized into corresponding derivatives in scwo and then polycyclic compounds are decomposed into monocyclic compounds and further split to open rings as a result liquid phase composition is very complex and few polycyclic intermediates may also be formed by some free radicals coupling dong et al 2015 for example naphthalene biphenyl and phenanthrene are formed by polymerization of phenyl and benzyl etc gong et al 2016 the oxidative degradation of these heterocyclic compounds can be summarized into four steps including hydroxylation to generate derivative alcohols oxidative reforming to form carbonyl and cyclolysis oh reattacks to take place deamination decarboxylation and rearrangement reaction and finally mineralization to form co2 h2o and nh3 gong et al 2016 till now the f 0 value the magnitude of the attack power of oh free radical of c and n atoms in pyridine has been calculated the f 0 value of the n atom is much higher than that of the c atom so the n atom is much easier to be attacked by oh to take place fracture yang and shen 2019 the bond energy of c n is 305 kj mol l lower than 332 kj mol l of c c hence it can be believed that c n bond fracture plays a dominating role in the ring opening process of n heterocyclic compounds meanwhile n atom has strong electron attraction ability and thus the electron cloud density of pyridine ring is relatively low gong et al 2016 this makes nucleophilic substitution reaction take place at α or γ position of the n atom pyrimidine with one more n atom than pyridine is easier to be oxidized and degraded due to its lower electron cloud density similarly the benzene ring in quinazoline and quinoline can be easily oxidized because of the low electron cloud density of the pyridine pyrimidine ring in them quinazoline has more n atoms than quinoline so its benzene ring is more easily oxidized and opened fig 14 displays potential reaction pathways of quinazoline and pyrimidine in scwo based on identification of intermediate products apparently there are two ring open pathways of quinazoline in scwo the first one is that more n atoms in the pyrimidine ring of quinazoline lead to a lower an electron cloud density so that the benzene ring in quinazoline is first attacked by oh and o2 to open the ring and form pyrimidine then the pyrimidine ring begins to cleave to form n containing chain products such as carbamate and oxalic acid and finally to form gases the other ring open pathway is that the pyrimidine ring is opened earlier than the benzene ring according to the appearance of benzene naphthalene methylbenzene etc in intermediate products gong et al gong et al 2016 inferred two types of possibilities for ring opening however in the study of scwo quinoline by ren et al ren et al 2019 there is just one possibility that benzene ring is opened first and the opening of the pyridine ring is a little slower therefore this inconsistence of different ring open orders requires to deep research in subsequent work to date the decomposition of diazonium group compounds in scwo has hardly been reported compared with the aromatic group the azo bond n n is easier to be broken so the oh radical is more likely to attack n n first in reactions which makes macromolecular compounds split into relatively small compounds yang et al 2017 meanwhile the presence of cl in compounds can promote the degradation of n containing compounds and the higher cl content in amino n compounds leads to more nh4 formation yang et al 2017 one possible explanation is that cl can react with some metals and thus released transition metal ions e g fe3 mn2 and cu2 play a catalytic role in reactions n containing substances derived from industrial living such as sludge and wastewater have more complex scwo processes compared with model compounds cabeza et al 2013 du et al 2013 li et al 2019 lin et al 2017 liquid phase intermediates after scwo can be classified into five types including non nitrogen open chain compounds nitrogen open chain compounds non nitrogen aromatic compounds nitrogen aromatic compounds and non aromatic ring compounds among them the non nitrogen open chain compounds are composed of aliphatic acids and small amounts of aliphatic hydrocarbons and esters qian et al 2015 the proportion of nitrogen open chain compounds is relatively low and almost all of them are amide compounds non nitrogen aromatic compounds are mainly oxygen containing aromatic derivatives which are mainly composed of phenols phenol and its methyl substituents acids phenylacetic acid alcohols phenylethanol and ketones acetophenone ma et al 2017 n containing aromatic compounds can be decomposed from macromolecules to pyridine indole pyrazine and derivatives substituted by methyl and amino groups changi et al 2012a qian et al 2016 however pyridine is difficult to be oxidized so the content of pyridine and its derivatives in the n aromatic compounds in liquid phase are relatively high n heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine can be formed by maillard reaction between protein degradation products and cellulose decomposition products and they can steadily reduce the number of free radicals as free radical scavengers with the increase of temperature and oxidant part of pyridine decomposes to form ammonia du et al 2013 and other pyridine can combine with the benzene ring to form fused ring compounds such as quinoline the other liquid phase products of wastewater scwo are non aromatic ring compounds but the content is much low most of non aromatic ring compounds are cyclic ketonic compounds including cyclopentanone cyclohexanone pyrrolidone and piperidone and they are intermediates of maillard reaction or sugar hydrolysis reaction and their further dehydrogenation can form phenols qian et al 2015 6 halogen atom s and p containing organic compounds conversions 6 1 cl br and f containing compounds cl containing organic compounds such as chloroalkyls chloroaromatic hydrocarbons and macromolecule polymers are important chemicals or intermediates in industry high toxicity and low biodegradability of these compounds can result in great environmental harm subcritical or supercritical fluid is an effective medium to remove chlorine from organic matters catalytic dechlorination can selectively break one or more c cl bond and thus reduces their toxicity soler et al 2018 many researchers have studied the dechlorination effect of chlorinated compounds in subcritical or supercritical water akimoto et al 2002 kubatova et al 2003 kubatova et al 2002 scw is an effective environment for the dechlorination of cl containing organic compounds scwo can convert organic chlorine into hcl and dissolve it in water meanwhile transforms organic carbon into gaseous product co2 some researchers adopt h2o2 as oxidant to explore the degradation kinetics of o dichlorobenzene o dcb in scw lin et al 2019 wang et al 2018a during o dcb scwo 5 chloro 2 pentanone 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 pentanone 2 hexanone 2 pentanone and 3 4 dichlorophenol and other intermediates are produced in scwo experiments of chlorobenzene liu liu and pan 2012 detected some intermediate by products that were not completely oxidized such as benzene 4 methyl 3 penten 2 one and 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 pentanone while shimokawa shimokawa et al 2010 used tio2 nanoparticles photocatalysis to obtain intermediate products with smaller molecular weight such as aliphatic c2 c4 ketone aldehyde alcohol and carboxylic acid without aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives fe zro2 can catalyze the reductive dechlorination of chlorobenzene in scw at 410 500 without adding any oxidant and cause h2o to crack more h in the presence of fe wei et al 2009 as shown in eq 51 moreover zr4 o2 lewis acid base pairs significantly promote the fracture of c cl bond on the chlorobenzene aromatic ring and accelerate the formation of hcl eq 52 wei et al 2009 this shows that catalyst can greatly improve the degradation efficiency of cl containing compounds in scw 51 2 h 2 o fe zr o 2 2 h 2 oh 52 2 h c 6 h 5 cl c 6 h 6 hcl as for cl and o containing organic compounds hashimoto hashimoto et al 2010 studied the oxidative degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in sub and supercritical water and found that the dechlorination effect increased with reaction time and temperature and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and acetic acid were main degradation intermediates however 2 4 dcp can almost completely disappear and transform into inorganic chlorine in scw at 400 c the first reaction pathway of 2 4 dcp decomposition leads to the formation of dimers and some macromolecular compounds such as dichlorophenoxyphenols and 5 dichloro 2 hydroxyacetophene then in scwo these compounds take place secondary oxidation to form ring opening products and monocyclic compounds such as phenol 2 methylphenol 2 4 dichloro 6 methylphenol which can eventually be oxidized into co2 lee et al 2005 moreover naoh is proved to be an effective catalyst for the dechlorination of 2 chlorophenol and can significantly reduce the formation of dimers in scwo lee et al 2002 the dechlorination of complex compounds commonly occurs in subcritical water because it is easier to achieve dechlorination than supercritical water kubatova et al 2002 takeshita et al takeshita et al 2004 treated polyvinyl chloride with subcritical water 200 350 c and obtained good dechlorination effect and no harmful chlorinated organic compounds were produced in liquid and gas components the corresponding reaction principle is regarded to release hcl in polyvinyl chloride and form a polyene structure of ch ch n then the formed hcl immediately dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid and the polyene structure further generates low molecular weight aromatic and aliphatic compounds through cyclization hydrolysis and other reactions soler et al soler et al 2018 conducted dechlorination experiments of polyvinyl chloride electric wires at 200 300 c and confirmed that when the residues after dechlorination was subjected to high temperature pyrolysis the emission of hcl and the formation of chlorobenzene and chlorophenol decreased while the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased with the dechlorination temperature increasing this shows that subcritical water treatment is an effective dechlorination method which can reduce the formation of chlorinated compounds in the subsequent heat treatment process this finding is also consistent with their experiments on debromination of printed circuit boards at 225 275 c soler et al 2017 both the efficiencies of debromination and dichlorination increase with an increase in process temperature the maximum debromination efficiency of 63 6 and the maximum dechlorination efficiency of 95 96 are obtained at 275 c and 300 c respectively soler et al 2018 soler et al 2017 obviously final conversion products of halogen elements during the degradation of compounds in scw are commonly hcl and hbr etc due to steric hindrance compared with high valent atoms monovalent atoms are easier to be exposed and attacked by free radicals in most seizure reactions therefore h can combine with cl and br to form hcl and hbr f is also a halogen element which is the most electronegative element making fluorochemicals have unique physiochemical properties perfluorochemicals pfcs such as perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos perfluorohexanesulfonate pfhs and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa have been widely used in many industrial processes and commercial products including polymer additives surfactants fire fighting foams and pesticides etc pfcs have recently received much attention because they are recognized as refractory environmental contaminants and commonly dominant in wastewater sludge schultz et al 2003 zhu et al 2012 using scw can effectively degrade pfcs and realize defluorination hori et al hori et al 2008 conducted the decomposition of pfhs in sub supercritical water with fe catalyst at 150 380 c 21 2 26 4 mpa for 6h and found that pfhs could be decomposed to f and so4 2 ions in the aqueous phase and small amounts of h2 co2 and cf3h were detected in the gas phase in addition to catalyst adding o2 can also enhance the decomposition of pfcs with the addition of o2 in the decomposition of c6h5 3s cf3so3 a substitute for pfos in subcritical water at 372 c for 6 h the f yield can reach up to 93 6 indicating that nearly all f atoms in cf3so3 are transformed into f ions hori and yokota 2015 o2 can also suppress the formation of cf3h and benzene in addition ca oh 2 can effectively defluorinate pfcs under thermal conditions by forming caf2 wang et al 2011 in general using scw to defluorinate aims to release fluorine from complex fluoroorganic compounds and convert it into f ion which can be recycled 6 2 s containing compounds in recent years the research on coal scwg of for hydrogen production has drawn much attention however s containing compounds in coal utilization processes can cause air pollution and reactor corrosion li et al 2015 yang et al 2020a besides some residual oil also contains many varieties of s containing compounds such as homologues of thiophene yuan et al 2005 using scw to remove sulfur from heavy oil asphalt and other raw materials has great development potential presently demirbas demirbas 2016 used a partial oxidation method to desulfurize residual oil with catalyst in scw and the desulfurization efficiency could reach up to 60 scw can effectively transform original sulfide into smaller sulfide so the studies on transformation pathways of the s element in scw can provide an important theoretical basis for the control of s containing pollutants in following utilization fig 15 illustrates sulfur distribution differences in gas liquid and solid phases after coal scwg and pyrolysis thus s containing gases after coal pyrolysis include h2s and so2 however scw can provide abundant h free radicals to generate more h2s and inhibit the formation of so2 and organic sulfur meanwhile scw also promotes the decomposition of sulfate and pyrite and oh free radical improves the oxidation of s 2 and coke in supercritical fluid meng et al 2016 these finding is consistent with of the conclusion of chen et al chen et al 2015 they studied the influence of pressure temperature and oxidation coefficient on the distribution of s in solid liquid and gas products after lignite scwg and found that so4 2 and s2o3 2 were main sulfur components in liquid fraction while the contents of s2 hs so3 2 and hso3 were very low and h2s was the only sulfur compound detected in gaseous products pathardhan et al patwardhan et al 2013 also pointed out that scw could effectively convert sulfur in the form of sulfides e g aliphatic aromatic and cyclic into h2s in the presence of α hydrogen and weak the s r bond as listed by eqs 53 57 at the initiation stage c s bonds are usually the weakest bonds in the system 53 r 1 c h 2 s r 2 r 1 c h 2 s r 2 54 r 1 c h 2 s r 2 r 1 c h 2 r 2 s at the propagation stage α c h is the easiest to abstract 55 r 2 rh r 2 h r 56 r r 1 c h 2 s r 2 rh r 1 c hs r 2 57 r 1 c hs r 2 r 1 ch s r 2 at present it is also a hot spot to explore desulfurization mechanism of alkyl sulfur compounds in scw such as hexyl sulfide class et al 2019 kida et al 2014 hexanethiol kang et al 2020 and isopropylthiobenzene wang et al 2016a water plays important roles in the scw decomposition of alkyl sulfide it is not only the reactant for the hydrolysis of important intermediates e g thioaldehyde and thioaectone but also the source of many h atoms needed for desulfurization to form h2s and the h transfer catalyst of desulfurization and decomposition of some intermediates thiols it is proposed that alkanes can lead to the selective cleavage of the c s bond and thus promote the decomposition and desulfurization process by forming aliphatic radicals attacking α h on isopropylthiobenzene wang et al 2016a similarly the isopropyl group in isopropylthiobenzene can act in the same way as alkane so improving the desulfurization of isopropylthiobenzene in scw till now there are few scw desulfurization catalysts ates et al ates et al 2014 studied the effects of zno moo3 and mos2 on the desulfurization of heavy oil in scw and found that zno had the best removal effect on dibenzothiophene but its main structure and composition changed and thus resulted in activity decrease due to sulfurization reaction therefore researchers can focus on the research regarding catalytic desulfurization effect and catalyst activity and stability in the future after s containing substances scwo sulfur is only released into liquid products and there is hardly s containing substance in gas products sulfide thiosulfate sulfite and sulfate are main sulfur components in liquid products among which sulfate is dominant due to different reactants sometimes the content of sulfide or thiosulfate is rich when reactants are methylmercaptan ma et al 2013 iron sulfide ma et al 2012 sulfur coal wang and zhu 2003 and thiirane ma et al 2013 if scwo is carried out at a high temperature with a long reaction time it is likely that sulfur can be completely converted into sulfate 6 3 p containing compounds representative p containing organic compounds such as tributhyl phosphate tbp and other organophosphate flame retardants opfrs are widely used in various fields for example tbp is usually used as a raw material for herbicides fungicides plasticizers and other products while most opfrs can be found in furnitures textiles electronics and other processing chemicals however with the development of phosphorus chemical industry environmental pollution is becoming more and more severe therefore several treatment methods of p containing organic compounds such as ultraviolet persulfate advanced oxidation processes aops photocatalytic oxidation and scwo have been reported in recent years antonopoulou et al 2017 kosari et al 2018 ou et al 2017 this section mainly summarizes some studies on scwo of tbp and other opfrs tbp can be successfully decomposed and achieve toc removal rate of 99 in scwo at 480 c 50 mpa for 100 min without any catalyst kosari et al 2018 the decomposition efficiency of tbp in scwo can reach the maximum value of 79 4 with fe2o3 at 405 c for 70 min and the order of catalytic performance is fe2o3 cuo mgo ag2o zno kosari et al 2018 the most abundant byproduct of tbp scwo is h3po4 followed by other compounds such as butanol monobutylphosphate mbp and dibutylphosphate dbp besides golmohammadi et al golmohammadi et al 2018 reported that the order of catalytic performance was ceo2 co3o4 cr2o3 mno2 now there is very little research on scwo of other opfrs yang et al yang et al 2019b investigated the decomposition of 14 opfrs in scwo with temperature varying from 350 to 550 c at 24 mpa for 1 6 min with 300 of excess oxygen they found that aryl and chloro opfrs like 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate and tris 1 3 dichloro phosphate achieved higher toc degradation rates than the alkyl ones e g tripropyl phosphate in summary conceivable degradation pathways of opfrs can generally contain hydroxylation ring cleavage and mineralization for aryl ones compared with hydroxylation carbonylation and mineralization for alkyl and chloro ones yang et al 2019b to the best of our knowledge the research on scwo of tbp and opfrs with or without catalyst is quite scarce and thus require further exploration 7 conclusions heavy hydrocarbons o and n containing organic compounds have good prospects for hydrogen production by scwg for some compounds containing heteroatoms e g cl br f s and p the research hotspot is to use excellent properties of scw to realize the removal of heteroatoms and the goal of environmental friendliness scwo is a very effective method to degrade most organic compounds under proper conditions free radicals play an important role in scwg and scwo and are related to complex chemical reactions intermediate products reaction pathways and reaction mechanisms it is of great significance to develop effective catalysts
