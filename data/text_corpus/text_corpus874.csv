4370,exploring the responsibility subject of water pollution is the foundation of ecological environmental control and protection a water pollution sources apportionment and contribution rates analysis method based on one dimensional model was developed it was adopted in a typical trans boundary river section in the sub watershed of the yangtze river basin the contribution rates of different time period and distinctive administrative regions of the section were calculated results show that urban living point sources contributed most to chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n followed by rural living sources agricultural sources are the main pollution source of total phosphorus tp throughout the year almost seven township regions in deyang city especially the bajiaojing community and xinshi town should be mainly responsible for water pollution however in different month and water periods contribution rates change along with the precipitation variability sewage treatment plants and industrial enterprises contributed the most to pollutants in the dry season but the living sources and non point agricultural sources have bigger contribution rates in the wet season there is a strong negative correlation between precipitation and contribution rate methods adopted in this paper can be used to analyze the pollution sources in the refined management of the water environment so as to trace the main body of environmental responsibility keywords sources apportionment water quality model river pollution section yangtze river basin 1 introduction water pollution is one of the major issues of global attention the total maximum daily loads tmdl in the usa the eu water framework directive wfd and the water pollutant total control in china are typical policies for total amount control of environmental pollution cao et al 2015 in these policies the core work is producing pollutant emissions inventory based on source apportionment for pollutants control however with the rapid development of social economy especially the industrial development and urban expansion sources of water pollutants become more diverse and complex haji gholizadeh et al 2016 this makes it more difficult to carry out sources apportionment for water pollution sources apportionment originates from the atmospheric field and has been applied to the water environment and soil fields for many years lu et al 2018 various technical methods can be used to qualitatively identify different sources of water pollutants and the contribution rate of each pollutant will be quantitatively calculated for sources apportionment nazeer et al 2016 the common sources apportionment represents the percentage of a certain pollution load in the total pollution loads on a region or basin haji gholizadeh et al 2016 in this field many methods have been put forward and could be divided into two categories qualitative identification and quantitative calculation chen et al 2013 kumari and tripathi 2014 the qualitative identification method is used for pollutants sources types and locations ascertaining for example a linear correlations was used to estimate the source of amine oxidation in water without calculating it explicitly which only provided the source where pollutants coming from but no specific contribution rates b√§cktorp et al 2015 the quantitative calculation method such as pollutant discharge coefficient method and non point source models can be used for pollutant emission loads computing uranishi et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 with these methods the inflow flux of pollutant sources could be detected on a large scale especially in china there were two national censuses of pollution sources the first pollution source census was conducted in 2007 which produced more than 1 1 billion sets of data wang et al 2016b the second census began on december 31 2017 and lasted for the whole year of 2018 in this new general survey of pollution source all pollution from industrial production agriculture family activities and other sources is covered a large number of data for analysis of water pollution sources have been obtained in this survey which will provide reliable information about the total amount and proportion of different pollution sources as the fine scale management carried out in the action of yangtze river protection detailed information about what is the biggest pollutant source to special water sections should be explored cao et al 2015 while the usual sources apportionment methods are difficult to obtain these information it is indispensable to control pollutants by analyzing contribution rate of pollution sources to specific monitoring sections or monitoring points many quantitative calculation methods have been put forward for sources apportionment recently such as the receptor model lu et al 2018 qu et al 2021 uranishi et al 2017 the non point source model ouyang et al 2018 wellen et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 and the water quality model bai et al 2018 hoos et al 2019 li et al 2011 li and zhang 2011 liu et al 2019 the receptor model is a statistical model which is based on the comparison and correlation analysis between the composition characteristics of a certain section and pollution sources the multivariate statistical analysis and chemical mass balance cmb models are commonly used as receptor models gokhale et al 2008 lu et al 2018 steiger et al 1990 it is assumed that the mass of particulate matter remains unchanged during the transport from the source to the recipient in many receptor models which are not suitable for big scale sources apportionment haji gholizadeh et al 2016 massoudieh and kayhanian 2013 other more receptor models are difficult to compute contribution rate of pollutant at different time periods the non point source model is used for the calculation of land pollutants loads but it is difficult to calculate the contribution rate of each source to the recipient pollutants results of which are always treated as input conditions for water quality models water quality models can be used to simulate the migration process of pollutants in rivers after the emission of pollution sources cao et al 2015 prabodanie et al 2010 on the basis of simulating pollutant concentration with water quality model scenario simulation method should be proposed to estimate the contribution rate guan et al 2013 in the scenario simulation method assume scenarios such as pollution source removal scenario based on the actual scenario the pollution source additional scenario based on the scenario without sources wang et al 2017 by comparing the contaminants flux between different scenarios the difference value of contaminants will be treated as the pollutant load from removal or additional source for the special section the contribution rate can be obtained from the rate of the difference value to the total contaminants flux in the special section the scenario simulation method ignores the influence of mixed pollutants on pollutant degradation otherwise if there are thousands of sources there will be a heavy computational burden this makes it also unsuitable for the contribution rate analysis in large scale river basins as the requirement of refined management of the water environment many river basins in china need to carry out water quality target management on some river sections at basin scale based on abundant pollutant sources data obtained in the national census of pollution sources an important task of the current water environment is to make refined sources apportionment and quantify their contribution rates to target river sections to achieve this we proposed a new contaminant flux variation method based on a water quality model to calculation the contribution rates from different sources to typical state controlled and intercity assessment sections the yangtze river is the biggest river basin with complicating water environment in china there are abundant of different pollutant sources around the basin strong spatial heterogeneity exists among the main stream and more than 700 tributary gao et al 2018 one policy for one river especially the fine and targeted environmental governance has become the most important strategy under the background of the yangtze river protection strategy therefore a typical tributary of yangtze river basin has been selected for sources apportionment 2 methods and materials 2 1 contaminant flux variation methods in order to calculate the contribution rate of pollution sources in the certain section pollution flux at the certain section generated by different sources should be identified pollutants are transported to rivers from land sources by advection and degradation nukazawa et al 2018 advection moves the mass downstream and diffusion spreads it out making it less concentrated for many rivers the calculation of water quality can be simplified to one dimensional water quality problem there are several well known models such as qual2k mike11 efdc and wasp which can be used for one dimensional water quality simulation for pollution sources the pollutant flux from point sources is relatively stable but non point sources are obviously affected by precipitation in one year a one dimensional model suitable for unsteady flow and water quality simulation in complex river network areas has been developed and used for pollutants transport simulation however water quality models could simulate the pollutant concentration at different river sections or river elements but it is still difficult to distinguish how much discharge comes from special river sections with different sources it is assumed that there are several pollution sources that contribute to the contaminants in the receptor and the pollutants emitted by each pollution source do not interact with each other but are reduced due to degradation sedimentation and other processes according to the law of conservation of mass the contaminants concentration in the receptor of sampling points can be regarded as a linear sum of the contaminants concentrations from various major pollution sources based on this premise the core of the contribution rates is to calculate the amount of retained contaminants after transporting from each pollution source to the specific section in other words it is necessary to determine how much pollutants will be reduced from each pollution source to a specific section assuming that the pollutants discharged from all pollution sources are uniformly mixed from the previous calculation unit to the next calculation unit the diffusion and degradation effects of pollutants from different pollution sources in the same calculation unit should be the same which can be described by a comprehensive loss coefficient k therefore the contaminants degradation amount of all calculation units in the upstream of a specific section can be calculated first and then the degradation amount can be evenly distributed to all pollution sources the pollutant leaving their sources will reach the specific section through the river network and pass through three types of a b c calculation units fig 1 as shown in fig 1 river channel calculation units can be divided into three categories a b and c category a represents the calculation unit with pollution source inflow category b represents the calculation unit without pollution source inflow it is not located at the intersection of the main stream and tributaries category c represents the calculation unit at the intersection of the main stream and tributaries through the water quality model the inflow and outflow flow and concentration of each calculation unit were simulated the pollutant reduction of each calculation unit can be expressed as a Œ¥ m a c in q in c up q up c out q out b Œ¥ m b c up q up c out q out c Œ¥ m c c u p 1 q u p 1 c u p 2 q u p 2 c out q out in which Œ¥ m a Œ¥ m b and Œ¥ m c represent the pollutant reduction of calculation unit type a b and c respectively cup mg l and qup m3 s represent the contaminants concentration and flux of the upstream flow of the calculation unit cout mg l and qout m3 s represent the concentration and pollutant flux at the outlet of the calculation unit cin mg l and qin m3 s stand for the concentration and flux discharged by pollution sources in calculation unit accordingly the pollutant reduction amount of each calculation unit can be obtained at a certain time on this basis it is only necessary to calculate the number of all pollution sources upstream of each calculation unit accordingly the contribution rate of pollution sources to a certain section can be obtained for calculating the remaining contaminants flux and its proportion which can be expressed as follows 1 q si m si j 1 n k j k j Œ¥ m j i n j p si q si q where qsi m3 is the pollutant flux of the pollution source si at the target section q m3 is the total pollutant flux at the target section psi is the contribution rate of the pollution source si Œ¥ m j m3 is the total pollutant reduction amount of the calculation unit j k j is the loss coefficient of pollution sources in the calculation unit j inj is the total amount of pollutant flow into unit j including upstream inputs and side inputs msi m3 is the pollutant load of pollution source si and n is the number of calculation units from the pollution source si to the target section according to the above formula the pollution contribution rate at different times can be obtained to calculate the contribution rate of pollution in a certain time period the psi in formula 1 can be expressed as follows 2 p si t 1 nt q sit Œ¥ t t 1 nt q t Œ¥ t where t is the time nt is the total number of output time steps Œ¥ t is the output time step qsit is the pollutant flux of pollution source si at the target section at time t and qt is the total pollutant flux at the target section at time t what needs illustration is that the method is more suitable in the following situations 1 slow flow rivers whose flow velocity is less than 5 m s 2 shallow rivers whose water depth is less than 10 m 3 narrow rivers whose surface width is less than 1000 m 2 2 study areas and data sources the tuojiang river basin with length of 627 4 km and area of 25 576 km2 mainly located in sichuan province is an important tributary affecting the water quantity and quality of the yangtze river zhou et al 2020 the whole tuojiang river basin covers 10 cities in sichuan province including chengdu zigong luzhou deyang mianyang neijiang leshan meishan yibin and ziyang fig 2 the population of tuojiang rvier basin at the year end of 2018 is over 22 million among them 80 are agricultural population the area of the tuojiang river basin is about 5 percent territory of the sichuan province but it supports more than 30 8 percent of the total economy and more than 26 2 percent of the population in recent years with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization over 1600 point sources including industrial enterprises large scale farms urban living point sources have been set up following with generally water environment quality declination of tuojiang river basin wang et al 2020 the water environment of the tuojiang river basin is affected by the various factors which is a typical representative of the compound pollution of the water environment in china wang et al 2016a almost 80 of water quality control sections are exceeding standards in water quality especially the total phosphorus tp concentration 0 2 mg l in the dry seasons to figure out the contribution of pollution sources to water quality control sections is the primary task of water environmental protection among water quality stations the section 201 at the intersection between deyang and chengdu is a key section of the state control the section 201 is located in the confluence of three large tributaries of tuojiang including the mianyuan river shiting river and yazi river it is one of sections with the most complex external environment in tuojiang river basin it is important and representative to promote the sources apportionment of the tuojiang river basin by studying deeply on section 201 fig 2 as showed in fig 2 a large number of pollution sources are distributed in the upstream of section 201 including various point sources meanwhile non point sources such as agricultural production and aquaculture in the region are also very complicated to carry out water quality management of section 201 and control upstream pollution sources it is necessary to clarify the pollution sources of section 201 and determine the main pollution sources as well as their contribution rate monitoring data such as pollution sources data water quality monitoring data hydrology data were provided by the sichuan academy of environmental sciences and sichuan ecological environment monitoring station the other data such as geographic data river network data and meteorological data were obtained from national geomatics center of china http www ngcc cn ngcc and the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 3 model developed 2 3 1 river network structure on the basis of the census of pollution sources in the tuojiang river basin an one dimensional river network water quality model based on the one dimensional mode of efdc was constructed as showed in fig 2 tuojiang river together with 5 tributaries with a total length of 352 km has been set for the model simulation the river network was divided into 9 reaches and 734 computing units the river structure in the one dimensional model is shown in fig 3 2 3 2 boundary condition and scenarios setting as shown in fig 3 there are five headwaters and one downstream boundary daily measured water flow data from the hydrology stations and monthly measured pollutant concentration data from the water quality stations near headwaters were used as input flow conditions daily measured water level data from the hyd1 hydrology station were set as downstream conditions as shown in fig 4 the model calculation time was from january to december 2019 with time step 10 s the chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp which concerned by the regulators were simulated as water quality indicators pollutant loads from 453 point sources and non point sources obtained in the second census were used as lateral boundary conditions point sources including industrial sewage sewage treatment plants large scale livestock and poultry farms and phosphogypsum stock dumps were imputed into the model with daily constant value non point sources including urban living sources rural living sources agricultural sources livestock and poultry breeding sources and aquaculture sources were distributed to different towns according to the proportion of their areas considering the time differentiation the non point sources loads were apportioned to every day based on the average daily rainfall during the whole year in 2019 total loads of different pollutants sources are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification hydrological and water quality validation were made by comparing the simulated results and measured data the coefficient of determination r2 was used for model evaluation 3 1 1 hydrological validation the measured water level of hyd2 and water flow of hyd1 near the section 201 was selected for hydrodynamic calibration and validation the final validation results of water level and water flow were shown in fig 5 from the simulation results of water level it can be seen that the hydrodynamic model can simulate the overall water level and water flow change trend of tuojiang river both of the r2 were above 0 8 which indicated that the model could simulate the change process of hydrodynamic 3 1 2 water quality validation the daily simulated results of cod tp and nh4 n and measured data of section 201 were selected for water quality verification as shown in fig 6 the r2 between simulated results and measured data of the section 201 bj sjq and sq stations were used for model verification as shown in fig 7 from the above figures it can be seen that the model can simulate the water quality changing process on the main stream of the tuojiang river the r2 of average pollutants concentration at these four water quality stations were over 0 65 it indicated that the simulated data fit well with the measured data the model performance in the three indicators is different for the reason that the phosphorus is a kind of sedimentary type pollutant it is hard to measured and simulated the phenomenon that the concentration of tp on december 1 is greatly increased was not simulated as shown in fig 6 otherwise the value of cod has a rather great fluctuation which is also relatively hard to simulate these caused that the fitting results of cod and tp are worse than that of nh4 n overall results of model verification indicated that the model can be used for the water quality contribution rate simulation in this paper 3 2 yearly contribution rates analysis 3 2 1 contribution rates of different pollution sources identifying the sources of water pollutants is the first step for efficient water quality management yang et al 2013 according to model results we have calculated contribution rates of nine different sources to section 201 in the whole year 2019 as shown in the fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8 the primary pollution sources of three water quality parameters are different rural living point sources urban living point sources sewage treatment plants agricultural sources and industrial sewage are the main pollutant sources of cod and nh4 n for cod to rural living sources takes the largest contribution rate with a contribution rate of 37 13 followed by urban living sources sewage treatment plants agricultural sources and industrial sewage with contribution rates 20 18 15 13 14 75 and 10 05 respectively among them rural living sources and urban living sources contribute cod over 57 the dense population caused in daily life generates most of the cod pollutants this result ties well with previous studies wherein rural nps pollution yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the nh4 n shows a same characteristics as cod the rural living sources produced 37 57 nh4 n followed with the urban living sources agricultural sources sewage treatment plants and industrial treatment with corresponding contribution rates of 27 64 14 9 10 01 and 9 6 respectively similar results have been reported by previous studies which described that the city expanding and extensive population growth have brought a lot of emissions on nh4 n and cod kringel et al 2016 su et al 2011 the main sources is varying with time changing in the early age of 21st century with field investigations and observations data researchers have found that medium sized and small rivers have been seriously polluted by industrial and domestic sewage animal manures chemical fertilizers in farmland and polluted sediments chen et al 2002 for the past few years along with the development of point sources control the nonpoint source pollution was becoming the major contributor to the total input of pollutants into the rivers chen et al 2019 especially the tp which is different from the other two pollutant indexes agricultural sources act as the dominant factor for tp with a contribution rate of 56 46 rural living sources with the corresponding contribution rate of 12 98 are the second largest sources of tp specially the phosphogypsum stock dumps discharged 6 62 of the tp the phosphorus p is one of the most important mineral nutrients in agricultural systems and is generally the most limiting nutrient for plant production hart et al 2004 with the deepening of water pollution control in the tuojiang river basin the problem of tp from agricultural and rural non point source pollution has gradually become prominent 3 2 2 contribution rates of different administrative regions besides identifying the different pollution sources of water pollutants for water environment management to find out the administrative region who should deserve the blame of pollution is the basis for pollution abatement of government according to the analysis results regions with higher pollution contribution rate are mainly concentrated in deyang city which presents a similar spatial distribution of higher contribution regions for three pollutant indexes as shown in fig 9 the bajiaojing community in deyang city has the largest contribution to three pollutants the second and the third largest contribution regions to three pollutants are also the same while the other regions whose contribution rates crs to different pollutants are different fig 9 presents that contribution rates of most regions are widespread less than 2 the bajiaojing community contributes pollutants far more than other regions contribution rates of the bajiaojing community to cod tp and nh4 n are 13 11 6 and 8 8 respectively it is almost 1 6 km from the bajiaojing community to section 201 along the mianyuan river across two towns different from others regions there are three sewage treatment plants located in the bajiaojing community located along with the mianyuan river from north to south it is indicated that most pollutants in the bajiaojing community are produced by sewage treatment plants with 84 9 for cod 88 48 for tp and 72 7 for nh4 n respectively in china urbanization has quickened its step and brought water quality problems to protect the water environment fundamental facilities e g sewage networks and sewage treatment plants have been built up in a lot of villages and towns li and zhang 2011 it was proved that sewage treatment plants play an important role in controlling pollutant discharges to surface waters and will improve the pollution abatement gatidou et al 2019 mao et al 2016 through investigation we have found that most of the sewage treatment plants stps in tuojiang river basin discharge wastewater according to the primary standard a in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb19818 2002 based on this standard the emission concentration of cod tp and nh4 n is 50 mg l 0 5 mg l and 8 mg l this discharge standard is of great difference with the basic water quality management standards of china the surface water quality standard of gb3838 2002 state environment protection bureau of china 2002 in the surface water quality standard there are five water quality standard types from type i to type v type v is the worst that indicates water is seriously polluted in which the concentration of cod tp and nh4 n is 40 mg l 0 4 mg l and 2 0 mg l the type iii with standard concentration of cod tp and nh4 n is set to 20 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l has been set as water quality management objectives the emission concentration of cod tp and nh4 n in wastewater treatment plants may be 2 or 5 times more than the water quality target concentration the wastewater treatment plants collect wastewater and discharge treated sewage to the river yarahmadi et al 2018 compared to wastewater before the collection and processing the water quality concentration is reduced but the total amount of pollutant is tremendously increased which may beyond the self purification capacity of rivers as a result the stps become the biggest sources of pollutants discharged into surface water xiao et al 2018 for the bajiaojing community as the short distance less than 10 km from these sewage treatment plants to section 201 there is limited degradation of pollutants which leading to a larger contribution rate besides sewage treatment plants rural living sources and agricultural sources are largest pollutant sources in the bajiaojing community in addition through investigation and analysis the concentrated distribution of industries in the basin is the main factor responsible for the high contribution rate of cod and nh4 n in xinshi town and xiaode town the xinshi town located in deyang city plays an important role in industry with an area of only 59 7 square kilometers but there are 39 large scale enterprises involving glass industry chemical building materials processing and other industries from the perspective of the river basin regions that contribute rates more than 4 to cod tp and nh4 n are mainly concentrated in the mianyuan river and shiting river the large number of factories the concentration of population as well as the high density of cities led to the direct discharge of industrial and domestic garbage and untreated sewage into the water body thus increasing the pollution load of cod tp and nh4 n 3 3 monthly and seasonal contribution rates analysis 3 3 1 contribution rates of different pollution sources to better understand the influences of sources the contribution rate in different months to section 201 was carried out fig 10 shows the contribution rate varies with months and presents a corresponding change trend with the growth of months due to the influence of rainfall and human activities in the basin the monthly contribution rate of cod and nh4 n of each pollution source tends to be consistent in general sewage treatment plants industrial sewage urban living sources agricultural sources and rural living sources are the main sources of cod and nh4 n in the respective month the sewage treatment plants and industrial sewage are point sources other three sources are non point sources from spring to summer range from march to august the main pollution sources of water quality gradually shift from point sources to non point sources which are just the opposite in the second half of the year the total contribution rate of urban living point sources rural living sources and agricultural sources accounts for a large proportion from april to september but relatively low in remaining months the total contribution rate of cod and nh4 n of the three above sources shows an upward trend from january to july with the maximum value corresponding to 84 and 92 in july and a downward trend from august to december presenting a slight overall change except for december in addition the change of pollution contribution rate of industrial enterprises and sewage treatment plants shows an opposite trend which presents a significant trend of a rise first followed by a decline with the minimum value in july and a significant increase in december cod 88 nh4 n 87 these could be summed up to three water periods of the tuojiang river basin the dry season from january to april and december wet season from june to september and normal season the may october and november contribution rates of different pollution sources in three water periods are shown in fig 11 in dry season sewage treatment plants and industrial enterprises are recognized as the main sources of cod and nh4 n with a contribution rate of 58 02 and 53 08 followed by rural and urban living sources 30 00 35 76 during wet season the impact of rural and urban sources on cod and nh4 n is relatively significant with contribution rates of 30 and 40 respectively compared with the dry season the contribution rate of industrial enterprises is significantly reduced while the contribution rate of agricultural sources has increased slightly in the normal season rural and urban living sources are still predominant among all pollution sources affecting cod and nh4 n accounting for 51 9 and 60 36 respectively in conclusion the pollution load of point sources to cod and nh4 n during the three water periods follows the following order of magnitude dry season normal season wet season while non point sources are just the opposite showing the characteristics of wet season normal season dry season besides it is not difficult to find that the contribution rates of main pollution sources in each water period are in accordance with that in months analyzed above which mainly due to the influence of rainfall and human activities previous researches showed that in the month when rainfall is concentrated the surface runoff generated due to the heavy rainfall carries more organic pollutants from farmland urban and rural life into the water body which increases the pollution load of cod and nh4 n in the water body gao et al 2014 on the other hand climate change will influence the pollution discharging characteristics for example the temperature is higher in summer causing an increase of water consumption of residents life and agricultural irrigation and the agricultural fertilization which makes the amount of cod and nh4 n flowing into the river increase wu et al 2012 in winter january and december the water consumption will decrease relative leading to less loads of resident living sources while the amount of industrial sewage produced in each month is relatively stable sarker et al 2013 the above two aspects are the reasons responsible for the increase of pollution contribution of urban living sources rural living and agricultural sources in the summer and autumn it is obvious from fig 11 that agricultural production plays a leading role in tp in the respective month with a contribution rate higher from april to november but significantly lower in january and december the contribution rate of agricultural sources increases first and then decreases which presents an increase from 14 99 to 69 73 from january to august and a decrease from 61 36 to 14 96 from september to december for the view of water periods it is clear that the agricultural sources are the major influencing factor for tp among all the pollution sources in the wet season 66 55 and normal season 59 29 sewage treatment plants are the largest sources for tp in the dry season with 37 83 distinguishingly the phosphogypsum storage yard plays an important role for generating tp with more than 5 contribution rates this change above is mainly due to the fact that periods from may to august are the time of farming with frequent agricultural activities and abundant rainfall which bring a large amount of phosphorus element into the river while in winter from december to february next year agricultural activities are greatly reduced and precipitation is relatively low leading to a significantly weak influence on tp of agriculture the contribution rate of industrial enterprises and urban living sources is low which shows a change trend opposite to that of agricultural sources 3 3 2 contribution rates of different administrative regions according to the contribution rates analysis of different pollutant sources in different time we suppose that contribution rates of different regions in different periods were various the monthly and different water periods contribution rates of cod nh4 n and tp were calculated out as shown in figs 12 15 it can be clearly seen that most of the townships have a monthly contribution rate less than 2 and almost 3 5 regions with a contribution rate greater than 6 space distribution characteristics and time changing trends of monthly contribution rates in different regions of the cod nh4 n and tp are similar these larger contribution regions are mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of shiting river and mianyuan river in deyang city from january to december there are two regions the bajiaoming community and the xinshi town in fig 7 continually have the largest contribution rates to the cod nh4 n and tp the contribution rates of these larger regions present inversely proportional to rainfall fig 16 shows the month average rainfall and contribution rates of the three regions for bajiaojing community the contribution rates to cod tp and nh4 n are 43 6 53 2 and 34 4 in january which are almost 5 time more than the second region from january to august there is a reduced trend in contribution rates of these regions with the reduction trends the contribution rates of the three regions are almost the same range from 3 to 5 in august along with the rainfall reducing from august to september the contribution rates are gradually increased we have used the pearson s correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between rainfall and contribution rate zounemat kermani et al 2016 results show that the correlation coefficients between monthly precipitation and contribution rates of cod tp and nh4 n are 0 746 0 69 and 0 71 it is indicated that there is a strong negative correlation between monthly precipitation and contribution rates in dry season such as the spring and winter the precipitation and agricultural activities in the basin decrease significantly causing small domestic and agricultural organic pollution into the water body therefore main pollutant sources are regions with more industrial enterprises and sewage treatment plants which leads to the bajiaoming community and xinshi town become the two biggest source of pollution while in wet season the surface runoff generated by the rainfall bring abundant non point source pollutants shi et al 2017 it reduces the contribution of point sources and make contribution rate of regions to be little difference with this results suggestion that reducing the discharge concentration of sewage treatment plants and roundly controlling industrial enterprise sewage in the dry season is effective for water management of section 201 at bajiaoming community and xinshi town meanwhile the control of fertilization to reduce agricultural non point source and the implementation of rain and sewage diversion to decrease domestic life source are helpful for water quality management in the wet season 4 conclusion with water quality model and contaminate flux variation method we have make a refined pollution sources apportionment and quantify contribution rates of seven types pollution sources to section 201 field verifications show that methods used in this paper are suitable for more precise sources apportionment our results demonstrated that the rural living sources urban living sources sewage treatment plants agricultural planting sources and industrial sewage are mainly the annual average pollution sources of the section 201 in different seasons the biggest rates come from different pollutant sources the bajiaoming community and the xinshi town should be responsible for the pollution in section 201 during the whole year especially in the dry season as to bajiaojing community with big sewage treatment plants the contribution rates to cod tp and nh4 n are over 30 moreover results indicated that the precipitation has a greater negative influence on cod and nh4 n than tp precipitation increased non point sources and runoff which will enhance the degradation of point sources as a result in the wet season the contribution rates of point sources will reduce but which of non point sources will increase overall the research of this paper finds out the contribution rates of the water quality section at different time which is helpful to the management recently delicacy management gradually became the most important mode of water environment management in this situation there are more situation that the model provided in this paper can be used such as targeted treatment of environmental pollution source tracing for water pollution and other demands for

4370,exploring the responsibility subject of water pollution is the foundation of ecological environmental control and protection a water pollution sources apportionment and contribution rates analysis method based on one dimensional model was developed it was adopted in a typical trans boundary river section in the sub watershed of the yangtze river basin the contribution rates of different time period and distinctive administrative regions of the section were calculated results show that urban living point sources contributed most to chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n followed by rural living sources agricultural sources are the main pollution source of total phosphorus tp throughout the year almost seven township regions in deyang city especially the bajiaojing community and xinshi town should be mainly responsible for water pollution however in different month and water periods contribution rates change along with the precipitation variability sewage treatment plants and industrial enterprises contributed the most to pollutants in the dry season but the living sources and non point agricultural sources have bigger contribution rates in the wet season there is a strong negative correlation between precipitation and contribution rate methods adopted in this paper can be used to analyze the pollution sources in the refined management of the water environment so as to trace the main body of environmental responsibility keywords sources apportionment water quality model river pollution section yangtze river basin 1 introduction water pollution is one of the major issues of global attention the total maximum daily loads tmdl in the usa the eu water framework directive wfd and the water pollutant total control in china are typical policies for total amount control of environmental pollution cao et al 2015 in these policies the core work is producing pollutant emissions inventory based on source apportionment for pollutants control however with the rapid development of social economy especially the industrial development and urban expansion sources of water pollutants become more diverse and complex haji gholizadeh et al 2016 this makes it more difficult to carry out sources apportionment for water pollution sources apportionment originates from the atmospheric field and has been applied to the water environment and soil fields for many years lu et al 2018 various technical methods can be used to qualitatively identify different sources of water pollutants and the contribution rate of each pollutant will be quantitatively calculated for sources apportionment nazeer et al 2016 the common sources apportionment represents the percentage of a certain pollution load in the total pollution loads on a region or basin haji gholizadeh et al 2016 in this field many methods have been put forward and could be divided into two categories qualitative identification and quantitative calculation chen et al 2013 kumari and tripathi 2014 the qualitative identification method is used for pollutants sources types and locations ascertaining for example a linear correlations was used to estimate the source of amine oxidation in water without calculating it explicitly which only provided the source where pollutants coming from but no specific contribution rates b√§cktorp et al 2015 the quantitative calculation method such as pollutant discharge coefficient method and non point source models can be used for pollutant emission loads computing uranishi et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 with these methods the inflow flux of pollutant sources could be detected on a large scale especially in china there were two national censuses of pollution sources the first pollution source census was conducted in 2007 which produced more than 1 1 billion sets of data wang et al 2016b the second census began on december 31 2017 and lasted for the whole year of 2018 in this new general survey of pollution source all pollution from industrial production agriculture family activities and other sources is covered a large number of data for analysis of water pollution sources have been obtained in this survey which will provide reliable information about the total amount and proportion of different pollution sources as the fine scale management carried out in the action of yangtze river protection detailed information about what is the biggest pollutant source to special water sections should be explored cao et al 2015 while the usual sources apportionment methods are difficult to obtain these information it is indispensable to control pollutants by analyzing contribution rate of pollution sources to specific monitoring sections or monitoring points many quantitative calculation methods have been put forward for sources apportionment recently such as the receptor model lu et al 2018 qu et al 2021 uranishi et al 2017 the non point source model ouyang et al 2018 wellen et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 and the water quality model bai et al 2018 hoos et al 2019 li et al 2011 li and zhang 2011 liu et al 2019 the receptor model is a statistical model which is based on the comparison and correlation analysis between the composition characteristics of a certain section and pollution sources the multivariate statistical analysis and chemical mass balance cmb models are commonly used as receptor models gokhale et al 2008 lu et al 2018 steiger et al 1990 it is assumed that the mass of particulate matter remains unchanged during the transport from the source to the recipient in many receptor models which are not suitable for big scale sources apportionment haji gholizadeh et al 2016 massoudieh and kayhanian 2013 other more receptor models are difficult to compute contribution rate of pollutant at different time periods the non point source model is used for the calculation of land pollutants loads but it is difficult to calculate the contribution rate of each source to the recipient pollutants results of which are always treated as input conditions for water quality models water quality models can be used to simulate the migration process of pollutants in rivers after the emission of pollution sources cao et al 2015 prabodanie et al 2010 on the basis of simulating pollutant concentration with water quality model scenario simulation method should be proposed to estimate the contribution rate guan et al 2013 in the scenario simulation method assume scenarios such as pollution source removal scenario based on the actual scenario the pollution source additional scenario based on the scenario without sources wang et al 2017 by comparing the contaminants flux between different scenarios the difference value of contaminants will be treated as the pollutant load from removal or additional source for the special section the contribution rate can be obtained from the rate of the difference value to the total contaminants flux in the special section the scenario simulation method ignores the influence of mixed pollutants on pollutant degradation otherwise if there are thousands of sources there will be a heavy computational burden this makes it also unsuitable for the contribution rate analysis in large scale river basins as the requirement of refined management of the water environment many river basins in china need to carry out water quality target management on some river sections at basin scale based on abundant pollutant sources data obtained in the national census of pollution sources an important task of the current water environment is to make refined sources apportionment and quantify their contribution rates to target river sections to achieve this we proposed a new contaminant flux variation method based on a water quality model to calculation the contribution rates from different sources to typical state controlled and intercity assessment sections the yangtze river is the biggest river basin with complicating water environment in china there are abundant of different pollutant sources around the basin strong spatial heterogeneity exists among the main stream and more than 700 tributary gao et al 2018 one policy for one river especially the fine and targeted environmental governance has become the most important strategy under the background of the yangtze river protection strategy therefore a typical tributary of yangtze river basin has been selected for sources apportionment 2 methods and materials 2 1 contaminant flux variation methods in order to calculate the contribution rate of pollution sources in the certain section pollution flux at the certain section generated by different sources should be identified pollutants are transported to rivers from land sources by advection and degradation nukazawa et al 2018 advection moves the mass downstream and diffusion spreads it out making it less concentrated for many rivers the calculation of water quality can be simplified to one dimensional water quality problem there are several well known models such as qual2k mike11 efdc and wasp which can be used for one dimensional water quality simulation for pollution sources the pollutant flux from point sources is relatively stable but non point sources are obviously affected by precipitation in one year a one dimensional model suitable for unsteady flow and water quality simulation in complex river network areas has been developed and used for pollutants transport simulation however water quality models could simulate the pollutant concentration at different river sections or river elements but it is still difficult to distinguish how much discharge comes from special river sections with different sources it is assumed that there are several pollution sources that contribute to the contaminants in the receptor and the pollutants emitted by each pollution source do not interact with each other but are reduced due to degradation sedimentation and other processes according to the law of conservation of mass the contaminants concentration in the receptor of sampling points can be regarded as a linear sum of the contaminants concentrations from various major pollution sources based on this premise the core of the contribution rates is to calculate the amount of retained contaminants after transporting from each pollution source to the specific section in other words it is necessary to determine how much pollutants will be reduced from each pollution source to a specific section assuming that the pollutants discharged from all pollution sources are uniformly mixed from the previous calculation unit to the next calculation unit the diffusion and degradation effects of pollutants from different pollution sources in the same calculation unit should be the same which can be described by a comprehensive loss coefficient k therefore the contaminants degradation amount of all calculation units in the upstream of a specific section can be calculated first and then the degradation amount can be evenly distributed to all pollution sources the pollutant leaving their sources will reach the specific section through the river network and pass through three types of a b c calculation units fig 1 as shown in fig 1 river channel calculation units can be divided into three categories a b and c category a represents the calculation unit with pollution source inflow category b represents the calculation unit without pollution source inflow it is not located at the intersection of the main stream and tributaries category c represents the calculation unit at the intersection of the main stream and tributaries through the water quality model the inflow and outflow flow and concentration of each calculation unit were simulated the pollutant reduction of each calculation unit can be expressed as a Œ¥ m a c in q in c up q up c out q out b Œ¥ m b c up q up c out q out c Œ¥ m c c u p 1 q u p 1 c u p 2 q u p 2 c out q out in which Œ¥ m a Œ¥ m b and Œ¥ m c represent the pollutant reduction of calculation unit type a b and c respectively cup mg l and qup m3 s represent the contaminants concentration and flux of the upstream flow of the calculation unit cout mg l and qout m3 s represent the concentration and pollutant flux at the outlet of the calculation unit cin mg l and qin m3 s stand for the concentration and flux discharged by pollution sources in calculation unit accordingly the pollutant reduction amount of each calculation unit can be obtained at a certain time on this basis it is only necessary to calculate the number of all pollution sources upstream of each calculation unit accordingly the contribution rate of pollution sources to a certain section can be obtained for calculating the remaining contaminants flux and its proportion which can be expressed as follows 1 q si m si j 1 n k j k j Œ¥ m j i n j p si q si q where qsi m3 is the pollutant flux of the pollution source si at the target section q m3 is the total pollutant flux at the target section psi is the contribution rate of the pollution source si Œ¥ m j m3 is the total pollutant reduction amount of the calculation unit j k j is the loss coefficient of pollution sources in the calculation unit j inj is the total amount of pollutant flow into unit j including upstream inputs and side inputs msi m3 is the pollutant load of pollution source si and n is the number of calculation units from the pollution source si to the target section according to the above formula the pollution contribution rate at different times can be obtained to calculate the contribution rate of pollution in a certain time period the psi in formula 1 can be expressed as follows 2 p si t 1 nt q sit Œ¥ t t 1 nt q t Œ¥ t where t is the time nt is the total number of output time steps Œ¥ t is the output time step qsit is the pollutant flux of pollution source si at the target section at time t and qt is the total pollutant flux at the target section at time t what needs illustration is that the method is more suitable in the following situations 1 slow flow rivers whose flow velocity is less than 5 m s 2 shallow rivers whose water depth is less than 10 m 3 narrow rivers whose surface width is less than 1000 m 2 2 study areas and data sources the tuojiang river basin with length of 627 4 km and area of 25 576 km2 mainly located in sichuan province is an important tributary affecting the water quantity and quality of the yangtze river zhou et al 2020 the whole tuojiang river basin covers 10 cities in sichuan province including chengdu zigong luzhou deyang mianyang neijiang leshan meishan yibin and ziyang fig 2 the population of tuojiang rvier basin at the year end of 2018 is over 22 million among them 80 are agricultural population the area of the tuojiang river basin is about 5 percent territory of the sichuan province but it supports more than 30 8 percent of the total economy and more than 26 2 percent of the population in recent years with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization over 1600 point sources including industrial enterprises large scale farms urban living point sources have been set up following with generally water environment quality declination of tuojiang river basin wang et al 2020 the water environment of the tuojiang river basin is affected by the various factors which is a typical representative of the compound pollution of the water environment in china wang et al 2016a almost 80 of water quality control sections are exceeding standards in water quality especially the total phosphorus tp concentration 0 2 mg l in the dry seasons to figure out the contribution of pollution sources to water quality control sections is the primary task of water environmental protection among water quality stations the section 201 at the intersection between deyang and chengdu is a key section of the state control the section 201 is located in the confluence of three large tributaries of tuojiang including the mianyuan river shiting river and yazi river it is one of sections with the most complex external environment in tuojiang river basin it is important and representative to promote the sources apportionment of the tuojiang river basin by studying deeply on section 201 fig 2 as showed in fig 2 a large number of pollution sources are distributed in the upstream of section 201 including various point sources meanwhile non point sources such as agricultural production and aquaculture in the region are also very complicated to carry out water quality management of section 201 and control upstream pollution sources it is necessary to clarify the pollution sources of section 201 and determine the main pollution sources as well as their contribution rate monitoring data such as pollution sources data water quality monitoring data hydrology data were provided by the sichuan academy of environmental sciences and sichuan ecological environment monitoring station the other data such as geographic data river network data and meteorological data were obtained from national geomatics center of china http www ngcc cn ngcc and the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 3 model developed 2 3 1 river network structure on the basis of the census of pollution sources in the tuojiang river basin an one dimensional river network water quality model based on the one dimensional mode of efdc was constructed as showed in fig 2 tuojiang river together with 5 tributaries with a total length of 352 km has been set for the model simulation the river network was divided into 9 reaches and 734 computing units the river structure in the one dimensional model is shown in fig 3 2 3 2 boundary condition and scenarios setting as shown in fig 3 there are five headwaters and one downstream boundary daily measured water flow data from the hydrology stations and monthly measured pollutant concentration data from the water quality stations near headwaters were used as input flow conditions daily measured water level data from the hyd1 hydrology station were set as downstream conditions as shown in fig 4 the model calculation time was from january to december 2019 with time step 10 s the chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp which concerned by the regulators were simulated as water quality indicators pollutant loads from 453 point sources and non point sources obtained in the second census were used as lateral boundary conditions point sources including industrial sewage sewage treatment plants large scale livestock and poultry farms and phosphogypsum stock dumps were imputed into the model with daily constant value non point sources including urban living sources rural living sources agricultural sources livestock and poultry breeding sources and aquaculture sources were distributed to different towns according to the proportion of their areas considering the time differentiation the non point sources loads were apportioned to every day based on the average daily rainfall during the whole year in 2019 total loads of different pollutants sources are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification hydrological and water quality validation were made by comparing the simulated results and measured data the coefficient of determination r2 was used for model evaluation 3 1 1 hydrological validation the measured water level of hyd2 and water flow of hyd1 near the section 201 was selected for hydrodynamic calibration and validation the final validation results of water level and water flow were shown in fig 5 from the simulation results of water level it can be seen that the hydrodynamic model can simulate the overall water level and water flow change trend of tuojiang river both of the r2 were above 0 8 which indicated that the model could simulate the change process of hydrodynamic 3 1 2 water quality validation the daily simulated results of cod tp and nh4 n and measured data of section 201 were selected for water quality verification as shown in fig 6 the r2 between simulated results and measured data of the section 201 bj sjq and sq stations were used for model verification as shown in fig 7 from the above figures it can be seen that the model can simulate the water quality changing process on the main stream of the tuojiang river the r2 of average pollutants concentration at these four water quality stations were over 0 65 it indicated that the simulated data fit well with the measured data the model performance in the three indicators is different for the reason that the phosphorus is a kind of sedimentary type pollutant it is hard to measured and simulated the phenomenon that the concentration of tp on december 1 is greatly increased was not simulated as shown in fig 6 otherwise the value of cod has a rather great fluctuation which is also relatively hard to simulate these caused that the fitting results of cod and tp are worse than that of nh4 n overall results of model verification indicated that the model can be used for the water quality contribution rate simulation in this paper 3 2 yearly contribution rates analysis 3 2 1 contribution rates of different pollution sources identifying the sources of water pollutants is the first step for efficient water quality management yang et al 2013 according to model results we have calculated contribution rates of nine different sources to section 201 in the whole year 2019 as shown in the fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8 the primary pollution sources of three water quality parameters are different rural living point sources urban living point sources sewage treatment plants agricultural sources and industrial sewage are the main pollutant sources of cod and nh4 n for cod to rural living sources takes the largest contribution rate with a contribution rate of 37 13 followed by urban living sources sewage treatment plants agricultural sources and industrial sewage with contribution rates 20 18 15 13 14 75 and 10 05 respectively among them rural living sources and urban living sources contribute cod over 57 the dense population caused in daily life generates most of the cod pollutants this result ties well with previous studies wherein rural nps pollution yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the nh4 n shows a same characteristics as cod the rural living sources produced 37 57 nh4 n followed with the urban living sources agricultural sources sewage treatment plants and industrial treatment with corresponding contribution rates of 27 64 14 9 10 01 and 9 6 respectively similar results have been reported by previous studies which described that the city expanding and extensive population growth have brought a lot of emissions on nh4 n and cod kringel et al 2016 su et al 2011 the main sources is varying with time changing in the early age of 21st century with field investigations and observations data researchers have found that medium sized and small rivers have been seriously polluted by industrial and domestic sewage animal manures chemical fertilizers in farmland and polluted sediments chen et al 2002 for the past few years along with the development of point sources control the nonpoint source pollution was becoming the major contributor to the total input of pollutants into the rivers chen et al 2019 especially the tp which is different from the other two pollutant indexes agricultural sources act as the dominant factor for tp with a contribution rate of 56 46 rural living sources with the corresponding contribution rate of 12 98 are the second largest sources of tp specially the phosphogypsum stock dumps discharged 6 62 of the tp the phosphorus p is one of the most important mineral nutrients in agricultural systems and is generally the most limiting nutrient for plant production hart et al 2004 with the deepening of water pollution control in the tuojiang river basin the problem of tp from agricultural and rural non point source pollution has gradually become prominent 3 2 2 contribution rates of different administrative regions besides identifying the different pollution sources of water pollutants for water environment management to find out the administrative region who should deserve the blame of pollution is the basis for pollution abatement of government according to the analysis results regions with higher pollution contribution rate are mainly concentrated in deyang city which presents a similar spatial distribution of higher contribution regions for three pollutant indexes as shown in fig 9 the bajiaojing community in deyang city has the largest contribution to three pollutants the second and the third largest contribution regions to three pollutants are also the same while the other regions whose contribution rates crs to different pollutants are different fig 9 presents that contribution rates of most regions are widespread less than 2 the bajiaojing community contributes pollutants far more than other regions contribution rates of the bajiaojing community to cod tp and nh4 n are 13 11 6 and 8 8 respectively it is almost 1 6 km from the bajiaojing community to section 201 along the mianyuan river across two towns different from others regions there are three sewage treatment plants located in the bajiaojing community located along with the mianyuan river from north to south it is indicated that most pollutants in the bajiaojing community are produced by sewage treatment plants with 84 9 for cod 88 48 for tp and 72 7 for nh4 n respectively in china urbanization has quickened its step and brought water quality problems to protect the water environment fundamental facilities e g sewage networks and sewage treatment plants have been built up in a lot of villages and towns li and zhang 2011 it was proved that sewage treatment plants play an important role in controlling pollutant discharges to surface waters and will improve the pollution abatement gatidou et al 2019 mao et al 2016 through investigation we have found that most of the sewage treatment plants stps in tuojiang river basin discharge wastewater according to the primary standard a in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb19818 2002 based on this standard the emission concentration of cod tp and nh4 n is 50 mg l 0 5 mg l and 8 mg l this discharge standard is of great difference with the basic water quality management standards of china the surface water quality standard of gb3838 2002 state environment protection bureau of china 2002 in the surface water quality standard there are five water quality standard types from type i to type v type v is the worst that indicates water is seriously polluted in which the concentration of cod tp and nh4 n is 40 mg l 0 4 mg l and 2 0 mg l the type iii with standard concentration of cod tp and nh4 n is set to 20 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l has been set as water quality management objectives the emission concentration of cod tp and nh4 n in wastewater treatment plants may be 2 or 5 times more than the water quality target concentration the wastewater treatment plants collect wastewater and discharge treated sewage to the river yarahmadi et al 2018 compared to wastewater before the collection and processing the water quality concentration is reduced but the total amount of pollutant is tremendously increased which may beyond the self purification capacity of rivers as a result the stps become the biggest sources of pollutants discharged into surface water xiao et al 2018 for the bajiaojing community as the short distance less than 10 km from these sewage treatment plants to section 201 there is limited degradation of pollutants which leading to a larger contribution rate besides sewage treatment plants rural living sources and agricultural sources are largest pollutant sources in the bajiaojing community in addition through investigation and analysis the concentrated distribution of industries in the basin is the main factor responsible for the high contribution rate of cod and nh4 n in xinshi town and xiaode town the xinshi town located in deyang city plays an important role in industry with an area of only 59 7 square kilometers but there are 39 large scale enterprises involving glass industry chemical building materials processing and other industries from the perspective of the river basin regions that contribute rates more than 4 to cod tp and nh4 n are mainly concentrated in the mianyuan river and shiting river the large number of factories the concentration of population as well as the high density of cities led to the direct discharge of industrial and domestic garbage and untreated sewage into the water body thus increasing the pollution load of cod tp and nh4 n 3 3 monthly and seasonal contribution rates analysis 3 3 1 contribution rates of different pollution sources to better understand the influences of sources the contribution rate in different months to section 201 was carried out fig 10 shows the contribution rate varies with months and presents a corresponding change trend with the growth of months due to the influence of rainfall and human activities in the basin the monthly contribution rate of cod and nh4 n of each pollution source tends to be consistent in general sewage treatment plants industrial sewage urban living sources agricultural sources and rural living sources are the main sources of cod and nh4 n in the respective month the sewage treatment plants and industrial sewage are point sources other three sources are non point sources from spring to summer range from march to august the main pollution sources of water quality gradually shift from point sources to non point sources which are just the opposite in the second half of the year the total contribution rate of urban living point sources rural living sources and agricultural sources accounts for a large proportion from april to september but relatively low in remaining months the total contribution rate of cod and nh4 n of the three above sources shows an upward trend from january to july with the maximum value corresponding to 84 and 92 in july and a downward trend from august to december presenting a slight overall change except for december in addition the change of pollution contribution rate of industrial enterprises and sewage treatment plants shows an opposite trend which presents a significant trend of a rise first followed by a decline with the minimum value in july and a significant increase in december cod 88 nh4 n 87 these could be summed up to three water periods of the tuojiang river basin the dry season from january to april and december wet season from june to september and normal season the may october and november contribution rates of different pollution sources in three water periods are shown in fig 11 in dry season sewage treatment plants and industrial enterprises are recognized as the main sources of cod and nh4 n with a contribution rate of 58 02 and 53 08 followed by rural and urban living sources 30 00 35 76 during wet season the impact of rural and urban sources on cod and nh4 n is relatively significant with contribution rates of 30 and 40 respectively compared with the dry season the contribution rate of industrial enterprises is significantly reduced while the contribution rate of agricultural sources has increased slightly in the normal season rural and urban living sources are still predominant among all pollution sources affecting cod and nh4 n accounting for 51 9 and 60 36 respectively in conclusion the pollution load of point sources to cod and nh4 n during the three water periods follows the following order of magnitude dry season normal season wet season while non point sources are just the opposite showing the characteristics of wet season normal season dry season besides it is not difficult to find that the contribution rates of main pollution sources in each water period are in accordance with that in months analyzed above which mainly due to the influence of rainfall and human activities previous researches showed that in the month when rainfall is concentrated the surface runoff generated due to the heavy rainfall carries more organic pollutants from farmland urban and rural life into the water body which increases the pollution load of cod and nh4 n in the water body gao et al 2014 on the other hand climate change will influence the pollution discharging characteristics for example the temperature is higher in summer causing an increase of water consumption of residents life and agricultural irrigation and the agricultural fertilization which makes the amount of cod and nh4 n flowing into the river increase wu et al 2012 in winter january and december the water consumption will decrease relative leading to less loads of resident living sources while the amount of industrial sewage produced in each month is relatively stable sarker et al 2013 the above two aspects are the reasons responsible for the increase of pollution contribution of urban living sources rural living and agricultural sources in the summer and autumn it is obvious from fig 11 that agricultural production plays a leading role in tp in the respective month with a contribution rate higher from april to november but significantly lower in january and december the contribution rate of agricultural sources increases first and then decreases which presents an increase from 14 99 to 69 73 from january to august and a decrease from 61 36 to 14 96 from september to december for the view of water periods it is clear that the agricultural sources are the major influencing factor for tp among all the pollution sources in the wet season 66 55 and normal season 59 29 sewage treatment plants are the largest sources for tp in the dry season with 37 83 distinguishingly the phosphogypsum storage yard plays an important role for generating tp with more than 5 contribution rates this change above is mainly due to the fact that periods from may to august are the time of farming with frequent agricultural activities and abundant rainfall which bring a large amount of phosphorus element into the river while in winter from december to february next year agricultural activities are greatly reduced and precipitation is relatively low leading to a significantly weak influence on tp of agriculture the contribution rate of industrial enterprises and urban living sources is low which shows a change trend opposite to that of agricultural sources 3 3 2 contribution rates of different administrative regions according to the contribution rates analysis of different pollutant sources in different time we suppose that contribution rates of different regions in different periods were various the monthly and different water periods contribution rates of cod nh4 n and tp were calculated out as shown in figs 12 15 it can be clearly seen that most of the townships have a monthly contribution rate less than 2 and almost 3 5 regions with a contribution rate greater than 6 space distribution characteristics and time changing trends of monthly contribution rates in different regions of the cod nh4 n and tp are similar these larger contribution regions are mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of shiting river and mianyuan river in deyang city from january to december there are two regions the bajiaoming community and the xinshi town in fig 7 continually have the largest contribution rates to the cod nh4 n and tp the contribution rates of these larger regions present inversely proportional to rainfall fig 16 shows the month average rainfall and contribution rates of the three regions for bajiaojing community the contribution rates to cod tp and nh4 n are 43 6 53 2 and 34 4 in january which are almost 5 time more than the second region from january to august there is a reduced trend in contribution rates of these regions with the reduction trends the contribution rates of the three regions are almost the same range from 3 to 5 in august along with the rainfall reducing from august to september the contribution rates are gradually increased we have used the pearson s correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between rainfall and contribution rate zounemat kermani et al 2016 results show that the correlation coefficients between monthly precipitation and contribution rates of cod tp and nh4 n are 0 746 0 69 and 0 71 it is indicated that there is a strong negative correlation between monthly precipitation and contribution rates in dry season such as the spring and winter the precipitation and agricultural activities in the basin decrease significantly causing small domestic and agricultural organic pollution into the water body therefore main pollutant sources are regions with more industrial enterprises and sewage treatment plants which leads to the bajiaoming community and xinshi town become the two biggest source of pollution while in wet season the surface runoff generated by the rainfall bring abundant non point source pollutants shi et al 2017 it reduces the contribution of point sources and make contribution rate of regions to be little difference with this results suggestion that reducing the discharge concentration of sewage treatment plants and roundly controlling industrial enterprise sewage in the dry season is effective for water management of section 201 at bajiaoming community and xinshi town meanwhile the control of fertilization to reduce agricultural non point source and the implementation of rain and sewage diversion to decrease domestic life source are helpful for water quality management in the wet season 4 conclusion with water quality model and contaminate flux variation method we have make a refined pollution sources apportionment and quantify contribution rates of seven types pollution sources to section 201 field verifications show that methods used in this paper are suitable for more precise sources apportionment our results demonstrated that the rural living sources urban living sources sewage treatment plants agricultural planting sources and industrial sewage are mainly the annual average pollution sources of the section 201 in different seasons the biggest rates come from different pollutant sources the bajiaoming community and the xinshi town should be responsible for the pollution in section 201 during the whole year especially in the dry season as to bajiaojing community with big sewage treatment plants the contribution rates to cod tp and nh4 n are over 30 moreover results indicated that the precipitation has a greater negative influence on cod and nh4 n than tp precipitation increased non point sources and runoff which will enhance the degradation of point sources as a result in the wet season the contribution rates of point sources will reduce but which of non point sources will increase overall the research of this paper finds out the contribution rates of the water quality section at different time which is helpful to the management recently delicacy management gradually became the most important mode of water environment management in this situation there are more situation that the model provided in this paper can be used such as targeted treatment of environmental pollution source tracing for water pollution and other demands for

4371,simplified versions of the shallow water equations known as kinematic and diffusive models are commonly applied to the analysis of debris and mud flow dynamics for this reason the study of their applicability conditions represents an important concern the present work investigates on the applicability conditions of the diffusive wave model dwm for the prediction of mud flows of shear thinning fluid represented by a power law rheology the study has been carried out through the numerical solution of the dwm and the full wave model fwm in unsteady conditions with hydrographs of different durations assigned at the channel inlet the analysis has considered different rheological indexes several values of the froude f and of the kinematic wave k numbers predictions of dwm and fdm have been compared considering the mean value of dimensionless errors on maximum flow depth Œµ h and maximum discharge Œµ q positive negative error leads to an overestimation underestimation of the maximum flow depth and flow discharge in the prediction of the dwm in the present analysis the dwm is considered safely applicable in case of underestimation i e for positive values of Œµ h and Œµ q negative errors are acceptable if their absolute value is smaller than 5 for all the investigated values of the governing parameters the performance of the dwm has been found to strongly depend on the value of the rheological index worsening as the fluid rheology becomes more shear thinning regardless of the hydrograph duration and for fixed power law exponent n and f values results indicate the existence of limiting values of the kinematic wave number k h and k q above which the dwm is applicable in terms of maximum depth and discharge respectively for k values smaller than k h and k q the dwm applicability depends also on the hydrograph duration in these conditions and for several values of the f n pair the threshold values of the hydrograph duration necessary for dwm applicability have been identified the presented applicability criteria represent a useful guideline for the practical application of the dwm in assessing the hazard of a mud flood keywords mud flow power law rheology shear thinning fluid diffusive wave model unsteady flow 1 introduction debris and mud flows involve fast moving mixtures of water with great volumes of sediment typically they develop in mountain areas triggered by heavy rains hutter et al 1994 iverson and denlinger 2001 particularly after wildfires rengers et al 2016 since they reduce the surface water storage benavides solorio and macdonald 2005 and promote the infiltration of the rain decreasing the canopy interception stoof et al 2012 debris and mud flows may produce huge damages and loss of lives hurlimann et al 2006 di et al 2008 and cause dramatic changes of the topography the river morphology brown and pasternack 2014 and even the coastal areas ciervo et al 2015 owing to their destructive power these flows have high socio economic impacts fuchs et al 2007 thiene et al 2017 and therefore the definition of appropriate mathematical models for predicting their impact is crucial the selection of the most adequate model for the debris and mud flows analysis implies a choice among many available options a first approach assumes a single phase description of the flowing medium considered as a homogeneous continuum with a non newtonian behavior however the use of a constant rheology does not furnish accurate predictions for debris flows when temporal and spatial variations of the pore fluid pressure and mixture agitation occur or when mixture composition changes due to segregation of solid particles iverson 2003 alternative approaches are represented by quasi single phase mixture e g xia et al 2018 and two phase e g iverson 1997 pitman and le 2005 di cristo et al 2016 li et al 2018a 2018b models for instance iverson 1997 and iverson and denlinger 2001 proposed a coulomb mixture theory for debris flows which considers the interaction between the fluid phase assumed as a newtonian fluid and the granular solid which behaves as a coulomb fictional material greco et al 2019 compared the performance of two different depth integrated theoretical models single phase model spm and two phase model tpm in reproducing the impact of a mud flow on rigid obstacles to evaluate the force acting on them the two models show comparable results for the considered two dimensional test case while some differences are observed in simulating a 1d landslide over a very steep slope in the framework of the single phase models different formulations have been proposed some of them assume the existence of a yield stress such as bingham liu and mei 1989 imran et al 2001 hewitt and balmforth 2013 and herschel bulkley coussot 1997 huang and garcia 1998 chanson et al 2006 models conversely the power law model without the yield stress is often adopted for mud flows characterized by mixtures of fine sediment and water with a rheology strongly influenced by the quantity of the fine fraction in particular the shear thinning power law model characterized by an exponent lower than one is particularly adequate for flows with a finite fraction of coarse grains ng and mei 1994 hwang et al 1994 perazzo and gratton 2004 longo et al 2015 encountered for instance in natural estuaries zhang et al 2010 or during landslides carotenuto et al 2015 the power law model may also result preferable when the correct rheological characterization of a visco plastic fluid appears difficult ovarlez et al 2011 chambon et al 2014 although in several cases three dimensional effects are not negligible depth averaged models based on 2d shallow water equation swes are widely accepted for many engineering applications iverson and george 2014 fent et al 2018 such as for mud flows routing armanini et al 2014 rosatti and begnudelli 2013 di cristo et al 2020 moreover even though efficient numerical methods for the solution of the swes are currently available simplified models derived neglecting one or more terms in the momentum equation are often used among the approximate models we cite the widespread kinematic wave model kwm and diffusive wave model dwm in particular the dwm is usefully applied in flood modelling and rainfall runoff simulations aric√≤ et al 2011 caviedes voullieme et al 2020 but also coupled with sewage models martins et al 2017 in particular prestinizi 2008 tested the dwm for reproducing a dam break denoting that it is able to reproduce the principal features of the inundation as far as non newtonian fluids are concerned the comparison between the numerical results and laboratory experiments carried out with reference to bingham e g liu and mei 1989 herschel bulkley e g ancey et al 2012 and power law e g longo et al 2015 fluids suggests that the dwm may describe the essential features of a mud flow wave in particular longo et al 2015 analysed the performance of both kinematic and diffusive models in reproducing the laboratory experiments concerning the propagation of a power law fluid wave in channels theoretical solutions are obtained for inclined channel in self similar form for the dwm and with the method of characteristics for the kwm it has been shown that the theoretical solutions describe with sufficient accuracy the front propagation before the transition to longer roll waves simplified models have been successfully applied also for reproducing the dynamics of debris and mud flows o brien et al 1993 arattano and franzi 2010 chiang et al 2012 gregoretti et al 2016 2019 bernard et al 2019 in clear water turbulent flows the applicability conditions of both kinematic and diffusive models have been deeply studied either analysing their linearized version tsai 2003 or accounting for the non linear terms moramarco et al 2008ab aric√≤ and nasello 2018 zheng et al 2020 conversely the applicability conditions of the approximated models for mud flows were not so deeply analysed starting from the theoretical results of di cristo et al 2013a applicability criteria for some approximate models were deduced in di cristo et al 2014a di cristo et al 2014b for both a herschel bulkley and a power law rheology through an analysis of the linearized equations moreover in di cristo et al 2018a accounting for the non linear terms the applicability conditions of both kinematic and diffusive approximate models have been defined for a power law fluid studying the analytical solution of the steady problem applicability criteria have been derived in terms of two non dimensional parameters governing the problem the froude and kinematic wave numbers it has been also shown that the criteria deduced for clear water flows moramarco et al 2008a cannot be straightforwardly applied to mud flows for both diffusive and kinematic approximate models because they lead to non conservative predictions in particular for small power law index values di cristo et al 2018a a further analysis performed by di cristo et al 2019 comparing the unsteady numerical results of the fully non linear model with the corresponding ones deduced through the kwm has confirmed these conclusions in this unsteady analysis the criteria for the application of the kwm have been provided in terms of the hydrograph rising time the present paper extends the non linear unsteady analysis of di cristo et al 2019 to the dwm considering discharge hydrographs at the channel inlet characterized by different wave durations the objective is to provide applicability criteria of the dwm for a shear thinning power law fluid described by the model proposed by ng and mei 1994 in the study carried out through an unsteady numerical analysis of both the full and the diffusive wave models the performance of the dwm are evaluated considering the dimensionless error on the maximum flow depth and on the maximum discharge the paper is organized as follows section 2 reports the governing equations for the fwm and of the dwm and the adopted numerical methods section 3 illustrates the performed tests and the results of the comparison between the fwm and the dwm along with the obtained applicability criteria an exemplification of the proposed methodology is illustrated in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 unsteady analysis 2 1 full wave model a homogeneous layer of an incompressible shear thinning power law fluid flowing over a fixed bed with a constant inclination Œ∏ with respect to the horizontal plane without lateral inflow or outflow is investigated neglecting the surface tension and considering a laminar gradually varied flow where spatial variations occur over scales larger than flow depth so that flow resistance by the sidewalls is negligible with respect to that by the bottom the dimensional depth averaged mass and momentum conservation equations are ng and mei 1994 di cristo et al 2017 1 h t q x 0 2 q t Œ≤ x q 2 h g h h x cos Œ∏ g h sin Œ∏ œÑ b œÅ where t is the time x is the streamwise coordinate h the flow depth q the flow rate for unit of width g and œÅ the gravity and the fluid density respectively Œ≤ and œÑ b are the momentum correction factor and the bottom stress respectively in laminar regime the expressions of the momentum correction factor and of the bottom stress are ng and mei 1994 di cristo et al 2013b respectively 3 Œ≤ 2 2 n 1 3 n 2 1 4 œÑ b Œº n 2 n 1 n u h n being u q h the depth averaged velocity Œº n and n the consistency and the rheological index of the power law fluid respectively for shear thinning fluids the rheological index is smaller than one while values larger than one represent shear thickening fluids in the following only shear thinning fluids have been considered the following dimensionless variables are introduced 5 x x l h h h n q q q ref t t t ref where l is the dimensional channel length q ref is the reference flow rate for unit width and h n the corresponding dimensional normal i e uniform depth the reference time scale t ref is assumed equal to the kinematic wave channel travel time of the reference discharge moramarco et al 2008b 6 t ref l c kwm where c kwm denotes the dimensional celerity of the kinematic wave which for power law fluid reads di cristo et al 2018b 7 c kwm c kwm q ref h n w i t h c kwm 2 n

denotes the normal froude number and k the kinematic wave number whose expressions are 10 f q ref h n 3 2 g cos Œ∏ 11 k 1 f 2 l h n tan Œ∏ therefore as in the clear water case govindaraju et al 1988a 1988b moramarco et al 2008a for the power law fluids the problem is univocally defined through the two dimensionless numbers f k or equivalently f k f 2 as reported with more details in di cristo et al 2019 the system 8 9 has been numerically solved using an explicit first order euler scheme for the temporal discretization and a second order finite volume method for the spatial discretization 2 2 diffusive wave model the dwm is obtained neglecting in eq 9 the local and convective inertia terms represented by the first two terms at the l h s obtaining 12 h x k f 2 1 q n h 2 n 1 taking the spatial resp temporal derivative of eqs 8 resp of eq 12 the dwm may be rewritten into the advection diffusion form as follows 13 q t c q x v 2 q x 2 where the expressions of the advective velocity c and of the hydraulic diffusivity v are 14 c 2n 1 n q h v 1 nkf 2 h 2n 1 q n 1 the influence of the power law index value on both the advective velocity and the hydraulic diffusivity has been discussed through a linear analysis by di cristo et al 2018b and in the non linear conditions by pascal 1991 in studying the stability of power law fluid gravity flows of over a plane the dwm i e eqs 8 and 12 has been numerically solved in implicit way through a finite volume scheme the scheme is first order both in space and in time a newton raphson iterative procedure has been used to solve the non linear algebraic system 2 3 boundary conditions for both models a flow hydrograph is imposed as the upstream boundary condition whose duration t f is expressed as a multiple of the reference time scale i e t f m t ref so that the value of m assumed larger than one represents the dimensionless duration of the upstream hydrograph the hydrograph shape has been assigned accordingly to the following four parameters pearson type iii distribution moramarco et al 2008a di cristo et al 2019 15 q 0 t q p t 1 Œ≥ 1 e 1 t Œ≥ 1 where q p is the dimensionless peak discharge for unit width and Œ≥ is the dimensionless shape factor with two different values for the rising Œ≥ Œ≥ ris for t 1 and the recession Œ≥ Œ≥ rec for t 1 limbs respectively q p is assumed equal to 2 and Œ≥ ris equal to 1 3 the Œ≥ rec value is defined imposing that the value of the discharge averaged in time over the duration m equals the dimensionless reference discharge q ref 1 zucco et al 2015 showed that the adopted hydrograph well represents the single peak floods occurring in natural channels moreover it may be considered also representative for debris mud flows based on the correlation between debris mud flow and water flow discharge takahashi 1991 vandine 1985 chen et al 2008 as far as fwm is concerned whenever hypercritical conditions occur at the channel inlet an additional boundary condition is required and imposing the instantaneous validity of the normal flow rating curve the following flow depth value is assigned 16 h 0 q 0 t n 2n 1 at the channel outlet for both models the critical flow depth is imposed which for a power law fluid reads di cristo et al 2019 17 h c Œ≤ q 2 f 2 3 3 numerical tests 3 1 criteria for the dwm applicability the prediction of the maximum values of the hydraulic variables such as flow depth and rate constitutes the essence of a typical hazard assessment from this standpoint the capacity of the dwm in reproducing the results of the fwm is tested in terms of mean values along the channel of relative errors on the maximum flow depth and maximum discharge Œµ h and Œµ q denoted with Œµ h and Œµ q respectively Œµ h and Œµ q are evaluated along the x axis as moramarco et al 2008b 18 Œµ h x h max dwm x h max fwm x h max fwm x 100 Œµ q x q max dwm x q max fwm x q max fwm x 100 where h max fwm and h max dwm resp q max fwm and q max dwm are the dimensionless maximum flow depth resp flow rate computed by the fwm and the dwm respectively with the aim of excluding the regions where the boundary conditions may have a large influence Œµ h and Œµ q are computed limitedly to 0 05 x 0 95 moramarco et al 2008b a positive mean error indicates that on average along the channel the dwm overestimates the flow depth or discharge predicted by the fwm while negative value results in an averaged underestimation which for a typical flow routing problem represents a non conservative prediction 3 2 performed tests several numerical tests have been performed under a variety of flow conditions characterized by different synthetic inlet hydrographs different tests have been carried out varying the hydrograph duration from 5 to 20000 correspondingly the Œ≥ rec value ranges between 1 1 m 5 and 12 536 m 20000 the rheological index has been varied in the whole shear thinning range namely n 1 the normal froude number covers the hypocritical range finally in the tests the kinematic wave number has been varied from 5 up to 100 all simulations have been performed with the same spatial step Œ¥x 0 005 while the time step was equal to Œ¥t 10 10 7 for the fwm and Œ¥t 10 10 4 for the dwm the accuracy of the numerical solutions has been tested verifying the independence of the simulation results when reducing the spatial and temporal step values in particular halving both the mesh spacing and the time step the differences on Œµ h and Œµ q are below 0 1 and 0 2 respectively 4 results and discussion figs 1 and 2 report the mean error of the maximum flow depth and discharge Œµ h and Œµ q respectively as a function of the hydrograph duration m for f 0 25 and for four different rheological indexes values i e n 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 two different values of the kinematic number have been considered namely k 5 a and k 16 b independently of the kinematic wave number and the power law index value fig 1 shows that Œµ h monotonically decreases with m asymptotically reaching its minimum negative value such a value corresponds to the quasi steady conditions Œµ h qs reported as red horizontal lines in fig 1 and it coincides with the averaged flow depth error evaluated assuming valid in each instant the steady solution di cristo et al 2019 such a monotone behavior has been verified for all the investigated f k n triplets results not shown for the sake of brevity the dwm differs from fwm for the inertial terms in the moment equation i e l h s of eq 9 since for high values of m the local inertia becomes negligible fig 1 shows that ignoring the convective inertial term an underestimation of flow depth has induced and then negative values of Œµ h are observed for shorter hydrograph durations the local inertia progressively attenuates this underestimation indeed small values of m i e short hydrograph durations are characterized by an overestimation of flow depth and positive values of Œµ h in this study the dwm is assumed to be conservatively applied for positive mean error values representing a flow depth overestimation conversely negative values of Œµ h corresponding to an underestimation on the maximum flow depth imply a non conservative application of the dwm in what follows the dwm is considered safely applicable provided that the negative values of Œµ h are larger than a prescribed threshold value as in previous studies moramarco et al 2008b di cristo et al 2019 this threshold is assumed equal to 5 and therefore the dwm would be considered applicable whenever Œµ h 5 considering the monotone dependence of Œµ h on m and that the minimum value of Œµ h corresponds to the asymptotic value Œµ h min Œµ h qs the condition Œµ h qs 5 guarantees the applicability of the dwm independently of the hydrograph duration for instance fig 1 shows that for f 0 25 and k 5 and k 16 the dwm may be safely applied for all the m values only for the case corresponding to a newtonian fluid i e n 1 and k equal to 16 see fig 1b in all the other cases reported in fig 1 since Œµ h qs 5 the condition Œµ h 5 defines an upper bound of m for the applicability of the dwm in terms of error on the maximum depth m h max as far as the mean error on the maximum discharge Œµ q is concerned fig 2 shows that independently of the k and n values Œµ q has a non monotone behavior with the hydrograph duration starting from a value Œµ q min pertaining to the lowest investigated m value Œµ q monotonically increases up to a maximum always positive value and subsequently decreases vanishing for sufficiently large hydrograph durations the zero asymptotic value is again consistent with the quasi steady approximation Œµ q qs 0 the above described functional dependence of Œµ q on m has been found for all the investigated froude and kinematic wave numbers values and independently of the value of the power law exponent results not shown if Œµ q min is larger than 5 the dwm may be safely applied for all wave durations for instance for k 16 fig 2b such a condition holds for all the considered n values while for k 5 fig 2a only whenever n is larger than 0 25 in particular a further investigation has shown that Œµ q min is still smaller than 5 for n 0 45 when Œµ q min 5 see for instance the k 5 and n 0 25 case in fig 2a there exists a lower bound of m for the safe application of the dwm in predicting the discharge m q min inspecting fig 1a and 1b it is also noted that for a fixed value of the f n pair and of the hydrograph duration m as k increases Œµ h min negative value increases in general numerical analyses have confirmed that the absolute value of errors in terms of both flow depth and discharge decreases for increasing k this can be explained considering that an increase of k induces in both full eq 9 and diffusive eq 12 momentum equations an increase of the source term difference between effects of gravity and friction in conclusion when Œµ h min 5 resp Œµ q min 5 the dwm can be safely applied to predict the flow depth resp discharge for all hydrograph durations conversely when Œµ h min 5 resp Œµ q min 5 there exists an upper bound m h max resp a lower bound m q min for the hydrograph duration in order to safely apply the dwm for predicting the flow depth resp the discharge in this case an analysis aimed to individuate the values of triplet k n f for which Œµ h min and Œµ q min are larger than 5 has been carried out in particular for given values of f and n analyzing the results in quasi steady conditions the value of k for which Œµ h min equals 5 has been determined denoting with k h this value it follows that the dwm is applicable for hydrograph of any duration in terms of maximum flow depth whenever k k h similarly the analysis of the results at m 5 has led to define the value of k for which Œµ q min is equal to 5 denoted with k q fig 3 reports for several values of n i e n 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and for froude number f 0 1 the values of the limiting kinematic wave numbers k h and k q in this map the applicability region is represented by the area on the right of k h and k q lines for all hydrograph durations the dwm can be safely applied to predict both flow depth and discharge whenever k is larger than both k h and k q i e k max k h k q fig 3 shows that for all n values there exists a k h value and it decreases as the froude number increases this observation implies that the applicability range of the dwm in terms of maximum flow depth enlarges with the froude number for froude number larger than 0 45 the applicability of the dwm holds for all considered rheologies for fixed value of froude number an increase of the power law index leads to a strong enlargement of the applicability region i e k h reduces with n for instance for f 0 1 increasing n from 0 25 up to 1 0 leads to a reduction of k h from 84 to 14 about the discharge in the investigated range of the governing parameters for n 0 5 the dwm is always applicable independently of the wave duration only for n 0 5 a lower bound of the kinematic wave number for the discharge prediction k q exists as shown in fig 2 furthermore differently from the flow depth k q increases with f and therefore the applicability region of the dwm for the discharge shrinks with the froude number for a fixed froude number the dependence of k q on the power law index is similar to the one of k h i e a reduction of n increases the k q value for instance for f 0 8 increasing n from 0 25 up to 0 5 k q reduces from 40 to 10 as far as the prediction of both flow depth and discharge is concerned fig 3 indicates that for n 0 5 the lower bound of the kinematic wave number k coincides with k h therefore for froude number larger than 0 45 and n 0 5 the dwm is applicable both in terms of flow depth and discharge for all m values a different conclusion holds for n 0 5 indeed at large f numbers the applicability range is bounded by k q conversely for low froude number value the limiting values k h is more restrictive as consequence for small values of n a non monotone dependence of k on the froude number is found for instance at n 0 25 the minimum value of k is detected at f 0 3 k 23 with the aim of defining the dwm applicability conditions for k smaller than k h or k q the influence of the hydrograph duration has been investigated as previously discussed an upper lower bound m h max m q min of the hydrograph duration has to be respected for the safe application of dwm in predicting the flow depth discharge those bounds depend on the values of the froude and kinematic wave numbers along with the power law exponent and they been computed starting from the results of the numerical simulations as far as the flow depth is concerned for each power law index value considered in fig 3 accounting for the results in terms of k h froude numbers up to 0 4 have been investigated for each f n pair the dwm may be applied for maximum flow depth prediction whenever m m h max fig 4 reports the m h max values as function of the kinematic wave number k for the considered rheological indexes n 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and for a f 0 1 b f 0 2 c f 0 3 d f 0 4 the k m pairs on the right of each curve corresponds to applicability conditions consistently with the conclusion that for k k h the dwm can be safely applied for all wave durations the curves in fig 4 diverge as k approaches k h as far as the discharge is concerned owing to the results in terms of k q of fig 3 for identifying the m q min values the investigated froude number range has been extended up to 0 8 while only the power law index 0 25 and 0 5 have been considered fig 5 reports the m q min values as a function of the kinematic wave number k for froude numbers ranging between 0 1 and 0 8 and rheological indexes n 0 25 a and 0 5 b for each f n pair the dwm may be applied for maximum discharge prediction whenever m m q min and therefore the region above each curve individuates the applicability domain the comparison between figs 4 and 5 reveals that m h max extends over one or two orders of magnitude whereas m q min spans about ten moreover for a fixed value of the froude number the applicability region both in terms of flow depth and flow rate enlarges for increasing k and n the dependence on the froude number is different for a fixed value of n the applicability region for the maximum flow depth resp flow rate prediction enlarges resp shrinks when the froude number is increased both conclusions agree with the results shown in fig 3 the effects of the power law exponent and the kinematic wave number on the applicability regions may be easily explained analyzing the magnitude of the terms of eq 9 since the dwm is expected to approximate better the fwm whenever the inertial terms at the left hand side of eq 9 are smaller than the ones at right hand side the rheological index n influences the two l h s terms and the source term at r h s with regards to the inertial terms fig 6 depicts c kwm and Œ≤ as functions of the power law index fig 6 suggests that n marginally affects the coefficient of the convective inertia term Œ≤ while the reduction the power law exponent strongly increases the weight of the local inertia through c kwm this behavior contributes to the reduction of the dwm applicability area as n decreases figs 4 and 5 moreover the influence of the power law exponent on the source term s q h kh 1 q n h 2n 1 is illustrated in fig 7 by plotting the iso contours of s q h for two values of the power law index namely n 0 25 and n 1 0 and assuming a conservative unitary value of the kinematic wave number the comparison between fig 7a and 7b suggests that the magnitude of the source term is substantially larger for n 1 0 than for n 0 25 particularly for small values of the flow depth this behavior contributes to reduce the dwm applicability domain as n decreases finally for a fixed value of n and independently of the value of the q h pair s linearly increases with k which justifies the corresponding enlargement of the dwm applicability region conversely the effect of the froude number on the applicability bounds m h max and m q min is more complex in fact the froude number influences both the weight of the r h s of eq 9 and the boundary condition at the channel outlet eq 17 indeed a reduction of f causes the weight of the pressure differential term to increase and similarly the magnitude of the r h s of eq 9 at the same time it also leads to a reduction of the critical flow depth at the channel outlet with a not easily foreseeable effect on the relative error in terms of both maximum flow depth and flow rate the above results allow to define the dwm applicability conditions analyzing the mean error along the channel length indeed although present results are useful for hazard assessment at large scales such as the basin one the criteria fulfillment does not ensure that the dwm may accurately describe the spatio temporal dynamics of the hydrograph a systematic comparison of fwm and dwm under this perspective is out of the scope of the present research however in order to give an idea about the local and instantaneous error in the dwm application a flow condition in which the criterion is fulfilled has been analysed in detail the following condition has been considered n 0 25 f 0 2 k 20 m 16 for which Œµ h 5 and Œµ q 5 fig 8 compares the time evolutions of the flow depth fig 8a and discharge fig 8b predicted by the two methods at three different channel locations namely x 0 25 x 0 5 and x 0 75 fig 8a shows that while the dwm correctly predicts the celerity of the front some differences are visible in terms of celerity of the maximum value of flow depth indeed the flow depth peak moves slightly faster in the dwm than in the fwm from fig 8b some differences are still observed in terms of celerity of maximum discharge but the trend is less clear with the peaks of the dwm that move slightly faster in the first half of the channel and slower downstream fig 8 also clearly indicates that for the considered condition negative value of Œµ h and positive values of Œµ q correspond to a dwm underprediction of maximum of flow depth and overprediction of the maximum discharge respectively to quantify the performance of the dwm in reproducing the spatio temporal dynamics of the hydrograph several indices have been considered firstly the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 19 n s q 1 t q fwm t q dwm t 2 t q fwm t q fwm 2 100 has been analyzed in eq 19 q fwm t and q dwm t are the dimensionless instantaneous flow rates computed by the fwm and the dwm respectively in a given section and q fwm is the fwm discharge mean value in the same section in addition the the local values of Œµ h and Œµ q have been computed along with the relative errors on the time to peak flow depth t h p and discharge t q p expressed as 20 Œµ t h p t h p dwm t h p fwm t h p fwm 100 Œµ t q p t q p dwm t q p fwm t q p fwm 100 table 1 reports the values of the considered five indices at the three sections represented in fig 8 the very high values of the nsq index indicate very good reproduction of the hydrograph shape by the dwm the relative errors on the estimation of the maximum flow depth and discharge show that the differences between the peak values i e the underprediction of the maximum flow depth and the overprediction of discharge are within 10 and increase along the channel for the time to peak of flow depth and discharge the relative errors are between 10 and 20 present results suggest that criteria deduced analyzing the spatially averaged errors such as the one herein presented have to be applied with caution whenever a detailed information about the hydrograph dynamics is required in other words there is not a univocal way to assess the applicability of the dwm but different criteria can be defined by selecting appropriate error parameters for the considered application 4 1 an example of application the cervinara mud flows in order to show that the dwm applicability conditions can be satisfied in real mud flows the historical event occurred in 1999 in cervinara southern italy is considered the area was hit by prolonged heavy rains and their action over the pyroclastic deposits covering the hills triggered several mud flows which reached the town center causing damages and fatalities two episodes form this dramatic series are considered in the following to provide an example of the possible application of the above methodology namely the two mud flows arising from the iozzino and san gennaro watersheds cascini et al 2011 based on the experiments by carotenuto et al 2015 the power law model can be adopted to describe the rheology of the muds developed after the intense washing of pyroclastic deposits from the rheological study the value of the consistency and of the rheological exponent have resulted equal to Œº n 21 4 pa s n and to n 0 1 respectively based on the hydrological data and on the results of the simulations reported by cascini et al 2011 the peak unit width discharges have been estimated as q ref 0 011 m 2 s for ioffredo watershed and q ref 0 033 m 2 s for san gennaro one the typical values of the longitudinal slope and flow width in the urbanized area have been estimated from available cartography as Œ∏ 0 049 for and Œ∏ 0 032 for the ioffredo and san gennaro watersheds respectively combining the above data with the bottom shear stress relationship eq 4 the reference froude number has been evaluated from eq 8 as f 0 45 and f 0 65 for the two mudflows the main data characterizing the two examples are summarized in table 2 the evaluation of the k h value for the considered rheology confirmed the effect of the shear thinning behavior as indicated in fig 3 for both values of the froude number it results k h 5 implying that the criterion on the mean values of the dimensionless error on the maximum flow depth is satisfied for any meaningful value of the channel length and for any duration of the flow hydrograph as far as the criterion on the mean values of the dimensionless error on the maximum flow discharge is concerned the values of k q have been computed as 44 8 and 43 4 for the events resulting from ioffredo and san gennaro watersheds respectively with these threshold values the dwm is applicable independently of the hydrograph duration in reaches with lengths longer than 50 m 5 conclusions the present study investigates the applicability of the diffusive wave model dwm in predicting the unsteady propagation of a mud flow wave represented through a shear thinning power law fluid described through the model proposed by ng and mei 1994 the analysis accounts for the non linearity of the governing equations which have been numerically solved for the full wave model fwm an explicit first order scheme in time and a second order finite volume method for the spatial discretization has been adopted the dwm has been numerically solved with an implicit finite volume scheme with a first order in space and time approximation different tests have been performed varying the wave duration of the hydrograph imposed at the inlet and considering different rheological index n several values of the froude f and of the kinematic wave k numbers the applicability conditions are expressed considering as indicators the mean values of the dimensionless error on the maximum flow depth and on the maximum discharge Œµ h and Œµ q respectively since positive errors lead to an overestimation of the maximum flow depth and flow rate in the presented analysis the dwm is considered safely applicable for positive values of Œµ h and Œµ q and for negative values larger than 5 about the mean error on the maximum flow depth present results indicate that it monotonically decreases with the wave duration with an asymptotic minimum negative value Œµ h min corresponding to quasi steady conditions conversely the mean error of the maximum flow discharge starting from a values at the lowest wave duration Œµ q min achieves a maximum positive value and then it decreases tending asymptotically to zero for quasi steady conditions these observations suggest that the conditions Œµ h min 5 and Œµ q min 5 guarantees the applicability of the dwm independently of the wave duration in terms of maximum flow depth and discharge respectivelly conversely when Œµ h min 5 there exists an upper bound of the wave duration below which the dwm can be safely applied for predicting the flow depth similarly when Œµ q min 5 the dwm can be adopted for evaluating the maximum discharge when the wave duration is larger than a lower bound for a fixed rheology the study of the Œµ h min and Œµ q min variability with respect to the governing dimensionless parameters f and k suggests that for a fixed f the condition Œµ h min 5 resp Œµ q min 5 is satisfied when the kinematic wave number exceeds the threshold value k h respectively k q indeed dwm can be safely applied independently of the hydrograph wave duration for the flow depth resp the flow rate prediction whenever k is larger than k h resp k q the k h and k q values have been determined for several values of the n f pair when the condition on k is not verified i e k k h respectively k k q further maps have been derived for evaluating the upper and lower bounds of wave duration for the safe application of the dwm in predicting the flow depth and the discharge respectively the presented results clearly indicate that the rheology substantially affects the magnitude of the errors reducing the applicability of dwm for shear thinning fluids finally the proposed methodology has been applied to two mud flows occurred in 1999 in southern italy and involving fluids with pronounced shear thinning behaviour it has shown that even in these extreme

4371,simplified versions of the shallow water equations known as kinematic and diffusive models are commonly applied to the analysis of debris and mud flow dynamics for this reason the study of their applicability conditions represents an important concern the present work investigates on the applicability conditions of the diffusive wave model dwm for the prediction of mud flows of shear thinning fluid represented by a power law rheology the study has been carried out through the numerical solution of the dwm and the full wave model fwm in unsteady conditions with hydrographs of different durations assigned at the channel inlet the analysis has considered different rheological indexes several values of the froude f and of the kinematic wave k numbers predictions of dwm and fdm have been compared considering the mean value of dimensionless errors on maximum flow depth Œµ h and maximum discharge Œµ q positive negative error leads to an overestimation underestimation of the maximum flow depth and flow discharge in the prediction of the dwm in the present analysis the dwm is considered safely applicable in case of underestimation i e for positive values of Œµ h and Œµ q negative errors are acceptable if their absolute value is smaller than 5 for all the investigated values of the governing parameters the performance of the dwm has been found to strongly depend on the value of the rheological index worsening as the fluid rheology becomes more shear thinning regardless of the hydrograph duration and for fixed power law exponent n and f values results indicate the existence of limiting values of the kinematic wave number k h and k q above which the dwm is applicable in terms of maximum depth and discharge respectively for k values smaller than k h and k q the dwm applicability depends also on the hydrograph duration in these conditions and for several values of the f n pair the threshold values of the hydrograph duration necessary for dwm applicability have been identified the presented applicability criteria represent a useful guideline for the practical application of the dwm in assessing the hazard of a mud flood keywords mud flow power law rheology shear thinning fluid diffusive wave model unsteady flow 1 introduction debris and mud flows involve fast moving mixtures of water with great volumes of sediment typically they develop in mountain areas triggered by heavy rains hutter et al 1994 iverson and denlinger 2001 particularly after wildfires rengers et al 2016 since they reduce the surface water storage benavides solorio and macdonald 2005 and promote the infiltration of the rain decreasing the canopy interception stoof et al 2012 debris and mud flows may produce huge damages and loss of lives hurlimann et al 2006 di et al 2008 and cause dramatic changes of the topography the river morphology brown and pasternack 2014 and even the coastal areas ciervo et al 2015 owing to their destructive power these flows have high socio economic impacts fuchs et al 2007 thiene et al 2017 and therefore the definition of appropriate mathematical models for predicting their impact is crucial the selection of the most adequate model for the debris and mud flows analysis implies a choice among many available options a first approach assumes a single phase description of the flowing medium considered as a homogeneous continuum with a non newtonian behavior however the use of a constant rheology does not furnish accurate predictions for debris flows when temporal and spatial variations of the pore fluid pressure and mixture agitation occur or when mixture composition changes due to segregation of solid particles iverson 2003 alternative approaches are represented by quasi single phase mixture e g xia et al 2018 and two phase e g iverson 1997 pitman and le 2005 di cristo et al 2016 li et al 2018a 2018b models for instance iverson 1997 and iverson and denlinger 2001 proposed a coulomb mixture theory for debris flows which considers the interaction between the fluid phase assumed as a newtonian fluid and the granular solid which behaves as a coulomb fictional material greco et al 2019 compared the performance of two different depth integrated theoretical models single phase model spm and two phase model tpm in reproducing the impact of a mud flow on rigid obstacles to evaluate the force acting on them the two models show comparable results for the considered two dimensional test case while some differences are observed in simulating a 1d landslide over a very steep slope in the framework of the single phase models different formulations have been proposed some of them assume the existence of a yield stress such as bingham liu and mei 1989 imran et al 2001 hewitt and balmforth 2013 and herschel bulkley coussot 1997 huang and garcia 1998 chanson et al 2006 models conversely the power law model without the yield stress is often adopted for mud flows characterized by mixtures of fine sediment and water with a rheology strongly influenced by the quantity of the fine fraction in particular the shear thinning power law model characterized by an exponent lower than one is particularly adequate for flows with a finite fraction of coarse grains ng and mei 1994 hwang et al 1994 perazzo and gratton 2004 longo et al 2015 encountered for instance in natural estuaries zhang et al 2010 or during landslides carotenuto et al 2015 the power law model may also result preferable when the correct rheological characterization of a visco plastic fluid appears difficult ovarlez et al 2011 chambon et al 2014 although in several cases three dimensional effects are not negligible depth averaged models based on 2d shallow water equation swes are widely accepted for many engineering applications iverson and george 2014 fent et al 2018 such as for mud flows routing armanini et al 2014 rosatti and begnudelli 2013 di cristo et al 2020 moreover even though efficient numerical methods for the solution of the swes are currently available simplified models derived neglecting one or more terms in the momentum equation are often used among the approximate models we cite the widespread kinematic wave model kwm and diffusive wave model dwm in particular the dwm is usefully applied in flood modelling and rainfall runoff simulations aric√≤ et al 2011 caviedes voullieme et al 2020 but also coupled with sewage models martins et al 2017 in particular prestinizi 2008 tested the dwm for reproducing a dam break denoting that it is able to reproduce the principal features of the inundation as far as non newtonian fluids are concerned the comparison between the numerical results and laboratory experiments carried out with reference to bingham e g liu and mei 1989 herschel bulkley e g ancey et al 2012 and power law e g longo et al 2015 fluids suggests that the dwm may describe the essential features of a mud flow wave in particular longo et al 2015 analysed the performance of both kinematic and diffusive models in reproducing the laboratory experiments concerning the propagation of a power law fluid wave in channels theoretical solutions are obtained for inclined channel in self similar form for the dwm and with the method of characteristics for the kwm it has been shown that the theoretical solutions describe with sufficient accuracy the front propagation before the transition to longer roll waves simplified models have been successfully applied also for reproducing the dynamics of debris and mud flows o brien et al 1993 arattano and franzi 2010 chiang et al 2012 gregoretti et al 2016 2019 bernard et al 2019 in clear water turbulent flows the applicability conditions of both kinematic and diffusive models have been deeply studied either analysing their linearized version tsai 2003 or accounting for the non linear terms moramarco et al 2008ab aric√≤ and nasello 2018 zheng et al 2020 conversely the applicability conditions of the approximated models for mud flows were not so deeply analysed starting from the theoretical results of di cristo et al 2013a applicability criteria for some approximate models were deduced in di cristo et al 2014a di cristo et al 2014b for both a herschel bulkley and a power law rheology through an analysis of the linearized equations moreover in di cristo et al 2018a accounting for the non linear terms the applicability conditions of both kinematic and diffusive approximate models have been defined for a power law fluid studying the analytical solution of the steady problem applicability criteria have been derived in terms of two non dimensional parameters governing the problem the froude and kinematic wave numbers it has been also shown that the criteria deduced for clear water flows moramarco et al 2008a cannot be straightforwardly applied to mud flows for both diffusive and kinematic approximate models because they lead to non conservative predictions in particular for small power law index values di cristo et al 2018a a further analysis performed by di cristo et al 2019 comparing the unsteady numerical results of the fully non linear model with the corresponding ones deduced through the kwm has confirmed these conclusions in this unsteady analysis the criteria for the application of the kwm have been provided in terms of the hydrograph rising time the present paper extends the non linear unsteady analysis of di cristo et al 2019 to the dwm considering discharge hydrographs at the channel inlet characterized by different wave durations the objective is to provide applicability criteria of the dwm for a shear thinning power law fluid described by the model proposed by ng and mei 1994 in the study carried out through an unsteady numerical analysis of both the full and the diffusive wave models the performance of the dwm are evaluated considering the dimensionless error on the maximum flow depth and on the maximum discharge the paper is organized as follows section 2 reports the governing equations for the fwm and of the dwm and the adopted numerical methods section 3 illustrates the performed tests and the results of the comparison between the fwm and the dwm along with the obtained applicability criteria an exemplification of the proposed methodology is illustrated in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 unsteady analysis 2 1 full wave model a homogeneous layer of an incompressible shear thinning power law fluid flowing over a fixed bed with a constant inclination Œ∏ with respect to the horizontal plane without lateral inflow or outflow is investigated neglecting the surface tension and considering a laminar gradually varied flow where spatial variations occur over scales larger than flow depth so that flow resistance by the sidewalls is negligible with respect to that by the bottom the dimensional depth averaged mass and momentum conservation equations are ng and mei 1994 di cristo et al 2017 1 h t q x 0 2 q t Œ≤ x q 2 h g h h x cos Œ∏ g h sin Œ∏ œÑ b œÅ where t is the time x is the streamwise coordinate h the flow depth q the flow rate for unit of width g and œÅ the gravity and the fluid density respectively Œ≤ and œÑ b are the momentum correction factor and the bottom stress respectively in laminar regime the expressions of the momentum correction factor and of the bottom stress are ng and mei 1994 di cristo et al 2013b respectively 3 Œ≤ 2 2 n 1 3 n 2 1 4 œÑ b Œº n 2 n 1 n u h n being u q h the depth averaged velocity Œº n and n the consistency and the rheological index of the power law fluid respectively for shear thinning fluids the rheological index is smaller than one while values larger than one represent shear thickening fluids in the following only shear thinning fluids have been considered the following dimensionless variables are introduced 5 x x l h h h n q q q ref t t t ref where l is the dimensional channel length q ref is the reference flow rate for unit width and h n the corresponding dimensional normal i e uniform depth the reference time scale t ref is assumed equal to the kinematic wave channel travel time of the reference discharge moramarco et al 2008b 6 t ref l c kwm where c kwm denotes the dimensional celerity of the kinematic wave which for power law fluid reads di cristo et al 2018b 7 c kwm c kwm q ref h n w i t h c kwm 2 n

denotes the normal froude number and k the kinematic wave number whose expressions are 10 f q ref h n 3 2 g cos Œ∏ 11 k 1 f 2 l h n tan Œ∏ therefore as in the clear water case govindaraju et al 1988a 1988b moramarco et al 2008a for the power law fluids the problem is univocally defined through the two dimensionless numbers f k or equivalently f k f 2 as reported with more details in di cristo et al 2019 the system 8 9 has been numerically solved using an explicit first order euler scheme for the temporal discretization and a second order finite volume method for the spatial discretization 2 2 diffusive wave model the dwm is obtained neglecting in eq 9 the local and convective inertia terms represented by the first two terms at the l h s obtaining 12 h x k f 2 1 q n h 2 n 1 taking the spatial resp temporal derivative of eqs 8 resp of eq 12 the dwm may be rewritten into the advection diffusion form as follows 13 q t c q x v 2 q x 2 where the expressions of the advective velocity c and of the hydraulic diffusivity v are 14 c 2n 1 n q h v 1 nkf 2 h 2n 1 q n 1 the influence of the power law index value on both the advective velocity and the hydraulic diffusivity has been discussed through a linear analysis by di cristo et al 2018b and in the non linear conditions by pascal 1991 in studying the stability of power law fluid gravity flows of over a plane the dwm i e eqs 8 and 12 has been numerically solved in implicit way through a finite volume scheme the scheme is first order both in space and in time a newton raphson iterative procedure has been used to solve the non linear algebraic system 2 3 boundary conditions for both models a flow hydrograph is imposed as the upstream boundary condition whose duration t f is expressed as a multiple of the reference time scale i e t f m t ref so that the value of m assumed larger than one represents the dimensionless duration of the upstream hydrograph the hydrograph shape has been assigned accordingly to the following four parameters pearson type iii distribution moramarco et al 2008a di cristo et al 2019 15 q 0 t q p t 1 Œ≥ 1 e 1 t Œ≥ 1 where q p is the dimensionless peak discharge for unit width and Œ≥ is the dimensionless shape factor with two different values for the rising Œ≥ Œ≥ ris for t 1 and the recession Œ≥ Œ≥ rec for t 1 limbs respectively q p is assumed equal to 2 and Œ≥ ris equal to 1 3 the Œ≥ rec value is defined imposing that the value of the discharge averaged in time over the duration m equals the dimensionless reference discharge q ref 1 zucco et al 2015 showed that the adopted hydrograph well represents the single peak floods occurring in natural channels moreover it may be considered also representative for debris mud flows based on the correlation between debris mud flow and water flow discharge takahashi 1991 vandine 1985 chen et al 2008 as far as fwm is concerned whenever hypercritical conditions occur at the channel inlet an additional boundary condition is required and imposing the instantaneous validity of the normal flow rating curve the following flow depth value is assigned 16 h 0 q 0 t n 2n 1 at the channel outlet for both models the critical flow depth is imposed which for a power law fluid reads di cristo et al 2019 17 h c Œ≤ q 2 f 2 3 3 numerical tests 3 1 criteria for the dwm applicability the prediction of the maximum values of the hydraulic variables such as flow depth and rate constitutes the essence of a typical hazard assessment from this standpoint the capacity of the dwm in reproducing the results of the fwm is tested in terms of mean values along the channel of relative errors on the maximum flow depth and maximum discharge Œµ h and Œµ q denoted with Œµ h and Œµ q respectively Œµ h and Œµ q are evaluated along the x axis as moramarco et al 2008b 18 Œµ h x h max dwm x h max fwm x h max fwm x 100 Œµ q x q max dwm x q max fwm x q max fwm x 100 where h max fwm and h max dwm resp q max fwm and q max dwm are the dimensionless maximum flow depth resp flow rate computed by the fwm and the dwm respectively with the aim of excluding the regions where the boundary conditions may have a large influence Œµ h and Œµ q are computed limitedly to 0 05 x 0 95 moramarco et al 2008b a positive mean error indicates that on average along the channel the dwm overestimates the flow depth or discharge predicted by the fwm while negative value results in an averaged underestimation which for a typical flow routing problem represents a non conservative prediction 3 2 performed tests several numerical tests have been performed under a variety of flow conditions characterized by different synthetic inlet hydrographs different tests have been carried out varying the hydrograph duration from 5 to 20000 correspondingly the Œ≥ rec value ranges between 1 1 m 5 and 12 536 m 20000 the rheological index has been varied in the whole shear thinning range namely n 1 the normal froude number covers the hypocritical range finally in the tests the kinematic wave number has been varied from 5 up to 100 all simulations have been performed with the same spatial step Œ¥x 0 005 while the time step was equal to Œ¥t 10 10 7 for the fwm and Œ¥t 10 10 4 for the dwm the accuracy of the numerical solutions has been tested verifying the independence of the simulation results when reducing the spatial and temporal step values in particular halving both the mesh spacing and the time step the differences on Œµ h and Œµ q are below 0 1 and 0 2 respectively 4 results and discussion figs 1 and 2 report the mean error of the maximum flow depth and discharge Œµ h and Œµ q respectively as a function of the hydrograph duration m for f 0 25 and for four different rheological indexes values i e n 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 two different values of the kinematic number have been considered namely k 5 a and k 16 b independently of the kinematic wave number and the power law index value fig 1 shows that Œµ h monotonically decreases with m asymptotically reaching its minimum negative value such a value corresponds to the quasi steady conditions Œµ h qs reported as red horizontal lines in fig 1 and it coincides with the averaged flow depth error evaluated assuming valid in each instant the steady solution di cristo et al 2019 such a monotone behavior has been verified for all the investigated f k n triplets results not shown for the sake of brevity the dwm differs from fwm for the inertial terms in the moment equation i e l h s of eq 9 since for high values of m the local inertia becomes negligible fig 1 shows that ignoring the convective inertial term an underestimation of flow depth has induced and then negative values of Œµ h are observed for shorter hydrograph durations the local inertia progressively attenuates this underestimation indeed small values of m i e short hydrograph durations are characterized by an overestimation of flow depth and positive values of Œµ h in this study the dwm is assumed to be conservatively applied for positive mean error values representing a flow depth overestimation conversely negative values of Œµ h corresponding to an underestimation on the maximum flow depth imply a non conservative application of the dwm in what follows the dwm is considered safely applicable provided that the negative values of Œµ h are larger than a prescribed threshold value as in previous studies moramarco et al 2008b di cristo et al 2019 this threshold is assumed equal to 5 and therefore the dwm would be considered applicable whenever Œµ h 5 considering the monotone dependence of Œµ h on m and that the minimum value of Œµ h corresponds to the asymptotic value Œµ h min Œµ h qs the condition Œµ h qs 5 guarantees the applicability of the dwm independently of the hydrograph duration for instance fig 1 shows that for f 0 25 and k 5 and k 16 the dwm may be safely applied for all the m values only for the case corresponding to a newtonian fluid i e n 1 and k equal to 16 see fig 1b in all the other cases reported in fig 1 since Œµ h qs 5 the condition Œµ h 5 defines an upper bound of m for the applicability of the dwm in terms of error on the maximum depth m h max as far as the mean error on the maximum discharge Œµ q is concerned fig 2 shows that independently of the k and n values Œµ q has a non monotone behavior with the hydrograph duration starting from a value Œµ q min pertaining to the lowest investigated m value Œµ q monotonically increases up to a maximum always positive value and subsequently decreases vanishing for sufficiently large hydrograph durations the zero asymptotic value is again consistent with the quasi steady approximation Œµ q qs 0 the above described functional dependence of Œµ q on m has been found for all the investigated froude and kinematic wave numbers values and independently of the value of the power law exponent results not shown if Œµ q min is larger than 5 the dwm may be safely applied for all wave durations for instance for k 16 fig 2b such a condition holds for all the considered n values while for k 5 fig 2a only whenever n is larger than 0 25 in particular a further investigation has shown that Œµ q min is still smaller than 5 for n 0 45 when Œµ q min 5 see for instance the k 5 and n 0 25 case in fig 2a there exists a lower bound of m for the safe application of the dwm in predicting the discharge m q min inspecting fig 1a and 1b it is also noted that for a fixed value of the f n pair and of the hydrograph duration m as k increases Œµ h min negative value increases in general numerical analyses have confirmed that the absolute value of errors in terms of both flow depth and discharge decreases for increasing k this can be explained considering that an increase of k induces in both full eq 9 and diffusive eq 12 momentum equations an increase of the source term difference between effects of gravity and friction in conclusion when Œµ h min 5 resp Œµ q min 5 the dwm can be safely applied to predict the flow depth resp discharge for all hydrograph durations conversely when Œµ h min 5 resp Œµ q min 5 there exists an upper bound m h max resp a lower bound m q min for the hydrograph duration in order to safely apply the dwm for predicting the flow depth resp the discharge in this case an analysis aimed to individuate the values of triplet k n f for which Œµ h min and Œµ q min are larger than 5 has been carried out in particular for given values of f and n analyzing the results in quasi steady conditions the value of k for which Œµ h min equals 5 has been determined denoting with k h this value it follows that the dwm is applicable for hydrograph of any duration in terms of maximum flow depth whenever k k h similarly the analysis of the results at m 5 has led to define the value of k for which Œµ q min is equal to 5 denoted with k q fig 3 reports for several values of n i e n 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and for froude number f 0 1 the values of the limiting kinematic wave numbers k h and k q in this map the applicability region is represented by the area on the right of k h and k q lines for all hydrograph durations the dwm can be safely applied to predict both flow depth and discharge whenever k is larger than both k h and k q i e k max k h k q fig 3 shows that for all n values there exists a k h value and it decreases as the froude number increases this observation implies that the applicability range of the dwm in terms of maximum flow depth enlarges with the froude number for froude number larger than 0 45 the applicability of the dwm holds for all considered rheologies for fixed value of froude number an increase of the power law index leads to a strong enlargement of the applicability region i e k h reduces with n for instance for f 0 1 increasing n from 0 25 up to 1 0 leads to a reduction of k h from 84 to 14 about the discharge in the investigated range of the governing parameters for n 0 5 the dwm is always applicable independently of the wave duration only for n 0 5 a lower bound of the kinematic wave number for the discharge prediction k q exists as shown in fig 2 furthermore differently from the flow depth k q increases with f and therefore the applicability region of the dwm for the discharge shrinks with the froude number for a fixed froude number the dependence of k q on the power law index is similar to the one of k h i e a reduction of n increases the k q value for instance for f 0 8 increasing n from 0 25 up to 0 5 k q reduces from 40 to 10 as far as the prediction of both flow depth and discharge is concerned fig 3 indicates that for n 0 5 the lower bound of the kinematic wave number k coincides with k h therefore for froude number larger than 0 45 and n 0 5 the dwm is applicable both in terms of flow depth and discharge for all m values a different conclusion holds for n 0 5 indeed at large f numbers the applicability range is bounded by k q conversely for low froude number value the limiting values k h is more restrictive as consequence for small values of n a non monotone dependence of k on the froude number is found for instance at n 0 25 the minimum value of k is detected at f 0 3 k 23 with the aim of defining the dwm applicability conditions for k smaller than k h or k q the influence of the hydrograph duration has been investigated as previously discussed an upper lower bound m h max m q min of the hydrograph duration has to be respected for the safe application of dwm in predicting the flow depth discharge those bounds depend on the values of the froude and kinematic wave numbers along with the power law exponent and they been computed starting from the results of the numerical simulations as far as the flow depth is concerned for each power law index value considered in fig 3 accounting for the results in terms of k h froude numbers up to 0 4 have been investigated for each f n pair the dwm may be applied for maximum flow depth prediction whenever m m h max fig 4 reports the m h max values as function of the kinematic wave number k for the considered rheological indexes n 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and for a f 0 1 b f 0 2 c f 0 3 d f 0 4 the k m pairs on the right of each curve corresponds to applicability conditions consistently with the conclusion that for k k h the dwm can be safely applied for all wave durations the curves in fig 4 diverge as k approaches k h as far as the discharge is concerned owing to the results in terms of k q of fig 3 for identifying the m q min values the investigated froude number range has been extended up to 0 8 while only the power law index 0 25 and 0 5 have been considered fig 5 reports the m q min values as a function of the kinematic wave number k for froude numbers ranging between 0 1 and 0 8 and rheological indexes n 0 25 a and 0 5 b for each f n pair the dwm may be applied for maximum discharge prediction whenever m m q min and therefore the region above each curve individuates the applicability domain the comparison between figs 4 and 5 reveals that m h max extends over one or two orders of magnitude whereas m q min spans about ten moreover for a fixed value of the froude number the applicability region both in terms of flow depth and flow rate enlarges for increasing k and n the dependence on the froude number is different for a fixed value of n the applicability region for the maximum flow depth resp flow rate prediction enlarges resp shrinks when the froude number is increased both conclusions agree with the results shown in fig 3 the effects of the power law exponent and the kinematic wave number on the applicability regions may be easily explained analyzing the magnitude of the terms of eq 9 since the dwm is expected to approximate better the fwm whenever the inertial terms at the left hand side of eq 9 are smaller than the ones at right hand side the rheological index n influences the two l h s terms and the source term at r h s with regards to the inertial terms fig 6 depicts c kwm and Œ≤ as functions of the power law index fig 6 suggests that n marginally affects the coefficient of the convective inertia term Œ≤ while the reduction the power law exponent strongly increases the weight of the local inertia through c kwm this behavior contributes to the reduction of the dwm applicability area as n decreases figs 4 and 5 moreover the influence of the power law exponent on the source term s q h kh 1 q n h 2n 1 is illustrated in fig 7 by plotting the iso contours of s q h for two values of the power law index namely n 0 25 and n 1 0 and assuming a conservative unitary value of the kinematic wave number the comparison between fig 7a and 7b suggests that the magnitude of the source term is substantially larger for n 1 0 than for n 0 25 particularly for small values of the flow depth this behavior contributes to reduce the dwm applicability domain as n decreases finally for a fixed value of n and independently of the value of the q h pair s linearly increases with k which justifies the corresponding enlargement of the dwm applicability region conversely the effect of the froude number on the applicability bounds m h max and m q min is more complex in fact the froude number influences both the weight of the r h s of eq 9 and the boundary condition at the channel outlet eq 17 indeed a reduction of f causes the weight of the pressure differential term to increase and similarly the magnitude of the r h s of eq 9 at the same time it also leads to a reduction of the critical flow depth at the channel outlet with a not easily foreseeable effect on the relative error in terms of both maximum flow depth and flow rate the above results allow to define the dwm applicability conditions analyzing the mean error along the channel length indeed although present results are useful for hazard assessment at large scales such as the basin one the criteria fulfillment does not ensure that the dwm may accurately describe the spatio temporal dynamics of the hydrograph a systematic comparison of fwm and dwm under this perspective is out of the scope of the present research however in order to give an idea about the local and instantaneous error in the dwm application a flow condition in which the criterion is fulfilled has been analysed in detail the following condition has been considered n 0 25 f 0 2 k 20 m 16 for which Œµ h 5 and Œµ q 5 fig 8 compares the time evolutions of the flow depth fig 8a and discharge fig 8b predicted by the two methods at three different channel locations namely x 0 25 x 0 5 and x 0 75 fig 8a shows that while the dwm correctly predicts the celerity of the front some differences are visible in terms of celerity of the maximum value of flow depth indeed the flow depth peak moves slightly faster in the dwm than in the fwm from fig 8b some differences are still observed in terms of celerity of maximum discharge but the trend is less clear with the peaks of the dwm that move slightly faster in the first half of the channel and slower downstream fig 8 also clearly indicates that for the considered condition negative value of Œµ h and positive values of Œµ q correspond to a dwm underprediction of maximum of flow depth and overprediction of the maximum discharge respectively to quantify the performance of the dwm in reproducing the spatio temporal dynamics of the hydrograph several indices have been considered firstly the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 19 n s q 1 t q fwm t q dwm t 2 t q fwm t q fwm 2 100 has been analyzed in eq 19 q fwm t and q dwm t are the dimensionless instantaneous flow rates computed by the fwm and the dwm respectively in a given section and q fwm is the fwm discharge mean value in the same section in addition the the local values of Œµ h and Œµ q have been computed along with the relative errors on the time to peak flow depth t h p and discharge t q p expressed as 20 Œµ t h p t h p dwm t h p fwm t h p fwm 100 Œµ t q p t q p dwm t q p fwm t q p fwm 100 table 1 reports the values of the considered five indices at the three sections represented in fig 8 the very high values of the nsq index indicate very good reproduction of the hydrograph shape by the dwm the relative errors on the estimation of the maximum flow depth and discharge show that the differences between the peak values i e the underprediction of the maximum flow depth and the overprediction of discharge are within 10 and increase along the channel for the time to peak of flow depth and discharge the relative errors are between 10 and 20 present results suggest that criteria deduced analyzing the spatially averaged errors such as the one herein presented have to be applied with caution whenever a detailed information about the hydrograph dynamics is required in other words there is not a univocal way to assess the applicability of the dwm but different criteria can be defined by selecting appropriate error parameters for the considered application 4 1 an example of application the cervinara mud flows in order to show that the dwm applicability conditions can be satisfied in real mud flows the historical event occurred in 1999 in cervinara southern italy is considered the area was hit by prolonged heavy rains and their action over the pyroclastic deposits covering the hills triggered several mud flows which reached the town center causing damages and fatalities two episodes form this dramatic series are considered in the following to provide an example of the possible application of the above methodology namely the two mud flows arising from the iozzino and san gennaro watersheds cascini et al 2011 based on the experiments by carotenuto et al 2015 the power law model can be adopted to describe the rheology of the muds developed after the intense washing of pyroclastic deposits from the rheological study the value of the consistency and of the rheological exponent have resulted equal to Œº n 21 4 pa s n and to n 0 1 respectively based on the hydrological data and on the results of the simulations reported by cascini et al 2011 the peak unit width discharges have been estimated as q ref 0 011 m 2 s for ioffredo watershed and q ref 0 033 m 2 s for san gennaro one the typical values of the longitudinal slope and flow width in the urbanized area have been estimated from available cartography as Œ∏ 0 049 for and Œ∏ 0 032 for the ioffredo and san gennaro watersheds respectively combining the above data with the bottom shear stress relationship eq 4 the reference froude number has been evaluated from eq 8 as f 0 45 and f 0 65 for the two mudflows the main data characterizing the two examples are summarized in table 2 the evaluation of the k h value for the considered rheology confirmed the effect of the shear thinning behavior as indicated in fig 3 for both values of the froude number it results k h 5 implying that the criterion on the mean values of the dimensionless error on the maximum flow depth is satisfied for any meaningful value of the channel length and for any duration of the flow hydrograph as far as the criterion on the mean values of the dimensionless error on the maximum flow discharge is concerned the values of k q have been computed as 44 8 and 43 4 for the events resulting from ioffredo and san gennaro watersheds respectively with these threshold values the dwm is applicable independently of the hydrograph duration in reaches with lengths longer than 50 m 5 conclusions the present study investigates the applicability of the diffusive wave model dwm in predicting the unsteady propagation of a mud flow wave represented through a shear thinning power law fluid described through the model proposed by ng and mei 1994 the analysis accounts for the non linearity of the governing equations which have been numerically solved for the full wave model fwm an explicit first order scheme in time and a second order finite volume method for the spatial discretization has been adopted the dwm has been numerically solved with an implicit finite volume scheme with a first order in space and time approximation different tests have been performed varying the wave duration of the hydrograph imposed at the inlet and considering different rheological index n several values of the froude f and of the kinematic wave k numbers the applicability conditions are expressed considering as indicators the mean values of the dimensionless error on the maximum flow depth and on the maximum discharge Œµ h and Œµ q respectively since positive errors lead to an overestimation of the maximum flow depth and flow rate in the presented analysis the dwm is considered safely applicable for positive values of Œµ h and Œµ q and for negative values larger than 5 about the mean error on the maximum flow depth present results indicate that it monotonically decreases with the wave duration with an asymptotic minimum negative value Œµ h min corresponding to quasi steady conditions conversely the mean error of the maximum flow discharge starting from a values at the lowest wave duration Œµ q min achieves a maximum positive value and then it decreases tending asymptotically to zero for quasi steady conditions these observations suggest that the conditions Œµ h min 5 and Œµ q min 5 guarantees the applicability of the dwm independently of the wave duration in terms of maximum flow depth and discharge respectivelly conversely when Œµ h min 5 there exists an upper bound of the wave duration below which the dwm can be safely applied for predicting the flow depth similarly when Œµ q min 5 the dwm can be adopted for evaluating the maximum discharge when the wave duration is larger than a lower bound for a fixed rheology the study of the Œµ h min and Œµ q min variability with respect to the governing dimensionless parameters f and k suggests that for a fixed f the condition Œµ h min 5 resp Œµ q min 5 is satisfied when the kinematic wave number exceeds the threshold value k h respectively k q indeed dwm can be safely applied independently of the hydrograph wave duration for the flow depth resp the flow rate prediction whenever k is larger than k h resp k q the k h and k q values have been determined for several values of the n f pair when the condition on k is not verified i e k k h respectively k k q further maps have been derived for evaluating the upper and lower bounds of wave duration for the safe application of the dwm in predicting the flow depth and the discharge respectively the presented results clearly indicate that the rheology substantially affects the magnitude of the errors reducing the applicability of dwm for shear thinning fluids finally the proposed methodology has been applied to two mud flows occurred in 1999 in southern italy and involving fluids with pronounced shear thinning behaviour it has shown that even in these extreme conditions the applicability region of the dwm is still of technical interest authors contributions conceptualization c d c m i t m and a v software c d c m i a v data analysis c d c m i and a v

4372,flood risk assessment and management in urbanized area experience an increasing reliance on the supporting information provided by numerical flood modeling as a rapid and efficient tool although hydrodynamic modeling based on shallow water equations requires less parameters than hydrologic ones uncertainties of the input factors describing both the driving forces and the complex urbanized environment still have important influences on the accuracy of the urban flood simulation results once induced into the modeling procedure the influences of input factors of engineering concern in urban flood hydrodynamic modeling in an intensely urbanized area of 0 58 km2 in the city of chongqing china with a mixture of different land use types are investigated in this study by taking advantage of a variance based global sensitivity analysis methodology with particular focus upon the interaction between the uncertainties of different input factors describing the external driving force the underlying urban surface the drainage loss and the spatial resolution of modeling the global sensitivity analysis results are examined with regard to maximum values of the flood extent water depth and discharge and their variation in the course of the urban flood propagation influences of the input factors and their interactions are observed to vary for different model outputs from a spatially distributed perspective a dependence of the interactions between input factors is found to be upon the relative location of their acting area associated to the land use type antagonistic effects of the input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss for the rainfall induced flood water accumulations and movements are analyzed with the flood evolution main effects of different input factors and their interactions are of a certain consistency with the underlying physical processes of the urban flood propagation from both static and temporal perspective

climate change and urbanization sun et al 2020 kundzewicz et al 2019 muis et al 2015 therefore the effective flood risk mitigation strategies is vitally important to be developed urgently numerical flood simulation informed by models is essential for providing significant information for flood risk assessment emergency response and water resource planning he et al 2020 hunter et al 2007 yalcin 2019 xue et al 2016 flood simulation with hydrodynamic model can effectively depict flood propagations and inundation processes over various highly complex topographies cea et al 2010 guerra et al 2014 xia et al 2017 such as intensely urbanized areas in urbanized environment some features deserve to be attached importance to such as topographic characteristics impervious build up area permeable surfaces and drainage capacity in the urban flood modeling the notably complex topographic features are important basic inputs for the hydrodynamic modeling since transient flows shocks and backwater effects can be induced with the representation of narrow gaps between steep gradients such as buildings testa et al 2007 xia et al 2011 two dimensional hydrodynamic models based on fully shallow water solver may have the capability to accurately reproduce these flow phenomena in capturing their characteristics kim et al 2012 with a fine enough spatial resolution of modeling when high resolution topographic data are available hunter et al 2008 kim et al 2020 finer spatial resolution may inevitably lead to non negligible augmentation of the computational burden and with the great demand to overcome this limitation of hydrodynamic modeling parallel computing technologies are becoming increasingly available in recent years noh et al 2018 sanders et al 2010 smith and liang 2013 villanueva and wright 2006 there is a spatial heterogeneity of the infiltration effect in the underlying urban surface with its impervious surfaces including roads buildings parking lots and plazas which are mixed with permeable areas like grasslands when taken into account in hydrodynamic model the infiltration rate can be estimated by scs cn green ampt and horton models caviedes voulli√®me et al 2012 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 mishra and singh 2013 the impervious artificial surfaces of urban area on which the flood water flows without infiltrating are generally connected to underground drainage systems and the water is collected by street inlets curbs or gutters before draining into the drainage network for the drainage effects one dimensional 1d sewer flow models are commonly combined or coupled with the two dimensional 2d overland flow models bisht et al 2016 chen et al 2016 fraga et al 2017 in urban flood hydrodynamic modeling however the lack of suitable drainage network data limits the application of 1d sewer modeling with fully 1d 2d combined or coupled models at present for many applications the drainage effects are generally represented by taking advantage of a rainfall reduction method with the design capacity of the drainage systems taken as the reduction rate h√©nonin et al 2015 smith et al 2017 yu et al 2016 with the increasing complexity of urban flood modeling the elements including incomplete data acquisition of detailed urban environment in a practical account imperfect representation of real urban features with more or less delicate spatial resolutions and vacancies in the understanding of the underlying physical processes may comprehensively result to the existence of substantial uncertainties in modeling procedures and results with respect to the model inputs the internal structures and different parameters abily et al 2016 jung and merwade 2015 savage et al 2016a quantification of the uncertainties from different origins is an inevitable issue of accurate prediction and reproduction in modeling practices hall et al 2005 teng et al 2017 liu et al 2020 to date sensitivity analysis is a general method to quantify the contribution of variables or parameters to the variability and uncertainty in outputs of numerical models of different kind which may be typically classified into two categories i e local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis the local sensitivity analysis method perturbs one variable or parameter at a time by a small amount in the vicinity of a specific point of interest in the parameter space and concentrates on local response of a certain model output based on the gradients tsubaki and kawahara 2013 in contrast global sensitivity analysis global sa varies all variables or parameters of interest across the potential range and can to some extent obtain the estimates of the uncertainty in each variable or parameter in a wider perspective considering the phenomenon of equifinality and the model complexity the methodology based on global sa can be applied to explore the complexity uncertainty trade off in order to find the factors with greatest influence and to rank them based on their importance ratto et al 2001 pappenberger et al 2008 saltelli et al 2008 with a variance based kind of global methods in global sa such as the variance based sobol method and derivative based morris method all variables or parameters of the model including both input factors and internal factors are allowed to be varied simultaneously providing a possibility of evaluating not only the contribution of each variable or parameter but also the interactions among all of them as contributions of model parameters are related to their influences on certain model outputs the interactions provide further insights into the simulation model s mechanism chen et al 2020 tang et al 2007 in the application to flooding issues modeled with hydrodynamic numerical methods global sa is primarily employed for hierarchical ranking of uncertain input parameters to a model output variability nossent et al 2011 garambois et al 2013 abily et al 2016 savage et al 2016a b the feasibility of the application of global sa for hydrodynamic modelling is confirmed with the relevant studies published in recent years with which a better knowledge about input parameters can be achieved abily et al 2015 2016 focused on the uncertain input parameters related to the high resolution topographic data in urban flood simulations with 2d hydraulic modelling and reported in quantifying the conspicuous contribution of the parameter related to the representation of terrain in densely urbanized areas chen et al 2018 took insight in first order global sensitivity indices of 1d and 2d hydraulic model for an experimental fluvial urban flood case and attributed the simulated water height variance mainly to the upstream and lateral inflow discharge and the bottom roughness for the understanding and prediction of drainage processes in urban flood simulation fraga et al 2016 by taking advantage of the variance based sobol s method in global sa revealed the greater effects of overflow parameters in comparison to sewer drainage parameters and highlighted the role played by overflow parameters in the enhancement of the model prediction reliability especially the manning coefficient of the impervious terrains which was identified as the most influential model parameter savage et al 2016a assessed with the global sa methodology the sensitivity of simulated water depth and inundation extent of a fluvial flood to various input factors includes spatial resolution topographic data inflow boundary condition and other model parameters and found temporal and spatial variations of the model parameter contributions nielsen and thorndahl 2018 presented a sensitivity analysis of an urban flood model integrating groundwater system overland flow sewer network and river network in the global sa framework and quantified the influence of a certain individual model parameter and correlated ones upon the simulated flood depth and area for an urban catchment surface drainage and rivers were discovered to contribute twice more than the sewer network to the output sensitivities according to these previous investigations concerning global sa the flood water depth and extent simulated with hydrodynamic models in urbanized area are generally revealed as being mostly affected by the driving forces such as the inflow discharge as boundary condition for fluvial urban flood simulations land use is also shown to make significant contributions to the urban flood modeling results dahri and abida 2017 together with the roughness of the underlying urban surface related to land use types to the best of the authors knowledge the existing global sa studies of urban floods concentrate mostly on fluvial ones and rarely revolve around rainfall induced floods for urbanized area although the model parameters are usually compared and sequenced for their influence following the principles and reasoning of global sa whether their influence may evolve in interplaying with the variation of other parameters or with the temporal evolution of the flood events still remains unclear and has rarely been involved in previous studies considering the complex urban topographic features the mixture of impervious artificial build up surfaces and scattered permeable surfaces together with the underground drainage system gathering water from street curbs or gutters along the road networks all of which may have impacts on the propagation and accumulation of urban flood water we are particularly interested in three questions 1 how influential the factors describing the driving force the underlying urban surface and the drainage capacity are for the hydrodynamic model outputs of engineering usefulness and to what extent they interplay with each other to change their influences 2 in which way the contribution of a certain factor particularly for those describing the underlying urban surface to the variance of hydrodynamic model results may vary with the size of its action area and whether its interactions with the other factors follow the same logic 3 whether the influences and the interactions of different factors as hydrodynamic flood modeling inputs exhibit non stationary behavior with conspicuousness and how they may change during the evolution of pluvial urban flood in this paper we focus on the contribution of different factors to the variance of the hydrodynamic modeling results of rainfall induced urban floods which can be believed to be non stationary and may interplay in between themselves influences of the input factors of different kind are examined and elucidated together with their interactions and temporal evolutions the case study area of the hydrodynamic simulations has been constructed with public accessed data sources including the precipitation records the underlying surface elevation the land cover information and a rough but reasonable preliminary estimation of the distribution of drainage inlets this may give the possibility for carrying out primary global sa for any urbanized area when facing the difficulty of immediate access to the very appropriate and precious basic data hydrodynamic simulations can be carried out with prevailing models including both open sourced ones and commercial ones depending on the model accessibility the basic data and hydrodynamic model construction are introduced in the methodology section section 2 together with a briefly presentation of the applied variance based global sa method analysis results of the influences and interactions of different key input parameters in hydrodynamic modeling of flood inundations in urbanized area including spatial resolution rainfall inputs and several others describing the underlying urban surface consisted of a mixture of building complexes roads and grass lands are presented and discussed in section 3 together with their variations with a changing action area and their temporal evolutions conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 methodology the methodology applied in this study is summarized within fig 1 starting from the construction of hydrodynamics model for urban flood simulation which

furthermore xia and liang 2018 and xia et al 2017 adapt the surface reconstruction method srm and implicit friction discretization scheme in this model in order to ensure stable and accurate descriptions of overland flows with dramatical changes of the water depth and ensure non negative water depth for applications involving wetting and drying over complex topography such as that in the urbanized area characterized with intense building complexes as the governing equations are solved with explicit numerical scheme the appropriate time step is controlled by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion the green ampt model is incorporated in hipims to simulate the infiltration process within the footprints of the scattered permeable areas e g gardens grass fields bare soil and woods in

where i is the infiltration rate lt 1 k s is hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h f is the metric suction head at the wetting front l and z f is wetting front depth l since the urbanized area includes extensive sewer drainage networks discharging the surface runoff the urban flooding simulation should assess the performance of drainage networks and include their effects fully 1d 2d coupled model presents a common choice for the drainage consideration however this kind of coupled model is largely dependent on reliable and detailed drainage network data which are quite complex and sometimes inaccessible in a practical account modelers are consequently obliged to adopt simplified approach for incorporating drainage effects i e rainfall reduction method yin et al 2016 yu et al 2016 which generally subtracts a certain water volume over the whole model domain the modified rainfall reduction method proposed and verified in xing et al 2019 is applied in this work for the inclusion of drainage losses of the overflow water which are calculated on the basis of the distributions of manholes and inlets as drainage collection points used in this study mainly along roads locations of the drainage collection points are determined with street view imageries collected from the online resources of baidu map api which provides very detailed information for most of the chinese cities manholes and inlets patterns are identified before being converted onto the computational grids as point sources within the 2d hydrodynamic model the drainage loss quantities are determined according to code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 in china hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive neal et al 2010 when applied onto complex urbanized area with appropriate

variance based global sensitivity analysis method the global sensitivity analysis with variance based method is applied in this work with its usefulness demonstrated for manipulating model exploitation over different combinations of values for inputs with uncertainties the global sa presents a logic opposite to deterministic analysis which takes a deterministic set of values for input variables the global sa with variance based method is featured with its model independence the capacity to capture the influence of the full range of variation of each input factor the appreciation of interaction effects among input factors and the capacity to tackle groups of input factors etc the essential idea of variance based global sensitivity analysis is to measure the relative influence of the uncertainty in each input factor by its contribution to the variance of the model output specifically the first order sensitivity index which also named main effect measuring the direct contribution to the output variance from individual variations of an input factor saltelli 2002 takes the first place to be calculated following which the total order sensitivity index or total effect is also typically calculated in reflecting the overall contribution both from individual variations and through interactions with other factors if a model output y can be expressed as y g x and the g function can be decomposed into 2 n functional terms of increasing dimensions in an inimitable way as 5 g x g 0 i g i x i i j i g ij x i x j g 12 n where 6 g 0 e y 7 g i e y x i g 0 8 g ij e y x i x j g i g j g 0 with square integrable g function and input variables independent with each other all the 2 n terms are orthogonal with each other taking variances to both sides of eq 7 gives 9 v y i v i i j i v ij v 12 n with 10 v i v g i v e y x i 11 v ij v g ij v e y x i x j v i v j where v i can also be written as v i v y e v y x i by making use of the total variance law e v y x i can be viewed as the average residual variance of model output with x i fixed over its full range leading to an explanation of the first order partial variance v i as the average reduction of model output variance resulting from fixing x i in determining the individual contribution of x i to the total variance v y importantly eq 11 shows the second order partial variance v ij which quantifies the interaction effect between x i and x j which signifies the interaction in pairs between two individual factors it is also possible to compute and interpret other higher order partial variances in a similar manner when the order increases up to the total number of the factors the total partial variance v ti computed with 12 v ti v y v e y x ƒ© e v y x ƒ© can be used to define the summation of all terms in eq 9 with subscripts including i incorporating both the individual effect of x i and its interaction effects with all the other input variables denoted by 13 x ƒ© x 1 x i 1 x i 1 x n v ti is thus determined by subtracting the main effect of x ƒ© from the total variance and the contribution of x i to the model output variance decreases with smaller value of the total partial variance the average residual variance of model output can be estimated with v ti as well when all the inputs but x i are fixed over their full ranges the first order sensitivity index s i or main effect the total order sensitivity index s ti or total effect and the second order sensitivity index s ij are consequently defined by standardizing v i v ti and v ij by the total variance v y as 14 s i v i v y v e y x i v y 15 s ti v ti v y v y v e y x ƒ© v y 16 s ij v ij v y v e y x i x j v i v j v y within which s i is commonly deemed as the basis for selecting important variables with s ti more suitable for screening non influential variables higher value for these sensitivity indices indicate a large influence over the variability of the output while low sensitivity indices indicate a small influence the interaction effects of x i with all other factors are calculated by the difference between these two indices which can be named as the interaction parts when the difference diminishes for all the factors the g function is regarded as an additive one with no occurrence of the interaction effects factors totally independent with each other the second order sensitivity index s ij reveals the amount of variance of y contributed by the interaction of two individual input factors x i and x j which gives the pairwise interaction effect between them the calculations of these indices follow the computational scheme proposed by saltelli et al 2010 2 4 sampling strategy and definition of variability space of the input factors and model outputs for the calculation of the global sensitivity indices of different orders determined by eq 14 to eq 16 the input factors of the hydrodynamic numerical model are given as stochastic variables which obey a certain probability distribution and following which the samples can be drawn by the use of a sampling strategy described by tarantola et al 2002a 2002b and lilburne and tarantola 2009 as earlier applications of such sampling approaches and in consequence by baroni and tarantola 2014 since the input factors in this work are represented by scalar numerical quantities the input factors are linked with a list of their possible realizations and the ranges or choices sampled of which are as indicative of the uncertainty or range of likely choices as possible for the input factors as continuous variables a very large number of possible values are sampled and included in the list so as to approximate the underlying continuous distribution for the input factors as discrete variables they are linked with a set of finite number of possible values for which the spatial resolution of this work presents an example with discrete number of choices for the hydrodynamic simulations for both continuous variables and discrete ones the index of each element in the list is defined as the desired scalar quantity x i following a uniform probability distribution and sampling can be performed with respect to the scalar indices x 1 x m whereas the evaluations of the numerical model are carried out against the original input factors defined by the sampled indices and the output samples thus obtained are then used to approximate the variance based global sensitivity indices including the main and total effects together with the second order ones in the application of this study ranges of the input factors as the parameters of the hydrodynamic model are represented in the following paragraphs and also listed in table 1 for the global sensitivity analysis which include the driving force rainfall inputs the spatial resolution or

storm formula can be expressed by the intensity duration frequency idf relationships according to the precipitation characteristics of the city of chongqing refer to the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 in china the 1 minute temporal resolution rainfall is generated by the chicago rain generator and the rainfall fields display a spatial uniformity with the relatively small extent of the affected area here we construct the perturbed design storm data at the 0 5 1 5 times range according to a baseline value of 50 year designedstormdata with the duration

in hydrodynamic models different manning coefficients are assigned for the friction of the surfaces based on their land use type i e n r for the build up artificial surfaces including roads and the spaces within building complexes whereas n p for all permeable area which are specifically grasslands in the study site of this work the manning coefficients are chosen from their plausible range based on the typical values as suggested in the literature e g mccuen et al 1996 with n r in the range of 0 01 0 05 m 1 3s and n p in the range of 0 15 0 4 m 1 3s iv hydraulic conductivity k s although intensely urbanized areas are featured with low permeability for most of their surfaces the influence of the infiltration processes in the scattered permeable surfaces conduces to minimize urban flooding risk the infiltration rate is estimated by the green ampt model in this work which relates to soil moisture and soil properties by choosing appropriate parameters following reports in literatures rawls et al 1983 herein with the possible soil properties in the vicinity of chongqing the value of hydraulic conductivity ranges between 11 78 and 0 03 cm hr according to different soil types i e sand clay loam etc in this work the spatial distribution of the permeable surfaces is given by the land use map v design capacity of drainage loss dl as described in section 2 1 limited by the availability of the detailed data of drainage systems this work considers the design capacity of the drainage loss at street inlets the design capacity of the drainage loss at street inlets can refer to the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 in china which is widely applied in most of the cities in china including the city of chongqing where our study site is extracted as the recommend in the code we choose the constant discharge 35 l s for the baseline value of the drainage capacity of street inlet as the discharge capacity may sometimes decrease due to partial blocking of the street inlets during heavy rains in their operation periods we consider the variation of the constant discharge within the range of 20 100 that of the baseline value the design discharge value of the street inlet drainage loss indicates that the rainfall water drains with this value as the maximum capacity when the rainfall intensity goes beyond for the variance based global sensitivity analysis with regard to all the analyzed input factors a base sample of n 5000 combinations is randomly drawn from this input variability space and following which the estimation of indices of the main and total effects according to the approximation strategy described in saltelli et al 2010 requires the construction of n m 2 2 20000 combinations of input factors with m indicating the number of input factors by recombining the elements in the base sample with the second order indices taken into consideration the combinations need to be fortified with additional ones and in total the model is thus evaluated against n 2 m 2 70000 input combinations for a complete analysis to the level of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the input factors and their interactions for spatially lumped model outputs 3 1 1 influence of the input factors and the general interactions fig 4 summarizes the interactions between the chosen input factors parameters of the hydrodynamic model together with the main and total effects from which the interactions are calculated for three spatially lumped model outputs the maximum flood extent mfe the average maximum water depth amwd and the average maximum discharge amd to which the modelers or decision makers pay more attention in urban flood modeling the grey crosses are the sensitivity measures computed from the bootstrap resamples and their distributions show a relatively good convergence with the sample size chosen in this study which leads to satisfactory analysis results for both the first order and total order indices although more combinations of the sampling of input factors parameters may give more precise results the efficiency of the global sa may be reduced and the time consumed may increase enormously even to inacceptable level especially for non stationary hydrodynamic modeling applied in this study in addition to the efficiency of the global sa method the gpu based algorithm of hipims is also essential for accomplishing the large amount of hydrodynamic model evaluations without which the model runs may become tens of times more time consuming as shown in fig 4 the most influential input factors parameters can be seen from the first order indices for different model outputs the rainfall rf for mfe and the spatial resolution sr or the grid size for amwd and amd it can be seen that with six input factors parameters chosen for the global sa the interactions are relatively important and generally with a magnitude comparable to the main effects values of first order indices although with lowest main effects the grid size sr manifests remarkably an important interaction part in fig 2 d which is several times larger than its first order index for the maximum flood extent with a water depth over 0 1 m as the model output therein a water depth threshold of 0 1 m can be used to identify obvious effect to flood consequences such as transportation and pedestrian safety moftakhari et al 2018 the large interaction part indicates that the influence of sr can be sensitively affected by variations or disturbances of other input factors parameters note that the interactions parts shown in the figure are the combined effects of all other input factors parameters more detailed interaction between different input factors parameters can only be examined with second order indices which may be discussed in the following subsection with this important interaction part for sr although it is not influential in the first order level its total effect overcomes those of the input factors parameters of the underlying urban surface n r n p and k s and drainage loss dl n r n p k s and dl and no longer presents a negligible factor when we pay attention to the flood extent in hydrodynamic modeling this implies that the influence of sr may increase with the variations of other parameters and also with the uncertainty induced by other parameters more or less important for the flood extent and the maximum water depth which are both directly related to the water volume induced in the simulation domain it is reasonable that the inundation driving force rf presents the first ranking factor but we can see that it also interacts with the influence of other input factors the input factors of the underlying urban surface n r n p and k s and drainage loss dl are revealed to be almost equally influential for both mfe and amwd with the first order indices and their quasi equal position can be further confirmed with their interaction parts very similar to each other for the average maximum discharge amd which is more related to the flow movements the spatial resolution of modeling plays a more important role and seems to be spared from the interacting effects of other input factors with very limited interaction part compared to its first order index as main flow channels in urbanized area during heavy rainfall the roads have their roughness n r slightly more influential than the other three input factors describing the properties of the underlying urban surface and drainage loss dl and this influence is physically less vulnerable to the effects from other input factors with an interaction value very limited the interaction parts of the input factors of the hydrodynamic model are listed in table 2 3 1 2 the pairwise interactions between different input factors in order to extract the interaction in pairs between the input factors from the global sensitivity analysis results the second order indices s ij among the six model input factors calculated with eq 16 are illustrated in fig 5 in form of heat map the specific influence of one input factor upon another can be identified from their intersection square when we take a look at the maximum flood extent mfe and the average maximum water depth amwd similar patterns can be found for the interactions among different input factors the maximum value of the second order indices is attributed to the pair sr rf which are the two significant input factors that cannot be overlooked in the modeling either with very strong main effects or with important total effects in addition we can see that the interactions between sr and the other four input factors n r n p k s and dl are all over 0 001 which are generally two or more times larger than the values in other squares from which we can infer that the very large interaction part of sr for mfe in fig 4 is not only related to the effects of rf but comes from those of other input factors as well this confirms further what we observe from the interaction part for sr in fig 4 d for the averaged maximum discharge amd the road roughness described by n r is found to interplay significantly with other input factors not only the most influential rf and sr but also n p k s and dl as the roads present important flow channels for the rainfall induced inundations in urbanized area the water blocking effects of the road surface roughness may be worthy of more concerns of the modelers when examining the flow movements as the drainage collecting points are physical outlets of the rainfall water from the simulation domain relatively strong interaction between the rainfall and the drainage loss is also observed and this strong interaction seem more obvious for the averaged maximum discharge amd since most of the drainage loss occurs within the footprints of the roads which shows a kind of consistency with the physical world on the other hand there are also typically small values of the interactions which can be seen in the heat maps for the three model outputs the parameters of the permeable area n p and k s interplay reasonably little with the drainage loss dl as the permeable area and the drainage loss points are located relatively far away from each other in this study area we may imply from this observation the existence of the relevancy between the parameters interactions and their acting locations some independence of the influence of the two input factors of the permeable area n p and k s can also be noticed from the second order heat maps although they make their effects both upon the grassland as permeable surface in our case we see that they influence different aspects of the flood water flow with n p mainly having its effects on the flow movements and k s on the water volume and in consequence the interaction may become insignificant for a specific model output 3 1 3 variations of influences and interactions of input factors with the action area in previous subsections we see that the influences of several input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss appear to some extent trivial in face of the predominant rf and sr note that the action areas of rf and sr both cover the whole simulation domain we put forward a question that whether the relatively small action area limits the influence of certain input factors e g the permeable area covers only 0 05 km2 about 7 6 of the model domain as the action area of n p and k s and an enlargement of the action area may increase the influence we take these permeable area as an example for examining the variation of input factor influence with the change of its associated action area for this purpose we expand the covering surface of permeable area by adding parcels of permeable area in the simulation domain in a relatively homogeneous way and carry out new simulations and global sa with the changes the results are analyzed for a doubled tripled and quadrupled permeable area as shown in fig 6 a to d in contrary to our instincts in assuming a positive correlation between the influence and the action area a net decline of the main effects first order indices can be found for the two input factors n p and k s associated with the permeable area in all three model outputs the maximum flood extent mfe the average maximum water depth amwd and the average maximum discharge amd as illustrated in fig 7 this decline is also observed for the n r and dl associated with the road roughness and the drainage loss as the most significant input factor for mfe and amwd the rainfall rf is found to have its influence further elevated by the expansions of permeable areas as the second order indices calculated for the pairs rf n p and rf k s are relatively large for mfe and amwd respectively indicating important interactions between the rainfall and the input factors associated with the permeable areas we may infer that the rainfall probably gains its augmentation of influence through these interactions with variations of the action surface of the permeable areas on the other hand although the main effects of n p and k s drop apparently we see a growing trend for the general interaction parts of k s for the averaged maximum water depth as the model output with more permeable areas this growing trend is found to overcome the dropping of the first order index and lead to a slightly increasing total order index for k s this large general interaction part indicates that the influence of k s may be more sensitive to the variations of other input factors when its action area increases and the modelers may pay more attention to the determination of other input factors instead to reduce the effects of possible errors or deviations of k s 3 2 influence and interactions of the input factors during the evolution of urban flood 3 2 1 temporal variations of main effects with the records of the chosen model outputs at different output times variations of the influence of the input factors in time are analyzed with the first order indices reported in fig 8 for the spatially lumped outputs including the flood extent fe the average maximum water depth amwd and the average maximum discharge amd the rainfall as the only driving force presents in most of the time the most influential factor on the basis of its main effects calculated over the bootstrap resamples since the flood extent relates mainly to the water volume induced into the model domain it is empirically true that the temporal variation of the rainfall influence follows that of the rainfall time series however it is worth noting that the rainfall influence is balanced by the input factors of the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss during the peak phase in experiencing a kind of plateau period instead and it is also during this period the input factors of the underlying urban surface n r n p k s and dl present almost simultaneously a constantly growing influence as these input factors of the underlying urban surface present water draining and blocking effects we can see that their effects become more important with an increasing flood water volume and this physical process can be captured to some extent by the global sa although the spatial resolution sr has been viewed as ranking the least influential among all the input factors in question from the static results in section 3 1 for the flood extent as the model output we can see that it does not constantly succumb to others sr ranks second at the start of the flood just behind the driving force and picks up during the drying phase these observations may confirm the non negligible impact of the spatial resolution on the flood extent estimation with relatively limited water depth consistent with the static results from section 3 1 the amwd and amd are in general dominated by the rainfall inputs followed by the spatial resolution sr and these two predominant factors present a kind of competitive relationship over time as the water depth and discharge are more tightly related to the movements of flood flow sr reasonably plays more important role on them than on the flood extent as what it does statically for the maximum values of the output over the whole time period although we can still rank the several input factors of the underlying urban surface according to their main effects we admit that very slight disparity can be observed among their influences differing from the sr the temporal variations of their influences are found to be in agreement with that of the rainfall influence which can be seen as a kind of symbiotic relationship 3 2 2 temporal variations of the interaction parts fig 9 reports the variations of the interaction parts of the six input factors for the three model outputs during the evolution of the rainfall induced flood in the study site for the flood extent the interaction parts of sr are observed to be much larger two times or more than those of other input factors except at the very beginning of the flood occurrence the sr curve also shows that the interactions between the spatial resolution or the grid size increases with the amount of water induced into the simulation domain at the end of the first ten minutes shortly after the start of the rainfall event the interaction part of the rainfall rf is found to be important and very close to that of sr as the rainfall intensity at this phase of the event is very limited it is physically reasonable that its effects suffer from important influences of other factors n r n p k s and dl which present blocking and reducing effects for the induced pluvial water we see that the interaction part of rf drops when the rainfall intensity increases and the other input factors begin to go under more important influence and interaction with the rainfall for the model outputs amwd and amd the interaction parts of the input factors show fluctuations over time the comparison with the temporal variations of the first order indices in fig 8 reveals that the interactions present a kind of competitive relationship with the main effects and both the main effects and the interaction parts fluctuate around relatively stable values without obvious trends of rising or dropping 3 3 discussion the factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss which induce water draining and blocking effects are generally found to be of equal importance for the model results from the perspective of water volume but their influences are different in terms of water movement similar to previous findings in the literature chen et al 2018 fraga et al 2016 liu et al 2020 bottom roughnesses and more precisely the manning coefficient on surfaces with different land use are found to be of importance for the hydrodynamic model outputs including the flood water depth and discharge in our study for the intensely urbanized area as the roads present principal corridors of flow movements the roughness of road surface is revealed to be more influential for the flood water discharge in the study area from the same perspective spatial resolution of modeling is found of very high significance for the flood water discharge but of minor significance of the flood extent and water depth however the important interactions between the spatial resolution and the other input factors imply that although with a minor influence for certain model outputs the influence of spatial resolution may be prey to the impacts coming from the uncertainties of other input factors as a higher or lower spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic modeling represents better or worse terrain features of the urbanized area especially the building complexes we can intuitively judge that the sensitivity of the spatial resolution may decrease with less intense buildings presented in the study area although the relevant sensitivity behavior presented in this work for the spatial resolution may be thus of certain site dependence results obtained here may still be applicable to other sites with similar level of development for a general estimation as the driving force of the pluvial urban floods the rainfall inputs are revealed to be of high level of importance not only in its main effects on all the analyzed model results but also in the interactions with the other input factors the sensitivity of the rainfall as the driving force can be highlighted for the flood extent and the flood water depth which presents a finding analogous to those of thomas savage et al 2016a and chen et al 2018 although they apply the inflow discharge as the driving force in their study the pluvial driving force also shows more important influence during the flood rising phase than the peak and recession phase in this study in the temporal analysis of the global sa indices of different input factors the antagonistic effects of those describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss are well captured by the variations of main effects and interactions with the rainfall induced flood water volume accumulated on the urban surface during the evolution of the pluvial urban floods from a spatially distributed point of view the interactions between the input factors are found to be dependent on the distance between their acting areas which are usually associated with land use type and the interactions decrease when the input factors act far away from each other by identifying influential or insignificant input factors or model parameters of the urban flood hydrodynamic modeling the quality of modeling may be enhanced with an emphasis on the preparation and determination of certain input factors of higher level of importance with the analysis of the interactions between different input factors in the modeling new understandings can be achieved about how the uncertainties of the input factors may have effects on the others and whether the influence of a certain input factor can be ignored with minor main effects the temporal analysis of the variations of the influences and interactions of the input factors allow us to gain insights into the effects of the input factors in course of an urban flood event and the results from both static and temporal perspective of the global sensitivity analysis results main effects of different input factors and their interactions are found to be consistent with the underlying physical processes of the urban flood propagation 4 conclusion the influences of the input factors or model parameters of engineering concern in urban flood hydrodynamic modeling are investigated by taking advantage of a variance based global sensitivity analysis methodology with particular focus upon the interaction between the uncertainties of different input factors describing the external driving force the underlying urban surface the drainage loss and the spatial resolution of modeling a model domain with a mixture of different land use types has been chosen for the hydrodynamic modeling of the pluvial floods and the global sensitivity analysis several key variables with which the modelers or decision makers are concerned have been selected as the model outputs including the flood extent the water depth and the discharge which are used for the objective functions of the global sa relevant to the research questions that we put forward the following conclusions can be drawn with the analysis performed in this work 1 in identifying the influences of different input factors with the main effects calculated with the variance based global sa method general global sensitivity patterns of hydrodynamic modeling of urban flood have been obtained for different model outputs as objective functions of the analysis contributions of the driving force are found to prevail over those of the factors describing the urban surface and interact strongly with them with the second order global sensitivity indices more meticulous interaction effects between pairs of the input factors have also been discerned 2 although the spatial resolution employed in the hydrodynamic modeling is revealed by its main effects as of minor importance for a certain model outputs like the flood extent its influence is found to be important for modeling results related to the flood water movements and vary in strongly interplaying with other input factors although the sensitivity patterns obtained for the spatial resolution are of a certain site dependence they may still applicable to urbanized areas with similar level of development as the study site of this work and in consequence may probably not be despised with the uncertainties induced by the other input factors 3 from the examination with regard to the permeable surfaces in this work the influence of the input factors may not necessarily increase with an augmentation of their action area however the interactions of these factors with the driving force exhibit a growing trend and consequently lead to an increasing total effects from a spatially distributed point of view the interactions between the input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss are found to be dependent on the distance between their acting areas which are usually associated with land use type and minor interactions can be observed when the input factors act far away from each other 4 in addition to the analysis with regard to the static model results the global sensitivity patterns of the input factors of hydrodynamic modeling are revealed to be conspicuously non stationary and the global sa indices of input factors vary differently during the evolution of the pluvial urban floods with the variations of the rainfall induced flood water volume accumulated on the urban surface antagonistic effects of the input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss upon the rainfall inputs can be captured with the global sa which is of a certain consistency with the underlying physical processes of the urban flood propagation credit authorship contribution statement yun xing methodology

4372,flood risk assessment and management in urbanized area experience an increasing reliance on the supporting information provided by numerical flood modeling as a rapid and efficient tool although hydrodynamic modeling based on shallow water equations requires less parameters than hydrologic ones uncertainties of the input factors describing both the driving forces and the complex urbanized environment still have important influences on the accuracy of the urban flood simulation results once induced into the modeling procedure the influences of input factors of engineering concern in urban flood hydrodynamic modeling in an intensely urbanized area of 0 58 km2 in the city of chongqing china with a mixture of different land use types are investigated in this study by taking advantage of a variance based global sensitivity analysis methodology with particular focus upon the interaction between the uncertainties of different input factors describing the external driving force the underlying urban surface the drainage loss and the spatial resolution of modeling the global sensitivity analysis results are examined with regard to maximum values of the flood extent water depth and discharge and their variation in the course of the urban flood propagation influences of the input factors and their interactions are observed to vary for different model outputs from a spatially distributed perspective a dependence of the interactions between input factors is found to be upon the relative location of their acting area associated to the land use type antagonistic effects of the input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss for the rainfall induced flood water accumulations and movements are analyzed with the flood evolution main

2014 xia et al 2017 such as intensely urbanized areas in urbanized environment some features deserve to be attached importance to such as topographic characteristics impervious build up area permeable surfaces and drainage capacity in the urban flood modeling the notably complex topographic features are important basic inputs for the hydrodynamic modeling since transient flows shocks and backwater effects can be induced with the representation of narrow gaps between steep gradients such as buildings testa et al 2007 xia et al 2011 two dimensional hydrodynamic models based on fully shallow water solver may have the capability to accurately reproduce these flow phenomena in capturing their characteristics kim et al 2012 with a fine enough spatial resolution of modeling when high resolution topographic data are available hunter et al 2008 kim et al 2020 finer spatial resolution may inevitably lead to non negligible augmentation of the computational burden and with the great demand to

and wright 2006 there is a spatial heterogeneity of the infiltration effect in the underlying urban surface with its impervious surfaces including roads buildings parking lots and plazas which are mixed with permeable areas like grasslands when taken into account in hydrodynamic model the infiltration rate can be estimated by scs cn green ampt and horton models caviedes voulli√®me et al 2012 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 mishra and singh 2013 the impervious artificial surfaces of urban area on which the flood water flows without infiltrating are generally connected to underground drainage systems and the water is collected by street inlets curbs or gutters before draining into the drainage network for the drainage effects one dimensional 1d sewer flow models are commonly combined or coupled with the two dimensional 2d overland flow models bisht et al 2016 chen et al 2016 fraga et al 2017 in urban flood hydrodynamic modeling however the lack of suitable drainage network data limits the application of 1d sewer modeling with fully 1d 2d combined or coupled models at present for many applications the drainage effects are generally represented by taking advantage of a rainfall reduction method with the design capacity of the drainage systems taken as the reduction rate h√©nonin et al 2015 smith et al 2017 yu et al 2016 with the increasing complexity of urban flood modeling the elements including incomplete data acquisition of detailed urban environment in a practical account imperfect representation of real urban features with more or less delicate spatial resolutions and vacancies in the understanding of the underlying physical processes may comprehensively result to the existence of substantial uncertainties in modeling procedures and results with respect to the model inputs the internal structures and different parameters abily et al 2016 jung and merwade 2015 savage et al 2016a quantification of the uncertainties from different origins is an inevitable issue of accurate prediction and reproduction in modeling practices hall et al 2005 teng et al 2017 liu et al 2020 to date sensitivity analysis is a general method to quantify the contribution of variables or parameters to the variability and uncertainty in outputs of numerical models of different kind which may be typically classified into two categories i e local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis the local sensitivity analysis method perturbs one variable or parameter at a time by a small amount in the vicinity of a specific point of interest in the parameter space and concentrates on local response of a certain model output based on the gradients tsubaki and kawahara 2013 in contrast global sensitivity analysis global sa varies all variables or parameters of interest across the potential range and can to some extent obtain the estimates of the uncertainty in each variable or parameter in a wider perspective considering the phenomenon of equifinality and the model complexity the methodology based on global sa can be applied to explore the complexity uncertainty trade off in order to find the factors with greatest influence and to rank them based on their importance ratto et al 2001 pappenberger et al 2008 saltelli et al 2008 with a variance based kind of global methods in global sa such as the variance based sobol method and derivative based morris method all variables or parameters of the model including both input factors and internal factors are allowed to be varied simultaneously providing a possibility of evaluating not only the contribution of each variable or parameter but also the interactions among all of them as contributions of model parameters are related to their influences on certain model outputs the interactions provide further insights into the simulation model s mechanism chen et al 2020 tang et al 2007 in the application to flooding issues modeled with hydrodynamic numerical methods global sa is primarily employed for hierarchical ranking of uncertain input parameters to a model output variability nossent et al 2011 garambois et al 2013 abily et al 2016 savage et al 2016a b the feasibility of the application of global sa for hydrodynamic modelling is confirmed with the relevant studies published in recent years with which a better knowledge about input parameters can be achieved abily et al 2015 2016 focused on the uncertain input parameters related to the high resolution topographic data in urban flood simulations with 2d hydraulic modelling and reported in quantifying the conspicuous contribution of the parameter related to the representation of terrain in densely urbanized areas chen et al 2018 took insight in first order global sensitivity indices of 1d and 2d hydraulic model for an experimental fluvial urban flood case and attributed the simulated water height variance mainly to the upstream and lateral inflow discharge and the bottom roughness for the understanding and prediction of drainage processes in urban flood simulation fraga et al 2016 by taking advantage of the variance based sobol s method in global sa revealed the greater effects of overflow parameters in comparison to sewer drainage parameters and highlighted the role played by overflow parameters in the enhancement of the model prediction reliability especially the manning coefficient of the impervious terrains which was identified as the most influential model parameter savage et al 2016a assessed with the global sa methodology the sensitivity of simulated water depth and inundation extent of a fluvial flood to various input factors includes spatial resolution topographic data inflow boundary condition and other model parameters and found temporal and spatial variations of the model parameter contributions nielsen and thorndahl 2018 presented a sensitivity analysis of an urban flood model integrating groundwater system overland flow sewer network and river network in the global sa framework and quantified the influence of a certain individual model parameter and correlated ones upon the simulated flood depth and area for an urban catchment surface drainage and rivers were discovered to contribute twice more than the sewer network to the output sensitivities according to these previous investigations concerning global sa the flood water depth and extent simulated with hydrodynamic models in urbanized area are generally revealed as being mostly affected by the driving forces such as the inflow discharge as boundary condition for fluvial urban flood simulations land use is also shown to make significant contributions to the urban flood modeling results dahri and abida 2017 together with the roughness of the underlying urban surface related to land use types to the best of the authors knowledge the existing global sa studies of urban floods concentrate mostly on fluvial ones and rarely revolve around rainfall induced floods for urbanized area although the model parameters are usually compared and sequenced for their influence following the principles and reasoning of global sa whether their influence may evolve in interplaying with the variation of other parameters or with the temporal evolution of the flood events still remains unclear and has rarely been involved in previous studies considering the complex urban topographic features the mixture of impervious artificial build up surfaces and scattered permeable surfaces together with the underground drainage system gathering water from street curbs or gutters along the road networks all of which may have impacts on the propagation and accumulation of urban flood water we are particularly interested in three questions 1 how influential the factors describing the driving force the underlying urban surface and the drainage capacity are for the hydrodynamic model outputs of engineering usefulness and to what extent they interplay with each other to change their influences 2 in which way the contribution of a certain factor particularly for those describing the underlying urban surface to the variance of hydrodynamic model results may vary with the size of its action area and whether its interactions with the other factors follow the same logic 3 whether the influences and the interactions of different factors as hydrodynamic flood modeling inputs exhibit non stationary behavior with conspicuousness and how they may change during the evolution of pluvial urban flood in this paper we focus on the contribution of different factors to the variance of the hydrodynamic modeling results of rainfall induced urban floods which can be believed to be non stationary and may interplay in between themselves influences of the input factors of different kind are examined and elucidated together with their interactions and temporal evolutions the case study area of the hydrodynamic simulations has been constructed with public accessed data sources including the precipitation records the underlying surface elevation the land cover information and a rough but reasonable preliminary estimation of the distribution of drainage inlets this may give the possibility for carrying out primary global sa for any urbanized area when facing the difficulty of immediate access to the very appropriate and precious basic data hydrodynamic simulations can be carried out with prevailing models including both open sourced ones and commercial ones depending on the model accessibility the basic data and hydrodynamic model construction are introduced in the methodology section section 2 together with a briefly presentation of the applied variance based global sa method analysis results of the influences and interactions of different key input parameters in hydrodynamic modeling of flood inundations in urbanized area including spatial resolution rainfall inputs and several others describing the underlying urban surface consisted of a mixture of building complexes roads and grass lands are presented and discussed in section 3 together with their variations with a changing action area and their temporal evolutions conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 methodology the methodology applied in this study is summarized within fig 1 starting from the construction of hydrodynamics model for urban flood simulation which

furthermore xia and liang 2018 and xia et al 2017 adapt the surface reconstruction method srm and implicit friction discretization scheme in this model in order to ensure stable and accurate descriptions of overland flows with dramatical changes of the water depth and ensure non negative water depth for applications involving wetting and drying over complex topography such as that in the urbanized area characterized with intense building complexes as the governing equations are solved with explicit numerical scheme the appropriate time step is controlled by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion the green ampt model is incorporated in hipims to simulate the infiltration process within the footprints of the scattered permeable areas e g gardens grass fields bare soil and woods in

where i is the infiltration rate lt 1 k s is hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h f is the metric suction head at the wetting front l and z f is wetting front depth l since the urbanized area includes extensive sewer drainage networks discharging the surface runoff the urban flooding simulation should assess the performance of drainage networks and include their effects fully 1d 2d coupled model presents a common choice for the drainage consideration however this kind of coupled model is largely dependent on reliable and detailed drainage network data which are quite complex and sometimes inaccessible in a practical account modelers are consequently obliged to adopt simplified approach for incorporating drainage effects i e rainfall reduction method yin et al 2016 yu et al 2016 which generally subtracts a certain water volume over the whole model domain the modified rainfall reduction method proposed and verified in xing et al 2019 is applied in this work for the inclusion of drainage losses of the overflow water which are calculated on the basis of the distributions of manholes and inlets as drainage collection points used in this study mainly along roads locations of the drainage collection points are determined with street view imageries collected from the online resources of baidu map api which provides very detailed information for most of the chinese cities manholes and inlets patterns are identified before being converted onto the computational grids as point sources within the 2d hydrodynamic model the drainage loss quantities are determined according to code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 in china hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive neal et al 2010 when applied onto complex urbanized area with appropriate

variance based global sensitivity analysis method the global sensitivity analysis with variance based method is applied in this work with its usefulness demonstrated for manipulating model exploitation over different combinations of values for inputs with uncertainties the global sa presents a logic opposite to deterministic analysis which takes a deterministic set of values for input variables the global sa with variance based method is featured with its model independence the capacity to capture the influence of the full range of variation of each input factor the appreciation of interaction effects among input factors and the capacity to tackle groups of input factors etc the essential idea of variance based global sensitivity analysis is to measure the relative influence of the uncertainty in each input factor by its contribution to the variance of the model output specifically the first order sensitivity index which also named main effect measuring the direct contribution to the output variance from individual variations of an input factor saltelli 2002 takes the first place to be calculated following which the total order sensitivity index or total effect is also typically calculated in reflecting the overall contribution both from individual variations and through interactions with other factors if a model output y can be expressed as y g x and the g function can be decomposed into 2 n functional terms of increasing dimensions in an inimitable way as 5 g x g 0 i g i x i i j i g ij x i x j g 12 n where 6 g 0 e y 7 g i e y x i g 0 8 g ij e y x i x j g i g j g 0 with square integrable g function and input variables independent with each other all the 2 n terms are orthogonal with each other taking variances to both sides of eq 7 gives 9 v y i v i i j i v ij v 12 n with 10 v i v g i v e y x i 11 v ij v g ij v e y x i x j v i v j where v i can also be written as v i v y e v y x i by making use of the total variance law e v y x i can be viewed as the average residual variance of model output with x i fixed over its full range leading to an explanation of the first order partial variance v i as the average reduction of model output variance resulting from fixing x i in determining the individual contribution of x i to the total variance v y importantly eq 11 shows the second order partial variance v ij which quantifies the interaction effect between x i and x j which signifies the interaction in pairs between two individual factors it is also possible to compute and interpret other higher order partial variances in a similar manner when the order increases up to the total number of the factors the total partial variance v ti computed with 12 v ti v y v e y x ƒ© e v y x ƒ© can be used to define the summation of all terms in eq 9 with subscripts including i incorporating both the individual effect of x i and its interaction effects with all the other input variables denoted by 13 x ƒ© x 1 x i 1 x i 1 x n v ti is thus determined by subtracting the main effect of x ƒ© from the total variance and the contribution of x i to the model output variance decreases with smaller value of the total partial variance the average residual variance of model output can be estimated with v ti as well when all the inputs but x i are fixed over their full ranges the first order sensitivity index s i or main effect the total order sensitivity index s ti or total effect and the second order sensitivity index s ij are consequently defined by standardizing v i v ti and v ij by the total variance v y as 14 s i v i v y v e y x i v y 15 s ti v ti v y v y v e y x ƒ© v y 16 s ij v ij v y v e y x i x j v i v j v y within which s i is commonly deemed as the basis for selecting important variables with s ti more suitable for screening non influential variables higher value for these sensitivity indices indicate a large influence over the variability of the output while low sensitivity indices indicate a small influence the interaction effects of x i with all other factors are calculated by the difference between these two indices which can be named as the interaction parts when the difference diminishes for all the factors the g function is regarded as an additive one with no occurrence of the interaction effects factors totally independent with each other the second order sensitivity index s ij reveals the amount of variance of y contributed by the interaction of two individual input factors x i and x j which gives the pairwise interaction effect between them the calculations of these indices follow the computational scheme proposed by saltelli et al 2010 2 4 sampling strategy and definition of variability space of the input factors and model outputs for the calculation of the global sensitivity indices of different orders determined by eq 14 to eq 16 the input factors of the hydrodynamic numerical model are given as stochastic variables which obey a certain probability distribution and following which the samples can be drawn by the use of a sampling strategy described by tarantola et al 2002a 2002b and lilburne and tarantola 2009 as earlier applications of such sampling approaches and in consequence by baroni and tarantola 2014 since the input factors in this work are represented by scalar numerical quantities the input factors are linked with a list of their possible realizations and the ranges or choices sampled of which are as indicative of the uncertainty or range of likely choices as possible for the input factors as continuous variables a very large number of possible values are sampled and included in the list so as to approximate the underlying continuous distribution for the input factors as discrete variables they are linked with a set of finite number of possible values for which the spatial resolution of this work presents an example with discrete number of choices for the hydrodynamic simulations for both continuous variables and discrete ones the index of each element in the list is defined as the desired scalar quantity x i following a uniform probability distribution and sampling can be performed with respect to the scalar indices x 1 x m whereas the evaluations of the numerical model are carried out against the original input factors defined by the sampled indices and the output samples thus obtained are then used to approximate the variance based global sensitivity indices including the main and total effects together with the second order ones in the application of this study ranges of the input factors as the parameters of the hydrodynamic model are represented in the following paragraphs and also listed in table 1 for the global sensitivity analysis which include the driving force rainfall inputs the spatial resolution or spatial grid size of modeling the urban surface layer properties and the design capacity of drainage loss i spatial resolution sr with the micro scale topographic and blockage effects such as buildings in urbanized area we consider four choices for spatial resolutions i e 5 10 15 20 m the bare earth terrain data available for the current study has an original 12 5 m spatial resolution as mentioned in section 2 2 buildings are reinserted onto bare earth terrain data on the basis of their footprints from land use map by making use of the building block bb method with various spatial resolution ii rainfall inputs rf in order to make an assessment of the influence of rainfall intensities for hydrodynamic model we represent the rainfall input through designed storm data the design storm formula can be expressed by the intensity duration frequency idf relationships according to the precipitation characteristics of the city of chongqing refer to the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 in china the 1 minute temporal resolution rainfall is generated by the chicago rain generator and the rainfall fields display a spatial uniformity with the relatively small extent of the affected area here we construct the perturbed design storm data at the 0 5 1 5 times range according to a baseline value of 50 year designedstormdata with the duration of 2 h iii manning coefficient n r n p manning coefficient is an important model parameter for controlling the flow characteristics e g the velocity the peak flow discharge the duration of peak flow in hydrodynamic models different manning coefficients are assigned for the friction of the surfaces based on their land use type i e n r for the build up artificial surfaces including roads and the spaces within building complexes whereas n p for all permeable area which are specifically grasslands in the study site of this work the manning coefficients are chosen from their plausible range based on the typical values as suggested in the literature e g mccuen et al 1996 with n r in the range of 0 01 0 05 m 1 3s and n p in the range of 0 15 0 4 m 1 3s iv hydraulic conductivity k s although intensely urbanized areas are featured with low permeability for most of their surfaces the influence of the infiltration processes in the scattered permeable surfaces conduces to minimize urban flooding risk the infiltration rate is estimated by the green ampt model in this work which relates to soil moisture and soil properties by choosing appropriate parameters following reports in literatures rawls et al 1983 herein with the possible soil properties in the vicinity of chongqing the value of hydraulic conductivity ranges between 11 78 and 0 03 cm hr according to different soil types i e sand clay loam etc in this work the spatial distribution of the permeable surfaces is given by the land use map v design capacity of drainage loss dl as described in section 2 1 limited by the availability of the detailed data of drainage systems this work considers the design capacity of the drainage loss at street inlets the design capacity of the drainage loss at street inlets can refer to the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering gb 50014 2006 in china which is widely applied in most of the cities in china including the city of chongqing where our study site is extracted as the recommend in the code we choose the constant discharge 35 l s for the baseline value of the drainage capacity of street inlet as the discharge capacity may sometimes decrease due to partial blocking of the street inlets during heavy rains in their operation periods we consider the variation of the constant discharge within the range of 20 100 that of the baseline value the design discharge value of the street inlet drainage loss indicates that the rainfall water drains with this value as the maximum capacity when the rainfall intensity goes beyond for the variance based global sensitivity analysis with regard to all the analyzed input factors a base sample of n 5000 combinations is randomly drawn from this input variability space and following which the estimation of indices of the main and total effects according to the approximation strategy described in saltelli et al 2010 requires the construction of n m 2 2 20000 combinations of input factors with m indicating the number of input factors by recombining the elements in the base sample with the second order indices taken into consideration the combinations need to be fortified with additional ones and in total the model is thus evaluated against n 2 m 2 70000 input combinations for a complete analysis to the level of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the input factors and their interactions for spatially lumped model outputs 3 1 1 influence of the input factors and the general interactions fig 4 summarizes the interactions between the chosen input factors parameters of the hydrodynamic model together with the main and total effects from which the interactions are calculated for three spatially lumped model outputs the maximum flood extent mfe the average maximum water depth amwd and the average maximum discharge amd to which the modelers or decision makers pay more attention in urban flood modeling the grey crosses are the sensitivity measures computed from the bootstrap resamples and their distributions show a relatively good convergence with the sample size chosen in this study which leads to satisfactory analysis results for both the first order and total order indices although more combinations of the sampling of input factors parameters may give more precise results the efficiency of the global sa may be reduced and the time consumed may increase enormously even to inacceptable level especially for non stationary hydrodynamic modeling applied in this study in addition to the efficiency of the global sa method the gpu based algorithm of hipims is also essential for accomplishing the large amount of hydrodynamic model evaluations without which the model runs may become tens of times more time consuming as shown in fig 4 the most influential input factors parameters can be seen from the first order indices for different model outputs the rainfall rf for mfe and the spatial resolution sr or the grid size for amwd and amd it can be seen that with six input factors parameters chosen for the global sa the interactions are relatively important and generally with a magnitude comparable to the main effects values of first order indices although with lowest main effects the grid size sr manifests remarkably an important interaction part in fig 2 d which is several times larger than its first order index for the maximum flood extent with a water depth over 0 1 m as the model output therein a water depth threshold of 0 1 m can be used to identify obvious effect to flood consequences such as transportation and pedestrian safety moftakhari et al 2018 the large interaction part indicates that the influence of sr can be sensitively affected by variations or disturbances of other input factors parameters note that the interactions parts shown in the figure are the combined effects of all other input factors parameters more detailed interaction between different input factors parameters can only be examined with second order indices which may be discussed in the following subsection with this important interaction part for sr although it is not influential in the first order level its total effect overcomes those of the input factors parameters of the underlying urban surface n r n p and k s and drainage loss dl n r n p k s and dl and no longer presents a negligible factor when we pay attention to the flood extent in hydrodynamic modeling this implies that the influence of sr may increase with the variations of other parameters and also with the uncertainty induced by other parameters more or less important for the flood extent and the maximum water depth which are both directly related to the water volume induced in the simulation domain it is reasonable that the inundation driving force rf presents the first ranking factor but we can see that it also interacts with the influence of other input factors the input factors of the underlying urban surface n r n p and k s and drainage loss dl are revealed to be almost equally influential for both mfe and amwd with the first order indices and their quasi equal position can be further confirmed with their interaction parts very similar to each other for the average maximum discharge amd which is more related to the flow movements the spatial resolution of modeling plays a more important role and seems to be spared from the interacting effects of other input factors with very limited interaction part compared to its first order index as main flow channels in urbanized area during heavy rainfall the roads have their roughness n r slightly more influential than the other three input factors describing the properties of the underlying urban surface and drainage loss dl and this influence is physically less vulnerable to the effects from other input factors with an interaction value very limited the interaction parts of the input factors of the hydrodynamic model are listed in table 2 3 1 2 the pairwise interactions between different input factors in order to extract the interaction in pairs between the input factors from the global sensitivity analysis results the second order indices s ij among the six model input factors calculated with eq 16 are illustrated in fig 5 in form of heat map the specific influence of one input factor upon another can be identified from their intersection square when we take a look at the maximum flood extent mfe and the average maximum water depth amwd similar patterns can be found for the interactions among different input factors the maximum value of the second order indices is attributed to the pair sr rf which are the two significant input factors that cannot be overlooked in the modeling either with very strong main effects or with important total effects in addition we can see that the interactions between sr and the other four input factors n r n p k s and dl are all over 0 001 which are generally two or more times larger than the values in other squares from which we can infer that the very large interaction part of sr for mfe in fig 4 is not only related to the effects of rf but comes from those of other input factors as well this confirms further what we observe from the interaction part for sr in fig 4 d for the averaged maximum discharge amd the road roughness described by n r is found to interplay significantly with other input factors not only the most influential rf and sr but also n p k s and dl as the roads present important flow channels for the rainfall induced inundations in urbanized area the water blocking effects of the road surface roughness may be worthy of more concerns of the modelers when examining the flow movements as the drainage collecting points are physical outlets of the rainfall water from the simulation domain relatively strong interaction between the rainfall and the drainage loss is also observed and this strong interaction seem more obvious for the averaged maximum discharge amd since most of the drainage loss occurs within the footprints of the roads which shows a kind of consistency with the physical world on the other hand there are also typically small values of the interactions which can be seen in the heat maps for the three model outputs the parameters of the permeable area n p and k s interplay reasonably little with the drainage loss dl as the permeable area and the drainage loss points are located relatively far away from each other in this study area we may imply from this observation the existence of the relevancy between the parameters interactions and their acting locations some independence of the influence of the two input factors of the permeable area n p and k s can also be noticed from the second order heat maps although they make their effects both upon the grassland as permeable surface in our case we see that they influence different aspects of the flood water flow with n p mainly having its effects on the flow movements and k s on the water volume and in consequence the interaction may become insignificant for a specific model output 3 1 3 variations of influences and interactions of input factors with the action area in previous subsections we see that the influences of several input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss appear to some extent trivial in face of the predominant rf and sr note that the action areas of rf and sr both cover the whole simulation domain we put forward a question that whether the relatively small action area limits the influence of certain input factors e g the permeable area covers only 0 05 km2 about 7 6 of the model domain as the action area of n p and k s and an enlargement of the action area may increase the influence we take these permeable area as an example for examining the variation of input factor influence with the change of its associated action area for this purpose we expand the covering surface of permeable area by adding parcels of permeable area in the simulation domain in a relatively homogeneous way and carry out new simulations and global sa with the changes the results are analyzed for a doubled tripled and quadrupled permeable area as shown in fig 6 a to d in contrary to our instincts in assuming a positive correlation between the influence and the action area a net decline of the main effects first order indices can be found for the two input factors n p and k s associated with the permeable area in all three model outputs the maximum flood extent mfe the average maximum water depth amwd and the average maximum discharge amd as illustrated in fig 7 this decline is also observed for the n r and dl associated with the road roughness and the drainage loss as the most significant input factor for mfe and amwd the rainfall rf is found to have its influence further elevated by the expansions of permeable areas as the second order indices calculated for the pairs rf n p and rf k s are relatively large for mfe and amwd respectively indicating important interactions between the rainfall and the input factors associated with the permeable areas we may infer that the rainfall probably gains its augmentation of influence through these interactions with variations of the action surface of the permeable areas on the other hand although the main effects of n p and k s drop apparently we see a growing trend for the general interaction parts of k s for the averaged maximum water depth as the model output with more permeable areas this growing trend is found to overcome the dropping of the first order index and lead to a slightly increasing total order index for k s this large general interaction part indicates that the influence of k s may be more sensitive to the variations of other input factors when its action area increases and the modelers may pay more attention to the determination of other input factors instead to reduce the effects of possible errors or deviations of k s 3 2 influence and interactions of the input factors during the evolution of urban flood 3 2 1 temporal variations of main effects with the records of the chosen model outputs at different output times variations of the influence of the input factors in time are analyzed with the first order indices reported in fig 8 for the spatially lumped outputs including the flood extent fe the average maximum water depth amwd and the average maximum discharge amd the rainfall as the only driving force presents in most of the time the most influential factor on the basis of its main effects calculated over the bootstrap resamples since the flood extent relates mainly to the water volume induced into the model domain it is empirically true that the temporal variation of the rainfall influence follows that of the rainfall time series however it is worth noting that the rainfall influence is balanced by the input factors of the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss during the peak phase in experiencing a kind of plateau period instead and it is also during this period the input factors of the underlying urban surface n r n p k s and dl present almost simultaneously a constantly growing influence as these input factors of the underlying urban surface present water draining and blocking effects we can see that their effects become more important with an increasing flood water volume and this physical process can be captured to some extent by the global sa although the spatial resolution sr has been viewed as ranking the least influential among all the input factors in question from the static results in section 3 1 for the flood extent as the model output we can see that it does not constantly succumb to others sr ranks second at the start of the flood just behind the driving force and picks up during the drying phase these observations may confirm the non negligible impact of the spatial resolution on the flood extent estimation with relatively limited water depth consistent with the static results from section 3 1 the amwd and amd are in general dominated by the rainfall inputs followed by the spatial resolution sr and these two predominant factors present a kind of competitive relationship over time as the water depth and discharge are more tightly related to the movements of flood flow sr reasonably plays more important role on them than on the flood extent as what it does statically for the maximum values of the output over the whole time period although we can still rank the several input factors of the underlying urban surface according to their main effects we admit that very slight disparity can be observed among their influences differing from the sr the temporal variations of their influences are found to be in agreement with that of the rainfall influence which can be seen as a kind of symbiotic relationship 3 2 2 temporal variations of the interaction parts fig 9 reports the variations of the interaction parts of the six input factors for the three model outputs during the evolution of the rainfall induced flood in the study site for the flood extent the interaction parts of sr are observed to be much larger two times or more than those of other input factors except at the very beginning of the flood occurrence the sr curve also shows that the interactions between the spatial resolution or the grid size increases with the amount of water induced into the simulation domain at the end of the first ten minutes shortly after the start of the rainfall event the interaction part of the rainfall rf is found to be important and very close to that of sr as the rainfall intensity at this phase of the event is very limited it is physically reasonable that its effects suffer from important influences of other factors n r n p k s and dl which present blocking and reducing effects for the induced pluvial water we see that the interaction part of rf drops when the rainfall intensity increases and the other input factors begin to go under more important influence and interaction with the rainfall for the model outputs amwd and amd the interaction parts of the input factors show fluctuations over time the comparison with the temporal variations of the first order indices in fig 8 reveals that the interactions present a kind of competitive relationship with the main effects and both the main effects and the interaction parts fluctuate around relatively stable values without obvious trends of rising or dropping 3 3 discussion the factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss which induce water draining and blocking effects are generally found to be of equal importance for the model results from the perspective of water volume but their influences are different in terms of water movement similar to previous findings in the literature chen et al 2018 fraga et al 2016 liu et al 2020 bottom roughnesses and more precisely the manning coefficient on surfaces with different land use are found to be of importance for the hydrodynamic model outputs including the flood water depth and discharge in our study for the intensely urbanized area as the roads present principal corridors of flow movements the roughness of road surface is revealed to be more influential for the flood water discharge in the study area from the same perspective spatial resolution of modeling is found of very high significance for the flood water discharge but of minor significance of the flood extent and water depth however the important interactions between the spatial resolution and the other input factors imply that although with a minor influence for certain model outputs the influence of spatial resolution may be prey to the impacts coming from the uncertainties of other input factors as a higher or lower spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic modeling represents better or worse terrain features of the urbanized area especially the building complexes we can intuitively judge that the sensitivity of the spatial resolution may decrease with less intense buildings presented in the study area although the relevant sensitivity behavior presented in this work for the spatial resolution may be thus of certain site dependence results obtained here may still be applicable to other sites with similar level of development for a general estimation as the driving force of the pluvial urban floods the rainfall inputs are revealed to be of high level of importance not only in its main effects on all the analyzed model results but also in the interactions with the other input factors the sensitivity of the rainfall as the driving force can be highlighted for the flood extent and the flood water depth which presents a finding analogous to those of thomas savage et al 2016a and chen et al 2018 although they apply the inflow discharge as the driving force in their study the pluvial driving force also shows more important influence during the flood rising phase than the peak and recession phase in this study in the temporal analysis of the global sa indices of different input factors the antagonistic effects of those describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss are well captured by the variations of main effects and interactions with the rainfall induced flood water volume accumulated on the urban surface during the evolution of the pluvial urban floods from a spatially distributed point of view the interactions between the input factors are found to be dependent on the distance between their acting areas which are usually associated with land use type and the interactions decrease when the input factors act far away from each other by identifying influential or insignificant input factors or model parameters of the urban flood hydrodynamic modeling the quality of modeling may be enhanced with an emphasis on the preparation and determination of certain input factors of higher level of importance with the analysis of the interactions between different input factors in the modeling new understandings can be achieved about how the uncertainties of the input factors may have effects on the others and whether the influence of a certain input factor can be ignored with minor main effects the temporal analysis of the variations of the influences and interactions of the input factors allow us to gain insights into the effects of the input factors in course of an urban flood event and the results from both static and temporal perspective of the global sensitivity analysis results main effects of different input factors and their interactions are found to be consistent with the underlying physical processes of the urban flood propagation 4 conclusion the influences of the input factors or model parameters of engineering concern in urban flood hydrodynamic modeling are investigated by taking advantage of a variance based global sensitivity analysis methodology with particular focus upon the interaction between the uncertainties of different input factors describing the external driving force the underlying urban surface the drainage loss and the spatial resolution of modeling a model domain with a mixture of different land use types has been chosen for the hydrodynamic modeling of the pluvial floods and the global sensitivity analysis several key variables with which the modelers or decision makers are concerned have been selected as the model outputs including the flood extent the water depth and the discharge which are used for the objective functions of the global sa relevant to the research questions that we put forward the following conclusions can be drawn with the analysis performed in this work 1 in identifying the influences of different input factors with the main effects calculated with the variance based global sa method general global sensitivity patterns of hydrodynamic modeling of urban flood have been obtained for different model outputs as objective functions of the analysis contributions of the driving force are found to prevail over those of the factors describing the urban surface and interact strongly with them with the second order global sensitivity indices more meticulous interaction effects between pairs of the input factors have also been discerned 2 although the spatial resolution employed in the hydrodynamic modeling is revealed by its main effects as of minor importance for a certain model outputs like the flood extent its influence is found to be important for modeling results related to the flood water movements and vary in strongly interplaying with other input factors although the sensitivity patterns obtained for the spatial resolution are of a certain site dependence they may still applicable to urbanized areas with similar level of development as the study site of this work and in consequence may probably not be despised with the uncertainties induced by the other input factors 3 from the examination with regard to the permeable surfaces in this work the influence of the input factors may not necessarily increase with an augmentation of their action area however the interactions of these factors with the driving force exhibit a growing trend and consequently lead to an increasing total effects from a spatially distributed point of view the interactions between the input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss are found to be dependent on the distance between their acting areas which are usually associated with land use type and minor interactions can be observed when the input factors act far away from each other 4 in addition to the analysis with regard to the static model results the global sensitivity patterns of the input factors of hydrodynamic modeling are revealed to be conspicuously non stationary and the global sa indices of input factors vary differently during the evolution of the pluvial urban floods with the variations of the rainfall induced flood water volume accumulated on the urban surface antagonistic effects of the input factors describing the underlying urban surface and the drainage loss upon the rainfall inputs can be captured with the global sa which is of a certain consistency with the underlying physical processes of the urban flood propagation credit authorship contribution statement yun xing methodology

4373,more than half of all streams globally are non perennial and thus dynamic due to their expanding and retracting nature field mapping in conjunction with observational data from gauges and or in situ loggers is a typical approach for studying non perennial stream dynamics but these approaches underrepresent their spatiotemporal variability high resolution distributed hydrological modeling promises to bridge this gap thanks to advances in model physics remote sensing and computational power as the first step towards this goal we investigate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture stream dynamics in upper blue river basin ok coupled routing and excess storage crest a distributed hydrological model is used to simulate spatiotemporally varied streamflow at 10 meter spatial resolution and daily time steps usgs stream gauge data and in situ state logger data are used to calibrate and validate the simulation at the watershed outlet and small headwater tributaries respectively dynamic surface water estimate dswe a landsat product is also compared with simulated water presence in high order streams results show that the crest model can capture low moderate streamflow values at the watershed outlet with a log nse value over 0 7 in the validation period while underestimating high flow values due to the daily time step also the calibrated model can accurately estimate wet dry status as monitored by in situ state loggers in nine headwater catchments the dynamic stream networks are mapped over 2510 stream segments using the crest simulation non perennial streams are the most dynamic in small headwater tributaries contributing area 2 km2 and high order streams are sustained by perennial flow as hydrologic interpretation of the stream dynamics the interannual and seasonal variability in rainfall and evapotranspiration is well reflected by the water occurrence in streams across various catchments a consistent threshold behavior is found between drainage density and unit discharge indicating the control of runoff generation on the flowing stream networks the mapping also identifies differences in stream dynamics caused by heterogeneities in land cover and soil properties given the prevalence of dynamical streams worldwide our analysis illustrates the potential for mapping them using distributed hydrologic models keywords stream dynamics non perennial tributaries blue river basin low flow condition distributed hydrological modeling landsat imagery in situ state logger 1 introduction out of all of the earth s streams non perennial streams those that do not continuously flow busch et al 2020 comprise about half of the total stream length datry et al 2014 these streams often reside in headwaters and extend retract seasonally and during storm events e g jensen et al 2017 shaw 2016 the frequency timing and duration of drying in non perennial streams are particularly important for river ecosystems at multiple spatiotemporal scales allen et al 2020 larned et al 2010 walker et al 1995 in spite of their ecological and hydrological significance the actively flowing stream networks and their spatiotemporal dynamics have received relatively little attention until recent years many field surveys have been conducted to investigate stream dynamics at seasonal and storm event scales durighetto et al 2020 godsey and kirchner 2014 goulsbra et al 2014 jensen et al 2019 lovill et al 2018 meerveld et al 2019 peirce and lindsay 2015 shaw et al 2017 whiting and godsey 2016 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 a common finding from these studies is that climate variabilities cause a major proportion the global stream networks to be dynamic the non perennial streams in headwaters play a major role in shaping the stream dynamics bishop et al 2008 and thus need to be characterized with accuracy and spatiotemporal granularity compared with perennial streams it is more challenging to characterize the non perennial streams because of the distinct hydro meteorologic settings e g rainfall and evapotranspiration irregularity soil and land cover heterogeneities niedda and pirastru 2014 peleg et al 2015 most importantly the sources of hydrological data are limited in coverage and spatial density the primary source has been gauging data but gauge stations are often spatially sparse and on perennial rivers close to urban areas benstead and leigh 2012 datry 2012 rather than in headwaters where non perennial streams are located de girolamo et al 2015 eng et al 2016 in addition various loggers can be deployed spatially to measure electrical conductivity chapin et al 2014 water temperature constantz et al 2001 and water level and or the presence absence of water bhamjee and lindsay 2011 vander vorste et al 2016 time series data from the loggers can be used to track the movement of wetting and drying fronts bhamjee and lindsay 2011 and the persistence of surface waters in different reaches vander vorste et al 2016 remote sensing is an emerging way to monitor non perennial streams various remote sensing techniques have been used to measure proxies for discharge e g river height or width from which to estimate flow regimes examples of these techniques are air and space borne measurements of surface velocity radar altimeters to measure surface water elevations and measurements of wetted areas and bank heights to estimate flow volumes costa et al 2013 gleason and smith 2014 puckridge et al 2000 however most remote sensing techniques are best suited for large rivers and have limited utility for small headwater streams due to low spatial resolution and dense vegetation cover costigan et al 2017 out of the all remotely sensed data satellite imagery has relatively high spatial resolution with vast spatial extent but low temporal frequency which is insufficient for capturing the stream intermittency that can be temporally dynamic hamada et al 2016 when monitoring approaches have only limited data for a location of interest at some discontinuous time steps modeling approaches can provide high spatiotemporal granularity and predict simulate scenarios in response to changing environmental conditions such as global change and water extraction for human uses the key to successful simulation of non perennial streams firstly depends on the capability of model structure to represent transition from low to zero flow regime or the discontinuities in the flow regime azarnivand et al 2020a camporese et al 2014 2019 also the water balance should be calculated integrating various catchment storges i e streams soils and groundwater azarnivand et al 2020b lumped models are explored in many studies e g cipriani et al 2014 ivkovic et al 2014 ye et al 1997 because of the easy of application low data requirement few parameters and good performance at the catchment outlet for example the widely used soil water assessment tool swat gassman et al 2007 accounts for precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration lateral flow and percolation and has been successful in modeling and also projecting flow intermittency under natural current and future conditions e g chahinian et al 2011 tzoraki et al 2016 brown et al 2015 in comparison distributed hydrological modeling receives spatially refined geographical data meteorologic forcing and tracks or outputs models fluxes streamflow infiltration evapotranspiration and states soil moisture groundwater levels in recent studies on non perennial streams increasing attention is given to distributed models that integrate surface and sub surface water by solving multiple nonlinear dynamics fatichi et al 2016 for example the cathy catchment hydrology model has been applied in intermittent or ephemeral catchments to investigate afforestation azarnivand et al 2020a water balance complexities due to heterogeneous land use dean et al 2016 and hydrologic response to rainfall frequency azarnivand et al 2020b also the model mike she was used to study water and salt dynamics of intermittent catchments daneshmand et al 2019 2020 as commonly pointed out in these studies distributed models are well suited for natural catchments fatichi et al 2016 as the heterogeneous dynamic water movements across surface and subsurface layers are dealt with in an integrated continuum however these few modeling studies of non perennial streams tributaries mostly focus on small sized headwater catchments the limited spatial scale does not fully cover the stream dynamics across various stream orders meanwhile previous studies on stream dynamics mostly reply on monitoring approaches via fixed gauges loggers and field surveys which is limited by the logistical challenges spatial density temporal frequency of the collected data e g bhamjee and lindsay 2011 godsey and kirchner 2014 jensen et al 2019 peirce and lindsay 2015 to bridge this gap we use high resolution process based distributed hydrologic modeling over a relatively large catchment to provide streamflow estimates of high spatial density and temporal frequency as the base of mapping stream dynamics the combination of high spatial resolution and large scale enables a comprehensive view of numerous small non perennial headwater tributaries as well as the high order perennial streams moreover stream gauge and state logger data are used for calibrating and validating model outputs to improve model performance at various stream orders the feasibility of satellite images in detecting stream dynamics is also explored the overarching goal is to provide a priori estimates and hydrologic interpretations of the stream dynamics across non perennial and perennial tributaries using high resolution distributed modeling the study aims to answer the following research questions 1 as indicators of stream dynamics can the model simulation capture flow values in high order large streams and wet dry status in low order non perennial streams 2 in spite of their inherent limitations whether and how can satellite imagery products and in situ state loggers be utilized in hydrologic modeling as calibration validation sources 3 how do the actively flowing networks vary in space and time in response to seasonal wetting and drying the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area data used in this study model configuration and methodology section 3 presents the results of hydrologic performance comparison of crest and satellite imagery validation using in situ state loggers mapping of dynamic streams as well as discussion on the results section 4 concludes the study and proposes future directions 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area is the headwaters of the blue river basin or the upper blue river basin hereafter ubrb located in southeastern oklahoma with a drainage area of 483 km2 typical of a continental climate the region experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation severe weather including tornadoes and thunderstorms occur in the region as a result of interactions between cold and warm air masses the mean annual precipitation temperature and snow percentages are 1116 mm 16 4 c and 8 2 from 1980 to 2020 according to national climate data center s archive of global historical weather and climate data https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web search the blue river basin features a dry period from may to september and a wet period in march and april in terms of runoff li et al 2012 the potential evapotranspiration in the dry period is higher than in the wet period by a factor of 3 li et al 2012 also storms have higher intensity but shorter durations in the dry period than in the wet period but the total storm depths are comparable in the two periods li et al 2012 tian et al 2012 as shown in fig 1 the dominant land cover is grassland followed by pasture hay and deciduous forest according to national land cover database https www mrlc gov data nlcd 2011 land cover conus 0 the dominant soil types are loam and silty clay loam according to soil survey geographic database https data nal usda gov dataset soil survey geographic database ssurgo the watershed is slightly hilly with elevation ranging from 180 to 409 m above sea level with an average of 340 m the baseflow in ubrb is sustained by discharge from the arbuckle simpson aquifer during wet years the main stem of ubrb has been reported to be perennial all the way to its headwater smith et al 2004 2 2 crest model 2 2 1 model overview one young family of models called the coupled routing and excess storage crest was initially developed in 2010 wang et al 2011 with a series of improvements later made on model physics parameter and software xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 crest is a distributed hydrological model resolving spatiotemporal water and energy fluxes on a regular grid with user defined resolution the core components of the crest model include runoff generation evapotranspiration surface routing and sub surface routing which enable a three dimensional representation of water fluxes in crest model precipitation is first intercepted by canopy layer infiltration and runoff are then partitioned via the variable infiltration curve concept liang et al 1994 zhao 1995 while surface and subsurface water was routed using the linear reservoir equations nash 1957 or 1 d kinematic wave approximation of the de saint venant equation singh 1997 water in excess storages including interception by the vegetation canopy and subsurface storages in the soil layer are subject to redistribution back to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration the water balance and grid based routing schemes are fully coupled at each time step to represent interactions between atmospheric land surface and subsurface water in terms of parameterization crest enables the use of gridded model parameter in regions where estimation of these values from remote sensing data is possible vergara et al 2016 have developed a prior distributed crest parameter sets for the contiguous united states which is adopted as initial parameter set for this study a brief description of crest model parameters is provided in the appendix crest includes automatic calibration modules i e the shuffled complex evolution duan et al 1992 and differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream vrugt et al 2009 another strength of crest is the compatibility with multiple datasets of remotely sensed meteorological forcing furthermore crest supports gridded output of model states and fluxes like streamflow soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff 2 3 data 2 3 1 forcing and geographic data the high resolution 10 m digital elevation model dem is obtained from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov and serves as the base for building crest model previous studies identified the lack of spatial characterization of hydro meteorologic and geographic conditions as a major challenge in modeling intermittent streams costelloe et al 2005 therefore the forcing data and model parameters should sufficiently represent the full range of spatial variability of hydro meteorologic conditions in the basin for precipitation forcing we used multi radar multi sensor mrms 1 hour gauge bias corrected radar precipitation accumulations q3gc shsr 1h q3gc shsr 1h is the cocorahs rain gauge corrected 1 hour radar qpe accumulation using a three steps method which has the temporal resolution of 1 h and 1 km2 spatial resolution zhang et al 2016 the potential evapotranspiration pet data used in this study were from united states geological survey usgs famine early warning systems network fews net https earlywarning usgs gov fews the daily 1 by 1 arc degree pet data were calculated from the global data assimilation system gdas using the penman monteith method verdin et al 2005 one u s geological survey usgs stream gauge usgs 07332390 near the downstream outlet of ubrb were selected to validate and calibrate the hydrological modeling fig 1 2 3 2 dynamic water surface estimate dswe the landsat mission the landsat archive and on going landsat sentinel data have enabled great progress in improving long term observation of inundation at continental and global scales pekel et al 2016 the newly released products by usgs dynamic surface water estimate dswe has furthered the ability of this dataset to detect inundation at subpixel level jones 2019 for dswe product generation each cloud cloud shadow and snow free pixel in a given scene is tested for the presence of standing surface water and classified into either not water nw or separate open water ow and partial surface water osw classes jones 2019 specifically a cell is classified as partially inundated if 20 of its area is covered by water suggesting detectability of a stream with water 6 meter wide in a 30 meter dswe cell jones 2019 therefore in this study we explore the potential of dswe as a validation source for a part of the stream networks with the bank width over 5 m we conduct field visits along the main stem of ubrb and determine that streams with contributing area over 100 km2 are targets for comparison with crest simulation below this threshold the streams get narrower than 5 m and are considered beyond the detectability of dswe the raw dswe data were obtained from usgs earth explorer via https earthexplorer usgs gov we treat both ow and osw classes as inundated pixels when compared with the crest simulation the comparison is based on dswe data on 44 selected days when cloud coverage was 10 unlike the common usage of inundation maps to validate hydraulic simulation dswe is used here to compare with hydrologic simulation which only outputs 1 d streamflow rather than 2 d inundation extent or water depth therefore simulation crest and observation dswe are only compared over a series of 10 meter channel cells with contributing area over 100 km2 in addition several preprocessing steps on the raw dswe dataset are explored as detailed in the appendix the dswe data are downscaled from 30 meter to 10 meter resolution based on nearest neighbor prior to comparison with the crest simulation 2 3 3 in situ logger data for the small headwater tributaries we monitored wet dry status at 9 sites in ubrb using modified onset hobo pendant loggers that measured stream temperature and conductivity at 30 minute intervals stic loggers chapin et al 2014 conductivity provides a reliable means to estimate drying status by displaying a range of higher values when wet and lower or zero signal when dry at each stream we deployed 5 loggers for redundancy in protective pvc housing at different points along a reach by securing them to the streambed using embedded rebar and zipties as shown in fig 2 a nine monitored reaches drain various contributing areas from 0 7 to 68 km2 and belong to different tributaries this arrangement spanned a range in hydrology and was designed to capture various wetting drying patterns of streams within the watershed we deployed loggers for one year from november 2019 to 2020 to ensure measurements included both rainy and dry seasons we inferred drying state changes of the loggers using a nonparametric change point analysis ncpa of the variation as the standard deviation in conductivity measurements over each day of the deployment matteson and james 2014 this eliminated the need for human interpretation of a large range of conductivity values and standardized signal interpretation across all loggers as daily variation was consistently higher during wet days compared to dry days we retained estimated change points between wet and dry transition periods permuted p value 0 1 and time increments between change points were assigned either wet 1 or dry 0 status based on the mean conductivity of that increment this allowed us to estimate drying status of each logger at a 1 day temporal resolution the ncpa for each logger time series was run with the ecp package james and matteson 2013 using the divisive hierarchical estimation algorithm with 999 permutations from the five loggers at each site the one with the most complete record least null values is chosen to represent the site fig 2b shows the time series of conductivity and processed wet dry status it can be found that the signal processing can reasonably distinguish transitions between wet and dry status at all nine sites 2 4 crest model setup the crest model for ubrb is set up over 10 meter grids at daily time steps one reason for using daily time steps is to offset the computational cost due to the high spatial resolution long simulation period and need for calibration in addition the future application of the stream dynamics estimates which are to be linked with ecological biological variables determines that the most relevant temporal resolution is also daily to this end the hourly mrms radar data is aggregated to a daily amount the available mrms q3gc shsr 1h products span 06 01 2015 to 10 13 2020 which confines the simulation period of this study two calibrations are conducted using the downstream usgs stream gauge data and in situ logger data respectively the a priori distributed parameter sets are adopted as the default initial values for the calibration when calibrating gridded parameters in crest a multiplication factor on the parameter matrix is varied and calibrated in each iteration which retains the spatial pattern of the parameter grids the model is first calibrated against observed streamflow at usgs gauge using crest s built in automatic dream calibration module the objective function is set to minimize the logarithmic nash sutcliffe coefficient table 1 for better capturing low moderate flow values it should be noted that log nse can only be used for positive flow values thus fits better for evaluation in a perennial reach which is the case in this study the calibration is done by varying all crest parameters table a1 in appendix over the period from 06 01 2015 to 12 31 2018 the observed flow over the remaining period from 01 01 2019 to 10 13 2020 is used for validation the aim of the first calibration is to assure overall water balance and flow routing in ubrb is captured by the model to further capture the wet dry dynamics at the nine headwater sites the following second calibration finetunes two already calibrated routing parameters under and alpha0 table a1 within a tight range of multiplier 0 8 to 1 2 over the period from 11 09 2019 to 10 13 2020 under and alpha0 are chosen for calibration because they respectively determine the surface and sub surface flow velocities in the overland cells thus the routing in larger downstream channels is insensitive to the variation of under and alpha0 within the tight range the objective function herein is set to maximize the widely used f1 score table 1 which is essentially a multi objective function combining the precision and recall metrics table 1 powers 2020 note that the f1 score is not a built in objective function in crest thus this second calibration is achieved by externally coupling crest and the sceua calibration algorithm duan et al 1992 we also design a three fold cross validation to examine the model performance at different potential catchments the split of loggers for calibration and validation considers even proportions of wet and dry values in each fold after assuring similar performances from the three scenarios we select the calibrated parameters from the scenario with the best evaluation metrics for the final simulation with the calibrated parameters the model is warmed up from 06 01 2015 to 12 31 2015 using observed forcing data simulation then starts on 01 01 2016 and finishes on 10 13 2020 table 1 summarizes the statistics used to calibrate validate and evaluate the hydrologic performance at the usgs gauge location and in situ logger sites 2 5 investigation of stream dynamics in previous field survey studies statistical analyses were often conduced on attributes of the active flowing networks like stream length discharge number of flow origins and connectivity e g datry et al 2016 godsey and kirchner 2014 jensen et al 2017 botter and durighetto 2020 recently developed a more versatile tool for characterizing flowing stream network as of this study the primary objective in mapping dynamic streams is to seek hydrologic interpretation based on crest simulation therefore we select simple metrics of spatiotemporal variability of the stream water in first level statistical analysis first based on the daily wet dry maps of all 10 meter pixels in the simulation domain the average presence of water in the streams is quantified by a single metric called water occurrence wo via eq 1 1 wo w d s d where wd is water detections representing occasions days here with water present and sd represents simulated days for each pixel in crest model domain the wds are simply regarded as days with positive streamflow values second drainage density is used to measure the spatial extent of actively flowing streams across catchments of various sizes which is defined as the total length of flowing streams per unit area of the catchment to investigate the relationship between flowing stream length and streamflow we examine drainage density in relation with unit discharge which is the streamflow at the most downstream stream segment of a catchment divided by the catchment area 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrologic simulation fig 3 a shows the simulated and observed hydrographs in log scale based on hydrograph shape the low simulated and observed streamflow values show good match while the high values are underestimated fig 3b and c show the comparison via scatter plot and flow duration curves of simulated and observed streamflow respectively similarly flow values below 10 m3 s are well captured as indicated by scatters aligning well with the lower part of the diagonal and close match of flow duration curves near the tails the log nse value of 0 79 maximized objective function in table 2 indicates a satisfactory calibration performance considering various metrics the model performance in the calibration period is slightly better than in the validation period the underestimation of high values also causes the overall bias to be negative as indicated by the log nse values table 2 the model performance is better on falling limb than on the rising limb of the hydrograph this consistently reflects the better performance on low flow values as receding limbs span more time than rising limbs and include more low flow values 3 2 comparison with dswe fig 4 a shows the binary comparisons between crest simulation and preprocessed dswe in streams with contributing area great than 100 km2 the comparison only results in two cases tp and fp as these streams are simulated to be perennial by the crest model it can be found that the detection of water by dswe in the main stem contributing area 300 km2 is unstable with discontinuous segments and water covered pixels in the two upstream tributaries are even more sporadic this is due to the narrow stream width which reduces to around 5 m just upstream of the confluence and possibly reaches the limit of dswe s detectability the only exceptions occurred on 02 15 2017 and 01 04 2019 corresponding to high flow values observed at the downstream usgs gauge fig 3a the high flow causes streams to become wider and detectable by the dswe fig 4b shows that preprocessing reduces the false positive rate to around 0 5 by essentially filling the discontinuous patches removing fp cases in the main stem in summary dswe fails to detect flowing streams narrower than 10 m and inconsistently detect water presence in channels around 15 meter wide 3 3 validation using in situ loggers the results of validating metrics for the threefold cross validation using in situ loggers are presented in table 3 all three scenarios result in very high precision recall and f1 values the three folds show equally high scores indicating the three separately calibrated models can perform comparably on the testing datasets this illustrates the model s ability to perform well with an unseen dataset in potentially a different headwater catchment 3 4 stream dynamics mapping fig 5 a shows the monthly time series of areal averaged precipitation and pet of ubrb over the 4 year period there is a noticeable interannual change in precipitation across the four years with year 2018 being the wettest seasonal variation is also evident where spring march april and may has the most precipitation followed by either summer june july and august or fall september october and november and then winter december january and february also summer months feature hot and dry days with high pet values fig 5b as a result of both precipitation and pet the soil moisture shows clear seasonal pattern with highest soil moisture occurring in winter followed by spring and fall soils are dry in summer with a soil moisture value nearly half of that in winter figs 5c and 7 using four years of daily streamflow grids output we map the water occurrence over the 2510 stream segments in ubrb for the four years and the four seasons fig 6 table 4 summarizes mean annual and seasonal water occurrence conditioned on contributing area for small headwater catchments streams with contributing area over 5 km2 appear to have flow over 77 of the time during the four years smallest tributaries in the headwater catchments contributing area 0 2 km2 are mostly non perennial with active flow for 78 percent of the time in terms of stream length 18 the total 1145 km of stream length stays perennial during the four years across the seasons streams show the highest water occurrence in the spring followed by fall summer and winter this can be explained by the seasonal variability of precipitation and pet as shown in fig 5a in terms of precipitation the wettest season is spring 3 8 mm d followed by summer 3 33 mm d fall 3 15 mm d and winter 1 88 mm d summer features high pet 5 7 mm d offsetting the intense but infrequent precipitation li et al 2012 and resulting in overall lower runoff as compared to fall with an averaged pet of only 2 9 mm d this effect is also evident in storage dynamics of the watershed as shown by the monthly time series of soil moisture in fig 5c the high pet reduces antecedent soil moisture ahead of storm events and further decreases the overland runoff generation in contrast low pet in winter makes the soil moisture higher than in any other season fig 5c and fig 7 despite the lowest precipitation this causes the water occurrence of streams in winter season to be only slightly smaller than that in the summer season fig 7 shows the seasonally averaged soil moisture simulated by crest where two areas outlined with different hydrologic responses are selected to illustrate the heterogeneous effects of geographical properties on stream dynamics fig 8 a and 8b show the monthly mean areal water occurrence and soil moisture for the two areas respectively in all seasons but summer soil moisture in area b is higher than in area a in area b the dramatic drop of soil moisture in summer also coincides with the sudden decrease of water occurrence as seen in august 2016 july 2018 and july 2019 such discrepancy in the hydrologic response is due to the different soil and land types of the two areas as shown in fig 1 area a features a more impervious surface plus sandy soils which hold low soil water content whereas area b is a naturalized catchment with clayey soils of high water holding capacity in summer limited evapotranspiration occurs in the area a due to its impervious coverage the soil moisture in area a is thus less sensitive than in area b fig 8b fig 8c and d show the monthly composition of surface and subsurface runoff in area a and b respectively the dotted lines mark the 50 value and no color signifies months without rainfall input it can be found that the different land cover and soil properties cause area a and area b to be dominated by surface and subsurface runoff respectively the higher proportion of surface runoff in area a could also be the reason for the overall higher water occurrence although subsurface runoff dominates in area b a few switches in the runoff generation mechanism can be found in summer when surface runoff composition gets above 50 such switches coincide with lowest soil moisture values since whatever small amount of infiltration is stored as soil water instead of running off in terms of land cover and soil types area b is representative of the whole ubrb fig 1 suggesting a large fraction of the watershed is as sensitive as area b and likely to experience similar seasonal switches in runoff generation mechanism we also examine the relationships between streamflow and drainage density in 16 selected catchments as shown in fig 9 the selection incorporates three levels of catchments sizes 10 to 20 50 to 60 and near 120 km2 and assures that catchments are independent within each level and spread evenly over the ubrb across the three levels drainage density as plotted in fig 9a to c increases roughly as power functions of unit discharge below some threshold values about 10 2 mm d and plateaus beyond the threshold in log log scale the values below the threshold are also fitted to linear relationships for each individual catchment the fitted relationships show strong statistical significance as indicated by the high r2 coefficient of determination values table 5 for basins of various sizes the log log slope k values exponent in the power law relationships are similar 0 31 to 0 4 while the log log intercepts b range from 0 91 to 1 23 variability in drainage density at a given unit discharge the spread along the vertical direction reduces with increasing catchment size as tributaries merge at confluences and form larger streams 3 5 discussion both streamflow in high order streams and wet dry status in headwater tributaries are automatically calibrated in this study automatic calibration scheme allows multi objective cost functions and is appropriate necessary for intermittent catchments azarnivand et al 2020b like the f1 score used for calibration using in situ logger data the underestimation of high flow values by the crest model is mainly due to the daily simulation time step fohrer et al 2001 during high flow events flooding the timing and magnitude of flood peaks are sensitive to the temporal distribution of rainfall because of the non linearities in the water balance and routing processes the daily average rainfall intensity diffuses any sub daily variabilities and is too coarse for simulating streamflow during floods also in overland routing scheme kinematic wave travel time from one grid cell to next downstream shortens with increasing unit discharge during floods the daily time step is at a larger scale than the travel time between 10 meter grid cells such effect also propagates downstream causing the translated volume to reduce at higher order streams the underestimation of high flow has not been widely reported by other modeling studies that investigate intermittent catchments using also daily timestep probably due to the relatively small catchment size and short channel length e g niedda and pirastru 2014 pierini et al 2014 camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 in comparison with distributed models lumped models could deal with this issue with flexibility for instance by using duration specific unit hydrographs however the trade off is the inability to simulate streamflow at any point within the catchment like the distributed models the interannual and seasonal variabilities of the rainfall and pet are well reflected in stream dynamics in ubrb fig 6 the role of rainfall intensity and frequency have been demonstrated to be vital for stream dynamics in intermittent catchments by previous studies azarnivand et al 2020a dean et al 2016 the contrast of water occurrence in summer and fall indicates mutual effects of rainfall pet and soil moisture on runoff generation interestingly the seasonality in forcings is strong enough to switch runoff generation mechanism in headwater tributaries across wet and dry periods fig 8d which is also revealed by previous studies on the blue river basin li et al 2012 tian et al 2012 the heterogeneity in catchment characteristics cause distinction in water occurrence of head tributaries fig 8 via the distribution of surface and subsurface runoff this strengthens the significance of antecedent catchment wetness prior to rainfall events in driving streamflow in intermittent catchments as also reported in previous studies viola et al 2014 niedda and pirastru 2014 although not fully exposed in the ubrb the crest model lacks representation of certain physical processes at fine spatial resolution e g 10 m which might become issues in other study areas for instance in low yielding basins in the western u s additional abstraction storage needs to be included to represent ground surface depression and soil shrinkage cracks in terms of groundwater the crest model adopts a conceptual bucket module to represent the recharge and discharge of groundwater in which groundwater flow is assumed to be parallel to the surface topography the bucket concept is also widely used in other distributed hydrologic and land surface models niu et al 2011 as a simplification of the highly heterogeneous and nonlinear groundwater flow process because an explicit representation of these processes is currently limited by the lack of information on bedrock topography camporese et al 2019 and the difficulty to assign spatially and vertically distributed parameters maneta et al 2008 also this assumption exempts the assignment of boundary conditions because groundwater is assumed to move only within the watershed boundary free from influence of surrounding hydraulic heads however there would be issues when the extent of underlying aquifer significantly exceeds the watershed boundary or when surface flow originates in aquifer fed springs the scaling relationships between drainage density and unit discharge have been reported in studies based on field mapping godsey and kirchner 2014 gregory and walling 1968 due to the low frequency of mapping and logistical challenges the mapped stream networks are subject to issues like low statistical significance limited spatial coverage of mapped networks in complex terrain and influences from stochastic factors e g debris and sediment collected by tree falls as demonstrated in this study hydrologic modeling here confirms and augments the power law relationship of strong statistical significance by continuously generating data at high resolution over a large spatial scale the scaling relationships plateau at some threshold discharge values representing entirely active stream networks at high flow conditions the existence of some plateau is reasonable because it physically represents the geomorphic channel networks i e the branching networks of topographic features nonetheless the plateaus which correspond to the size total length of stream networks are limited by the resolution of topographic data dem in other words the total length of streams could have exponentially increased and allowed the power law relationship to extend further had the model been simulated over finer grids e g using 1 meter dem to certain extent the plateau also justifies the underestimation of high flow by the crest model as stream dynamics is demonstrated to be only sensitive to discharge at low moderate flow conditions 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture the stream dynamics in upper blue river basin ok the fully distributed crest model is established over 10 meter grids using distributed geographic data forcing data and parameters of fine resolution the high spatial resolution of the simulation enables us to decipher dynamics in refined stream networks with the averaged contributing area of individual stream segment being 0 2 km2 the large spatial scale of study area exceeds most of existing studies and allows us to examine the stream dynamics across a wide range of stream orders and catchment sizes and potentially capture effects from heterogenous catchment characteristics to achieve desired model performance at various stream orders we deploy in situ state loggers at nine headwater tributaries as an additional calibration validation source to the usgs stream gauge we also explore the utility of landsat product dswe in capturing water presence in high order channels output streamflow grids are lastly used to map actively flowing stream networks at daily time step the mapped stream networks are interpreted hydrologically using the gridded output from the crest model the major findings are summarized as follows 1 the hydrologic simulation at 10 meter spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution using the crest model performs well against low moderate observed flow as indicated by a logarithmic nse over 0 7 in the validation period due to the daily timestep high flow values are underestimated at headwater tributaries the calibrated simulation can accurately capture wet dry status as compared with in situ logger records 2 the 30 meter landsat dynamic surface water estimate dswe products are insufficient to serve as validation source for water presence even in high order streams after preprocessing is applied due to limitation in resolution the data only detect discontinuous patches of water in 15 meter wide streams and sporadic water presence in 10 meter wide streams 3 flowing stream networks are dynamic over the 4 year simulation period in ubrb at daily time step the density of flowing stream length scales as a power law function of unit discharge below a threshold value above the threshold the whole networks become active with flowing water the existence of the threshold also justifies the underestimation of high flow values by the crest as stream dynamics is sensitive only to low moderate unit discharges the exponent of the power law relationship i e change in drainage density per change in unit discharge stays consistent across catchments of various sizes indicating the existence of a central tendency across the numerous streams in utrb 4 mapping of water occurrence shows that streams are most dynamic in the small headwater catchments the interannual and seasonal variabilities of precipitation and pet is well reflected by the water occurrence in these small non perennial tributaries the distinction in land cover and soil properties cause the runoff generation mechanism to differ among heterogenous headwater catchments which indicates the significance of antecedent catchment wetness prior to rainfall events in driving streamflow in non perennial catchments compared with traditional field mapping approach in stream dynamics study the modeling approach can generate data samples with greater statistical significance temporal frequency and range therefore distributed hydrologic models should be utilized more to understand controls on the sensitivity of the flowing stream networks to changes in runoff this study also reveals the need for future research efforts since hydrological modeling of intermittent streams is very much constrained by the quantity and quality of observations needed to calibrate and validate the model outputs therefore as a priori estimates from this study the simulated output needs to be supplemented with better datasets also models in general are only as good as our understanding of the physical processes that drive stream dynamics the representation of physical processes is also sensitive to model resolution at fine scales additional processes need to be included and represent complex nonlinear processes of runoff generation in low yielding basins e g surface groundwater interactions or local geological peculiarities like karstic areas ye et al 1997 following this study ongoing research focuses on coupling crest with land surface models to represent springs fed by unconfined aquifers in arid and karstic basins finally as we are confident that the mapped dynamic stream networks make sense hydrologically a more in depth future study focusing on stream dynamics will follow to take advantage of the rich information in the crest simulation

following the steps below first digital elevation model dem data in crest like most of distributed hydrologic models are filled to avoid water from being trapped locally ponds and potholes should thus be excluded from validation we automatically segment ponds from the dswe rasters using an algorithm traditionally applied in identifying rain cells from radar images dixon and wiener 1993 and then filtering the identified clusters of water covered pixels considering their shape and area after fitting identified pixel clusters to ellipsoids we exclude those with ellipticity ratio of minor axis over major axis lower than 0 2 and area above 9 000 m2 next we align the stream cells in dswe rasters with those in the crest domain by nudging adjacent inundated dswe pixels into crest streams while limiting the nudging distance to be 30 m one dswe pixel this step is crucial because the crest streamflow output is 1 d which means one stream cell and its adjacent overland cells could have significantly different contributing area and stream flow therefore a dswe water covered pixel is paired aligned with a nearby stream cell for the comparison lastly the water covered pixels in dswe can be discontinuous even after the alignment fig a1 which can be interpreted as isolated pools in small streams but are unlikely to occur in high order streams with persistent baseflow another cause for the discontinuity is no data stripes of unscanned pixels that cut through stream networks and leave many no data gaps in order to quantify the effect from the discontinuous features in higher order streams we fill the gaps between two adjacent water covered segments that are separated by 90 m of flow distance distance along streams and have drainage area over 300 km2 with the preprocessing done dswe rasters are resampled using nearest neighbor approach to 10 meter resolution and then compared with crest streamflow grids 
4373,more than half of all streams globally are non perennial and thus dynamic due to their expanding and retracting nature field mapping in conjunction with observational data from gauges and or in situ loggers is a typical approach for studying non perennial stream dynamics but these approaches underrepresent their spatiotemporal variability high resolution distributed hydrological modeling promises to bridge this gap thanks to advances in model physics remote sensing and computational power as the first step towards this goal we investigate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture stream dynamics in upper blue river basin ok coupled routing and excess storage crest a distributed hydrological model is used to simulate spatiotemporally varied streamflow at 10 meter spatial resolution and daily time steps usgs stream gauge data and in situ state logger data are used to calibrate and validate the simulation at the watershed outlet and small headwater tributaries respectively dynamic surface water estimate dswe a landsat product is also compared with simulated water presence in high order streams results show that the crest model can capture low moderate streamflow values at the watershed outlet with a log nse value over 0 7 in the validation period while underestimating high flow values due to the daily time step also the calibrated model can accurately estimate wet dry status as monitored by in situ state loggers in nine headwater catchments the dynamic stream networks are mapped over 2510 stream segments using the crest simulation non perennial streams are the most dynamic in small headwater tributaries contributing area 2 km2 and high order streams are sustained by perennial flow as hydrologic interpretation of the stream dynamics the interannual and seasonal variability in rainfall and evapotranspiration is well reflected by the water occurrence in streams across various catchments a consistent threshold behavior is found between drainage density and unit discharge indicating the control of runoff generation on the flowing stream networks the mapping also identifies differences in stream dynamics caused by heterogeneities in land cover and soil properties given the prevalence of dynamical streams worldwide our analysis illustrates the potential for mapping them using distributed hydrologic models keywords stream dynamics non perennial tributaries blue river basin low flow condition distributed hydrological modeling landsat imagery in situ state logger 1 introduction out of all of the earth s streams non perennial streams those that do not continuously flow busch et al 2020 comprise about half of the total stream length datry et al 2014 these streams often reside in headwaters and extend retract seasonally and during storm events e g jensen et al 2017 shaw 2016 the frequency timing and duration of drying in non perennial streams are particularly important for river ecosystems at multiple spatiotemporal scales allen et al 2020 larned et al 2010 walker et al 1995 in spite of their ecological and hydrological significance the actively flowing stream networks and their spatiotemporal dynamics have received relatively little attention until recent years many field surveys have been conducted to investigate stream dynamics at seasonal and storm event scales durighetto et al 2020 godsey and kirchner 2014 goulsbra et al 2014 jensen et al 2019 lovill et al 2018 meerveld et al 2019 peirce and lindsay 2015 shaw et al 2017 whiting and godsey 2016 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 a common finding from these studies is that climate variabilities cause a major proportion the global stream networks to be dynamic the non perennial streams in headwaters play a major role in shaping the stream dynamics bishop et al 2008 and thus need to be characterized with accuracy and spatiotemporal granularity compared with perennial streams it is more challenging to characterize the non perennial streams because of the distinct hydro meteorologic settings e g rainfall and evapotranspiration irregularity soil and land cover heterogeneities niedda and pirastru 2014 peleg et al 2015 most importantly the sources of hydrological data are limited in coverage and spatial density the primary source has been gauging data but gauge stations are often spatially sparse and on perennial rivers close to urban areas benstead and leigh 2012 datry 2012 rather than in headwaters where non perennial streams are located de girolamo et al 2015 eng et al 2016 in addition various loggers can be deployed spatially to measure electrical conductivity chapin et al 2014 water temperature constantz et al 2001 and water level and or the presence absence of water bhamjee and lindsay 2011 vander vorste et al 2016 time series data from the loggers can be used to track the movement of wetting and drying fronts bhamjee and lindsay 2011 and the persistence of surface waters in different reaches vander vorste et al 2016 remote sensing is an emerging way to monitor non perennial streams various remote sensing techniques have been used to measure proxies for discharge e g river height or width from which to estimate flow regimes examples of these techniques are air and space borne measurements of surface velocity radar altimeters to measure surface water elevations and measurements of wetted areas and bank heights to estimate flow volumes costa et al 2013 gleason and smith 2014 puckridge et al 2000 however most remote sensing techniques are best suited for large rivers and have limited utility for small headwater streams due to low spatial resolution and dense vegetation cover costigan et al 2017 out of the all remotely sensed data satellite imagery has relatively high spatial resolution with vast spatial extent but low temporal frequency which is insufficient for capturing the stream intermittency that can be temporally dynamic hamada et al 2016 when monitoring approaches have only limited data for a location of interest at some discontinuous time steps modeling approaches can provide high spatiotemporal granularity and predict simulate scenarios in response to changing environmental conditions such as global change and water extraction for human uses the key to successful simulation of non perennial streams firstly depends on the capability of model structure to represent transition from low to zero flow regime or the discontinuities in the flow regime azarnivand et al 2020a camporese et al 2014 2019 also the water balance should be calculated integrating various catchment storges i e streams soils and groundwater azarnivand et al 2020b lumped models are explored in many studies e g cipriani et al 2014 ivkovic et al 2014 ye et al 1997 because of the easy of application low data requirement few parameters and good performance at the catchment outlet for example the widely used soil water assessment tool swat gassman et al 2007 accounts for precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration lateral flow and percolation and has been successful in modeling and also projecting flow intermittency under natural current and future conditions e g chahinian et al 2011 tzoraki et al 2016 brown et al 2015 in comparison distributed hydrological modeling receives spatially refined geographical data meteorologic forcing and tracks or outputs models fluxes streamflow infiltration evapotranspiration and states soil moisture groundwater levels in recent studies on non perennial streams increasing attention is given to distributed models that integrate surface and sub surface water by solving multiple nonlinear dynamics fatichi et al 2016 for example the cathy catchment hydrology model has been applied in intermittent or ephemeral catchments to investigate afforestation azarnivand et al 2020a water balance complexities due to heterogeneous land use dean et al 2016 and hydrologic response to rainfall frequency azarnivand et al 2020b also the model mike she was used to study water and salt dynamics of intermittent catchments daneshmand et al 2019 2020 as commonly pointed out in these studies distributed models are well suited for natural catchments fatichi et al 2016 as the heterogeneous dynamic water movements across surface and subsurface layers are dealt with in an integrated continuum however these few modeling studies of non perennial streams tributaries mostly focus on small sized headwater catchments the limited spatial scale does not fully cover the stream dynamics across various stream orders meanwhile previous studies on stream dynamics mostly reply on monitoring approaches via fixed gauges loggers and field surveys which is limited by the logistical challenges spatial density temporal frequency of the collected data e g bhamjee and lindsay 2011 godsey and kirchner 2014 jensen et al 2019 peirce and lindsay 2015 to bridge this gap we use high resolution process based distributed hydrologic modeling over a relatively large catchment to provide streamflow estimates of high spatial density and temporal frequency as the base of mapping stream dynamics the combination of high spatial resolution and large scale enables a comprehensive view of numerous small non perennial headwater tributaries as well as the high order perennial streams moreover stream gauge and state logger data are used for calibrating and validating model outputs to improve model performance at various stream orders the feasibility of satellite images in detecting stream dynamics is also explored the overarching goal is to provide a priori estimates and hydrologic interpretations of the stream dynamics across non perennial and perennial tributaries using high resolution distributed modeling the study aims to answer the following research questions 1 as indicators of stream dynamics can the model simulation capture flow values in high order large streams and wet dry status in low order non perennial streams 2 in spite of their inherent limitations whether and how can satellite imagery products and in situ state loggers be utilized in hydrologic modeling as calibration validation sources 3 how do the actively flowing networks vary in space and time in response to seasonal wetting and drying the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area data used in this study model configuration and methodology section 3 presents the results of hydrologic performance comparison of crest and satellite imagery validation using in situ state loggers mapping of dynamic streams as well as discussion on the results section 4 concludes the study and proposes future directions 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area is the headwaters of the blue river basin or the upper blue river basin hereafter ubrb located in southeastern oklahoma with a drainage area of 483 km2 typical of a continental climate the region experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation severe weather including tornadoes and thunderstorms occur in the region as a result of interactions between cold and warm air masses the mean annual precipitation temperature and snow percentages are 1116 mm 16 4 c and 8 2 from 1980 to 2020 according to national climate data center s archive of global historical weather and climate data https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web search the blue river basin features a dry period from may to september and a wet period in march and april in terms of runoff li et al 2012 the potential evapotranspiration in the dry period is higher than in the wet period by a factor of 3 li et al 2012 also storms have higher intensity but shorter durations in the dry period than in the wet period but the total storm depths are comparable in the two periods li et al 2012 tian et al 2012 as shown in fig 1 the dominant land cover is grassland followed by pasture hay and deciduous forest according to national land cover database https www mrlc gov data nlcd 2011 land cover conus 0 the dominant soil types are loam and silty clay loam according to soil survey geographic database https data nal usda gov dataset soil survey geographic database ssurgo the watershed is slightly hilly with elevation ranging from 180 to 409 m above sea level with an average of 340 m the baseflow in ubrb is sustained by discharge from the arbuckle simpson aquifer during wet years the main stem of ubrb has been reported to be perennial all the way to its headwater smith et al 2004 2 2 crest model 2 2 1 model overview one young family of models called the coupled routing and excess storage crest was initially developed in 2010 wang et al 2011 with a series of improvements later made on model physics parameter and software xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 crest is a distributed hydrological model resolving spatiotemporal water and energy fluxes on a regular grid with user defined resolution the core components of the crest model include runoff generation evapotranspiration surface routing and sub surface routing which enable a three dimensional representation of water fluxes in crest model precipitation is first intercepted by canopy layer infiltration and runoff are then partitioned via the variable infiltration curve concept liang et al 1994 zhao 1995 while surface and subsurface water was routed using the linear reservoir equations nash 1957 or 1 d kinematic wave approximation of the de saint venant equation singh 1997 water in excess storages including interception by the vegetation canopy and subsurface storages in the soil layer are subject to redistribution back to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration the water balance and grid based routing schemes are fully coupled at each time step to represent interactions between atmospheric land surface and subsurface water in terms of parameterization crest enables the use of gridded model parameter in regions where estimation of these values from remote sensing data is possible vergara et al 2016 have developed a prior distributed crest parameter sets for the contiguous united states which is adopted as initial parameter set for this study a brief description of crest model parameters is provided in the appendix crest includes automatic calibration modules i e the shuffled complex evolution duan et al 1992 and differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream vrugt et al 2009 another strength of crest is the compatibility with multiple datasets of remotely sensed meteorological forcing furthermore crest supports gridded output of model states and fluxes like streamflow soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff 2 3 data 2 3 1 forcing and geographic data the high resolution 10 m digital elevation model dem is obtained from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov and serves as the base for building crest model previous studies identified the lack of spatial characterization of hydro meteorologic and geographic conditions as a major challenge in modeling intermittent streams costelloe et al 2005 therefore the forcing data and model parameters should sufficiently represent the full range of spatial variability of hydro meteorologic conditions in the basin for precipitation forcing we used multi radar multi sensor mrms 1 hour gauge bias corrected radar precipitation accumulations q3gc shsr 1h q3gc shsr 1h is the cocorahs rain gauge corrected 1 hour radar qpe accumulation using a three steps method which has the temporal resolution of 1 h and 1 km2 spatial resolution zhang et al 2016 the potential evapotranspiration pet data used in this study were from united states geological survey usgs famine early warning systems network fews net https earlywarning usgs gov fews the daily 1 by 1 arc degree pet data were calculated from the global data assimilation system gdas using the penman monteith method verdin et al 2005 one u s geological survey usgs stream gauge usgs 07332390 near the downstream outlet of ubrb were selected to validate and calibrate the hydrological modeling fig 1 2 3 2 dynamic water surface estimate dswe the landsat mission the landsat archive and on going landsat sentinel data have enabled great progress in improving long term observation of inundation at continental and global scales pekel et al 2016 the newly released products by usgs dynamic surface water estimate dswe has furthered the ability of this dataset to detect inundation at subpixel level jones 2019 for dswe product generation each cloud cloud shadow and snow free pixel in a given scene is tested for the presence of standing surface water and classified into either not water nw or separate open water ow and partial surface water osw classes jones 2019 specifically a cell is classified as partially inundated if 20 of its area is covered by water suggesting detectability of a stream with water 6 meter wide in a 30 meter dswe cell jones 2019 therefore in this study we explore the potential of dswe as a validation source for a part of the stream networks with the bank width over 5 m we conduct field visits along the main stem of ubrb and determine that streams with contributing area over 100 km2 are targets for comparison with crest simulation below this threshold the streams get narrower than 5 m and are considered beyond the detectability of dswe the raw dswe data were obtained from usgs earth explorer via https earthexplorer usgs gov we treat both ow and osw classes as inundated pixels when compared with the crest simulation the comparison is based on dswe data on 44 selected days when cloud coverage was 10 unlike the common usage of inundation maps to validate hydraulic simulation dswe is used here to compare with hydrologic simulation which only outputs 1 d streamflow rather than 2 d inundation extent or water depth therefore simulation crest and observation dswe are only compared over a series of 10 meter channel cells with contributing area over 100 km2 in addition several preprocessing steps on the raw dswe dataset are explored as detailed in the appendix the dswe data are downscaled from 30 meter to 10 meter resolution based on nearest neighbor prior to comparison with the crest simulation 2 3 3 in situ logger data for the small headwater tributaries we monitored wet dry status at 9 sites in ubrb using modified onset hobo pendant loggers that measured stream temperature and conductivity at 30 minute intervals stic loggers chapin et al 2014 conductivity provides a reliable means to estimate drying status by displaying a range of higher values when wet and lower or zero signal when dry at each stream we deployed 5 loggers for redundancy in protective pvc housing at different points along a reach by securing them to the streambed using embedded rebar and zipties as shown in fig 2 a nine monitored reaches drain various contributing areas from 0 7 to 68 km2 and belong to different tributaries this arrangement spanned a range in hydrology and was designed to capture various wetting drying patterns of streams within the watershed we deployed loggers for one year from november 2019 to 2020 to ensure measurements included both rainy and dry seasons we inferred drying state changes of the loggers using a nonparametric change point analysis ncpa of the variation as the standard deviation in conductivity measurements over each day of the deployment matteson and james 2014 this eliminated the need for human interpretation of a large range of conductivity values and standardized signal interpretation across all loggers as daily variation was consistently higher during wet days compared to dry days we retained estimated change points between wet and dry transition periods permuted p value 0 1 and time increments between change points were assigned either wet 1 or dry 0 status based on the mean conductivity of that increment this allowed us to estimate drying status of each logger at a 1 day temporal resolution the ncpa for each logger time series was run with the ecp package james and matteson 2013 using the divisive hierarchical estimation algorithm with 999 permutations from the five loggers at each site the one with the most complete record least null values is chosen to represent the site fig 2b shows the time series of conductivity and processed wet dry status it can be found that the signal processing can reasonably distinguish transitions between wet and dry status at all nine sites 2 4 crest model setup the crest model for ubrb is set up over 10 meter grids at daily time steps one reason for using daily time steps is to offset the computational cost due to the high spatial resolution long simulation period and need for calibration in addition the future application of the stream dynamics estimates which are to be linked with ecological biological variables determines that the most relevant temporal resolution is also daily to this end the hourly mrms radar data is aggregated to a daily amount the available mrms q3gc shsr 1h products span 06 01 2015 to 10 13 2020 which confines the simulation period of this study two calibrations are conducted using the downstream usgs stream gauge data and in situ logger data respectively the a priori distributed parameter sets are adopted as the default initial values for the calibration when calibrating gridded parameters in crest a multiplication factor on the parameter matrix is varied and calibrated in each iteration which retains the spatial pattern of the parameter grids the model is first calibrated against observed streamflow at usgs gauge using crest s built in automatic dream calibration module the objective function is set to minimize the logarithmic nash sutcliffe coefficient table 1 for better capturing low moderate flow values it should be noted that log nse can only be used for positive flow values thus fits better for evaluation in a perennial reach which is the case in this study the calibration is done by varying all crest parameters table a1 in appendix over the period from 06 01 2015 to 12 31 2018 the observed flow over the remaining period from 01 01 2019 to 10 13 2020 is used for validation the aim of the first calibration is to assure overall water balance and flow routing in ubrb is captured by the model to further capture the wet dry dynamics at the nine headwater sites the following second calibration finetunes two already calibrated routing parameters under and alpha0 table a1 within a tight range of multiplier 0 8 to 1 2 over the period from 11 09 2019 to 10 13 2020 under and alpha0 are chosen for calibration because they respectively determine the surface and sub surface flow velocities in the overland cells thus the routing in larger downstream channels is insensitive to the variation of under and alpha0 within the tight range the objective function herein is set to maximize the widely used f1 score table 1 which is essentially a multi objective function combining the precision and recall metrics table 1 powers 2020 note that the f1 score is not a built in objective function in crest thus this second calibration is achieved by externally coupling crest and the sceua calibration algorithm duan et al 1992 we also design a three fold cross validation to examine the model performance at different potential catchments the split of loggers for calibration and validation considers even proportions of wet and dry values in each fold after assuring similar performances from the three scenarios we select the calibrated parameters from the scenario with the best evaluation metrics for the final simulation with the calibrated parameters the model is warmed up from 06 01 2015 to 12 31 2015 using observed forcing data simulation then starts on 01 01 2016 and finishes on 10 13 2020 table 1 summarizes the statistics used to calibrate validate and evaluate the hydrologic performance at the usgs gauge location and in situ logger sites 2 5 investigation of stream dynamics in previous field survey studies statistical analyses were often conduced on attributes of the active flowing networks like stream length discharge number of flow origins and connectivity e g datry et al 2016 godsey and kirchner 2014 jensen et al 2017 botter and durighetto 2020 recently developed a more versatile tool for characterizing flowing stream network as of this study the primary objective in mapping dynamic streams is to seek hydrologic interpretation based on crest simulation therefore we select simple metrics of spatiotemporal variability of the stream water in first level statistical analysis first based on the daily wet dry maps of all 10 meter pixels in the simulation domain the average presence of water in the streams is quantified by a single metric called water occurrence wo via eq 1 1 wo w d s d where wd is water detections representing occasions days here with water present and sd represents simulated days for each pixel in crest model domain the wds are simply regarded as days with positive streamflow values second drainage density is used to measure the spatial extent of actively flowing streams across catchments of various sizes which is defined as the total length of flowing streams per unit area of the catchment to investigate the relationship between flowing stream length and streamflow we examine drainage density in relation with unit discharge which is the streamflow at the most downstream stream segment of a catchment divided by the catchment area 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrologic simulation fig 3 a shows the simulated and observed hydrographs in log scale based on hydrograph shape the low simulated and observed streamflow values show good match while the high values are underestimated fig 3b and c show the comparison via scatter plot and flow duration curves of simulated and observed streamflow respectively similarly flow values below 10 m3 s are well captured as indicated by scatters aligning well with the lower part of the diagonal and close match of flow duration curves near the tails the log nse value of 0 79 maximized objective function in table 2 indicates a satisfactory calibration performance considering various metrics the model performance in the calibration period is slightly better than in the validation period the underestimation of high values also causes the overall bias to be negative as indicated by the log nse values table 2 the model performance is better on falling limb than on the rising limb of the hydrograph this consistently reflects the better performance on low flow values as receding limbs span more time than rising limbs and include more low flow values 3 2 comparison with dswe fig 4 a shows the binary comparisons between crest simulation and preprocessed dswe in streams with contributing area great than 100 km2 the comparison only results in two cases tp and fp as these streams are simulated to be perennial by the crest model it can be found that the detection of water by dswe in the main stem contributing area 300 km2 is unstable with discontinuous segments and water covered pixels in the two upstream tributaries are even more sporadic this is due to the narrow stream width which reduces to around 5 m just upstream of the confluence and possibly reaches the limit of dswe s detectability the only exceptions occurred on 02 15 2017 and 01 04 2019 corresponding to high flow values observed at the downstream usgs gauge fig 3a the high flow causes streams to become wider and detectable by the dswe fig 4b shows that preprocessing reduces the false positive rate to around 0 5 by essentially filling the discontinuous patches removing fp cases in the main stem in summary dswe fails to detect flowing streams narrower than 10 m and inconsistently detect water presence in channels around 15 meter wide 3 3 validation using in situ loggers the results of validating metrics for the threefold cross validation using in situ loggers are presented in table 3 all three scenarios result in very high precision recall and f1 values the three folds show equally high scores indicating the three separately calibrated models can perform comparably on the testing datasets this illustrates the model s ability to perform well with an unseen dataset in potentially a different headwater catchment 3 4 stream dynamics mapping fig 5 a shows the monthly time series of areal averaged precipitation and pet of ubrb over the 4 year period there is a noticeable interannual change in precipitation across the four years with year 2018 being the wettest seasonal variation is also evident where spring march april and may has the most precipitation followed by either summer june july and august or fall september october and november and then winter december january and february also summer months feature hot and dry days with high pet values fig 5b as a result of both precipitation and pet the soil moisture shows clear seasonal pattern with highest soil moisture occurring in winter followed by spring and fall soils are dry in summer with a soil moisture value nearly half of that in winter figs 5c and 7 using four years of daily streamflow grids output we map the water occurrence over the 2510 stream segments in ubrb for the four years and the four seasons fig 6 table 4 summarizes mean annual and seasonal water occurrence conditioned on contributing area for small headwater catchments streams with contributing area over 5 km2 appear to have flow over 77 of the time during the four years smallest tributaries in the headwater catchments contributing area 0 2 km2 are mostly non perennial with active flow for 78 percent of the time in terms of stream length 18 the total 1145 km of stream length stays perennial during the four years across the seasons streams show the highest water occurrence in the spring followed by fall summer and winter this can be explained by the seasonal variability of precipitation and pet as shown in fig 5a in terms of precipitation the wettest season is spring 3 8 mm d followed by summer 3 33 mm d fall 3 15 mm d and winter 1 88 mm d summer features high pet 5 7 mm d offsetting the intense but infrequent precipitation li et al 2012 and resulting in overall lower runoff as compared to fall with an averaged pet of only 2 9 mm d this effect is also evident in storage dynamics of the watershed as shown by the monthly time series of soil moisture in fig 5c the high pet reduces antecedent soil moisture ahead of storm events and further decreases the overland runoff generation in contrast low pet in winter makes the soil moisture higher than in any other season fig 5c and fig 7 despite the lowest precipitation this causes the water occurrence of streams in winter season to be only slightly smaller than that in the summer season fig 7 shows the seasonally averaged soil moisture simulated by crest where two areas outlined with different hydrologic responses are selected to illustrate the heterogeneous effects of geographical properties on stream dynamics fig 8 a and 8b show the monthly mean areal water occurrence and soil moisture for the two areas respectively in all seasons but summer soil moisture in area b is higher than in area a in area b the dramatic drop of soil moisture in summer also coincides with the sudden decrease of water occurrence as seen in august 2016 july 2018 and july 2019 such discrepancy in the hydrologic response is due to the different soil and land types of the two areas as shown in fig 1 area a features a more impervious surface plus sandy soils which hold low soil water content whereas area b is a naturalized catchment with clayey soils of high water holding capacity in summer limited evapotranspiration occurs in the area a due to its impervious coverage the soil moisture in area a is thus less sensitive than in area b fig 8b fig 8c and d show the monthly composition of surface and subsurface runoff in area a and b respectively the dotted lines mark the 50 value and no color signifies months without rainfall input it can be found that the different land cover and soil properties cause area a and area b to be dominated by surface and subsurface runoff respectively the higher proportion of surface runoff in area a could also be the reason for the overall higher water occurrence although subsurface runoff dominates in area b a few switches in the runoff generation mechanism can be found in summer when surface runoff composition gets above 50 such switches coincide with lowest soil moisture values since whatever small amount of infiltration is stored as soil water instead of running off in terms of land cover and soil types area b is representative of the whole ubrb fig 1 suggesting a large fraction of the watershed is as sensitive as area b and likely to experience similar seasonal switches in runoff generation mechanism we also examine the relationships between streamflow and drainage density in 16 selected catchments as shown in fig 9 the selection incorporates three levels of catchments sizes 10 to 20 50 to 60 and near 120 km2 and assures that catchments are independent within each level and spread evenly over the ubrb across the three levels drainage density as plotted in fig 9a to c increases roughly as power functions of unit discharge below some threshold values about 10 2 mm d and plateaus beyond the threshold in log log scale the values below the threshold are also fitted to linear relationships for each individual catchment the fitted relationships show strong statistical significance as indicated by the high r2 coefficient of determination values table 5 for basins of various sizes the log log slope k values exponent in the power law relationships are similar 0 31 to 0 4 while the log log intercepts b range from 0 91 to 1 23 variability in drainage density at a given unit discharge the spread along the vertical direction reduces with increasing catchment size as tributaries merge at confluences and form larger streams 3 5 discussion both streamflow in high order streams and wet dry status in headwater tributaries are automatically calibrated in this study automatic calibration scheme allows multi objective cost functions and is appropriate necessary for intermittent catchments azarnivand et al 2020b like the f1 score used for calibration using in situ logger data the underestimation of high flow values by the crest model is mainly due to the daily simulation time step fohrer et al 2001 during high flow events flooding the timing and magnitude of flood peaks are sensitive to the temporal distribution of rainfall because of the non linearities in the water balance and routing processes the daily average rainfall intensity diffuses any sub daily variabilities and is too coarse for simulating streamflow during floods also in overland routing scheme kinematic wave travel time from one grid cell to next downstream shortens with increasing unit discharge during floods the daily time step is at a larger scale than the travel time between 10 meter grid cells such effect also propagates downstream causing the translated volume to reduce at higher order streams the underestimation of high flow has not been widely reported by other modeling studies that investigate intermittent catchments using also daily timestep probably due to the relatively small catchment size and short channel length e g niedda and pirastru 2014 pierini et al 2014 camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 in comparison with distributed models lumped models could deal with this issue with flexibility for instance by using duration specific unit hydrographs however the trade off is the inability to simulate streamflow at any point within the catchment like the distributed models the interannual and seasonal variabilities of the rainfall and pet are well reflected in stream dynamics in ubrb fig 6 the role of rainfall intensity and frequency have been demonstrated to be vital for stream dynamics in intermittent catchments by previous studies azarnivand et al 2020a dean et al 2016 the contrast of water occurrence in summer and fall indicates mutual effects of rainfall pet and soil moisture on runoff generation interestingly the seasonality in forcings is strong enough to switch runoff generation mechanism in headwater tributaries across wet and dry periods fig 8d which is also revealed by previous studies on the blue river basin li et al 2012 tian et al 2012 the heterogeneity in catchment characteristics cause distinction in water occurrence of head tributaries fig 8 via the distribution of surface and subsurface runoff this strengthens the significance of antecedent catchment wetness prior to rainfall events in driving streamflow in intermittent catchments as also reported in previous studies viola et al 2014 niedda and pirastru 2014 although not fully exposed in the ubrb the crest model lacks representation of certain physical processes at fine spatial resolution e g 10 m which might become issues in other study areas for instance in low yielding basins in the western u s additional abstraction storage needs to be included to represent ground surface depression and soil shrinkage cracks in terms of groundwater the crest model adopts a conceptual bucket module to represent the recharge and discharge of groundwater in which groundwater flow is assumed to be parallel to the surface topography the bucket concept is also widely used in other distributed hydrologic and land surface models niu et al 2011 as a simplification of the highly heterogeneous and nonlinear groundwater flow process because an explicit representation of these processes is currently limited by the lack of information on bedrock topography camporese et al 2019 and the difficulty to assign spatially and vertically distributed parameters maneta et al 2008 also this assumption exempts the assignment of boundary conditions because groundwater is assumed to move only within the watershed boundary free from influence of surrounding hydraulic heads however there would be issues when the extent of underlying aquifer significantly exceeds the watershed boundary or when surface flow originates in aquifer fed springs the scaling relationships between drainage density and unit discharge have been reported in studies based on field mapping godsey and kirchner 2014 gregory and walling 1968 due to the low frequency of mapping and logistical challenges the mapped stream networks are subject to issues like low statistical significance limited spatial coverage of mapped networks in complex terrain and influences from stochastic factors e g debris and sediment collected by tree falls as demonstrated in this study hydrologic modeling here confirms and augments the power law relationship of strong statistical significance by continuously generating data at high resolution over a large spatial scale the scaling relationships plateau at some threshold discharge values representing entirely active stream networks at high flow conditions the existence of some plateau is reasonable because it physically represents the geomorphic channel networks i e the branching networks of topographic features nonetheless the plateaus which correspond to the size total length of stream networks are limited by the resolution of topographic data dem in other words the total length of streams could have exponentially increased and allowed the power law relationship to extend further had the model been simulated over finer grids e g using 1 meter dem to certain extent the plateau also justifies the underestimation of high flow by the crest model as stream dynamics is demonstrated to be only sensitive to discharge at low moderate flow conditions 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture the stream dynamics in upper blue river basin ok the fully distributed crest model is established over 10 meter grids using distributed geographic data forcing data and parameters of fine resolution the high spatial resolution of the simulation enables us to decipher dynamics in refined stream networks with the averaged contributing area of individual stream segment being 0 2 km2 the large spatial scale of study area exceeds most of existing studies and allows us to examine the stream dynamics across a wide range of stream orders and catchment sizes and potentially capture effects from heterogenous catchment characteristics to achieve desired model performance at various stream orders we deploy in situ state loggers at nine headwater tributaries as an additional calibration validation source to the usgs stream gauge we also explore the utility of landsat product dswe in capturing water presence in high order channels output streamflow grids are lastly used to map actively flowing stream networks at daily time step the mapped stream networks are interpreted hydrologically using the gridded output from the crest model the major findings are summarized as follows 1 the hydrologic simulation at 10 meter spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution using the crest model performs well against low moderate observed flow as indicated by a logarithmic nse over 0 7 in the validation period due to the daily timestep high flow values are underestimated at headwater tributaries the calibrated simulation can accurately capture wet dry status as compared with in situ logger records 2 the 30 meter landsat dynamic surface water estimate dswe products are insufficient to serve as validation source for water presence even in high order streams after preprocessing is applied due to limitation in resolution the data only detect discontinuous patches of water in 15 meter wide streams and sporadic water presence in 10 meter wide streams 3 flowing stream networks are dynamic over the 4 year simulation period in ubrb at daily time step the density of flowing stream length scales as a power law function of unit discharge below a threshold value above the threshold the whole networks become active with flowing water the existence of the threshold also justifies the underestimation of high flow values by the crest as stream dynamics is sensitive only to low moderate unit discharges the exponent of the power law relationship i e change in drainage density per change in unit discharge stays consistent across catchments of various sizes indicating the existence of a central tendency across the numerous streams in utrb 4 mapping of water occurrence shows that streams are most dynamic in the small headwater catchments the interannual and seasonal variabilities of precipitation and pet is well reflected by the water occurrence in these small non perennial tributaries the distinction in land cover and soil properties cause the runoff generation mechanism to differ among heterogenous headwater catchments which indicates the significance of antecedent catchment wetness prior to rainfall events in driving streamflow in non perennial catchments compared with traditional field mapping approach in stream dynamics study the modeling approach can generate data samples with greater statistical significance temporal frequency and range therefore distributed hydrologic models should be utilized more to understand controls on the sensitivity of the flowing stream networks to changes in runoff this study also reveals the need for future research efforts since hydrological modeling of intermittent streams is very much constrained by the quantity and quality of observations needed to calibrate and validate the model outputs therefore as a priori estimates from this study the simulated output needs to be supplemented with better datasets also models in general are only as good as our understanding of the physical processes that drive stream dynamics the representation of physical processes is also sensitive to model resolution at fine scales additional processes need to be included and represent complex nonlinear processes of runoff generation in low yielding basins e g surface groundwater interactions or local geological peculiarities like karstic areas ye et al 1997 following this study ongoing research focuses on coupling crest with land surface models to represent springs fed by unconfined aquifers in arid and karstic basins finally as we are confident that the mapped dynamic stream networks make sense hydrologically a more in depth future study focusing on stream dynamics will follow to take advantage of the rich information in the crest simulation

following the steps below first digital elevation model dem data in crest like most of distributed hydrologic models are filled to avoid water from being trapped locally ponds and potholes should thus be excluded from validation we automatically segment ponds from the dswe rasters using an algorithm traditionally applied in identifying rain cells from radar images dixon and wiener 1993 and then filtering the identified clusters of water covered pixels considering their shape and area after fitting identified pixel clusters to ellipsoids we exclude those with ellipticity ratio of minor axis over major axis lower than 0 2 and area above 9 000 m2 next we align the stream cells in dswe rasters with those in the crest domain by nudging adjacent inundated dswe pixels into crest streams while limiting the nudging distance to be 30 m one dswe pixel this step is crucial because the crest streamflow output is 1 d which means one stream cell and its adjacent overland cells could have significantly different contributing area and stream flow therefore a dswe water covered pixel is paired aligned with a nearby stream cell for the comparison lastly the water covered pixels in dswe can be discontinuous even after the alignment fig a1 which can be interpreted as isolated pools in small streams but are unlikely to occur in high order streams with persistent baseflow another cause for the discontinuity is no data stripes of unscanned pixels that cut through stream networks and leave many no data gaps in order to quantify the effect from the discontinuous features in higher order streams we fill the gaps between two adjacent water covered segments that are separated by 90 m of flow distance distance along streams and have drainage area over 300 km2 with the preprocessing done dswe rasters are resampled using nearest neighbor approach to 10 meter resolution and then compared with crest streamflow grids 
4374,global studies have observed divergent impacts of forest cover changes on water yields and biophysical effects on local temperatures these two topics have long been debated by the scientific community here we built a quantitative link between the negative positive effects of forest cover changes on water yields and the biophysical cooling warming effects of forest cover on local temperatures this model performs well across 12 paired watersheds and eddy covariance observations worldwide our results show that the directions of forest biophysical effects on temperatures are strongly related to the directions of water yield effects caused by the forest cover changes in general the water yield effects associated with forest biophysical processes increase significantly as climatic dryness increases and these parts are usually larger than those from the background climate notably the ratio of water yield differences to corresponding temperature changes caused by forest cover changes is larger in a dry climate than that in a humid climate our findings support the hypothesis that forest water yield in the dry climate regions is more sensitive to land cover changes than that in the humid climate regions this study provides new insights into explaining the differences in water yield effects of forest cover changes between the dry and humid climates keywords

warming alkama and cescatti 2016 however two important scientific questions associated with the process of forest carbon sequestration have long been debated by scientific communities one question is the impact of forest cover on local temperatures lee et al 2011 li et al 2015 su et al 2019 conflicting observations from global studies have shown inconsistent biophysical effects of forest cover on

of forest cover changes on regional water resources zhou et al 2015 global paired watershed experiments have shown considerable negative effects hibbert 1965 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 limited negative effects dyhr nielsen 1986 buttle and metcalfe 2000 antonio et al 2008 or even positive effects zhou et al 2008 wang et al 2011 of forest cover on water yields zhou et al 2015

processes are tightly coupled with energy fluxes in forest atmosphere interactions zhang et al 2004 fuh 1981 budyko 1974 su et al 2019 we hypothesize that the negative and positive effects of forest cover on water yields are tied to the biophysical cooling and warming effects of forest cover on local temperatures we aimed to establish a quantitative linkage between the effects of forest cover on water yield and the effects on local temperatures by combining a classic water balance model chen et al 2015 and a three layered energy balance model of forest land su et al 2019 methods we grouped 12

model of forest land su et al 2019 which separated the biophysical effects of forests on air and soil temperatures the step by step formula deductions for the model development were listed in the

control whether forest cover changes impose negative or positive effects on water yields 3 2 increased sensitivity of forest water yield changes associated with its biophysical effects under large Œª p values the Œª p index in the wbm cas model equation 5 is a regional climate indicator that is defined as the ratio of energy input to rainfall input p where Œª is the transfer coefficient the Œª p index illustrates that the background climate is limited by precipitation Œª p 1 0 hereafter called a water limited climate or limited by radiation Œª p 1 0 hereafter named an energy limited climate in principle the wbm cas model equation 5 indicates that the forest water yield changes associated with forest biophysical effects i e the Œ¥ a Œ¥ t c Œ¥ t a and Œ¥ t s terms will be amplified by Œª p under a water limited climate Œª p 1 0 and will be minimized by Œª p under an energy limited climate Œª p 1 0 here the Œª p values of the 12 selected site groups are all 1 0 fig 2 shows an intuitive relation between the Œª p index and the impacts of forest biophysical effects on water yield the forest biophysical effects in relation to the Œ¥ a Œ¥ t c Œ¥ t a and Œ¥ t s terms show different directions of the impacts on Œ¥ r p but their magnitudes all increase significantly with the increase in Œª p fig 2 the results verify that a drier climate could result in a more amplified impact on water yields associated with forest biophysical effects during the derivation of equation 5 we partitioned the contributions of background climate Œª p and forest biophysical effects the Œ¥ a Œ¥ t c Œ¥ t a and Œ¥ t s terms to forest water yield changes Œ¥ r p methods fig 3 in general the water yield impacts associated with forest biophysical effects are usually larger than those from the background climate in particular with the increase in Œª p the contributions from forest biophysical effects increase significantly fig 3 while the background climate plays less important roles in influencing the Œ¥ r p our results imply less importance of forest cover in influencing water yield under a humid climate than under a dry climate 4 discussions it is well understood that forest lands have low albedo resulting in the interception of large amounts of radiation and have high evapotranspiration to consume more water resources than other land types lee et al 2011 zeng et al 2017 su et al 2019 which tends to negatively influence the forest water yield these potential threats of water resource trade offs caused by forest cover have limited the uptake of large scale reforestation activities in climate policies canadell and raupach 2008 however despite the negative effects of forest cover on water yield indicated above some experimental studies have observed considerable positive effects zhou et al 2008 wang et al 2011 of forest cover on water yields zhou et al 2015 the analysis in this study suggested that whether forest water yield is larger or smaller than that in other land surfaces is quantitively associated with the biophysical warming or cooling of forests on local temperatures fig 1 b and 2 large positive effects on Œ¥ r p in relation to the Œ¥ t c term can offset the negative effects on Œ¥ r p in relation to other forest biophysical effects the Œ¥ t c term is dependent of the aerodynamic resistances to sensible heat transfer of canopy open air r 0 419 p 0 001 and understory air canopy r 0 477 p 0 001 layers equation 5 which show negative correlations with Œ¥ r p fig 4 this means that high aerodynamic resistances result in reduced energy

4374,global studies have observed divergent impacts of forest cover changes on water yields and biophysical effects on local temperatures these two topics have long been debated by the scientific community here we built a quantitative link between the negative positive effects of forest cover changes on water yields and the biophysical cooling warming effects of forest cover on local temperatures this model performs well across 12 paired watersheds and eddy covariance observations worldwide our results show that the directions of forest biophysical effects on temperatures are strongly related to the directions of water yield effects caused by the forest cover changes in general the water yield effects associated with forest biophysical processes increase significantly as climatic dryness increases and these parts are usually larger than those from the background climate notably the ratio of water yield differences to corresponding temperature changes caused by forest cover changes is larger in a dry climate than that in a humid climate our findings support the hypothesis that forest water yield in the dry climate regions is more sensitive to land cover changes than that in the humid climate regions this study provides new insights into explaining the differences in water yield effects of forest cover changes between the dry and humid climates keywords

warming alkama and cescatti 2016 however two important scientific questions associated with the process of forest carbon sequestration have long been debated by scientific communities one question is the impact of forest cover on local temperatures lee et al 2011 li et al 2015 su et al 2019 conflicting observations from global studies have shown inconsistent biophysical effects of forest cover on local temperatures i e biophysical cooling and biophysical warming these effects have been widely observed among many empirical field based wong and yu 2005 georgi and zafiriadis 2006 potchter et al

of forest cover changes on regional water resources zhou et al 2015 global paired watershed experiments have shown considerable negative effects hibbert 1965 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 limited negative effects dyhr nielsen 1986 buttle and metcalfe 2000 antonio et al 2008 or even positive effects zhou et al 2008 wang et al 2011 of forest cover on water yields zhou et al 2015 understanding the underlying mechanism is an essential prerequisite to realistically guide large scale afforestation planning for climate change mitigation rigden and li 2017 given that hydrological processes are tightly coupled with energy fluxes in forest atmosphere interactions zhang et al 2004 fuh 1981 budyko 1974 su et al 2019 we hypothesize that the negative and positive effects of forest cover on water yields are tied to the biophysical cooling and warming effects of forest cover on local temperatures we aimed to establish a quantitative linkage between the effects of forest cover on water yield and the effects on local temperatures by combining a classic water balance model chen et al 2015 and a three layered energy balance model of forest land su et al 2019 methods we grouped 12

effects of forest cover on water yields the eddy covariance ec data at a nearby ec observation site from the fluxnet2015 dataset were matched with each grdc pw to evaluate the effects of forest cover on local temperatures methods 2 methods 2 1 model strategies a novel model was developed in this study to relate the impacts of forest cover changes on water yield to the biophysical effects of forest cover on local temperatures we combined a classic water balance model chen et al 2015 which linked the terrestrial components of the earth system hydrological cycle with a three layered energy balance model of forest land su et al 2019 which separated the biophysical effects of forests on air and soil temperatures the step by step formula deductions for the model development were listed in the supplementary text to verify the above hypothesis we matched two nearby watersheds in forest lands and non forest lands e g grassland and farmland from the grdc https www bafg de respectively the two nearby watersheds were hereafter named as pws we calculated the differences in runoff efficient Œ¥ r p of each pw to evaluate the impacts of forest cover on water yields in addition we also matched a ec flux site close outside the watershed area to each pw group we calculated the differences in air temperature Œ¥ t a soil temperature Œ¥ t s and canopy temperature Œ¥ t c between forest lands and non forest lands to evaluate the impacts of forest cover on local temperatures then we quantitatively linked the water yield differences Œ¥ r p and temperature differences Œ¥ t a Œ¥ t s and Œ¥ t c between forest and non forest lands to validate the model proposed in the methods section in total 12 groups with one grdc pw and a nearby ec site for each group were selected at the global scale

due to lack of deep drainage observations we ignored this part of hydrological processes in this study the wbm equation 2 was forced into the cas model equation 1 by transferring le to et using a

biophysical effects of forest cover on its water yield can be decomposed into 4 terms all acronyms were listed in the front of the main text 1 the Œ¥ a term represents the water yield effects caused by the albedo differences between forest and non forest lands Œª p Œ¥ a 2 the Œ¥ t c term represents the water yield effects in relation to the biophysical processes causing the differences between canopy temperature and open air temperature Œª p œÅ a c p 1 r c a 1 r a c Œ¥ t c 3 the Œ¥ t s term represents the water yield effects in relation to the biophysical processes causing the soil

temperature differences between forest and non forest lands Œª p œÅ a c p 1 r a c 1 r s Œ¥ t a it is well understood that forest cover reduces surface albedo Œ¥ a 0 and intercepts more radiation than other land types lee et al 2011 zeng et al 2017 su et al 2019 this phenomenon tends to cause a negative climate forcing on Œ¥ r p the Œ¥ r p effects from the Œ¥ a term tropic Œ¥ a term 0 011 0 003

control whether forest cover changes impose negative or positive effects on water yields 3 2 increased sensitivity of forest water yield changes associated with its biophysical effects under large Œª p values the Œª p index in the wbm cas model equation 5 is a regional climate indicator that is defined as the ratio of energy input to rainfall input p where Œª is the transfer coefficient the Œª p index illustrates that the background climate is limited by precipitation Œª p 1 0 hereafter called a water limited climate or limited by radiation Œª p 1 0 hereafter named an energy limited climate in principle the wbm cas model equation 5 indicates that the forest water yield changes associated with forest biophysical effects i e the Œ¥ a Œ¥ t c Œ¥ t a and Œ¥ t s terms will be amplified by Œª p under a water limited climate Œª p 1 0 and will be minimized by Œª p under an energy limited climate Œª p 1 0 here the Œª p values of the 12 selected site groups are all 1 0 fig 2 shows an intuitive relation between the Œª p index and the impacts of forest biophysical effects on water yield the forest biophysical effects in relation to the Œ¥ a Œ¥ t c Œ¥ t a and Œ¥ t s terms show different directions of the impacts on Œ¥ r p but their magnitudes all increase significantly with the increase in Œª p fig 2 the results verify that a drier climate could result in a more amplified impact on water yields associated with forest biophysical effects during the derivation of equation 5 we partitioned the contributions of background climate Œª p and forest biophysical effects the Œ¥ a Œ¥ t c Œ¥ t a and Œ¥ t s terms to forest water yield changes Œ¥ r p methods fig 3 in general the water yield impacts associated with forest biophysical effects are usually larger than those from the background climate in particular with the increase in Œª p the contributions from forest biophysical effects increase significantly fig 3 while the background climate plays less important roles in influencing the Œ¥ r p our results imply less importance of forest cover in influencing water yield under a humid climate than under a dry climate 4 discussions it is well understood that forest lands have low albedo resulting in the interception of large amounts of radiation and have high evapotranspiration to consume more water resources than other land types lee et al 2011 zeng et al 2017 su et al 2019 which tends to negatively influence the forest water yield these potential threats of water resource trade offs caused by forest cover have limited the uptake of large scale reforestation activities in climate policies canadell and raupach 2008 however despite the negative effects of forest cover on water yield indicated above some experimental studies have observed considerable positive effects zhou et al 2008 wang et al 2011 of forest cover on water yields zhou et al 2015 the analysis in this study suggested that whether forest water yield is larger or smaller than that in other land surfaces is quantitively associated with the biophysical warming or cooling of forests on local temperatures fig 1 b and 2 large positive effects on Œ¥ r p in relation to the Œ¥ t c term can offset the negative effects on Œ¥ r p in relation to other forest biophysical effects the Œ¥ t c term is dependent of the aerodynamic resistances to sensible heat transfer of canopy open air r 0 419 p 0 001 and understory air canopy r 0 477 p 0 001 layers equation 5 which show negative correlations with Œ¥ r p fig 4 this means that high aerodynamic resistances result in reduced energy transport out of forest systems through sensible heat fluxes and in turn increased energy from forest ecosystem loss through latent heat processes su et al 2019 causing increased water yield losses in forest lands compared to non forest lands in contrast low aerodynamic resistances of forest lands allow more energy to be transported out of forest systems through sensible heat fluxes and less energy to be transported through forest evaporative processes consuming limited water resources or even less than other land surface types creed et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 our findings alert us to pay

impose more impacts on the water resources under a dry climate than that under a humid climate fig 3 zhou et al 2015 observed an increase in the variation in the globally observed water yield coefficient with decreases in the wetness index to verify above predictions we further calculated the water yield coefficient changes per temperature effect wpt caused by forest cover changes equation

induce significant positive feedback on Œ¥ r p these positive feedbacks of forest ecosystems on precipitation could probably offset the negative effects of forest cover on Œ¥ r p and result in net
