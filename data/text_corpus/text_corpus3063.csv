incfii derepressed version of r1 clerget et al 1981 were used as targets for phage enumeration see table s1 for the list of strains used here we used derepressed plasmids or plasmids with high transfer ability to facilitate phage detection and s enterica was selected as plasmid host because sewage contains few somatic phages against s enterica strains compared to other enterobacteriaceae havelaar et al 1985 havelaar and hogeboom 1984 the strains were generated by surface mating assays using escherichia coli strains as plasmid donors strains mg1655 dh5α bw27783 and chsh3 harboring pkjk5 gfp drr27 pkm101 and r1drd19 respectively due to the lack of selectable markers in s enterica mhm112 the plasmids were initially transferred to a fastidious intermediate donor strain e coli st18 a δhema deletion mutant requiring 5 aminolevulinic acid ala for growth thoma and schobert 2009 and with resistance to streptomycin and trimethoprim the initial donor and intermediate recipient strains were grown overnight in luria bertani lb media with appropriate antibiotics and ala at 37 c while shaking these cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 6720 g and resuspended in 0 9 nacl solution the donor and the intermediate recipient strains were mixed in a 1 1 ratio and plated on lb plates supplemented with 50 µg ml ala cultures of donors or recipients alone were used as negative controls after overnight incubation at 25 c for drr27 and at 37 c for pkjk5 pkm101 and r1drd19 the bacteria were collected with an inoculation loop and suspended in 0 9 nacl solution dilutions were plated on lb plates supplemented with 50 µg ml ala and 50 µg ml streptomycin along with either 10 or 20 µg ml tetracycline to select for the intermediate recipient strain harboring drr27 or pkjk5 respectively or 100 µg ml ampicillin pkm101 and r1drd19 a colony from each of these plates was then used in a subsequent surface mating with s enterica mhm112 as described above to obtain mhm112 with each of the plasmids the mating mixtures were plated on lb plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics to select for the plasmids but without ala to eliminate the intermediate strains additionally to confirm the success of the surface mating assay the putative transconjugants were plated on xylose lysine deoxycholate xld plates for visual inspection as s enterica and e coli colonies have distinct morphotypes on this media 2 2 enumeration of bacteriophages with dla assay to enumerate bacteriophages in environmental samples we adopted the classical double layer agar dla assay clokie and kropinski 2009 the environmental water samples were centrifuged for 17 min at 4820 g the supernatant was filtered into a sterile container through a 25 mm whatman glass fiber membrane gf f syringe filter with a pore size of 0 7 µm to reduce the bacterial load while retaining the viral fraction in the filtrate s enterica mhm112 carrying one of the plasmids or without any plasmid somatic control were grown overnight 18 20 h in lb at 37 c while shaking these target strains were diluted in lb to an od600 of 0 5 and 1 ml of this suspension was mixed with 100 µl or 1 ml of the filtered water sample and with 3 ml soft agar medium 0 7 agar in lb broth supplemented with cacl2 and glycerol at a final concentration of 5 mm and 5 respectively santos et al 2009 in sterile glass tubes prewarmed at 48 50 c the mixture was then poured on top of duplicate lb plates with appropriate antibiotics to select for the plasmids to specifically enumerate dna bacteriophages and infer abundance of rna bacteriophages by subtraction from total counts duplicate plates were prepared with soft agar supplemented with rnase a at 40 µg ml following the iso 10705 1 protocol anonymous 2001 all plates were incubated overnight at 25 c before counting the plaques to estimate phage concentration as pfu ml after multiplying by the concentration factor for the low biomass samples where necessary see below we report plasmid specific phage concentrations after subtracting the number of s enterica somatic phages we detected 2 3 collection and processing of water samples twenty nine water samples freshwater or wastewater from different sources and at different degrees of treatment were collected in southern sweden and eastern denmark using either grab samples river samples some of the wastewater samples or 24 h flow proportional sampling samples from municipal wastewater treatment plants the three river samples were from usserød å a peri urban stream north of copenhagen dk they cover different degrees of human influence the stream origin at a lake station 1 a station mostly influenced by agricultural activity station 6 and a station mostly influenced by the urban environment about 500 m downstream of a small municipal wwtp station 7 more details can be found elsewhere lemaire 2021 grab samples 2 l of untreated wastewater were collected from three hospitals within 100 km of copenhagen cities of slagelse herlev and hillerød with 367 938 and 520 beds respectively the fate of plasmid specific phages was studied in three municipal wastewater treatment plants in southern sweden they treat water of the cities of malmø visby and gothenburg ryaverket 106 pe visby 5 104 pe sjölunda 3 105 pe samples were collected twice within a single week of the fall 2020 at the influent after primary clarification gravity settling and at the effluent using 24 h flow proportional sampling the treatment train in these plants included four moving bed bioreactors mbbrs and a secondary clarification step visby activated sludge and secondary filtration two mbrrs and tertiary filtration with disk filters ryaverket wang et al 2020 activated sludge and secondary filtration trickling filter mbbr and flotation sjölunda for samples with low suspended matter river samples and wwtp effluents we concentrated 7 to 9 l of the samples to about 250 ml prior to enumeration we used hollow fiber filtration as described in mcminn et al 2017 which reports a recovery between 20 and 80 for f coliphages the samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c until processing samples collected in denmark were processed within 48 h while samples collected in sweden were processed within 10 days of collection total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss were measured prior to any concentration and according to standard methods american public health association 2014 2 4 molecular analysis 2 4 1 dna extraction dna extraction was carried out using the nucleospin soil kit macherey nagel düren germany following the user manual and using sl2 lysis buffer and without enhancing buffer sx the starting material was 0 5 ml of biomass concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in saline solution 0 9 nacl supplemented with glycerol 10 v v final concentration the wastewater samples were concentrated 10 fold and the low biomass samples 100 fold combining the hollow fiber filtration described in 2 3 and centrifugation the low biomass samples were the river samples and the wttp effluents the concentrated biomass and extracted dna were kept at 80 c for up to 6 months before extraction or before qpcr the dna concentration was measured with qubit fluorometer using the hs dsdna kit invitrogen maryland md usa an extraction blank milli q water was included in each batch of dna extraction 2 4 2 high throughput qpcr a selection of 120 β lactamases genes and genes associated to gene mobility transposases integrases is elements were quantified using high throughput qpcr ht qpcr as described previously li et al 2021 the quantification was performed by resistomap helsinki finland on a smartchip real time pcr cycler takara bio san jose ca for 40 cycles with 100 nl reaction comprised 1 smartchip tb green gene expression master mix takarabio nuclease free pcr grade water 300 nm of each primer and a template concentration of 2 ng µl this technology and microchip design were shown to compare favorably to conventional qpcr assays run with standard curves stedtfeld et al 2018 for each assay disassociation melt curve analysis was conducted at the end of the reaction to confirm that the observed melting behavior was consistent with expectations and we checked the absence of amplification for the dna extraction blanks that served as negative control no problem was detected with both types of quality control of particular interest are the primer sets targeting plasmids as introduced in the arg primer set 2 0 stedtfeld et al 2018 which target incn orit rep kora incp 1 orit trfa incf fic and inchi2 smr0018 plasmids we filtered out data for genes and samples where two or more of the ht qpcr three technical replicates had a cycle threshold ct 28 as previously suggested stedtfeld et al 2018 in addition we checked that at least one of the technical replicates did not suffer from sub optimal efficiency of amplification 1 8 compared to the ideal value of 2 we converted the copy number of the plasmid related genes to relative abundance by dividing them by the copy number of the 16s rrna gene from the same qpcr assay to make our plasmid quantification robust against sample specific partial pcr inhibition or variable dna extraction recovery this plasmid abundance relative to bacterial abundance could then be compared to phage concentration relative to i e divided by the vss concentration used as a proxy of bacterial concentration and always measured on samples not subjected to concentration step 2 5 statistical methods data analysis was conducted in r version 4 1 0 we used statistical methods robust against non normality of the data e g median median absolute deviation kruskal wallis rank sum test to test for concentration differences and spearman correlation test significance threshold was set at p 0 05 lastly the vegan package oksanen et al 2021 was used to generate principal coordinate analysis ordination plots of the phage compositions across samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of the set of strains for environmental enumeration of plasmid specific phages across the tested water samples somatic phages forming plaques against the plasmid free salmonella mhm112 were rare median abundance 0 02 and 31 pfu ml in river and wastewater samples respectively table 1 which allows the quantification of plasmid specific phages with a low detection limit this confirms s enterica as an appropriate host for plasmid specific phage enumeration in the environment as previously proposed havelaar et al 1985 havelaar and hogeboom 1984 the detection limit was even lower for rna phages as we did not find evidence of rnase sensitive somatic phages against mhm112 in eight out of the eleven wastewater samples surveyed we verified that the vast majority of phages purified from the plaques of the plasmid bearing strains displayed a lack of infectivity against the plasmid free strain but could infect other hosts carrying plasmids from the same or related plasmid incompatibility groups 3 2 distribution of plasmid specific phages there are clear differences between wastewater and river samples with the latter characterized by low phage abundance table 1 in river samples the abundance of phages targeting drr27 or r1drd19 was always below detection limit of the dla assay and below 10 pfu ml for the other plasmids pkjk5 specific phages were clearly above detection limit in the two river samples with highest turbidity and pkm101 only in the most turbid sample table s2 the river samples were collected during a summer rainstorm which transitorily mobilized solids possibly including viral particles or viral particles attached to solids fauvel et al 2017 hence the possible link between suspended solid and viral load for these samples an incomplete phage recovery during the concentration of the river samples might have contributed to but cannot fully explain the large difference between river and wastewater samples the latter being processed without concentration the wide distribution of pkjk5 specific phages observed in the river samples was confirmed in the wastewater samples where such phages were always present at concentrations larger than 45 pfu ml table 2 phages targeting drr27 and pkm101 were detected in most wastewater samples with our dla assay 8 out of 12 samples 9 out of 11 samples while those targeting the incfii plasmid r1drd19 were often either below detection limit 4 out of 10 samples or at low abundance median when detected 41 pfu ml this low abundance contrasts with the high f coliphage abundance typically reported in wastewater havelaar et al 1985 nappier et al 2019 for the limited number of samples for which we compared the performance of our test strain with the one classically used for f coliphage enumeration atcc700891 anonymous 2001 both strains yielded similarly low phage counts suggesting that the wastewater samples we tested were characterized by a low concentration of these phages for wastewater samples neither the concentration of individual phage types nor that of all plasmid specific phages combined significantly correlated with the suspended solids concentration vss or tss spearman s ρ 0 42 and p 0 17 suggesting that biomass concentration is not a good predictor of plasmid specific phage distribution in raw wastewater samples however we found that hospital wastewater and the influent of municipal wwtp presented several compositional differences table 1 the hospital samples had higher concentrations of pkjk5 specific phages median 1034 vs 126 pfu ml kruskal wallis rank sum test p 0 02 in contrast the samples from the wwtp influents tended to contain more pkm101 and r1drd19 specific phages table 1 and fig 1 p 0 06 we compared phage abundance with that of plasmid associated genes as measured with the arg ht qpcr array after normalization by the vss concentration and by 16s rrna gene copy number respectively fig 2 all ht qpcr assays and samples passed quality control and all plasmid types were detected in at least five samples genes associated with incp oritt and trfa were detected in all samples while the ones associated with inchi2 incn or incf were below detection limit in the river samples fig 2 the detection of the incf specific gene was restricted to the wwtp influent samples and always with low relative abundance median 1 5 10 5 copies per 16s rrna gene copies we observed slightly different patterns of coexistence between phages and their target depending on the plasmid class we rarely observed coexistence of high abundances of the phages and their targets instead typically when one was abundant the other was not this was most clearly the case for the incn plasmids and pkm101 specific phages as well as for the inchi2 plasmids and the drr27 specific phages fig 2 this pattern is consistent with a high phage efficiency in controlling the density of their preys sometimes termed the killing the winner hypothesis as previously observed in water treatment systems shapiro et al 2009 however in absence of time series of the abundance data we cannot confirm that such scenario has been taking place for incp 1 plasmids and their phages the pattern was more complex in this case the relationship between phage and plasmid abundance depended on the type of sample we noted a positive correlation for both the hospital samples and wwtp influent samples but with very different slopes pearson s product moment correlation 0 97 p 0 05 and 0 85 p 0 07 respectively this effort at relating abundance of plasmids and phages that target them is complicated by the fact that the specificity of any plasmid primer set is unlikely to perfectly match phage specificity indeed plasmid specific phages can often infect carriers of plasmid s of several incompatibility groups for example prd1 like phages target bacteria carrying plasmids from the incp1 w or n groups bamford et al 1995 in contrast the primers we used target single groups or even subgroups of plasmids e g smr0018 only inchi2 when the host range of inch specific phages typically spans the hi1 hi2 and hii groups coetzee et al 1985 3 3 types of phage genomes for a subset of samples we compared the number of plaques on the dla plates in presence and absence of rnase table 2 this revealed that drr27 specific rna phages are more abundant than their dna counterparts while the opposite was true for pkm101 wilcoxon paired test p 0 06 and p 0 008 respectively these dominance patterns are consistent with the fact that all inch specific phages isolates described to date are rna phages coetzee et al 1985 nuttal et al 1987 while all incn specific phages known to date are dna phages bamford et al 1995 bradley et al 1981 khatoon et al 1972 for pkjk5 and r1drd19 in contrast we did not identify a clear dominance pattern which is indicative of higher overall diversity of phages targeting these plasmid groups 3 4 fate of plasmid specific phages through municipal wastewater treatment plants across the phage types and the wwtps we observed that primary clarification did not reduce phage concentration in the water phase fig 3 this limited effect of settling attributable to the small size of the viral particles is consistent with previous research lewis and metcalf 1988 however the rest of the treatment trains strongly reduced phage concentrations which dropped by ca 2 log in the effluent compared to the influent we note that these removal estimates might be biased by the incomplete recovery of phages by the concentration procedure used for the plant effluent samples this recovery was estimated to 20 80 mcminn et al 2017 the overall plant wide removal is similar albeit a bit lower than observed in ryaverket for all viruses as measured by metagenomic sequencing in a separate sampling effort 3 to 4 log wang et al 2020 our experimental design does not allow identification of the process unit s most responsible for phage removal activated sludge where viruses can become associated with microbial biomass and be removed from the liquid stream has been reported to constitute the most significant barrier against viruses iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 lewis and metcalf 1988 tanji et al 2002 however we do not observe a strong difference in removal between the two plants that include this process unit sjölunda and ryaverket and the one which does not visby it is thus likely that the biofilms in mbbrs capture phage virions in a similar fashion as activated sludge flocs do 4 conclusions this first effort at describing the distribution of plasmid specific phages beyond the f coliphages generated the following insight a set of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains was constructed and used to detect and quantify phages targeting four important plasmid classes they open new opportunities in water quality monitoring and for understanding the fate and ecology of conjugal plasmids and the resistance genes they may carry plasmid specific phages are more abundant in wastewater than ambient water suggesting that gut microbiomes are the main sources of these phages phages specific to incp 1 plasmids are especially consistently found in wastewater samples and at elevated concentration in hospital wastewater they could serve as sensitive fecal indicator complementing the established f coliphage indicators the fate of all types of plasmid specific phages confirms municipal wastewater treatment plants and especially secondary treatment as effective barriers against environmental dissemination of viruses of fecal origin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

at 48 50 c the mixture was then poured on top of duplicate lb plates with appropriate antibiotics to select for the plasmids to specifically enumerate dna bacteriophages and infer abundance of rna bacteriophages by subtraction from total counts duplicate plates were prepared with soft agar supplemented with rnase a at 40 µg ml following the iso 10705 1 protocol anonymous 2001 all plates were incubated overnight at 25 c before counting the plaques to estimate phage concentration as pfu ml after multiplying by the concentration factor for the low biomass samples where necessary see below we report plasmid specific phage concentrations after subtracting the number of s enterica somatic phages we detected 2 3 collection and processing of water samples twenty nine water samples freshwater or wastewater from different sources and at different degrees of treatment were collected in southern sweden and eastern denmark using either grab samples river samples some of the wastewater samples or 24 h flow proportional sampling samples from municipal wastewater treatment plants the three river samples were from usserød å a peri urban stream north of copenhagen dk they cover different degrees of human influence the stream origin at a lake station 1 a station mostly influenced by agricultural activity station 6 and a station mostly influenced by the urban environment about 500 m downstream of a small municipal wwtp station 7 more details can be found elsewhere lemaire 2021 grab samples 2 l of untreated wastewater were collected from three hospitals within 100 km of copenhagen cities of slagelse herlev and hillerød with 367 938 and 520 beds respectively the fate of plasmid specific phages was studied in three municipal wastewater treatment plants in southern sweden they treat water of the cities of malmø visby and gothenburg ryaverket 106 pe visby 5 104 pe sjölunda 3 105 pe samples were collected twice within a single week of the fall 2020 at the influent after primary clarification gravity settling and at the effluent using 24 h flow proportional sampling the treatment train in these plants included four moving bed bioreactors mbbrs and a secondary clarification step visby activated sludge and secondary filtration two mbrrs and tertiary filtration with disk filters ryaverket wang et al 2020 activated sludge and secondary filtration trickling filter mbbr and flotation sjölunda for samples with low suspended matter river samples and wwtp effluents we concentrated 7 to 9 l of the samples to about 250 ml prior to enumeration we used hollow fiber filtration as described in mcminn et al 2017 which reports a recovery between 20 and 80 for f coliphages the samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c until processing samples collected in denmark were processed within 48 h while samples collected in sweden were processed within 10 days of collection total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss were measured prior to any concentration and according to standard methods american public health association 2014 2 4 molecular analysis 2 4 1 dna extraction dna extraction was carried out using the nucleospin soil kit macherey nagel düren germany following the user manual and using sl2 lysis buffer and without enhancing buffer sx the starting material was 0 5 ml of biomass concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in saline solution 0 9 nacl supplemented with glycerol 10 v v final concentration the wastewater samples were concentrated 10 fold and the low biomass samples 100 fold combining the hollow fiber filtration described in 2 3 and centrifugation the low biomass samples were the river samples and the wttp effluents the concentrated biomass and extracted dna were kept at 80 c for up to 6 months before extraction or before qpcr the dna concentration was measured with qubit fluorometer using the hs dsdna kit invitrogen maryland md usa an extraction blank milli q water was included in each batch of dna extraction 2 4 2 high throughput qpcr a selection of 120 β lactamases genes and genes associated to gene mobility transposases integrases is elements were quantified using high throughput qpcr ht qpcr as described previously li et al 2021 the quantification was performed by resistomap helsinki finland on a smartchip real time pcr cycler takara bio san jose ca for 40 cycles with 100 nl reaction comprised 1 smartchip tb green gene expression master mix takarabio nuclease free pcr grade water 300 nm of each primer and a template concentration of 2 ng µl this technology and microchip design were shown to compare favorably to conventional qpcr assays run with standard curves stedtfeld et al 2018 for each assay disassociation melt curve analysis was conducted at the end of the reaction to confirm that the observed melting behavior was consistent with expectations and we checked the absence of amplification for the dna extraction blanks that served as negative control no problem was detected with both types of quality control of particular interest are the primer sets targeting plasmids as introduced in the arg primer set 2 0 stedtfeld et al 2018 which target incn orit rep kora incp 1 orit trfa incf fic and inchi2 smr0018 plasmids we filtered out data for genes and samples where two or more of the ht qpcr three technical replicates had a cycle threshold ct 28 as previously suggested stedtfeld et al 2018 in addition we checked that at least one of the technical replicates did not suffer from sub optimal efficiency of amplification 1 8 compared to the ideal value of 2 we converted the copy number of the plasmid related genes to relative abundance by dividing them by the copy number of the 16s rrna gene from the same qpcr assay to make our plasmid quantification robust against sample specific partial pcr inhibition or variable dna extraction recovery this plasmid abundance relative to bacterial abundance could then be compared to phage concentration relative to i e divided by the vss concentration used as a proxy of bacterial concentration and always measured on samples not subjected to concentration step 2 5 statistical methods data analysis was conducted in r version 4 1 0 we used statistical methods robust against non normality of the data e g median median absolute deviation kruskal wallis rank sum test to test for concentration differences and spearman correlation test significance threshold was set at p 0 05 lastly the vegan package oksanen et al 2021 was used to generate principal coordinate analysis ordination plots of the phage compositions across samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of the set of strains for environmental enumeration of plasmid specific phages across the tested water samples somatic phages forming plaques against the plasmid free salmonella mhm112 were rare median abundance 0 02 and 31 pfu ml in river and wastewater samples respectively table 1 which allows the quantification of plasmid specific phages with a low detection limit this confirms s enterica as an appropriate host for plasmid specific phage enumeration in the environment as previously proposed havelaar et al 1985 havelaar and hogeboom 1984 the detection limit was even lower for rna phages as we did not find evidence of rnase sensitive somatic phages against mhm112 in eight out of the eleven wastewater samples surveyed we verified that the vast majority of phages purified from the plaques of the plasmid bearing strains displayed a lack of infectivity against the plasmid free strain but could infect other hosts carrying plasmids from the same or related plasmid incompatibility groups 3 2 distribution of plasmid specific phages there are clear differences between wastewater and river samples with the latter characterized by low phage abundance table 1 in river samples the abundance of phages targeting drr27 or r1drd19 was always below detection limit of the dla assay and below 10 pfu ml for the other plasmids pkjk5 specific phages were clearly above detection limit in the two river samples with highest turbidity and pkm101 only in the most turbid sample table s2 the river samples were collected during a summer rainstorm which transitorily mobilized solids possibly including viral particles or viral particles attached to solids fauvel et al 2017 hence the possible link between suspended solid and viral load for these samples an incomplete phage recovery during the concentration of the river samples might have contributed to but cannot fully explain the large difference between river and wastewater samples the latter being processed without concentration the wide distribution of pkjk5 specific phages observed in the river samples was confirmed in the wastewater samples where such phages were always present at concentrations larger than 45 pfu ml table 2 phages targeting drr27 and pkm101 were detected in most wastewater samples with our dla assay 8 out of 12 samples 9 out of 11 samples while those targeting the incfii plasmid r1drd19 were often either below detection limit 4 out of 10 samples or at low abundance median when detected 41 pfu ml this low abundance contrasts with the high f coliphage abundance typically reported in wastewater havelaar et al 1985 nappier et al 2019 for the limited number of samples for which we compared the performance of our test strain with the one classically used for f coliphage enumeration atcc700891 anonymous 2001 both strains yielded similarly low phage counts suggesting that the wastewater samples we tested were characterized by a low concentration of these phages for wastewater samples neither the concentration of individual phage types nor that of all plasmid specific phages combined significantly correlated with the suspended solids concentration vss or tss spearman s ρ 0 42 and p 0 17 suggesting that biomass concentration is not a good predictor of plasmid specific phage distribution in raw wastewater samples however we found that hospital wastewater and the influent of municipal wwtp presented several compositional differences table 1 the hospital samples had higher concentrations of pkjk5 specific phages median 1034 vs 126 pfu ml kruskal wallis rank sum test p 0 02 in contrast the samples from the wwtp influents tended to contain more pkm101 and r1drd19 specific phages table 1 and fig 1 p 0 06 we compared phage abundance with that of plasmid associated genes as measured with the arg ht qpcr array after normalization by the vss concentration and by 16s rrna gene copy number respectively fig 2 all ht qpcr assays and samples passed quality control and all plasmid types were detected in at least five samples genes associated with incp oritt and trfa were detected in all samples while the ones associated with inchi2 incn or incf were below detection limit in the river samples fig 2 the detection of the incf specific gene was restricted to the wwtp influent samples and always with low relative abundance median 1 5 10 5 copies per 16s rrna gene copies we observed slightly different patterns of coexistence between phages and their target depending on the plasmid class we rarely observed coexistence of high abundances of the phages and their targets instead typically when one was abundant the other was not this was most clearly the case for the incn plasmids and pkm101 specific phages as well as for the inchi2 plasmids and the drr27 specific phages fig 2 this pattern is consistent with a high phage efficiency in controlling the density of their preys sometimes termed the killing the winner hypothesis as previously observed in water treatment systems shapiro et al 2009 however in absence of time series of the abundance data we cannot confirm that such scenario has been taking place for incp 1 plasmids and their phages the pattern was more complex in this case the relationship between phage and plasmid abundance depended on the type of sample we noted a positive correlation for both the hospital samples and wwtp influent samples but with very different slopes pearson s product moment correlation 0 97 p 0 05 and 0 85 p 0 07 respectively this effort at relating abundance of plasmids and phages that target them is complicated by the fact that the specificity of any plasmid primer set is unlikely to perfectly match phage specificity indeed plasmid specific phages can often infect carriers of plasmid s of several incompatibility groups for example prd1 like phages target bacteria carrying plasmids from the incp1 w or n groups bamford et al 1995 in contrast the primers we used target single groups or even subgroups of plasmids e g smr0018 only inchi2 when the host range of inch specific phages typically spans the hi1 hi2 and hii groups coetzee et al 1985 3 3 types of phage genomes for a subset of samples we compared the number of plaques on the dla plates in presence and absence of rnase table 2 this revealed that drr27 specific rna phages are more abundant than their dna counterparts while the opposite was true for pkm101 wilcoxon paired test p 0 06 and p 0 008 respectively these dominance patterns are consistent with the fact that all inch specific phages isolates described to date are rna phages coetzee et al 1985 nuttal et al 1987 while all incn specific phages known to date are dna phages bamford et al 1995 bradley et al 1981 khatoon et al 1972 for pkjk5 and r1drd19 in contrast we did not identify a clear dominance pattern which is indicative of higher overall diversity of phages targeting these plasmid groups 3 4 fate of plasmid specific phages through municipal wastewater treatment plants across the phage types and the wwtps we observed that primary clarification did not reduce phage concentration in the water phase fig 3 this limited effect of settling attributable to the small size of the viral particles is consistent with previous research lewis and metcalf 1988 however the rest of the treatment trains strongly reduced phage concentrations which dropped by ca 2 log in the effluent compared to the influent we note that these removal estimates might be biased by the incomplete recovery of phages by the concentration procedure used for the plant effluent samples this recovery was estimated to 20 80 mcminn et al 2017 the overall plant wide removal is similar albeit a bit lower than observed in ryaverket for all viruses as measured by metagenomic sequencing in a separate sampling effort 3 to 4 log wang et al 2020 our experimental design does not allow identification of the process unit s most responsible for phage removal activated sludge where viruses can become associated with microbial biomass and be removed from the liquid stream has been reported to constitute the most significant barrier against viruses iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 lewis and metcalf 1988 tanji et al 2002 however we do not observe a strong difference in removal between the two plants that include this process unit sjölunda and ryaverket and the one which does not visby it is thus likely that the biofilms in mbbrs capture phage virions in a similar fashion as activated sludge flocs do 4 conclusions this first effort at describing the distribution of plasmid specific phages beyond the f coliphages generated the following insight a set of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains was constructed and used to detect and quantify phages targeting four important plasmid classes they open new opportunities in water quality monitoring and for understanding the fate and ecology of conjugal plasmids and the resistance genes they may carry plasmid specific phages are more abundant in wastewater than ambient water suggesting that gut microbiomes are the main sources of these phages phages specific to incp 1 plasmids are especially consistently found in wastewater samples and at elevated concentration in hospital wastewater they could serve as sensitive fecal indicator complementing the established f coliphage indicators the fate of all types of plasmid specific phages confirms municipal wastewater

15316,the incorporation of secondary metal atoms into iron oxyhydroxides may regulate the surface chemistry of mediating electron transfer et and therefore the biogeochemical pollutant processes such as arsenic as in the subsurface and soils the influence of incorporating two typical metals cu and zn into a specific 001 hematite facet on o2 activation by surface bound fe ii was addressed the results showed that cu incorporated hematite enhances as iii oxidation in the presence of fe ii under oxic conditions and increases with increasing cu content conversely zn incorporation leads to the opposite trend the as iii oxidation induced by surface bound fe ii is positively related to the fe ii content and is favorable under acidic conditions reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide o2 and h2o2 predominantly contribute to as iii oxidation as a result of 1 electron transfer from bound fe ii to surface o2 on hematite and radical propagation electrochemical analysis demonstrates that cu incorporation significantly lower the oxidation potential of fe ii on hematite whereas zn led to a higher reaction potential for fe ii oxidation subsequently distinct surface reactivities of hematite for the activation of o2 to form ros by surface bound fe ii are evidenced by metal incorporation our study provides a new understanding of the changes in the surface chemistry of iron oxyhydroxides because of incorporating metals zn and cu and therefore impact the biogeochemical processes of pollutants in soils and subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidative transformation iron oxides heavy metalloid electron reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in water and soils caused by the weathering of arsenic containing minerals and human activities such as mining has received considerable attention showing potential threats to food security and human health teixeira et al 2020 hong et al 2021 in aqueous environments inorganic as is present in its main form including arsenate as v and arsenite as iii and as iii exhibits considerably higher toxicity and mobility than as v boussouga et al 2021 wang et al 2022 thus the redox transformation of as iii to as v is a crucial detoxification process of as biogeochemical processes in water and soil environments tong et al 2021 liu et al 2022 iron oxyhydroxides are a class of major redox sensitive minerals that mediate the adsorption and or redox transformation of as under aerobic and anaerobic conditions redox processes on the surface of iron oxyhydroxides are important for limiting the toxicity and mobility of as in aquatic and terrestrial environments kendall et al 2012 ding et al 2018 huang et al 2020 ferrous ions generated by microorganisms or organic electron shuttles from fe iii reduction can be adsorbed on the surface of iron oxyhydroxides and react with oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as oh and o2 radicals han et al 2016 yu et al 2013 gubler and thomasarrigo 2021 in iron oxyhydroxide driven interfacial redox processes the facets and defects of iron oxyhydroxide surfaces can influence the surface structure and electron transfer abilities catalano et al 2010 jin et al 2017 different exposed iron oxyhydroxide facets formed under varying conditions exhibit distinct surface active site density electron transfer efficiency and therefore redox activities leading to differences in the redox of fe ii soil organic matter and organic pollutants on iron oxyhydroxide surfaces catalano et al 2010 hu et al 2021a b hao et al 2022a moreover the iron oxyhydroxide defects also influence their interfacial redox processes and therefore influence the tendency of electron transfer via a decrease in the activation energy barrier cao et al 2016 lira et al 2011 the natural formation of iron oxyhydroxides is generally accompanied by the incorporation of impurity elements such as cu2 zn2 and al3 which may lead to the generation of defects and an increase in the lattice iron or oxygen vacancies of iron oxyhydroxides lassoued et al 2017 bylaska et al 2019 notini et al 2018 frierdich et al 2012 the increase in oxygen or iron vacancies after incorporation into iron oxyhydroxides can enhance or reduce the redox abilities of iron oxyhydroxides such as hematite goethite and magnetite jin et al 2017 cao et al 2016 bylaska et al 2019 generally cu incorporation increases the oxygen vacancies of oxyhydroxides whereas zn incorporation increases iron vacancies the reverse defect caused by these two naturally spread elements may have different effects on the redox and electron transfer abilities of oxyhydroxides cao et al 2016 bylaska et al 2019 interfacial observations of facet and defect dependent effects of iron oxyhydroxide mediated redox processes have been widely studied while the coupled effects of facets and defects on the redox transformation of as iii on iron oxyhydroxides induced by surface bound fe ii are still unknown in this study we investigated the coupling effects of crystalline facets and defects of iron hydro oxide on the electron transfer process of fe ii with o2 and subsequently the redox transformation process of as iii hematite with a highly exposed 001 facet and incorporated with foreign metals including cu zn i e cu hem zn hem was selected as a model iron oxide owing to its typical semiconductive feature and stability in water and soil and the 001 hematite facet always exhibits higher electron transfer ability and more surface active sites compared to other facets owing to its specific atomic arrangements wu et al 2021 huang et al 2016a b hu et al 2021a as iii adsorption and oxidation mediated by cu hem and zn hem were investigated in the presence of fe ii under varying conditions moreover the effects of the cu and zn incorporation ratio fe ii concentration and ph on as iii adsorption and redox processes were also evaluated subsequently quenching experiments were conducted to verify the ros response to as iii oxidation in fe ii cu hem or zn hem systems the electrochemical properties of hematite mixed with fe ii were investigated to analyze the mechanisms of the reaction differences for different hematite samples these observations provide insights into the biogeochemical recycling of as in aquatic and terrestrial systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o hydrochloric acid hcl potassium hydroxide

iron powder and then the fe ii stock solution was diluted to 200 mg l in an anaerobic chamber 2 2 hem cu hem and zn hem preparation different hematite materials were synthesized using previously established methods lv et al 2018 appropriate amounts of fecl3 6h2o cucl2 or zhcl2 and 11 2 g of ch3coona were prepared and the mixtures were dissolved in 140 ml of ethanol and 9 8 ml of milli q water the total concentrations of fe cu and zn in the synthesized solutions were 0 093 m and the molar ratios of cu or zn cu or zn fe were ranged from 0 to 0 03 the solution was stirred for 1 h then heated at 180 c for 12 h finally milli q water and ethanol were used to wash the precipitates at least three times and dried for further use 2 3 characterization the synthesized hem cu hem and zn hem powders

reaction was placed on an al platform and the valence states of fe cu zn o and as were analyzed using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo fischer uk 2 4 batch experiments the adsorption and oxidation processes of as iii by hem cu hem and zn hem were investigated in the presence of different concentrations of fe ii ranging from to 0 10 mg l under varying ph conditions including 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 the experiments were performed in brown sample bottles at 200 rpm and 25 1 c the hem cu hem or zn hem concentrations were 1 g l in all experiments and ph was adjusted at 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 by 0 1 m hcl or naoh appropriate amounts of as iii and fe ii stock solutions were added to the above suspensions under anoxic conditions and the final concentration of as iii was 5 mg l successively the mixed suspensions were exposed to air to trigger the reactions and the concentrations of as iii as v and fe ii of the reaction solution at different reaction times up to 120 min were analyzed after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane filter all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 5 radical quenching experiments to investigate the contribution of ros to as iii oxidation radical quenching experiments were conducted by adding ipa 1 4 benzoquinone and cat to the reaction solution the dosage of cu hem 0 03 and as iii were 1 g l and 5 mg l respectively at ph 7 0 the suspensions during the reactions were extracted from the reaction solutions at different reaction times including 2 5 15 30 60 and 120 min and 1 ml of the suspension of each reaction time was mixed with 1 ml of 6 m hcl to

characterization the related electrochemical properties were analyzed using an electrochemical workstation composed of a working electrode platinum counter electrode and reference electrode ag agcl the electron transfer rates of different hematite samples were calculated by cyclic voltammetry cv using the laviron method in different reaction systems at various scan rates 0 05 to 2 v s 1 both the

3 r t 1 α n f log 1 α n f v a r t k e r where α and v refer to the coefficient of electron transfer and scan rate respectively and r t and f refer to the gas constant temperature 298 k and faraday constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 hem cu hem and zn hem characterization in general the 001 facets of hematite exhibit higher activity and electron transfer abilities than other facets of hematite hu et al 2021a b hao et al 2022a the incorporation ratios of cu or zn from cu hem or zn hem ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 table s1 the sem and tem images show that the synthesized hem cu hem and zn hem have well defined nanoplate shapes with mainly exposed hexagonal 001 facets huang et al 2016a hu et al 2021b while the size of cu zn hem decreases gradually from approximately 90 to 50 nm with increasing cu zn incorporation ratios especially for zn hem 0 03 figs 1 a f and s1 this is likely attributable to the enhancement of the nucleation center density of hematite after the incorporation of cu or zn gao et al 2020 lassoued et al 2017 the radius of zn is greater than that of cu which leads to a smaller size of approximately 50 nm for zn hem 0 03 moreover cu and zn element signals have been clearly detected by edx mapping of cu zn hem indicating that cu and zn are successfully incorporated within hematite fig 1c f the xrd patterns of cu hem and zn hem show that the synthesized iron oxides matched well with pdf 33 0644 of standard hematite figs 1g and s2 among these diffraction peaks the 110 peak is the strongest of all the synthesized hematite which demonstrates that these iron oxides exhibit crystal development along the a b direction hao et al 2022a the peak intensities of the 104 and 110 peaks of hematite decreased after the incorporation of cu and zn fig 1g indicating a decrease in the crystal size wu et al 2021 like the sem and tem results fig 1a f the half peak widths of the peaks increase fig 1g indicating that the incorporation of cu and zn decrease the hematite size and crystalline degree wu et al 2021 this may be caused by an increase in iron oxide defects and or the substitution of lattice fe sites by foreign ions lassoued et al 2017 klug and alexander 1974 aquino and balela 2020 the binding energy of fe2p from cu hem increases while that of zn hem decrease fig s3a b this is likely caused by the density alteration of the outer electron cloud of fe3 ions after incorporating cu or zn kang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 the cu and zn signals of cu hem and zn hem are also detected corresponding to the signals of cu o and zn o respectively fig s3c d the o 1 s signals of different hematite samples are divided into four peaks including surface oh lattice oh fe o and cu zn o fig 1h the percentage of surface oh reflects the oxygen vacancy content jin et al 2017 the percentage of surface oh from cu hem 0 03 increase from 7 52 to 22 6 compared to that of hem while the percentage of surface oh from zn hem 0 03 decrease fig 1h this result suggests that cu hem contains more oxygen vacancies whereas zn hem contains more iron vacancies jin et al 2017 bylaska et al 2019 for cu hem oxygen vacancies are mainly contributed by the enhanced positive charge of the lattice after the incorporation of cu which can attract more electrons from the o atoms lassoued et al 2017 for zn hem substituting zn for lattice fe3 and subsequent interstitial site proton addition to maintain charge balance can lead to an increase in iron vacancies bylaska et al 2019 3 2 as adsorption and oxidation on hematite in the presence of fe ii fig 2 a shows that in the presence of 5 mg l fe ii hem cu hem 0 03 and zn hem 0 03 effectively adsorb as iii while fe ii alone slightly lower the concentrations of as iii in the aqueous phase the adsorption extent of as iii follow the trend cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 in the presence of fe ii fig 2a during this process chemical adsorption through the inner sphere primarily mediates the adsorption of as iii zhang et al 2017 hematite samples adsorb more as iii in the presence of fe ii compared to hematite in the absence of fe ii fig 2b indicating that fe ii contributes to the adsorption of as in solutions as a new iron hydro oxide hydrate phase formed by the oxidation of adsorbed fe ii chen et al 2020 frierdich et al 2015 the total oxidized as v mediated by different hematite was investigated to compare the effect of oxidation of as iii to as v fig 2c and the ratios of generated as v by fe ii hem fe ii cu hem 0 03 fe ii and zn hem 0 03 are 8 4 48 7 67 9 and 35 0 respectively the adsorbed fe ii decays rapidly and 6 10 fe ii remains on the surface of hematite fig 2d this demonstrates that as iii oxidation occur on the iron oxide surface liu et al 2022 amstaetter et al 2010 moreover the fe ii content after the reaction differs at different hematite interfaces with cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 indicating that more fe ii contributes to the fe ii fe iii recycling process for cu hem 0 03 because of the high content of oxygen vacancies and probable lattice cu i cu ii recycling process jin et al 2017 moreover excluding cu or zn incorporated hematite defects the size or surface area of different hematite also differed fig 1a f which may influence various geochemical processes chi et al 2022 however the surface area effect is not a key factor in the as iii adsorption and oxidation processes as there is no obvious regularity between the surface area and as iii adsorption and oxidation efficiencies fig 1a f fig 2 3 3 incorporation ratio effect of cu zn on the adsorption and oxidation of as iii the effects of the cu or zn incorporation ratio on as iii oxidation by cu hem or zn hem are shown in fig 3 for cu hem the as adsorption rate increase with increasing cu incorporation ratio from 0 01 to 0 03 fig 3a while the adsorption rate of zn hem decrease with increasing zn incorporation ratio fig 3d a similar trend is also observed for adsorbed as on hematite the adsorbed as on cu hem increase with an increase in the cu incorporation ratio while the adsorbed as on zn hem decrease with an increase in the zn incorporation ratio fig s4 this is likely due to the change in the number of adsorption sites after the incorporation of cu or zn more adsorption sites exist for cu hem owing to the increase in oxygen vacancies whereas the number of adsorption sites gradually decreases as lattice fe is instituted by h with the increase in the zn incorporation ratio jin et al 2017 bylaska et al 2019 subsequently the oxidation of as iii by cu hem or zn hem with different cu or zn incorporation ratios are investigated the total generated as v increase after increasing the cu incorporation ratio of cu hem while less as v are generated for an increased zn incorporation ratio of zn hem fig 3b e the fe ii content contents of fe ii decrease rapidly and the reaction rates decrease to equilibrium fig 3c f during this process more fe ii exist on cu hem with the increase in cu incorporation ratio from 0 01 to 0 03 fig 3c as the incorporated cu can promote the fe ii recycling process while the opposite trend is observed for zn hem because of the inhibition effects for fe ii recycling fig 3f moreover our results show no apparent as iii oxidation in the presence of cuo and zno indicating that cu o or zn o in cu hem or zn hem hardly influence as iii oxidation fig s5 3 4 effect of water chemistry on as iii adsorption and oxidation water chemistry parameters such as fe ii concentration and ph can remarkably influence as iii redox transformation chen et al 2022 hao et al 2022b in the presence of fe ii additional as iii can be adsorbed by hematite from the solution fig 4 a as a result of new iron oxide formation on hematite surfaces under aerobic conditions liu et al 2021 hua et al 2022 there are no obvious differences in as iii adsorption with an increase in fe ii from 2 5 mg l to 10 mg l after 120 min as the newly formed iron oxide film may have been distributed throughout the hematite surface at low fe ii concentrations meanwhile the as iii oxidative transformation on hematite can also be promoted on the surface of hematite with an increase in the fe ii concentration fig 4b a large portion of fe ii is consumed and only 6 19 fe ii remains on the surface of hematite after reactions fig 4c suggesting that the fe ii oxidation rate enhance at a higher initial concentration of fe ii the influence of the reaction ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 on as iii adsorption and oxidation by hematite was investigated in the presence of fe ii the as iii adsorption rate increase with a decrease in ph from 8 5 to 5 5 fig 4d which is consistent with a previously reported trend showing that acidic conditions promote the adsorption capacity of hematite giménez et al 2007 moreover as iii oxidation on hematite can be improved substantially under relatively acidic conditions fig 4e mainly owing to the high electron transfer ability of the hematite surface by lowering the solution ph hug and leupin 2003 the remaining fe ii content on the hematite surfaces is considerably higher at lower ph values indicating that the cycling of fe ii may be promoted under acidic conditions 3 5 insight into crystal structure and morphology of hematite after reaction the reacted solid phase hematite samples were analyzed using tem eds mapping xrd and xps to explore the changes in different hematite after the reaction fig 5 the morphologies of the synthesized hematite do not change as revealed by the tem images and the as signals are detected on the surface of the synthesized hematite surfaces uniformly fig 5a d the xrd diffraction peaks remain intact after the reactions fig 5e indicating that the fe ii reaction likely only lead to the continuous growth of an identical crystalline structure analogous to that of hematite the adsorbed fe ii ions induce the atom exchange of fe with bulk structural fe iii in hematite and the exchange can be inhibited after the formation of monolayer coverage and the cycling of fe ii likely exists liu et al 2020 ding et al 2018 the xrd peak intensity weaken after the reactions which can be attributed to the competition of as iii as v with fe iii on the surface of the iron oxides guo et al 2013 the solid as in hematite surfaces is mainly adsorbed rather than precipitated because no new as related precipitates have been detected by xrd fig 5e zhang et al 2017 we investigated the surface xps spectra of adsorbed as onto different hematite surfaces figs 5f g and s6 the as 3d signals from the reacted hematite consist of two divided peaks including as 3d3 2 located at 44 3 ev for as v and as 3d5 2 located at 45 2 ev for as iii wei et al 2019a b the as v peak area portion for different hematite exhibit a cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 trend in support of our batch experiment results fig 2c 3 6 reactive oxygen species identification the ros radicals formed by electron transfer between fe ii and o2 on the highly exposed hematite surface are key intermediates governing as iii oxidation katsoyiannis et al 2008 hence we conducted quenching experiments by adding ipa beq and cat as scavengers of oh o2 and h2o2 respectively wang et al 2013 the generated as v by cu hem 0 03 in the presence of fe ii decrease from 52 3 to 46 9 20 3 and 29 5 with the addition of ipa beq and cat respectively fig 6 a the results demonstrate that o2 and h2o2 are the main ros during the oxidation of as iii whereas oh radicals contribute less in this system thus the contributions of different ros are quantified in solutions containing hem cu hem 0 03 or zn hem 0 03 in the presence of 5 mg l fe ii the amount of oh and o2 generated by hematite exhibit a trend of cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 in the presence of fe ii fig 6b c the dynamic change in generated h2o2 by hematite exhibit a similar trend fig 6d these results explain the differences in as iii oxidation for different hematite species in particular o2 radicals can be produced by electron transfer from fe ii to oxygen eq 3 amstaetter et al 2010 and cu hem with more oxygen vacancies can promote the formation of o2 subsequently o2 radicals can directly oxidize as iii to as v liu et al 2022 finally the o2 radicals react with the surface bound fe ii to generate h2o2 eq 4 and h2o2 can produce o2 and oh and participate in the recycling of fe ii eqs 5 and 6 katsoyiannis et al 2008 lee et al 2014 for cu hem lattice cu ii participates in the fe ii recycling process eqs 7 and 8 jin et al 2017 the possible reactions are as follows 3 fe ii o 2 fe iii o 2 4 fe ii 2 h 2 o o 2 fe iii h 2 o 2 2 o h 5 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o h oh 6 fe iii o o fe iii 2 h 2 o 2 fe ii o o fe ii o 2 2 h 7 cu ii o o cu ii 2 h 2 o 2 cu i o o cu i o 2 2 h cu hem 8 c u i f e i i i c u i i f e i i c u h e m 3 7 electrochemical evidence on electron transfer process of fe ii onto hematite the electron transfer process of bound fe ii and o2 onto the hematite surfaces plays a key role in ros generation and subsequent as iii oxidation the fe ii oxidation peak on hematite decrease from 0 001 v to 0 06 v for hematite fe ii systems compared to fe ii alone fig 7 a indicating fe ii redox properties alter after adsorption to hem cu hem or zn hem surfaces frierdich et al 2019 it is not fully reversible for fe ii oxidation as new iron oxide films may be formed which has been verified by the differences between the current oxidation and reduction peak values liu et al 2020 to explore the effects of incorporating cu or zn on electron transfer the electron transfer behaviors were analyzed by cv using the laviron method in different reaction systems at various scan rates 0 05 2 v s 1 fig s7 the ket values can be obtained with the 3 07 10 6 s 1 1 35 10 6 s 1 and 3 53 10 7 s 1 values for cu hem 0 03 hem and zn hem 0 03 respectively fig s7 the oxidation peaks of fe ii on cu hem 0 03 and hem are located at 0 140 v measured by pulse voltammetry curves while the peak of fe ii on zn hem 0 03 is located at 0 085 v fig s8 the current of the fe ii oxidation peaks onto different hematite surfaces exhibit the trend cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 fig s8 this demonstrates that it is relatively easy for fe ii to transfer electrons onto the cu hem 0 03 electrodes while the transfer of electrons onto the zn hem 0 03 electrodes is difficult furthermore nyquist curves of the different hematite electrodes were obtained fig 7b the impedance half radius results show that cu hem 0 03 exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance and higher interface charge transfer rate whereas zn hem 0 03 exhibits a slower interface charge transfer rate these electrochemical results demonstrate that cu hem exhibits a higher electron transfer rate which can promote ros generation and as iii oxidation electron transfer onto zn hem is slow leading to the inhibition of ros generation and as iii oxidation 3 8 underlying mechanisms of as iii oxidation and adsorption on hematite the adsorption and oxidation mechanisms of as iii in the hem cu hem and zn hem systems are summarized in fig 8 the bound fe ii on different hematite samples transfers electrons to oxygen which generates o2 that participates in the generation of h2o2 the generated o2 and h2o2 are the main ros the incorporation of these two elements mediates ros production for cu hem more exposed oxygen vacancies contribute to electron transfer and lattice cu contributes to the fe ii fe iii recycling process via transformation between cu ii cu i which only occur in cu hem eqs 7 and 8 and is attributed to the generation of more ros for zn hem the relatively low number of oxygen vacancies inhibits electron transfer resulting in lower ros production the generated ros subsequently mediate the as iii oxidation process o2 contributes to as iii oxidation and h2o2 mediates the oxidation of as iii via the production of o2 oh in the oxygen vacancies of different hematite surfaces and promotes the recycling of fe ii then the produced o2 oh can oxidize as iii based on eqs 9 and 10 liu et al 2022 the oxidation process in eqs 9 and 10 occurred on hem cu hem and zn hem and the reaction efficiency is dependent on the ros content the positively charged hematite adsorb generated as v via electrostatic bonding whereas no new phase is generated as shown by the xrd pattern fig 5e 9 as iii o 2 2 h 2 o as v h 2 o 2 2 o h 10 as iii oh as v h 2 o in summation the incorporation of cu into hematite substantially promotes the adsorption and oxidation of as iii cu hem exhibits more oxygen vacancies which can enhance the surface charge and electron transfer capability benefiting as iii adsorption and oxidation as a result of enhanced ros production jin et al 2017 moreover lattice cu can mediate ros generation and promote the fe ii recycling via the transformation between structural cu ii and cu i jin et al 2017 however zn incorporation decrease the ability of as iii to adsorb and oxidize hematite zn incorporation can enhance the catalytic ability and electrochemical properties of many materials in other systems choi et al 2019 qi et al 2020 which is conflicting to our results in our study the oxygen vacancy content that mediates electron transfer is a dependent factor in ros generation and subsequent as iii oxidation fig 1h thus more exposed iron vacancies lead to fewer oxygen vacancies in zn hem moreover the structural zn ii on hematite was also relatively stable and did not participate in fe ii fe iii cycling which led to lower ros generation and as iii oxidation efficiency these factors lead to the inhibition of as iii oxidation and the opposite phenomena compared to previous results 4 conclusions this study synthesized different 001 facets exposed hematite including hem cu hem and zn hem and investigated the oxidation and adsorption of as iii by different hematite under aerobic conditions in the presence of fe ii compared to hem the efficiencies of as iii adsorption and oxidation were promoted for cu hem and inhibited for zn hem which were controlled by the oxygen contents or iron vacancies and electron transfer abilities the promotion or inhibition effects are controlled by the incorporation ratio of cu or zn fe ii concentrations and ph moreover o2 and h2o2 are the main ros in as iii oxidation the redox dynamic processes of contaminants such as as are coupled with the redox cycling of iron oxides in the environment in particular the as redox couples with the transformation of fe ii at the iron oxide interface under aerobic conditions this study confirmed that the fate and immobilization of as are mediated by hematite incorporated with different elements the findings of this work provide insight into as biogeochemical cycling processes in groundwater and soil systems declaration of

15316,the incorporation of secondary metal atoms into iron oxyhydroxides may regulate the surface chemistry of mediating electron transfer et and therefore the biogeochemical pollutant processes such as arsenic as in the subsurface and soils the influence of incorporating two typical metals cu and zn into a specific 001 hematite facet on o2 activation by surface bound fe ii was addressed the results showed that cu incorporated hematite enhances as iii oxidation in the presence of fe ii under oxic conditions and increases with increasing cu content conversely zn incorporation leads to the opposite trend the as iii oxidation induced by surface bound fe ii is positively related to the fe ii content and is favorable under acidic conditions reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide o2 and h2o2 predominantly contribute to as iii oxidation as a result of 1 electron transfer from bound fe ii to surface o2 on hematite and radical propagation electrochemical analysis demonstrates that cu incorporation significantly lower the oxidation potential of fe ii on hematite whereas zn led to a higher reaction potential for fe ii oxidation subsequently distinct surface reactivities of hematite for the activation of o2 to form ros by surface bound fe ii are evidenced by metal incorporation our study provides a new understanding of the changes in the surface chemistry of iron oxyhydroxides because of incorporating metals zn and cu and therefore impact the biogeochemical processes of pollutants in soils and subsurface environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidative transformation iron oxides heavy metalloid electron reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in water and soils caused by the weathering of arsenic containing minerals and human activities such as mining has received considerable attention showing potential threats to food security and human health teixeira et al 2020 hong et al 2021 in aqueous environments inorganic as is present in its main form including arsenate as v and arsenite as iii and as iii exhibits considerably higher toxicity and mobility than as v boussouga et al 2021 wang et al 2022 thus the redox transformation of as iii to as v is a crucial detoxification process of as biogeochemical processes in water and soil environments tong et al 2021 liu et al 2022 iron oxyhydroxides are a class of major redox sensitive minerals that mediate the adsorption and or redox transformation of as under aerobic and anaerobic conditions redox processes on the surface of iron oxyhydroxides are important for limiting the toxicity and mobility of as in aquatic and terrestrial environments kendall et al 2012 ding et al 2018 huang et al 2020 ferrous ions generated by microorganisms or organic electron shuttles from fe iii reduction can be adsorbed on the surface of iron oxyhydroxides and react with oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as oh and o2 radicals han et al 2016 yu et al 2013 gubler and thomasarrigo 2021 in iron oxyhydroxide driven interfacial redox processes the facets and defects of iron oxyhydroxide surfaces can influence the surface structure and electron transfer abilities catalano et al 2010 jin et al 2017 different exposed iron oxyhydroxide facets formed under varying conditions exhibit distinct surface active site density electron transfer efficiency and therefore redox activities leading to differences in the redox of fe ii soil organic matter and organic pollutants on iron oxyhydroxide surfaces catalano et al 2010 hu et al 2021a b hao et al 2022a moreover the iron oxyhydroxide defects also influence their interfacial redox processes and therefore influence the tendency of electron transfer via a decrease in the activation energy barrier cao et al 2016 lira et al 2011 the natural formation of iron oxyhydroxides is generally accompanied by the incorporation of impurity elements such as cu2 zn2 and al3 which may lead to the generation of defects and an increase in the lattice iron or oxygen vacancies of iron oxyhydroxides lassoued et al 2017 bylaska et al 2019 notini et al 2018 frierdich et al 2012 the increase in oxygen or iron vacancies after incorporation into iron oxyhydroxides can enhance or reduce the redox abilities of iron oxyhydroxides such as hematite goethite and magnetite jin et al 2017 cao et al 2016 bylaska et al 2019 generally cu incorporation increases the oxygen vacancies of oxyhydroxides whereas zn incorporation increases iron vacancies the reverse defect caused by these two naturally spread elements may have different effects on the redox and electron transfer abilities of oxyhydroxides cao et al 2016 bylaska et al 2019 interfacial observations of facet and defect dependent effects of iron oxyhydroxide mediated redox processes have been widely studied while the coupled effects of facets and defects on the redox transformation of as iii on iron oxyhydroxides induced by surface bound fe ii are still unknown in this study we investigated the coupling effects of crystalline facets and defects of iron hydro oxide on the electron transfer process of fe ii with o2 and subsequently the redox transformation process of as iii hematite with a highly exposed 001 facet and incorporated with foreign metals including cu zn i e cu hem zn hem was selected as a model iron oxide owing to its typical semiconductive feature and stability in water and soil and the 001 hematite facet always exhibits higher electron transfer ability and more surface active sites compared to other facets owing to its specific atomic arrangements wu et al 2021 huang et al 2016a b hu et al 2021a as iii adsorption and oxidation mediated by cu hem and zn hem were investigated in the presence of fe ii under varying conditions moreover the effects of the cu and zn incorporation ratio fe ii concentration and ph on as iii adsorption and redox processes were also evaluated subsequently quenching experiments were conducted to verify the ros response to as iii oxidation in fe ii cu hem or zn hem systems the electrochemical properties of hematite mixed with fe ii were investigated to analyze the mechanisms of the reaction differences for different hematite samples these observations provide insights into the biogeochemical recycling of as in aquatic and terrestrial systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o hydrochloric acid hcl potassium hydroxide

iron powder and then the fe ii stock solution was diluted to 200 mg l in an anaerobic chamber 2 2 hem cu hem and zn hem preparation different hematite materials were synthesized using previously established methods lv et al 2018 appropriate amounts of fecl3 6h2o cucl2 or zhcl2 and 11 2 g of ch3coona were prepared and the mixtures were dissolved in 140 ml of ethanol and 9 8 ml of milli q water the total concentrations of fe cu and zn in the synthesized solutions were 0 093 m and the molar ratios of cu or zn cu or zn fe were ranged from 0 to 0 03 the solution was stirred for 1 h then heated at 180 c for 12 h finally milli q water and ethanol were used to wash the precipitates at least three times and dried for further use 2 3 characterization the synthesized hem cu hem and zn hem powders

synthesized iron oxides were also observed using transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy tem eds fei tf20 netherlands the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of hem cu hem and zn hem before and after the reaction were analyzed using a bruker axsd8 focus germany equipped with ni filtered cu kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10 80 the hematite synthesized before and after the reaction was placed on an al platform and the valence states of fe cu zn o and as were analyzed using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo fischer uk 2 4 batch experiments the adsorption and oxidation processes of as iii by hem cu hem and zn hem were investigated in the presence of different concentrations of fe ii ranging from to 0 10 mg l under varying ph conditions including 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 the experiments were performed in brown sample bottles at 200 rpm and 25 1 c the hem cu hem or zn hem concentrations were 1 g l in all experiments and ph was adjusted at 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 by 0 1 m hcl or naoh appropriate amounts of as iii and fe ii stock solutions were added to the above suspensions under anoxic conditions and the final concentration of as iii was 5 mg l successively the mixed suspensions were exposed to air to trigger the reactions and the concentrations of as iii as v and fe ii of the reaction solution at different reaction times up to 120 min were analyzed after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane filter all experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 5 radical quenching experiments to investigate the contribution of ros to as iii oxidation radical quenching experiments were conducted by adding ipa 1 4 benzoquinone and cat to the reaction solution the dosage of cu hem 0 03 and as iii were 1 g l and 5 mg l respectively at ph 7 0 the suspensions during the reactions were extracted from the reaction solutions at different reaction times including 2 5 15 30 60 and 120 min and 1 ml of the suspension of each reaction time was mixed with 1 ml of 6 m hcl to measure the content of generated total as v in the experiment all experiments were performed in triplicates 2 6 analytical methods liquid chromatography coupled with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy kylin s12 beijing jitian instrument china was used to measure the dissolved and total as iii and as v content for each experiment and sample for dissolved as iii and as v the extracted suspensions

characterization the related electrochemical properties were analyzed using an electrochemical workstation composed of a working electrode platinum counter electrode and reference electrode ag agcl the electron transfer rates of different hematite samples were calculated by cyclic voltammetry cv using the laviron method in different reaction systems at various scan rates 0 05 to 2 v s 1 both the oxidation and reduction peak currents increased with increasing scan rate in the experimental systems to compare the electron transfer rates of the different materials ep e0 log v was analyzed using

3 r t 1 α n f log 1 α n f v a r t k e r where α and v refer to the coefficient of electron transfer and scan rate respectively and r t and f refer to the gas constant temperature 298 k and faraday constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 hem cu hem and zn hem characterization in general the 001 facets of hematite exhibit higher activity and electron transfer abilities than other facets of hematite hu et al 2021a b hao et al 2022a the incorporation ratios of cu or zn from cu hem or zn hem ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 table s1 the sem and tem images show that the synthesized hem cu hem and zn hem have well defined nanoplate shapes with mainly exposed hexagonal 001 facets huang et al 2016a hu et al 2021b while the size of cu zn hem decreases gradually from approximately 90 to 50 nm with increasing cu zn incorporation ratios especially for zn hem 0 03 figs 1 a f and s1 this is likely attributable to the enhancement of the nucleation center density of hematite after the incorporation of cu or zn gao et al 2020 lassoued et al 2017 the radius of zn is greater than that of cu which leads to a smaller size of approximately 50 nm for zn hem 0 03 moreover cu and zn element signals have been clearly detected by edx mapping of cu zn hem indicating that cu and zn are successfully incorporated within hematite fig 1c f the xrd patterns of cu hem and zn hem show that the synthesized iron oxides matched well with pdf 33 0644 of standard hematite figs 1g and s2 among these diffraction peaks the 110 peak is the strongest of all the synthesized hematite which demonstrates that these iron oxides exhibit crystal development along the a b direction hao et al 2022a the peak intensities of the 104 and 110 peaks of hematite decreased after the incorporation of cu and zn fig 1g indicating a decrease in the crystal size wu et al 2021 like the sem and tem results fig 1a f the half peak widths of the peaks increase fig 1g indicating that the incorporation of cu and zn decrease the hematite size and crystalline degree wu et al 2021 this may be caused by an increase in iron oxide defects and or the substitution of lattice fe sites by foreign ions lassoued et al 2017 klug and alexander 1974 aquino and balela 2020 the binding energy of fe2p from cu hem increases while that of zn hem decrease fig s3a b this is likely caused by the density alteration of the outer electron cloud of fe3 ions after incorporating cu or zn kang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 the cu and zn signals of cu hem and zn hem are also detected corresponding to the signals of cu o and zn o respectively fig s3c d the o 1 s signals of different hematite samples are divided into four peaks including surface oh lattice oh fe o and cu zn o fig 1h the percentage of surface oh reflects the oxygen vacancy content jin et al 2017 the percentage of surface oh from cu hem 0 03 increase from 7 52 to 22 6 compared to that of hem while the percentage of surface oh from zn hem 0 03 decrease fig 1h this result suggests that cu hem contains more oxygen vacancies whereas zn hem contains more iron vacancies jin et al 2017 bylaska et al 2019 for cu hem oxygen vacancies are mainly contributed by the enhanced positive charge of the lattice after the incorporation of cu which can attract more electrons from the o atoms lassoued et al 2017 for zn hem substituting zn for lattice fe3 and subsequent interstitial site proton addition to maintain charge balance can lead to an increase in iron vacancies bylaska et al 2019 3 2 as adsorption and oxidation on hematite in the presence of fe ii fig 2 a shows that in the presence of 5 mg l fe ii hem cu hem 0 03 and zn hem 0 03 effectively adsorb as iii while fe ii alone slightly lower the concentrations of as iii in the aqueous phase the adsorption extent of as iii follow the trend cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 in the presence of fe ii fig 2a during this process chemical adsorption through the inner sphere primarily mediates the adsorption of as iii zhang et al 2017 hematite samples adsorb more as iii in the presence of fe ii compared to hematite in the absence of fe ii fig 2b indicating that fe ii contributes to the adsorption of as in solutions as a new iron hydro oxide hydrate phase formed by the oxidation of adsorbed fe ii chen et al 2020 frierdich et al 2015 the total oxidized as v mediated by different hematite was investigated to compare the effect of oxidation of as iii to as v fig 2c and the ratios of generated as v by fe ii hem fe ii cu hem 0 03 fe ii and zn hem 0 03 are 8 4 48 7 67 9 and 35 0 respectively the adsorbed fe ii decays rapidly and 6 10 fe ii remains on the surface of hematite fig 2d this demonstrates that as iii oxidation occur on the iron oxide surface liu et al 2022 amstaetter et al 2010 moreover the fe ii content after the reaction differs at different hematite interfaces with cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 indicating that more fe ii contributes to the fe ii fe iii recycling process for cu hem 0 03 because of the high content of oxygen vacancies and probable lattice cu i cu ii recycling process jin et al 2017 moreover excluding cu or zn incorporated hematite defects the size or surface area of different hematite also differed fig 1a f which may influence various geochemical processes chi et al 2022 however the surface area effect is not a key factor in the as iii adsorption and oxidation processes as there is no obvious regularity between the surface area and as iii adsorption and oxidation efficiencies fig 1a f fig 2 3 3 incorporation ratio effect of cu zn on the adsorption and oxidation of as iii the effects of the cu or zn incorporation ratio on as iii oxidation by cu hem or zn hem are shown in fig 3 for cu hem the as adsorption rate increase with increasing cu incorporation ratio from 0 01 to 0 03 fig 3a while the adsorption rate of zn hem decrease with increasing zn incorporation ratio fig 3d a similar trend is also observed for adsorbed as on hematite the adsorbed as on cu hem increase with an increase in the cu incorporation ratio while the adsorbed as on zn hem decrease with an increase in the zn incorporation ratio fig s4 this is likely due to the change in the number of adsorption sites after the incorporation of cu or zn more adsorption sites exist for cu hem owing to the increase in oxygen vacancies whereas the number of adsorption sites gradually decreases as lattice fe is instituted by h with the increase in the zn incorporation ratio jin et al 2017 bylaska et al 2019 subsequently the oxidation of as iii by cu hem or zn hem with different cu or zn incorporation ratios are investigated the total generated as v increase after increasing the cu incorporation ratio of cu hem while less as v are generated for an increased zn incorporation ratio of zn hem fig 3b e the fe ii content contents of fe ii decrease rapidly and the reaction rates decrease to equilibrium fig 3c f during this process more fe ii exist on cu hem with the increase in cu incorporation ratio from 0 01 to 0 03 fig 3c as the incorporated cu can promote the fe ii recycling process while the opposite trend is observed for zn hem because of the inhibition effects for fe ii recycling fig 3f moreover our results show no apparent as iii oxidation in the presence of cuo and zno indicating that cu o or zn o in cu hem or zn hem hardly influence as iii oxidation fig s5 3 4 effect of water chemistry on as iii adsorption and oxidation water chemistry parameters such as fe ii concentration and ph can remarkably influence as iii redox transformation chen et al 2022 hao et al 2022b in the presence of fe ii additional as iii can be adsorbed by hematite from the solution fig 4 a as a result of new iron oxide formation on hematite surfaces under aerobic conditions liu et al 2021 hua et al 2022 there are no obvious differences in as iii adsorption with an increase in fe ii from 2 5 mg l to 10 mg l after 120 min as the newly formed iron oxide film may have been distributed throughout the hematite surface at low fe ii concentrations meanwhile the as iii oxidative transformation on hematite can also be promoted on the surface of hematite with an increase in the fe ii concentration fig 4b a large portion of fe ii is consumed and only 6 19 fe ii remains on the surface of hematite after reactions fig 4c suggesting that the fe ii oxidation rate enhance at a higher initial concentration of fe ii the influence of the reaction ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 on as iii adsorption and oxidation by hematite was investigated in the presence of fe ii the as iii adsorption rate increase with a decrease in ph from 8 5 to 5 5 fig 4d which is consistent with a previously reported trend showing that acidic conditions promote the adsorption capacity of hematite giménez et al 2007 moreover as iii oxidation on hematite can be improved substantially under relatively acidic conditions fig 4e mainly owing to the high electron transfer ability of the hematite surface by lowering the solution ph hug and leupin 2003 the remaining fe ii content on the hematite surfaces is considerably higher at lower ph values indicating that the cycling of fe ii may be promoted under acidic conditions 3 5 insight into crystal structure and morphology of hematite after reaction the reacted solid phase hematite samples were analyzed using tem eds mapping xrd and xps to explore the changes in different hematite after the reaction fig 5 the morphologies of the synthesized hematite do not change as revealed by the tem images and the as signals are detected on the surface of the synthesized hematite surfaces uniformly fig 5a d the xrd diffraction peaks remain intact after the reactions fig 5e indicating that the fe ii reaction likely only lead to the continuous growth of an identical crystalline structure analogous to that of hematite the adsorbed fe ii ions induce the atom exchange of fe with bulk structural fe iii in hematite and the exchange can be inhibited after the formation of monolayer coverage and the cycling of fe ii likely exists liu et al 2020 ding et al 2018 the xrd peak intensity weaken after the reactions which can be attributed to the competition of as iii as v with fe iii on the surface of the iron oxides guo et al 2013 the solid as in hematite surfaces is mainly adsorbed rather than precipitated because no new as related precipitates have been detected by xrd fig 5e zhang et al 2017 we investigated the surface xps spectra of adsorbed as onto different hematite surfaces figs 5f g and s6 the as 3d signals from the reacted hematite consist of two divided peaks including as 3d3 2 located at 44 3 ev for as v and as 3d5 2 located at 45 2 ev for as iii wei et al 2019a b the as v peak area portion for different hematite exhibit a cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 trend in support of our batch experiment results fig 2c 3 6 reactive oxygen species identification the ros radicals formed by electron transfer between fe ii and o2 on the highly exposed hematite surface are key intermediates governing as iii oxidation katsoyiannis et al 2008 hence we conducted quenching experiments by adding ipa beq and cat as scavengers of oh o2 and h2o2 respectively wang et al 2013 the generated as v by cu hem 0 03 in the presence of fe ii decrease from 52 3 to 46 9 20 3 and 29 5 with the addition of ipa beq and cat respectively fig 6 a the results demonstrate that o2 and h2o2 are the main ros during the oxidation of as iii whereas oh radicals contribute less in this system thus the contributions of different ros are quantified in solutions containing hem cu hem 0 03 or zn hem 0 03 in the presence of 5 mg l fe ii the amount of oh and o2 generated by hematite exhibit a trend of cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 in the presence of fe ii fig 6b c the dynamic change in generated h2o2 by hematite exhibit a similar trend fig 6d these results explain the differences in as iii oxidation for different hematite species in particular o2 radicals can be produced by electron transfer from fe ii to oxygen eq 3 amstaetter et al 2010 and cu hem with more oxygen vacancies can promote the formation of o2 subsequently o2 radicals can directly oxidize as iii to as v liu et al 2022 finally the o2 radicals react with the surface bound fe ii to generate h2o2 eq 4 and h2o2 can produce o2 and oh and participate in the recycling of fe ii eqs 5 and 6 katsoyiannis et al 2008 lee et al 2014 for cu hem lattice cu ii participates in the fe ii recycling process eqs 7 and 8 jin et al 2017 the possible reactions are as follows 3 fe ii o 2 fe iii o 2 4 fe ii 2 h 2 o o 2 fe iii h 2 o 2 2 o h 5 fe ii h

evidence on electron transfer process of fe ii onto hematite the electron transfer process of bound fe ii and o2 onto the hematite surfaces plays a key role in ros generation and subsequent as iii oxidation the fe ii oxidation peak on hematite decrease from 0 001 v to 0 06 v for hematite fe ii systems compared to fe ii alone fig 7 a indicating fe ii redox properties alter after adsorption to hem cu hem or zn hem surfaces frierdich et al 2019 it is not fully reversible for fe ii oxidation as new iron oxide films may be formed which has been verified by the differences between the current oxidation and reduction peak values liu et al 2020 to explore the effects of incorporating cu or zn on electron transfer the electron transfer behaviors were analyzed by cv using the laviron method in different reaction systems at various scan rates 0 05 2 v s 1 fig s7 the ket values can be obtained with the 3 07 10 6 s 1 1 35 10 6 s 1 and 3 53 10 7 s 1 values for cu hem 0 03 hem and zn hem 0 03 respectively fig s7 the oxidation peaks of fe ii on cu hem 0 03 and hem are located at 0 140 v measured by pulse voltammetry curves while the peak of fe ii on zn hem 0 03 is located at 0 085 v fig s8 the current of the fe ii oxidation peaks onto different hematite surfaces exhibit the trend cu hem 0 03 hem zn hem 0 03 fig s8 this demonstrates that it is relatively easy for fe ii to transfer electrons onto the cu hem 0 03 electrodes while the transfer of electrons onto the zn hem 0 03 electrodes is difficult furthermore nyquist curves of the different hematite electrodes were obtained fig 7b the impedance half radius results show that cu hem 0 03 exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance and higher interface charge transfer rate whereas zn hem 0 03 exhibits a slower interface charge transfer rate these electrochemical results demonstrate that cu hem exhibits a higher electron transfer rate which can promote ros generation and as iii oxidation electron transfer onto zn hem is slow leading to the inhibition of ros generation and as iii oxidation 3 8 underlying mechanisms of as iii oxidation and adsorption on hematite the adsorption and oxidation mechanisms of as iii in the hem cu hem and zn hem systems are summarized in fig 8 the bound fe ii on different hematite samples transfers electrons to oxygen which generates o2 that participates in the generation of h2o2 the generated o2 and h2o2 are the main ros the incorporation of these two elements mediates ros production for cu hem more exposed oxygen vacancies contribute to electron transfer and lattice cu contributes to the fe ii fe iii recycling process via transformation between cu ii cu i which only occur in cu hem eqs 7 and 8 and is attributed to the generation of more ros for zn hem the relatively low number of oxygen vacancies inhibits electron transfer resulting in lower ros production the generated ros subsequently mediate the as iii oxidation process o2 contributes to as iii oxidation and h2o2 mediates the oxidation of as iii via the production of o2 oh in the oxygen vacancies of different hematite surfaces and promotes the recycling of fe ii then the produced o2 oh can oxidize as iii based on eqs 9 and 10 liu et al 2022 the oxidation process in eqs 9 and 10 occurred on hem cu hem and zn hem and the reaction efficiency is dependent on the ros content the positively charged hematite adsorb generated as v via electrostatic bonding whereas no new phase is generated as shown by the xrd pattern fig 5e 9 as iii o 2 2 h 2 o as v h 2 o 2 2 o h 10 as iii oh as v h 2 o in summation the incorporation of cu into hematite substantially promotes the adsorption and oxidation of as iii cu hem exhibits more oxygen vacancies which can enhance the surface charge and electron transfer capability benefiting as iii adsorption and oxidation as a result of enhanced ros production jin et al 2017 moreover lattice cu can mediate ros generation and promote the fe ii recycling via the transformation between structural cu ii and cu i jin et al 2017 however zn incorporation decrease the ability of as iii to adsorb and oxidize hematite zn incorporation can enhance the catalytic ability and electrochemical properties of many materials in other systems choi et al 2019 qi et al 2020 which is conflicting to our results in our study the oxygen vacancy content that mediates electron transfer is a dependent factor in ros generation and subsequent as iii oxidation fig 1h thus more exposed iron vacancies lead to fewer oxygen vacancies in zn hem moreover the structural zn ii on hematite was also relatively stable and did not participate in fe ii fe iii cycling which led to lower ros generation and as iii oxidation efficiency these factors lead to the inhibition of as iii oxidation and the opposite phenomena compared to previous results 4 conclusions this study synthesized different 001 facets exposed hematite including hem cu hem and zn hem and investigated the oxidation and adsorption of as iii by different hematite under aerobic conditions in the presence of fe ii compared to hem the efficiencies of as iii adsorption and oxidation were promoted for cu hem and inhibited for zn hem which were controlled by the oxygen contents or iron vacancies and electron transfer abilities the promotion or inhibition effects are controlled by the incorporation ratio of cu or zn fe ii concentrations and ph moreover o2 and h2o2 are the main ros in as iii oxidation the redox dynamic processes of contaminants such as as are coupled with the redox cycling of iron oxides in the environment in particular the as redox couples with the transformation of fe ii at the iron oxide interface under aerobic conditions this study confirmed that the fate and immobilization of as are mediated by hematite incorporated with different elements the findings of this work provide insight into as biogeochemical cycling processes in groundwater and soil systems declaration of

15317,global anthropogenic flows of nitrogen n and phosphorus p have exceeded planetary boundaries with significant implications for pollution of the freshwater resources in the world understanding the global patterns and drivers of n and p concentrations and their ratios in the lakes could help design more effective management and remediation strategies to mitigate the impacts of eutrophication while a suite of drivers are associated with the sources of nutrients their transport and internal processes that control concentrations of n and p in the lakes much less is known about the relative importance of different drivers in explaining spatial variations of lake nutrients and ratios in this study we compared n and p concentrations and their ratios in the lakes across china and europe and examined the differences of dominant environmental and social drivers on lake nutrients our comparison showed that total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were much higher in the lakes in china compared to those in europe i e tn 1 13 mg l in china vs 0 64 mg l in europe tp 35 83 μg l in china vs 19 38 μg l in europe the median value however lake n p ratios for both regions were not statistically different concentrations of tn and tp showed decoupling in both regions with the majority of lakes having high n p mass ratios when evaluated by the commonly accepted threshold of 23 i e 61 in china and 68 in europe indicating that phytoplankton are more p limited relative to n agricultural activity in the lake catchment is an important predictor for both nutrient concentrations and their ratio in europe this reflects successful investments in infrastructure and policy prescriptions in addressing point sources of pollution in comparison lake depth and water residence time are important in the decoupling of n and p concentrations in china the regional difference between the dominant drivers can provide important insights into development of effective water pollution control measures it is necessary for policy makers and water resource managers to be aware of large scale imbalance of nutrients in lake due to the potential environmental consequences a set of spatially flexible policies for water quality controls would be beneficial for sustaining the ecological integrity and future health of lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient concentrations and ratios eutrophication catchment land uses lake morphometry water quality management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes provide valuable services to billions of people for drinking recreational and industrial or agricultural uses kalff 2002 however they are also susceptible to degradation due to the human activities with a range of influences associated with different stages of the economic development in recent decades growing population pressures and changing land use patterns have had an unprecedented influence on the world s lakes buttner et al 2022 eea 2018 qin et al 2022 tong et al 2018 the industrialisation of ammonia production and extensive phosphate mining have made the nutrients available at a faster rate than ever seen in human history gruber and galloway 2008 peñuelas and sardans 2022 the excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs have resulted in eutrophication and the expansion of harmful algal blooms that are an increasing threat to drinking water and undermine the ecosystem services globally ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 the absolute concentration of a limiting nutrient plays a central role in the ecosystem dynamics while the relative availability of some nutrients can also affect a range of ecological patterns and processes collins et al 2017 sterner and elser 2002 nutrient co limitation by n and p has been pervasive across a range of aquatic or marine ecosystems elser et al 2009 elser et al 2007 tong et al 2022 in many cases n and p concentrations in the lake are not transferred at equal or predictable rates resulting in unexpected changes in the nutrient ratios peñuelas et al 2013 sterner and elser 2002 an accelerated imbalance between n and p has been reported in many lakes including the lake zurich in switzerland lake okeechobee in the u s lake erie in canada u s and dianchi in china peñuelas et al 2013 tong et al 2020 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2010 yan et al 2016 mitigation of eutrophication has been achieved in some lakes in europe eea 2018 and a part of the great lakes in the u s canada allan et al 2013 mahdiyan et al 2021 sterner 2021 while eutrophication is still severe in many regions particularly in developing countries where nutrient inputs into fresh waterbody continue to increase rapid changes in nutrient composition concentration together with the ratio in lakes have far reaching implications for a range of ecological processes glibert 2012 sterner and elser 2002 changes in nutrient composition can trigger shifts in the composition of phytoplankton species that in turn resonate throughout the aquatic food web glibert 2012 homeostatic mechanisms could maintain the uptake of materials and energies in balance with the demands for the cellular growth of primary producer klausmeier et al 2008 sterner and elser 2002 different plankton species have different optimal n p ratios finkel et al 2010 klausmeier et al 2004 for example the n2 fixing cyanobacteria that dominate the plankton community under low n p ratios become inferior competitors relative to non n2 fixing species such as microcystis spp and planktothrix spp under high n p ratios chislock et al 2014 high n p ratio could also lead to p limitations on phytoplankton communities thereby reducing the nutritional quality of food for the majority of herbivorous zooplankton schulhof et al 2019 in addition the per cell productions of n rich toxin e g microcystins could be enhanced by enrichment of n under the oligotrophic conditions sterner and elser 2002 thus changes in the availability of n and p along with associated changes in n p ratios could drive shifts in phytoplankton species and their dominance in freshwater ecosystems consequently transfer of energy throughout the food web could be reduced leading to fewer predators and the loss of aquatic biodiversity tong et al 2020 human activities are primarily responsible for the observed increase in nutrient inputs to the world s lakes the level of economic development can affect the degree of eutrophication and the nature of the issues which typically manifest much earlier in today s more developed economies jenny et al 2020 powers et al 2016 low income economies are often more challenged by point and non point sources of pollutions while more developed high income economies usually have the ability to apply the technologies or innovations to control if not reverse the trend of nutrient inputs there are numerous pathways through which n and p enter aquatic ecosystem with the n p ratios typically correlating to different human activities accounting for the type of human activity is thus important in regulating the n p ratio many previous studies have attempted to identify the drivers of nutrient concentrations or ratios at broad regional or continental scales abell et al 2019 yan et al 2016 however predicting nutrient ratios is more challenging than concentrations since the ratio can be only related to the driver if one nutrient responds strongly and the other is not affected collins et al 2017 most of the p input typically comes from point source while most of the n is usually derived from diffuse sources and gaseous form which are more difficult to manage yan et al 2016 tong et al 2020 in addition to the impacts from nutrient sources nutrient composition in freshwater systems could also be impacted by internal processes for instance a study in the midwestern region of the u s had indicated that lake depth was a strong predictor of nutrient ratio in water since only p was related to depth but n was not collins et al 2017 removing p from the water column is easier mainly in particulate from through sedimentation whereas n can only be removed by the nitrification or denitrification processes and biological uptake qin et al 2020 in addition nutrients in lakes are also influenced by the climatic factors and catchment topography that can affect nutrient transport on land collins et al 2017 peñuelas and sardans 2022 whitehead and crossman 2012 thus the nutrient composition in lakes is due to a combination of multiple environmental and social factors making it difficult to identify those that can drive changes in nutrient concentrations and ratios the need to examine the drivers of changes in both n and p in lakes over space and time collins et al 2017 liu et al 2021 is highlighted by the influence of eutrophication on the ecological processes coupled with accelerating nutrient inputs due to the increasing human pressures glibert 2012 klausmeier et al 2008 sterner and elser 2002 su et al 2019 understanding global pattern of n and p concentrations and their ratio in lake and identifying their drivers could therefore help to design more effective measures to mitigate eutrophication and control the expansion of harmful algal blooms in this study n and p concentrations and their ratios in lakes in china are compared to those in europe in order to provide new insight into the driver of nutrients and identify the measures to control algal blooms we examine the contributions of different environmental and social drivers on nutrients in lakes and explore differences between the dominant drivers across regions social drivers examined in the study include the extent of cropland and pasture in the lake catchment population density and gross domestic product gdp environmental factors include lake morphometries i e lake depth and water residence time climate and local soil erosion concentration of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp along with their n p mass ratios in 117 lakes across china and 788 lakes across europe have been investigated and compared the primary goal is to identify the drivers of lake nutrient concentrations and their ratios over space and time and to determine how they differ across regions with different environmental and social characteristics 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area freshwater lakes are widely distributed in both europe and china and many of them are experiencing or have experienced a deterioration of water quality jenny et al 2020 despite differences in level of economic development fig s1 both regions are facing increasing pressures resulting in the ecosystem degradation including an increasing occurrence of algal blooms and a rapid loss in aquatic biodiversity birk et al 2020 huisman et al 2018 jenny et al 2020 china has gone through a long and rapid period of the economic development and industrialisation since the introduction of reforms in 1978 which shifted the country to a market based economy nbsc 2021 this has seen sustained growth with gdp averaging almost 10 a year and income per capita increasing from us 300 in 1978 to us 10 276 in 2019 and more than 850 million people lifted out of poverty world bank and development research center 2022 this has been coupled with a period of rapid urbanization with over 60 of the total populations living in cities in 2020 compared to less than 20 in the 1970s nbsc 2021 rapid economic development has resulted in an increase of n and p input into freshwater with very limited environmental protection measures such as the development of wastewater treatment plants the wastewater discharge standard and the cap control targets for pollutants before 2000 xu et al 2021 in comparison europe has a much lower population density around 70 people per km2 and a higher average per capita gdp around 30 000 in 2020 though it varies largely between countries ibrd 2022 since the 1990s the european commission has initiated regulations to control diffuse sources of pollutions from agriculture and point sources of pollutions from the urban wastewater discharges including the nitrates directive the urban wastewater treatment directive and water framework directive eea 2018 the european water policy has specifically aimed for all the rivers lakes coastal and transitional waters to attain good ecological status before 2015 or at the latest by 2027 while recent estimates suggest that most of the aquatic ecosystems have failed to achieve this target poikane et al 2019 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 lake nutrient data in europe and china data on tn tp concentrations and the mass ratio were obtained for 788 lakes or reservoirs covering 21 countries in europe and 117 lakes located in different regions of mainland china fig 1 the number of lakes from different european countries is shown in fig s2 the area and depth of the lakes surveyed in this study are shown in figs s3 and s4 we did not differentiate between lake or reservoirs because both can be affected by similar environmental or social drivers derived from the surrounding catchment area water quality data include tn mg l tp μg l and chl a μg l concentrations the n p mass ratio was then calculated for each lake based on the tn and tp concentrations to ensure consistencies in the sampling and chemical analysis only official data were adopted including those from the eea lake quality database in europe and the national water quality monitoring network for lakes in china tong et al 2020 in europe 286 of all the lakes have water quality records for 1998 2018 while water quality records were available for 54 lakes in china for 2006 2018 the smaller number of investigated lakes in china reflects the later development of the national water quality network part of the data for lakes on the tibetan plateau was obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center song 2021 data compilation and analysis were based on two criteria first annual average tn tp and chl a concentrations were collected second the average value of all sites was calculated for lakes with several sampling locations and applied in the analysis considering the spatial heterogeneity across regions europe was divided into two sub regions northern and southern europe and china was divided into the eastern and western region to account for potential differences in driving factors data were further divided into shallow 4 5 m in depth and deep 4 5 m in depth lakes li et al 2020 2 2 2 social and natural environmental factors on lake nutrients a dataset was created for all lakes included in the investigation using the existing hydroatlas and hydrolakes datasets including catchment land use type lake morphology and climatic data lehner et al 2022 linke et al 2019 messager et al 2016 hydrolakes provides a global database with shoreline polygon and attributes for lakes with a surface area above 0 1 km2 hydroatlas is a global unified dataset that helps to minimise uncertainties from different regional data sources lehner et al 2022 linke et al 2019 in data analysis we first applied the hydrobasins to identify the catchment boundary within which human activities could influence nutrient concentrations or ratios for each of the lakes lehner and grill 2013 for most of the lakes level 6 in hydrobasins was used as the boundary while level 5 was adopted as boundary for large lakes such as lake vanern in sweden lake saimaa in finland and lake poyang in china population density local gdp values land use types e g cropland and pasture extents in the catchments temperatures and soil erosions had been extracted from the gridded maps using hydroatlas as summarized in table 1 2 3 driver analysis for lake nutrient concentration and ratio drivers for tn and tp concentrations and their ratios were investigated using a redundancy analysis rda implemented in the rda function that is available in the vegan package for r rda is a direct gradient ordination analysis that summarises linear relationships between a set of response and explanatory variables mahdiyan et al 2021 tn tp concentrations and n p ratios in the lakes were used as response variables the explanatory variables in the rda analysis include the land use variables i e population density gdp value land use type lake morphometries i e lake depth and water residence time climate and local soil erosion we assessed the multi collinearity between the explanatory variables using the spearman rank correlation matrixes and variance inflation factor vif in the r variables that were highly correlated i e r 0 8 or vif 10 were removed from the subsequent analysis rda was performed for lakes in sub regions from europe and china individually to identify difference of the dominant drivers in addition a general linear model glm analysis was performed to quantify the relative influences of environmental and social factors on the changes on tn tp concentrations and n p ratios tao et al 2015 tong et al 2018 the sen slopes were calculated to explore the trends in tn tp and n p ratios in the lakes using the historical records this included 286 european lakes that had water quality records from 1998 to 2018 and 54 lakes from china that had continuous water quality records from 2006 to 2018 sen slope analysis is a nonparametric method that calculates the median of all the pairwise slopes within time series data to represent the trends over time sen slopes are resistant to the outliers valid for non normal distribution in the dataset and have been widely applied to evaluate the trend in water quality mahdiyan et al 2021 o reilly et al 2015 sen slopes and significances were calculated using r package trend pearson s correlation was used to characterise relationships among tn tp n p mass ratio and chl a comparisons of lake nutrients i e tn tp n p mass ratio between different groups e g lakes in europe vs lakes in china deep vs shallow lakes were performed using student s t test if the data obeyed the normal distribution if the data did not obey normal distribution a mann whitney u test was applied on comparison data and statistical analyses were carried out using excel 2010 microsoft usa spss 16 spss usa and r software version 4 0 5 3 results 3 1 lake nutrient concentrations and their ratio in china and europe the investigated lakes in china had a median tn concentration of 1 13 0 34 3 13 mg l median and 95 confidence interval ci and median tp concentration of 35 83 6 67 167 22 μg l n 117 for the 2018 baseline year figs 2 and s5 s6 by contrast the tn and tp concentrations in europe were 0 64 0 15 3 54 mg l n 472 and 19 38 2 48 150 33 μg l n 788 respectively tn and tp in lakes in europe were significantly lower than lakes in china p 0 01 for tn and p 0 01 for tp based on the surface water quality standards in china table s1 over half of all the investigated lakes in china 64 out of 117 had the tn concentrations higher than the grade iii limit 1 mg l above which lakes can be considered severely polluted in contrast only 45 lakes 38 of the total in china had tp concentrations higher than the grade iii limit 50 μg l if assessed by the same standard only 30 of the lakes in europe had tn concentrations above 1 mg l and 18 had tp concentrations above 50 μg l fig 2 it should be noted that the nutrient concentrations could also vary largely among the lakes within europe and china for example both tn and tp concentrations in lakes from northern europe were much lower than those in southern europe tn 0 42 mg l in the north vs 1 02 mg l in the south tp 11 3 μg l in the north vs 38 1 μg l in the south median value fig 2 in addition tn and tp in were much higher in shallow lakes 4 5 m in depth than those in deep lakes 4 5 m in depth p 0 01 in both china and europe in europe tn concentration in shallow lakes was 0 92 0 26 4 18 mg l while tn in deep lakes was only 0 51 0 13 2 54 mg l p 0 01 similar trends could also be observed for the lakes in china fig s7 the n p ratios for lakes in europe and china and their sub regions were calculated based on the concentrations of tn and tp fig 2 the n p mass ratio was 25 9 6 1 150 4 n 117 for lakes in china and 30 1 8 2 124 8 n 472 for lakes in europe lake n p ratios for both regions were not statistically different p 0 615 in spite of the higher tn and tp concentrations in china as for the sub regions lake n p mass ratio in eastern china was 27 3 9 4 163 0 higher than that in western china 21 1 4 2 112 3 in northern europe lake n p mass ratio was 36 0 13 1 107 9 higher than that in southern europe 25 4 7 4 130 5 an n p ratio greater than 23 in freshwaters is assumed to be p limiting to the phytoplankton guildford and hecky 2000 based on this threshold 61 of all the surveyed lakes in china and 68 of all the lakes in europe had high n p ratios figs s5 s6 this fact suggested that p limitation for the phytoplankton is more widespread for the lakes in china and europe relative to n 3 2 temporal changes of lake nutrients and ratios in china and europe nutrient concentrations and their ratios in lakes often change with economic development and in response to implementation of water pollution control measures peñuelas et al 2013 we explored the trends of tn tp concentrations and their n p ratios based on the historical records for 286 lakes in europe and 54 lakes in china fig 3 in europe 149 out of the 188 lakes investigated showed declines in tn concentration at a median rate of 0 006 mg l per year and 187 of the 286 lakes showed decreases in tp concentrations at a median rate of 0 2 μg l per year n p mass ratio showed an increase in 101 lakes with a decline observed in 87 lakes changes in the n p ratio was more pronounced for lakes in china tp concentration decreased in 32 of 54 lakes yet increased in 22 lakes in contrast tn concentration increased in 30 lakes and decreased in 24 lakes inconsistent changes in tn and tp resulted in a rapid observed increase of n p ratios in 36 out of 54 lakes in addition to differences in the level of economic development and water pollution control measures between europe and china it should be noted that these trends could be influenced by the period for which water quality data is available with a shorter record available for lakes in china this shorter record could also affect the interpretation of trends in nutrient concentrations or ratios for lakes included in the study period 3 3 an analysis of drivers of nutrient concentrations and their ratios the concentrations of n and p are determined by a suite of drivers that are associated with the source of nutrients their transports and internal processing collins et al 2017 peñuelas and sardans 2022 in the study significant differences were observed between the catchment characteristics and major drivers influencing the source of nutrients including the extents of cropland and pasture population density and gdp values table 1 among the sub regions cropland covered large proportions of the catchment in eastern china with a median of 32 southern europe with a median of 38 and northern europe with a median of 12 high population densities were observed in eastern china with about 396 0 people per km2 while the population densities in northern europe were 18 7 people per km2 table 1 in spite of the low population density northern europe has the highest per capita gdp among the four sub regions the relationship between the major drivers and lake nutrients among four sub regions was examined based on the rda models the rda explained about 36 8 of the variation in the composition of lake nutrients in northern europe most of this variation is explained by the first axis 26 2 with the second axis explaining an additional 10 6 fig 4 in contrast the percentage of variation explained by the rda for lakes in southern europe was 25 7 with the first axis explaining the majority of variation 20 5 and the second axis explained another 5 2 for both rda models n and p concentrations in lakes were associated with rda1 whereas the n p ratio was associated with rda2 the higher n and p concentrations were associated with the increasing crop extents and temperatures while the n p ratio was associated with the gdp in southern europe in china the rda explained 35 0 and 36 1 of the lake nutrients for lakes in the eastern and western regions respectively suggesting that the variables could explain about one third of spatial variation in the lake nutrient in eastern china the first axis explained most of the variation 24 6 while the second axis explained an additional 10 4 in western china the first axis of the rda analysis explained 20 9 of the variation with the second axis explaining an additional 15 1 in both rda models lake tp concentration was associated with rda1 and tn was associated with rda2 this implies that tn and tp concentrations in lakes are influenced by different drivers in eastern china deeper lake depth was associated with a decrease in the tp concentration and increase of the n p ratio in contrast lake n p ratio was more associated with the extent of cropland in the catchments in western china fig 4 a glm model was applied to quantify the contributions of various variables in explaining the spatial heterogeneity associated with lake nutrients across regions in all four sub regions the driving variables explained up to half of the variations in n and p concentrations with a r 2 range of 0 29 0 53 but less variation in the n p ratios with a r 2 range of 0 12 0 35 see fig s8 the ability of the selected drivers to explain the variations varied significantly among the four sub regions in eastern china and southern europe the key drivers explained more variations in nutrient concentrations than the corresponding n p ratio while in western china the r 2 for the n p ratio was closer to those for the n and p concentrations fig s8 the difference can be explained by the relationship between the driving variables and nutrient concentrations versus the ratio the concentrations of lake n and p are related to one or more drivers associated with nutrient sources within the catchments while their relative importance can vary across sub regions fig 5 and table 2 in northern europe the extent of cropland and population density in the catchment explained 60 of the variation in lake tp and 43 of the variation in tn while in southern europe key drivers related to the transport of nutrients i e temperatures and soil erosion could also be substantial in eastern china variations of n and p concentrations were explained by drivers of internal processing lake depth and water resident time and one related to nutrient source the cropland extents the drivers in western china were similar to eastern china with the extent of pasture in the catchment also having a marginal contribution fig 5 lake nutrients could be related to environmental drivers in different ways when n and p concentrations do not respond equally to the main driver influence of one could be significant in determining the response of the n p ratio collins et al 2017 thus it is not surprising that the response of n p ratios to most of the drivers were relatively low the largest n p effect is from the key drivers which resulted in strong differences in the coefficients for tn and tp in the lakes we found that the dominant drivers of n p ratios varied substantially between lakes in europe and china in northern europe agricultural practices the extents of pasture and croplands in the catchments had strongest effects on n p ratios explaining about half of the variation as shown in fig 5 the two factors were more powerful in explaining variation in p concentrations than the concentrations of n in southern europe the effect sizes of most drivers were comparable for n and p resulting in less influence of the key drivers on n p ratio unlike the lakes in europe internal processing factors were important in regulating n p ratios for lakes in china in eastern china lake depth explained 40 of the variation of the n p ratios with another 18 of the variation explained by the extent of cropland in the catchments in eastern china lake depth exhibited a strong negative impact on p with the lesser effect on n leading to a strong impact on the n p ratio similarly in western china the extent of cropland in the catchment explained 41 of the n p variation while water residence time explained an additional 25 these results suggest that n p ratios in lakes in europe can be more easily influenced by external nutrient sources while the internal processing processes are more important for lakes in china 4 discussion our results show that while nutrient concentrations in lakes in china are much higher than those observed in lakes in europe while lakes from both regions are facing the decoupling of n and p cycle as reflected in high n p ratios for the majority of lakes 61 of all the surveyed lakes in china and 68 in europe fig 2 and s5 compared to individual concentrations of n and p the selected variables explained less of the variation observed in n p ratios table 2 differences were observed in the responses of nutrient concentrations and ratios to drivers across sub regions due to different human activities in some regions the same driver could affect both lake n and p concentrations in the same way resulting in limited impacts on the n p ratio as observed in southern europe while in the other regions one driver might impose a stronger impact on one nutrient resulting in the changes of nutrient ratios for both lakes in china and europe n and p concentrations are related to external sources of nutrients such as the extent of cropland in the catchment however for different sub regions the magnitude of response of nutrients to the same driver differs fig 5 for example in northern europe the extent of cropland explains around 33 of the variation in n and 47 of p variation yet in southern europe the extent of cropland explains 27 of the n variation and 17 of the p variation table 2 in southern europe most of the drivers were related with the lake tn and tp concentrations in a similar way resulting in a weaker relationship between drivers and the n p ratio showing as a low r 2 in the glm model by contrast there was a single nutrient response from some drivers e g cropland and pasture extents in northern europe with the key drivers explaining variation in n p ratios comparable to those for n and p concentrations figs 4 and 5 across sub regions we find that agricultural activities are an important driver in explaining variation observed in tn and tp concentrations and their n p ratio the n p mass ratio in the anthropogenic inputs was estimated at 12 6 in 2020 i e n 205 255 tg p 17 tg globally having increased from 8 6 in 1980 peñuelas et al 2020 traditionally agricultural activity is believed to be a dominant factor responsible for increasing nutrient concentrations in lakes due to the widespread application of n or p containing fertilizers in recent decades bouwman et al 2009 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2016 however emerging studies have shown that agricultural activities are also important in determining changes of n p mass ratios from the anthropogenic inputs and in the receiving water arbuckle and downing 2001 collins et al 2017 peñuelas and sardans 2022 a study in the midwestern region of the u s showed that cropland practices could decouple n and p concentrations in lakes since n was related to the percentages of crop agriculture in the catchment yet p was not collins et al 2017 similarly results from iowa u s have also demonstrated that the variations of n p ratios in lakes could be explained by land use types since n was associated with cropping while p was positively related to pasture agriculture arbuckle and downing 2001 it should be noted that relative importance of cropland practices on nutrient concentrations and their ratio could vary among sub regions fig 5 and table 2 besides cropland practices pastures have been recognized as an important driver in regulating the n p ratios in lakes in northern europe due to the low n p ratio in animal excrement pasture practices are usually associated to declining n p ratios in the receiving waters arbuckle and downing 2001 peñuelas et al 2020 it should be noted that the contributions of agricultural activities to lakes would also depend on processes influencing nutrient transport such as climate the extent of soil erosion and nutrient binding abilities of minerals or organics goyette et al 2018 tong et al 2022 in eastern china air temperatures explain 25 of the variation of lake n concentration but less than 2 of lake p similarly in northern and southern europe temperature explained about 21 and 38 of the variations in n while only 9 and 27 respectively for p this fact suggests that climatic conditions could impose a stronger impact on n than p in lakes the difference between these two nutrients could be explained by differences in the behaviours of n and p in the soils as a lithophile element p is relatively immobile after being adsorbed by al fe and ca grenon et al 2021 land retention of p can regulate its delivery rate into the water and creates time lag between human p inputs and its concentration in water kusmer et al 2019 by contrast n is more water soluble and volatile making it more sensitive to the climate and thus n tends to spread out over a larger radius from its source peñuelas and sardans 2022 in contrast to the results in europe we find that the internal processing drivers are more pronounced in regulating the nutrient concentrations and ratio in lakes in china for instance in eastern china lake depth explains an estimated 33 of the variation in p but less than 7 of the variation for lakes in southern europe in addition lake depth was also shown to be a dominant factor in determining the n p ratio in lakes in eastern explaining around 40 of the variation close associations between internal nutrient cycling and lake morphometries have been well documented in previous studies collins et al 2017 qin et al 2020 tong et al 2019 vollenweider quantified the relationship between tp and lake depth as early as 1976 vollenweider 1976 particulate p a major component of tp could be more easily deposited from water column with increasing lake depth akbarzadeh et al 2019 n does not show the same relationships with lake depth making depth a strong predictor of n p ratio in contrast to the relationship between p and lake depth we found that n concentration was more sensitive to water residence time which explains an estimated 44 of the variation in n for lakes in western china reenforcing the findings of earlier studies finlay et al 2013 and tong et al 2019 it has been reported that the efficiency of n removal by denitrification and permanent burial is primarily affected by water residence time with longer residence times resulting in increased efficiencies saunders and kalff 2001 the efficiency of n removal due to internal processes can increase from 4 to 20 of the total input if the residence time of a waterbody increased from 0 2 to 1 year finlay et al 2013 it should be noted that the relative impacts of lake depth or water residence time on internal nutrient cycling also depend on lake nutrient concentrations and external nutrient inputs collins et al 2017 seitzinger et al 2006 wu et al 2017 the role of lake depth and water residence time on nutrient concentrations or ratios may be limited to high nutrient concentrations as revealed by finlay et al 2013 lakes with higher nutrient concentration display higher internal nutrient removal than oligotrophic lakes compared with lakes in europe tn or tp concentrations in lakes in china are much higher fig 2 these observed differences between nutrient concentrations in lakes in europe and china can explain the more pronounced effect of lake morphometry on nutrient concentration and ratios in china the large scale and increasing imbalances between n and p concentration in lakes suggests that more emphasis should be placed on maintaining a balance between nutrients in addition to focusing only on the reductions of n and p concentrations prior studies have highlighted importance of a balance between n and p in the restoration of lakes to sustain phytoplankton biodiversity tong et al 2020 however to date most of the eutrophication control measures focus on reduction of a single nutrient while simultaneously neglecting changes of the n p ratio the results reaffirm the need for continued efforts in europe to control nutrient inputs from agriculture activities highlighting the contributions of cropland practices on changes in n p ratios excess nutrient input from point sources has been gradually brought under control in europe through effective implementations of water framework directive european urban wastewater treatment directive and similar policies guildford and hecky 2000 pollutants from diffuse or intermittent sources that are difficult to identify continue to prove challenging in securing further improvement in water quality across lakes in europe as shown in this study the contributions from croplands and pasture practices continue to be important drivers not only on nutrient concentrations but also their ratios particularly in the northern europe in contrast to europe nutrient concentrations in china are related to lake morphology and the ability of the lakes to self purify after pollutants enter into water self purification capacity of waterbodies is crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of increased human n inputs finlay et al 2013 saunders and kalff 2001 we found that lake depth and water residence time had abilities in regulating n and p concentrations as well as their ratios to some extent this self purification ability is beneficial for the mitigation of eutrophication since it can help to reduce nutrient concentration however this ability can only be significant in high nutrient lakes as a comparison lakes in europe had lower nutrient concentrations and the impact of lake depth or water residence time on nutrients is less significant secondly this self purification may not impact n or p concentration equally and might result in a change of n p ratio lake depth and water residence time are not typically included as a predictor of n p ratios in the lakes however our results indicate that because of the different impacts of lake depth and residence time on n and p their inclusion in the broad scale prediction of lake n p ratio is critical particularly for the lakes with high nutrient concentrations 5 conclusions we carried out a comparative analysis of lake nutrient concentrations and their ratios based on the official monitoring data for 788 lakes in europe and 117 lakes in china considering a range of environmental and social drivers for two regions at different economic development stages the results indicate that while tn and tp concentrations were much higher in lakes in china than those in europe majority of lakes in both regions are facing high n p ratio having successfully implemented a series of measures to control point source pollutions these results highlight the challenge of controlling nutrient contamination from agricultural practices these non point sources continue to be an important driver in regulating nutrient concentrations and ratios in northern europe in contrast nutrient concentrations for lakes in china are explained primarily by lake depth and water residence time regional differences in the major drivers of nutrient concentrations highlight the need for region specific water pollution control strategies in order to mitigate the impacts of eutrophication it is important for water resource managers to be aware of the potential for the large scale imbalance between different nutrients given the limited understanding of the ecological risks these could be induced in aquatic ecosystems while there is a need for collective actions to control the n and p concentrations in the world s water

15317,global anthropogenic flows of nitrogen n and phosphorus p have exceeded planetary boundaries with significant implications for pollution of the freshwater resources in the world understanding the global patterns and drivers of n and p concentrations and their ratios in the lakes could help design more effective management and remediation strategies to mitigate the impacts of eutrophication while a suite of drivers are associated with the sources of nutrients their transport and internal processes that control concentrations of n and p in the lakes much less is known about the relative importance of different drivers in explaining spatial variations of lake nutrients and ratios in this study we compared n and p concentrations and their ratios in the lakes across china and europe and examined the differences of dominant environmental and social drivers on lake nutrients our comparison showed that total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were much higher in the lakes in china compared to those in europe i e tn 1 13 mg l in china vs 0 64 mg l in europe tp 35 83 μg l in china vs 19 38 μg l in europe the median value however lake n p ratios for both regions were not statistically different concentrations of tn and tp showed decoupling in both regions with the majority of lakes having high n p mass ratios when evaluated by the commonly accepted threshold of 23 i e 61 in china and 68 in europe indicating that phytoplankton are more p limited relative to n agricultural activity in the lake catchment is an important predictor for both nutrient concentrations and their ratio in europe this reflects successful investments in infrastructure and policy prescriptions in addressing point sources of pollution in comparison lake depth and water residence time are important in the decoupling of n and p concentrations in china the regional difference between the dominant drivers can provide important insights into development of effective water pollution control measures it is necessary for policy makers and water resource managers to be aware of large scale imbalance of nutrients in lake due to the potential environmental consequences

keywords nutrient concentrations and ratios eutrophication catchment land uses lake morphometry water quality management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes provide valuable services to billions of people for drinking recreational and industrial or agricultural uses kalff 2002 however they are also susceptible to degradation due to the human activities with a range of influences associated with different stages of the economic development in recent decades growing population pressures and changing land use patterns have had an unprecedented influence on the world s lakes buttner et al 2022 eea 2018 qin et al 2022 tong et al 2018 the industrialisation of ammonia production and extensive phosphate mining have made the nutrients available at a faster rate than ever seen in human history gruber and galloway 2008 peñuelas and sardans 2022 the excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs have resulted in eutrophication and the expansion of harmful algal blooms that are an increasing threat to drinking water and undermine the ecosystem services globally ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 the absolute concentration of a limiting nutrient plays a central role in the ecosystem dynamics while the relative availability of some nutrients can also affect a range of ecological patterns and processes collins et al 2017 sterner and elser 2002 nutrient co limitation by n and p has been pervasive across a range of aquatic or marine ecosystems elser et al 2009 elser et al 2007 tong et al 2022 in many cases n and p concentrations in the lake are not transferred at equal or predictable rates resulting in unexpected changes in the nutrient ratios peñuelas et al 2013 sterner and elser 2002 an accelerated imbalance between n and p has been reported in many lakes including the lake zurich in switzerland lake okeechobee in the u s lake erie in canada u s and dianchi in china peñuelas et al 2013 tong et al 2020 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2010 yan et al 2016 mitigation of eutrophication has been achieved in some lakes in europe eea 2018 and a part of the great lakes in the u s canada allan et al 2013 mahdiyan et al 2021 sterner 2021 while eutrophication is still severe in many regions particularly in developing countries where nutrient inputs into fresh waterbody continue to increase rapid changes in nutrient composition concentration together with the ratio in lakes have far reaching implications for a range of ecological processes glibert 2012 sterner and elser 2002 changes in nutrient composition can trigger shifts in the composition of phytoplankton species that in turn resonate throughout the aquatic food web glibert 2012 homeostatic mechanisms could maintain the uptake of materials and energies in balance with the demands for the cellular growth of primary producer klausmeier et al 2008 sterner and elser 2002 different plankton species have different optimal n p ratios finkel et al 2010 klausmeier et al 2004 for example the n2 fixing cyanobacteria that dominate the plankton community under low n p ratios become inferior competitors relative to non n2 fixing species such as microcystis spp and planktothrix spp under high n p ratios chislock et al 2014 high n p ratio could also lead to p limitations on phytoplankton communities thereby reducing the nutritional quality of food for the majority of herbivorous zooplankton schulhof et al 2019 in addition the per cell productions of n rich toxin e g microcystins could be enhanced by enrichment of n under the oligotrophic conditions sterner and elser 2002 thus changes in the availability of n and p along with associated changes in n p ratios could drive shifts in phytoplankton species and their dominance in freshwater ecosystems consequently transfer of energy throughout the food web could be reduced leading to fewer predators and the loss of aquatic biodiversity tong et al 2020 human activities are primarily responsible for the observed increase in nutrient inputs to the world s lakes the level of economic development can affect the degree of eutrophication and the nature of the issues which typically manifest much earlier in today s more developed economies jenny et al 2020 powers et al 2016 low income economies are often more challenged by point and non point sources of pollutions while more developed high income economies usually have the ability to apply the technologies or innovations to control if not reverse the trend of nutrient inputs there are numerous pathways through which n and p enter aquatic ecosystem with the n p ratios typically correlating to different human activities accounting for the type of human activity is thus important in regulating the n p ratio many previous studies have attempted to identify the drivers of nutrient concentrations or ratios at broad regional or continental scales abell et al 2019 yan et al 2016 however predicting nutrient ratios is more challenging than concentrations since the ratio can be only related to the driver if one nutrient responds strongly and the other is not affected collins et al 2017 most of the p input typically comes from point source while most of the n is usually derived from diffuse sources and gaseous form which are more difficult to manage yan et al 2016 tong et al 2020 in addition to the impacts from nutrient sources nutrient composition in freshwater systems could also be impacted by internal processes for instance a study in the midwestern region of the u s had indicated that lake depth was a strong predictor of nutrient ratio in water since only p was related to depth but n was not collins et al 2017 removing p from the water column is easier mainly in particulate from through sedimentation whereas n can only be removed by the nitrification or denitrification processes and biological uptake qin et al 2020 in addition nutrients in lakes are also influenced by the climatic factors and catchment topography that can affect nutrient transport on land collins et al 2017 peñuelas and sardans 2022 whitehead and crossman 2012 thus the nutrient composition in lakes is due to a combination of multiple environmental and social factors making it difficult to identify those that can drive changes in nutrient concentrations and ratios the need to examine the drivers of changes in both n and p in lakes over space and time collins et al 2017 liu et al 2021 is highlighted by the influence of eutrophication on the ecological processes coupled with accelerating nutrient inputs due to the increasing human pressures glibert 2012 klausmeier et al 2008 sterner and elser 2002 su et al 2019 understanding global pattern of n and p concentrations and their ratio in lake and identifying their drivers could therefore help to design more effective measures to mitigate eutrophication and control the expansion of harmful algal blooms in this study n and p concentrations and their ratios in lakes in china are compared to those in europe in order to provide new insight into the driver of nutrients and identify the measures to control algal blooms we examine the contributions of different environmental and social drivers on nutrients in lakes and explore differences between the dominant drivers across regions social drivers examined in the study include the extent of cropland and pasture in the lake catchment population density and gross domestic product gdp environmental factors include lake morphometries i e lake depth and water residence time climate and local soil erosion concentration of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp along with their n p mass ratios in 117 lakes across china and 788 lakes across europe have been investigated and compared the primary goal is to identify the drivers of lake nutrient concentrations and their ratios over space and time and to determine how they differ across regions with different environmental and social characteristics 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area freshwater lakes are widely distributed in both europe and china and many of them are experiencing or have experienced a deterioration of water quality jenny et al 2020 despite differences in level of economic development fig s1 both regions are facing increasing pressures resulting in the ecosystem degradation including an increasing occurrence of algal blooms and a rapid loss in aquatic biodiversity birk et al 2020 huisman et al 2018 jenny et al 2020 china has gone through a long and rapid period of the economic development and industrialisation since the introduction of reforms in 1978 which shifted the country to a market based economy nbsc 2021 this has seen sustained growth with gdp averaging almost 10 a year and income per capita increasing from us 300 in 1978 to us 10 276 in 2019 and more than 850 million people lifted out of poverty world bank and development research center 2022 this has been coupled with a period of rapid urbanization with over 60 of the total populations living in cities in 2020 compared to less than 20 in the 1970s nbsc 2021 rapid economic development has resulted in an increase of n and p input into freshwater with very limited environmental protection measures such as the development of wastewater treatment plants the wastewater discharge standard and the cap control targets for pollutants before 2000 xu et al 2021 in comparison europe has a much lower population density around 70 people per km2 and a higher average per capita gdp around 30 000 in 2020 though it varies largely between countries ibrd 2022 since the 1990s the european commission has initiated regulations to control diffuse sources of pollutions from agriculture and point sources of pollutions from the urban wastewater discharges including the nitrates directive the urban wastewater treatment directive and water framework directive eea 2018 the european water policy has specifically aimed for all the rivers lakes coastal and transitional waters to attain good ecological status before 2015 or at the latest by 2027 while recent estimates suggest that most of the aquatic ecosystems have failed to achieve this target poikane et al 2019 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 lake nutrient data in europe and china data on tn tp concentrations and the mass ratio were obtained for 788 lakes or reservoirs covering 21 countries in europe and 117 lakes located in different regions of mainland china fig 1 the number of lakes from different european countries is shown in fig s2 the area and depth of the lakes surveyed in this study are shown in figs s3 and s4 we did not differentiate between lake or reservoirs because both can be affected by similar environmental or social drivers derived from the surrounding catchment area water quality data include tn mg l tp μg l and chl a μg l concentrations the n p mass ratio was then calculated for each lake based on the tn and tp concentrations to ensure consistencies in the sampling and chemical analysis only official data were adopted including those from the eea lake quality database in europe and the national water quality monitoring network for lakes in china tong et al 2020 in europe 286 of all the lakes have water quality records for 1998 2018 while water quality records were available for 54 lakes in china for 2006 2018 the smaller number of investigated lakes in china reflects the later development of the national water quality network part of the data for lakes on the tibetan plateau was obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center song 2021 data compilation and analysis were based on two criteria first annual average tn tp and chl a concentrations were collected second the average value of all sites was calculated for lakes with several sampling locations and applied in the analysis considering the spatial heterogeneity across regions europe was divided into two sub regions northern and southern europe and china was divided into the eastern and western region to account for potential differences in driving factors data were further divided into shallow 4 5 m in depth and deep 4 5 m in depth lakes li et al 2020 2 2 2 social and natural environmental factors on lake nutrients a dataset was created for all lakes included in the investigation using the existing hydroatlas and hydrolakes datasets including catchment land use type lake morphology and climatic data lehner et al 2022 linke et al 2019 messager et al 2016 hydrolakes provides a global database with shoreline polygon and attributes for lakes with a surface area above 0 1 km2 hydroatlas is a global unified dataset that helps to minimise uncertainties from different regional data sources lehner et al 2022 linke et al 2019 in data analysis we first applied the hydrobasins to identify the catchment boundary within which human activities could influence nutrient concentrations or ratios for each of the lakes lehner and grill 2013 for most of the lakes level 6 in hydrobasins was used as the boundary while level 5 was adopted as boundary for large lakes such as lake vanern in sweden lake saimaa in finland and lake poyang in china population density local gdp values land use types e g cropland and pasture extents in the catchments temperatures and soil erosions had been extracted from the gridded maps using hydroatlas as summarized in table 1 2 3 driver analysis for lake nutrient concentration and ratio drivers for tn and tp concentrations and their ratios were investigated using a redundancy analysis rda implemented in the rda function that is available in the vegan package for r rda is a direct gradient ordination analysis that summarises linear relationships between a set of response and explanatory variables mahdiyan et al 2021 tn tp concentrations and n p ratios in the lakes were used as response variables the explanatory variables in the rda analysis include the land use variables i e population density gdp value land use type lake morphometries i e lake depth and water residence time climate and local soil erosion we assessed the multi collinearity between the explanatory variables using the spearman rank correlation matrixes and variance inflation factor vif in the r variables that were highly correlated i e r 0 8 or vif 10 were removed from the subsequent analysis rda was performed for lakes in sub regions from europe and china individually to identify difference of the dominant drivers in addition a general linear model glm analysis was performed to quantify the relative influences of environmental and social factors on the changes on tn tp concentrations and n p ratios tao et al 2015 tong et al 2018 the sen slopes were calculated to explore the trends in tn tp and n p ratios in the lakes using the historical records this included 286 european lakes that had water quality records from 1998 to 2018 and 54 lakes from china that had continuous water quality records from 2006 to 2018 sen slope analysis is a nonparametric method that calculates the median of all the pairwise slopes within time series data to represent the trends over time sen slopes are resistant to the outliers valid for non normal distribution in the dataset and have been widely applied to evaluate the trend in water quality mahdiyan et al 2021 o reilly et al 2015 sen slopes and significances were calculated using r package trend pearson s correlation was used to characterise relationships among tn tp n p mass ratio and chl a comparisons of lake nutrients i e tn tp n p mass ratio between different groups e g lakes in europe vs lakes in china deep vs shallow lakes were performed using student s t test if the data obeyed the normal distribution if the data did not obey normal

lake nutrient concentrations and their ratio in china and europe the investigated lakes in china had a median tn concentration of 1 13 0 34 3 13 mg l median and 95 confidence interval ci and median tp concentration of 35 83 6 67 167 22 μg l n 117 for the 2018 baseline year figs 2 and s5 s6 by contrast the tn and tp concentrations in europe were 0 64 0 15 3 54 mg l n 472 and 19 38 2 48 150 33 μg l n 788 respectively tn and tp in lakes in europe were significantly lower than lakes in china p 0 01 for tn and p 0 01 for tp based on the surface water quality standards in china table s1 over half of all the investigated lakes in china 64 out of 117 had the tn concentrations higher than the grade iii limit 1 mg l above which lakes can be considered severely polluted in contrast only 45 lakes 38 of the total in china had tp concentrations higher than the grade iii limit 50 μg l if assessed by the same standard only 30 of the lakes in europe had tn concentrations above 1 mg l and 18 had tp concentrations above 50 μg l fig 2 it should be noted that the nutrient concentrations could also vary largely among the lakes within europe and china for example both tn and tp concentrations in lakes from northern europe were much lower than those in southern europe tn 0 42 mg l in the north vs 1 02 mg l in the south tp 11 3 μg l in the north vs 38 1 μg l in the south median value fig 2 in addition tn and tp in were much higher in shallow lakes 4 5 m in depth than those in deep lakes 4 5 m in depth p 0 01 in both china and europe in europe tn concentration in shallow lakes was 0 92 0 26 4 18 mg l while tn in deep lakes was only 0 51 0 13 2 54 mg l p 0 01 similar trends could also be observed for the lakes in china fig s7 the n p ratios for lakes in europe and china and their sub regions were calculated based on the concentrations of tn and tp fig 2 the n p mass ratio was 25 9 6 1 150 4 n 117 for lakes in china and 30 1 8 2 124 8 n 472 for lakes in europe lake n p ratios for both regions were not statistically different p 0 615 in spite of the higher tn and tp concentrations in china as for the sub regions lake n p mass ratio in eastern china was 27 3 9 4 163 0 higher than that in western china 21 1 4 2 112 3 in northern europe lake n p mass ratio was 36 0 13 1 107 9 higher than that in southern europe 25 4 7 4 130 5 an n p ratio greater than 23 in freshwaters is assumed to be p limiting to the phytoplankton guildford and hecky 2000 based on this threshold 61 of all the surveyed lakes in china and 68 of all the lakes in europe had high n p ratios figs s5 s6 this fact suggested that p limitation for the phytoplankton is more widespread for the lakes in china and europe relative to n 3 2 temporal changes of lake nutrients and ratios in china and europe nutrient concentrations and their ratios in lakes often change with economic development and in response to implementation of water pollution control measures peñuelas et al 2013 we explored the trends of tn tp concentrations and their n p ratios based on the historical records for 286 lakes in europe and 54 lakes in china fig 3 in europe 149 out of the 188 lakes investigated showed declines in tn concentration at a median rate of 0 006 mg l per year and 187 of the 286 lakes showed decreases in tp concentrations at a median rate of 0 2 μg l per year n p mass ratio showed an increase in 101 lakes with a decline observed in 87 lakes changes in the n p ratio was more pronounced for lakes in china tp concentration decreased in 32 of 54 lakes yet increased in 22 lakes in contrast tn concentration increased in 30 lakes and decreased in 24 lakes inconsistent changes in tn and tp resulted in a rapid observed increase of n p ratios in 36 out of 54 lakes in addition to differences in the level of economic development and water pollution control measures between europe and china it should be noted that these trends could be influenced by the period for which water quality data is available with a shorter record available for lakes in china this shorter record could also affect the interpretation of trends in nutrient concentrations or ratios for lakes included in the study period 3 3 an analysis of drivers of nutrient concentrations and their ratios the concentrations of n and p are determined by a suite of drivers that are associated with the source of nutrients their transports and internal processing collins et al 2017 peñuelas and sardans 2022 in the study significant differences were observed between the catchment characteristics and major drivers influencing the source of nutrients including the extents of cropland and pasture population density and gdp values table 1 among the sub regions cropland covered large proportions of the catchment in eastern china with a median of 32 southern europe with a median of 38 and northern europe with a median of 12 high population densities were observed in eastern china with about 396 0 people per km2 while the population densities in northern europe were 18 7 people per km2 table 1 in spite of the low population density northern europe has the highest per capita gdp among the four sub regions the relationship between the major drivers and lake nutrients among four sub regions was examined based on the rda models the rda explained about 36 8 of the variation in the composition of lake nutrients in northern europe most of this variation is explained by the first axis 26 2 with the second axis explaining an additional 10 6 fig 4 in contrast the percentage of variation explained by the rda for lakes in southern europe was 25 7 with the first axis explaining the majority of variation 20 5 and the second axis explained another 5 2 for both rda models n and p concentrations in lakes were associated with rda1 whereas the n p ratio was associated with rda2 the higher n and p concentrations were associated with the increasing crop extents and temperatures while the n p ratio was associated with the gdp in southern europe in china the rda explained 35 0 and 36 1 of the lake nutrients for lakes in the eastern and western regions respectively suggesting that the variables could explain about one third of spatial variation in the lake nutrient in eastern china the first axis explained most of the variation 24 6 while the second axis explained an additional 10 4 in western china the first axis of the rda analysis explained 20 9 of the variation with the second axis explaining an additional 15 1 in both rda models lake tp concentration was associated with rda1 and tn was associated with rda2 this implies that tn and tp concentrations in lakes are influenced by different drivers in eastern china deeper lake depth was associated with a decrease in the tp concentration and increase of the n p ratio in contrast lake n p ratio was more associated with the extent of cropland in the catchments in western china fig 4 a glm model was applied to quantify the contributions of various variables in explaining the spatial heterogeneity associated with lake nutrients across regions in all four sub regions the driving variables explained up to half of the variations in n and p concentrations with a r 2 range of 0 29 0 53 but less variation in the n p ratios with a r 2 range of 0 12 0 35 see fig s8 the ability of the selected drivers to explain the variations varied significantly among the four sub regions in eastern china and southern europe the key drivers explained more variations in nutrient concentrations than the corresponding n p ratio while in western china the r 2 for the n p ratio was closer to those for the n and p concentrations fig s8 the difference can be explained by the relationship between the driving variables and nutrient concentrations versus the ratio the concentrations of lake n and p are related to one or more drivers associated with nutrient sources within the catchments while their relative importance can vary across sub regions fig 5 and table 2 in northern europe the extent of cropland and population density in the catchment explained 60 of the variation in lake tp and 43 of the variation in tn while in southern europe key drivers related to the transport of nutrients i e temperatures and soil erosion could also be substantial in eastern china variations of n and p concentrations were explained by drivers of internal processing lake depth and water resident time and one related to nutrient source the cropland extents the drivers in western china were similar to eastern china with the extent of pasture in the catchment also having a marginal contribution fig 5 lake nutrients could be related to environmental drivers in different ways when n and p concentrations do not respond equally to the main driver influence of one could be significant in determining the response of the n p ratio collins et al 2017 thus it is not surprising that the response of n p ratios to most of the drivers were relatively low the largest n p effect is from the key drivers which resulted in strong differences in the coefficients for tn and tp in the lakes we found that the dominant drivers of n p ratios varied substantially between lakes in europe and china in northern europe agricultural practices the extents of pasture and croplands in the catchments had strongest effects on n p ratios explaining about half of the variation as shown in fig 5 the two factors were more powerful in explaining variation in p concentrations than the concentrations of n in southern europe the effect sizes of most drivers were comparable for n and p resulting in less influence of the key drivers on n p ratio unlike the lakes in europe internal processing factors were important in regulating n p ratios for lakes in china in eastern china lake depth explained 40 of the variation of the n p ratios with another 18 of the variation explained by the extent of cropland in the catchments in eastern china lake depth exhibited a strong negative impact on p with the lesser effect on n leading to a strong impact on the n p ratio similarly in western china the extent of cropland in the catchment explained 41 of the n p variation while water residence time explained an additional 25 these results suggest that n p ratios in lakes in europe can be more easily influenced by external nutrient sources while the internal processing processes are more important for lakes in china 4 discussion our results show that while nutrient concentrations in lakes in china are much higher than those observed in lakes in europe while lakes from both regions are facing the decoupling of n and p cycle as reflected in high n p ratios for the majority of lakes 61 of all the surveyed lakes in china and 68 in europe fig 2 and s5 compared to individual concentrations of n and p the selected variables explained less of the variation observed in n p ratios table 2 differences were observed in the responses of nutrient concentrations and ratios to drivers across sub regions due to different human activities in some regions the same driver could affect both lake n and p concentrations in the same way resulting in limited impacts on the n p ratio as observed in southern europe while in the other regions one driver might impose a stronger impact on one nutrient resulting in the changes of nutrient ratios for both lakes in china and europe n and p concentrations are related to external sources of nutrients such as the extent of cropland in the catchment however for different sub regions the magnitude of response of nutrients to the same driver differs fig 5 for example in northern europe the extent of cropland explains around 33 of the variation in n and 47 of p variation yet in southern europe the extent of cropland explains 27 of the n variation and 17 of the p variation table 2 in southern europe most of the drivers were related with the lake tn and tp concentrations in a similar way resulting in a weaker relationship between drivers and the n p ratio showing as a low r 2 in the glm model by contrast there was a single nutrient response from some drivers e g cropland and pasture extents in northern europe with the key drivers explaining variation in n p ratios comparable to those for n and p concentrations figs 4 and 5 across sub regions we find that agricultural activities are an important driver in explaining variation observed in tn and tp concentrations and their n p ratio the n p mass ratio in the anthropogenic inputs was estimated at 12 6 in 2020 i e n 205 255 tg p 17 tg globally having increased from 8 6 in 1980 peñuelas et al 2020 traditionally agricultural activity is believed to be a dominant factor responsible for increasing nutrient concentrations in lakes due to the widespread application of n or p containing fertilizers in recent decades bouwman et al 2009 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2016 however emerging studies have shown that agricultural activities are also important in determining changes of n p mass ratios from the anthropogenic inputs and in the receiving water arbuckle and downing 2001 collins et al 2017 peñuelas and sardans 2022 a study in the midwestern region of the u s showed that cropland practices could decouple n and p concentrations in lakes since n was related to the percentages of crop agriculture in the catchment yet p was not collins et al 2017 similarly results from iowa u s have also demonstrated that the variations of n p ratios in lakes could be explained by land use types since n was associated with cropping while p was positively related to pasture agriculture arbuckle and downing 2001 it should be noted that relative importance of cropland practices on nutrient concentrations and their ratio could vary among sub regions fig 5 and table 2 besides cropland practices pastures have been recognized as an important driver in regulating the n p ratios in lakes in northern europe due to the low n p ratio in animal excrement pasture practices are usually associated to declining n p ratios in the receiving waters arbuckle and downing 2001 peñuelas et al 2020 it should be noted that the contributions of agricultural activities to lakes would also depend on processes influencing nutrient transport such as climate the extent of soil erosion and nutrient binding abilities of minerals or organics goyette et al 2018 tong et al 2022 in eastern china air temperatures explain 25 of the variation of lake n concentration but less than 2 of lake p similarly in northern and southern europe temperature explained about 21 and 38 of the variations in n while only 9 and 27 respectively for p this fact suggests that climatic conditions could impose a stronger impact on n than p in lakes the difference between these two nutrients could be explained by differences in the behaviours of n and p in the soils as a lithophile element p is relatively immobile after being adsorbed by al fe and ca grenon et al 2021 land retention of p can regulate its delivery rate into the water and creates time lag between human p inputs and its concentration in water kusmer et al 2019 by contrast n is more water soluble and volatile making it more sensitive to the climate and thus n tends to spread out over a larger radius from its source peñuelas and sardans 2022 in contrast to the results in europe we find that the internal processing drivers are more pronounced in regulating the nutrient concentrations and ratio in lakes in china for instance in eastern china lake depth explains an estimated 33 of the variation in p but less than 7 of the variation for lakes in southern europe in addition lake depth was also shown to be a dominant factor in determining the n p ratio in lakes in eastern explaining around 40 of the variation close associations between internal nutrient cycling and lake morphometries have been well documented in previous studies collins et al 2017 qin et al 2020 tong et al 2019 vollenweider quantified the relationship between tp and lake depth as early as 1976 vollenweider 1976 particulate p a major component of tp could be more easily deposited from water column with increasing lake depth akbarzadeh et al 2019 n does not show the same relationships with lake depth making depth a strong predictor of n p ratio in contrast to the relationship between p and lake depth we found that n concentration was more sensitive to water residence time which explains an estimated 44 of the variation in n for lakes in western china reenforcing the findings of earlier studies finlay et al 2013 and tong et al 2019 it has been reported that the efficiency of n removal by denitrification and permanent burial is primarily affected by water residence time with longer residence times resulting in increased efficiencies saunders and kalff 2001 the efficiency of n removal due to internal processes can increase from 4 to 20 of the total input if the residence time of a waterbody increased from 0 2 to 1 year finlay et al 2013 it should be noted that the relative impacts of lake depth or water residence time on internal nutrient cycling also depend on lake nutrient concentrations and external nutrient inputs collins et al 2017 seitzinger et al 2006 wu et al 2017 the role of lake depth and water residence time on nutrient concentrations or ratios may be limited to high nutrient concentrations as revealed by finlay et al 2013 lakes with higher nutrient concentration display higher internal nutrient removal than oligotrophic lakes compared with lakes in europe tn or tp concentrations in lakes in china are much higher fig 2 these observed differences between nutrient concentrations in lakes in europe and china can explain the more pronounced effect of lake morphometry on nutrient concentration and ratios in china the large scale and increasing imbalances between n and p concentration in lakes suggests that more emphasis should be placed on maintaining a balance between nutrients in addition to focusing only on the reductions of n and p concentrations prior studies have highlighted importance of a balance between n and p in the restoration of lakes to sustain phytoplankton biodiversity tong et al 2020 however to date most of the eutrophication control measures focus on reduction of a single nutrient while simultaneously neglecting changes of the n p ratio the results reaffirm the need for continued efforts in europe to control nutrient inputs from agriculture activities highlighting the contributions of cropland practices on changes in n p ratios excess nutrient input from point sources has been gradually brought under control in europe through effective implementations of water framework directive european urban wastewater treatment directive and similar policies guildford and hecky 2000 pollutants from diffuse or intermittent sources that are difficult to identify continue to prove challenging in securing further improvement in water quality across lakes in europe as shown in this study the contributions from croplands and pasture practices continue to be important drivers not only on nutrient concentrations but also their ratios particularly in the northern europe in contrast to europe nutrient concentrations in china are related to lake morphology and the ability of the lakes to self purify after pollutants enter into water self purification capacity of waterbodies is crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of increased human n inputs finlay et al 2013 saunders and kalff 2001 we found that lake depth and water residence time had abilities in regulating n and p concentrations as well as their ratios to some extent this self purification ability is beneficial for the mitigation of eutrophication since it can help to reduce nutrient concentration however this ability can only be significant in high nutrient lakes as a comparison lakes in europe had lower nutrient concentrations and the impact of lake depth or water residence time on nutrients is less significant secondly this self purification may not impact n or p concentration equally and might result in a change of n p ratio lake depth and water residence time are not typically included as a predictor of n p ratios in the lakes however our results indicate that because of the different impacts of lake depth and residence time on n and p their inclusion in the broad scale prediction of lake n p ratio is critical particularly for the lakes with high nutrient concentrations 5 conclusions we carried out a comparative analysis of lake nutrient concentrations and their ratios based on the official monitoring data for 788 lakes in europe and 117 lakes in china considering a range of environmental and social drivers for two regions at different economic development stages the results indicate that while tn and tp concentrations were much higher in lakes in china than those in europe majority of lakes in both regions are facing high n p ratio having successfully implemented a series of measures to control point source pollutions these results highlight the challenge of controlling nutrient contamination from agricultural practices these non point sources continue to be an important driver in regulating nutrient concentrations and ratios in northern europe in contrast nutrient concentrations for lakes in china are explained primarily by lake depth and water residence time regional differences in the major drivers of nutrient concentrations highlight the need for region specific water pollution control strategies in order to mitigate the impacts of eutrophication it is important for water resource managers to be aware of the potential for the large scale imbalance between different nutrients given the limited understanding of the ecological risks these could be induced in aquatic ecosystems while there is a need for collective actions to control the n and p concentrations in the world s water

15318,glutaraldehyde and didecyldimethylammonium bromide gd is a disinfectant widely used to prevent african swine fever asf in livestock farms however the effect of residual gd on the activated sludge microbial ecology of receiving wastewater treatment plants wwtps remains largely unknown in this study seven simulated systems were established to research the effects of gd on wwtps and reveal the underlying mechanisms of microecological responses to gd at different concentrations both the nitrogen and carbon removal rates decreased with increasing gd concentrations and nitrogen metabolism was inhibited more obviously but the inhibition weakened with increasing stress duration microorganisms activated their soxrs systems to promote atp synthesis and electron transfer to support the hydrolysis and efflux of gd by producing a small number of ros when exposed to gd at less than 1 mg l the overproduction of ros led to a decrease of antioxidant and nitrogen removal enzyme activities and upregulation of the porin gene increased the risk of gd entering the intracellular space upon exposure to gd at concentrations higher than 1 mg l some denitrifiers survived via resistance and their basic capabilities of sugar metabolism and nitrogen assimilation notably low concentrations of disinfectants could promote vertical and horizontal transfer of multiple resistance genes especially aminoglycosides among microorganisms which might increase not only the adaptation capability of denitrifiers but also the risk to ecological systems therefore the risks of disinfectants targeting asf on ecology and health as well as the effects of disinfectant residuals from the covid 19 epidemic should receive more attention keywords glutaraldehyde and didecyldimethylammonium bromide disinfectant microecological response mechanism nitrogen metabolism resistance genes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years china s livestock industry has greatly developed to meet the continuous expansion of market demand and the livestock and poultry production mode has changed from scattered and small scale farming to large scale standardized and industrialized farming li et al 2020 however since 2018 african swine fever asf has spread in most provinces and cities across china there is still no effective vaccine standardized disinfection measures are considered the most effective and convenient means to prevent asf and efficient and cost effective disinfectants have become the first choice for large scale plant breeding tong et al 2021 at present the disinfectants commonly used in breeding production to prevent epidemics include sodium hydroxide quicklime sodium hypochlorite and quaternary ammonium salts gosling et al 2017 maertens et al 2020 as a new compound disinfectant glutaraldehyde didecyldimethylammonium bromide gd solution has the characteristics of quaternary ammonium salts in destroying cell membranes and disturbing ionic stability as well as the advantages of aldehyde disinfectants in changing the secondary structure of proteins therefore it is widely used in pig house environments and pool disinfection lin et al 2018 to deal with the normalized and complicated epidemics situation according to the production requirements besides daily disinfection to prevent from exotic invasion of virus great disinfection was generally conducted before a new production period and the residual disinfectants from production area converged into the wastewater treatment systems maertens et al 2019 which might affect the operation of the wastewater system and even be a bigger issue during serious outbreaks of african swine fever it had been reported that several type of daily cleaning agents e g savo domestos asanox clorox containing the disinfectants of sodium hypochlorite could reduce the cod removal efficiency of the receiving municipal sewage treatment facilities which might cause by the inhibition of the respiration rate and the functional enzyme activity of the activated sludge and excessive production of intracellular ros was also found in the sludge with expose to disinfectants bodik et al 2008 han et al 2016 the migration and spread of disinfectant or antibiotic resistance genes were also promoted by the daily disinfectants remained in municipal sewage treatment facilities eventually flowing to the environment and posing a serious threat to human health and ecosystem safety chacon et al 2021 therefore it is important and necessary to study the effects and mechanisms of different concentrations of gd exposure on artificial and natural ecosystems to accurately evaluate the effect of residual disinfectant gd on the construction and function of microbial communities and reveal its mechanism seven stimulated livestock wastewater treatment systems were established and the effect of gd disinfectant was studied in the present paper the effects of metabolism and the organic substances removal capability and its mechanisms on key functional genes and their expression levels bacterial community dynamics and the stress responses of ecological interaction networks were researched the results provide insight into the ecological risk of disinfectants and draw more attention to the rational use of disinfectants especially in the current environmental context of

establishment and operation of the stimulated aerobic reactors seven groups of stimulated aerobic reactors were established in the laboratory by adding 50 ml of activated sludge into each 100 ml container which was collected fetched from the one stage aerobic tank of a swine wwtp in guangdong province the activated sludge was washed three times with deionized water to avoid interference of background values and then was diluted to 50 ml with the simulated wastewater the simulated wastewater contains nh4cl 0 19 g l nano2 0 246 g l mgso4 0 6 g l nahco3 2 628 g l kh2po4 0 02 g l and cacl2 0 2 g l different concentrations of disinfectants were added to each group according to the detection results of gds concentration in livestock wastewater tables s1 and s2 so that the initial concentrations of each group were 20 mg l 10 mg l 5 mg l 1 mg l 0 5 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 mg l the control respectively all conical flasks were incubated at 150 rpm in a shaker at 35 c for 48 h the water and biological samples were collected at 0 h 3 h 9 h and 24 h for testing and analysis the nitrogen and cod removal efficiency was used as an indicator of the stress effect of the disinfectant at various concentrations on the operation performance of activated sludge 2 3 determination of the effective concentration of disinfectants water samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was passed through a 0 22 μm millipore filter for subsequent analysis a total of 200 µl of water sample was mixed with 100 µl of 0 12 mmol 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine solution the mixture was incubated at 20 c for 30 min and the incubated solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm sterivex nylon filter chromatography experiments were performed using a triple stage quadrupole mass

negative ionization mode with an atomization gas flow of 50 psi a drying gas flow of 8 l min and a spray voltage of 4 5 kv 2 4 detection of reactive oxygen species ros and antioxidant enzymes in the experiment samples were collected at each time point for the detection of ros and antioxidant enzyme activities which were used to evaluate the response to each disinfectant at different concentrations intracellular ros production was measured by a ros detection kit containing h2dcf da han et al 2016 activated sludge samples were extracted from erlenmeyer flasks and resuspended in 0 154 mol l nacl solution briefly h2dcf da was added and the solution was incubated at 37 c for 60 min in the dark h2dcf da was intracellularly hydrolyzed into h2dcf and the extracellular residual probe was removed by centrifugation and washing after probe loading the samples were immediately measured in a flow cytometer flowsight merck usa at 488 nmex 530 nmem in addition a total superoxide dismutase sod assay kit nanjing jiancheng china and a catalase cat assay kit nanjing jiancheng china were used to detect the activities of the two antioxidant enzymes and a total protein quantitative assay kit nanjing jiancheng china was used to detect the protein content of the corresponding samples 2 5 electron transport system ets activity and atp assays ets activity was quantified according to the method reported by wang et al 2013 in addition the atp content was measured according to the instructions of the assay kit nanjing jiancheng china the sludge was first separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min the collected sludge was added to 300 500 µl of hot double distilled water and the mixture was placed in a hot water bath 90 100 c for homogenization and crushing afterwards the bacterial suspension was heated in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and removed for mixing and extraction for 1 minute finally the detection reagents were added and measured in a spectrophotometer 2 6 sample metatranscriptomics analysis sludge samples were collected from the experimental groups of compound disinfectants with four concentrations of 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l at time points 0 and 9 and the sludge rna was extracted using a soil rna mini kit r6825 01 omega usa then the residual dna was digested with the rnase free dnase ⅰset e1091 01 omega usa rna concentration and purity were quantified with microvolume uv vis spectrophotometers nanodrop one thermo scientific usa subsequently the rrna reads in the metatranscriptome were removed using sortmerna raw reads were filtered and trimmed using trimmomatic and then dehosted based on bowtie2 using kneaddata software the kraken2 microbial database was used to identify the species in the sample and then bracken was used to predict the relative abundance of the species in the sample humann2 software based on diamond was used to align the reads of each sample to the database its purpose is to efficiently and accurately profile the abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data starting from the clean reads with host genes removed fmap software was used for quality control and annotation of each sample by comparing the reads without host genes with the antibiotic resistance gene database card to obtain the abundance distribution of resistance genes 2 7 analytical methods cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined according to the national standard methods ceph 2002 concentration of gds in livestock wastewater detected by lc ms tsq endura thermo fisher usa cao et al 2014 menet et al 1997 the functional group fractions of sludge samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa wang et al 2021a 3 results 3 1 impact of gd on conventional nitrogen removal processes the removal efficiencies of total nitrogen tn and cod were used as indicators of the effects on activated sludge performance under the stress of disinfectants with different concentrations as shown in fig 1 a after 3 h of gd exposure microbial activity was gradually inhibited and the residual concentration of total nitrogen in the high concentration group with gd concentrations greater than 1 mg l was 30 40 mg l higher than that in the control group as the experiment proceeded to the 9th hour the inhibition effect intensified and the difference in the concentration of total nitrogen among the groups became significant the residual concentration of tn in the high concentration group was 60 of the initial concentration which was 60 70 mg l higher than that in the control group however the residual cod concentration was only 16 of the initial concentration after 9 h of stress at 20 mg l gd the results showed that the effect of gd on cod removal was weaker than that on tn to clarify the specific denitrification process mainly inhibited by the reduced denitrification efficiency the experiment was conducted to assess the degree of inhibition of each denitrification process by comparing the residual concentration ratios of ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen between each experimental group and the control group the experimental results showed that the ammonia oxidation process was inhibited first showing a significant increase in the ratio of ammonia nitrogen accumulation when gd stress was applied for 3 h while nitrite and nitrate showed significant accumulation only after 9 h thus the order of inhibition of denitrification processes was consistent with the traditional nitrogen cycle process of ammonia oxidation nitrosation denitrification notably the inhibition of nitrosation was most obvious throughout the denitrification process especially after 9 h of gd stress at 5 mg l and nitrite accumulation was approximately 30 fold higher than that of the control which may be a key step limiting the rate of total nitrogen removal unlike the pattern observed for the ammonia oxidation and nitrosation processes the experimental group exhibited lower residual nitrate nitrogen concentrations than the control group within three hours of 1 mg l gd stress indicating that denitrifying microorganisms have strong gd adaptability and can respond within a short period of time 3 2 effect of gd stress on atp and ets activity as two key indicators of the activity of denitrifying microorganisms the atp and ets of sludge samples are shown in fig 2 both ets and atp decreased in all experimental groups and had dose effect relationships with the gd stress concentration indicating that disinfectants at high concentrations inhibited the metabolic activity of sludge microorganisms moreover microorganisms do not directly convert organic matter into energy to support nitrogen metabolic processes when exposed to disinfectants at high concentrations notably the atp content was 4 fold higher than that of the control and the ets activity approached a maximum of 76 2 mg g h when the sludge was stressed by gd at the original concentration of 1 mg l for 9 hours meanwhile the associated nitrate removal was optimal with the remaining nitrate concentration 0 75 times that of the control group these results suggested that physiological processes such as nitrogen metabolism could be accelerated by increasing the atp content and electron transfer activity of sludge microorganisms under low concentration of gd stress 3 3 effect of gd on ros and the antioxidant enzymes sod cat compared with the control group the experimental group showed a significant increase in both reactive oxygen species ros and antioxidant enzyme activities under disinfectant stress fig 3 a sludge microorganisms induced excessive production of ros when exposed to the disinfectant gd and started to increase reactive oxygen hydrolases such as sod cat to decrease cell damage induced by ros amariei et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhang and chen 2020 the ros level strongly increased with the disinfectant concentration but the enzymatic activities of sod and cat did not show the same trend sod was very sensitive to gd stress and the sensitivity decreased with increasing gd concentration the sensitivity of cat first increased and then decreased with increasing gd concentration unlike the sod enzyme the cat enzyme still showed higher activity under high concentrations of disinfectant stress it could be inferred that the front end sod enzyme is unable to efficiently convert o2 to h2o2 under significant inhibition from high concentrations of disinfectant thus reducing the inhibitory effect of h2o2 on cat enzyme combining the experimental results for the cat enzyme and sod enzyme it was found that their activities were relatively high under disinfectant addition at 1 mg l with cat enzyme activity reaching its maximum under this condition combined with the results of previous water quality tests in session 3 1 these results showed that under the oxidative stress generated by a low concentration of disinfectant microorganisms could gradually adapt to the stress within 9 hours and the functional effects could be recovered relatively quickly however with a gd concentration higher than 1 mg l the microorganisms were unable to overcome the toxic effects of increasing ros because of the reduced capacity of antioxidant enzymes produced by the stress and the sludge activity and its function were significantly inhibited 3 4 changes in the microbial community with gd stress the response mechanisms of microorganisms under different concentrations of disinfectant stress could be explored according to the differences in community structure among different samples there were five main phyla in the microbial communities of all samples namely proteobacteria firmicutes nitrospirae euryarchaeota and actinobacteria fig 4 a the abundance levels changed for all phyla after disinfectant addition the relative abundances of the phylum proteobacteria and the phylum nitrospira showed a downward trend with increasing gd concentration most of the nitrogen removing bacteria in the wastewater treatment system belonged to these two phyla the results indicated that disinfectants had a certain inhibitory effect on nitrogen removing bacteria which is consistent with the water quality test results in session 3 1 to further explore the specific gd tolerant microbial species the species level abundance results fig 4b indicated that the microbial community of sludge was dominated by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas communis nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrospira defluvii and denitrification bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri thauera aminoaromatica thauera sp mzit thauera humireducens thauera sp k11 thauera terpenica the results showed that both aob and nob n europaea n communis n defluvii showed different degrees of abundance decreases which is consistent with the previous water quality test in which the nitrification process was severely lagged on the contrary denitrification bacteria showed good tolerance to both high and low concentrations of gd stress where strong disinfectant tolerance made p stutzeri the main dominant species while with the disinfectant concentration decreasing the t aminoaromatica thauera sp mzit t humireducens thauera sp k11 t terpenica gradually became the dominant bacteria in the activated sludge the strong adaptability of both types of denitrifying bacteria to different concentrations of gd is the main reason why the denitrification efficiency is less affected by gd 3 5 effect of different concentrations of gd on gene expression and enzymatic activity differential expression of genes by different bacteria in response to environmental changes is an important factor affecting the evolution of microbial communities meyer et al 2004 swingley et al 2007 to further investigate the effects of disinfectant stress on microbial gene transcription levels and enzyme activities nitrogen cycle genes resistance genes efflux pump genes membrane permeability genes enzyme modification genes and hydrolase genes and genes related to sugar metabolism and electron transfer were selected to observe their differences in expression before and after gd stress the results showed fig s3 that when the gd concentration increased to 10 mg l the expression of most of the resistance genes and their related enzyme activities were downregulated and some resistance genes showed disordered expression e g lamb oprb a pore protein gene responsible for the transmembrane transport of disinfectants was significantly upregulated meanwhile sugar metabolism genes and nitrogen metabolism genes and their related enzyme activities also showed different degrees of downregulation and only nitrogen assimilation genes were significantly upregulated this process was mainly dominated by p stutzeri fig s8 therefore we suggest that excessive gd concentration stress inhibits sugar metabolism and nitrogen conversion processes and reduces the expression of resistance genes thus resulting in reduced microbial activity and abundance only denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri maintained bacterial growth by upregulating nitrogen assimilation genes which is consistent with the higher abundance of pseudomonas spp fig 4 compared to 10 mg l disinfectant addition both 1 mg l and 0 1 mg l disinfectant stress induced upregulation of key genes involved in gluconeogenesis isocitrate dehydrogenase gene icd pyruvate kinase pyk and phosphoglycerate kinase glxk while key genes involved in electron transport e1 6 99 3 petb coq7 also showed higher expression in particular denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri t phenylacetica and t aminoaromatica showed elevated activities of the corresponding functional enzymes of sugar metabolism and electron transfer energy processes during low concentration gd stress fig s8 the results suggested that low concentration gd stress could induce energy metabolism and electron transfer in tolerant microorganisms in addition low concentrations of gd induced the upregulation of expression of most resistance genes which was dominated by resistance genes that require the hydrolysis of atp for energy support abc transporter family macb efrb membrane permeation genes lptg lptd lptc lptf lptb and modifier enzyme genes aac 6 in9 ant 3 ia in contrast all the genes involved in the nitrogen cycle except denitrification related genes napa nirk cnorb nosz showed different degrees of downregulation and the denitrification functional enzymes also showed the same trend which coincided with the water quality test results this suggests that denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri t phenylacetica and t aminoaromatica may accelerate the utilization of substrates and energy metabolism in water under stress from a low concentration of gd the effect of disinfectants on microorganisms was reduced through toxin efflux hydrolysis and membrane structure adjustment in contrast the inhibition of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob functional gene expression and enzyme activity explains the delay of ammonia oxidation and nitrosation in the experimental group in the first 9 hours of disinfectant addition compared with the control group surprisingly the expression levels of common quaternary genes suge emre ydge qaca qace etc tong et al 2021 and glutaraldehyde genes yqhd lptd huang et al 2019 vikram et al 2015 were relatively low and only the plasmid mediated quaternary efflux pump gene qach was significantly upregulated instead there was significant expression and upregulation of antibiotic resistance genes which were mainly aminoglycosides tetracyclines and multidrug efflux pump genes in contrast no antibiotics were added during the experiments so it could be speculated that the commonality of modes of action between disinfectants and antibiotics leads to the selection of mutants thus changing the action site of the drug and generating cross resistance 3 6 regulation of denitrification under low concentration gd stress our results above demonstrated that low concentration gd stress can induce more atp production by microorganisms atp serves as a central station for energy transfer and the energy generated from the oxidative breakdown of substrates can be used for the synthesis of cellular components and other life activities including the response mechanism of microorganisms under disinfectant stress deng and walther 2020 therefore to further understand the relationships between energy metabolism denitrification and disinfectant resistance experiments were conducted to assess the correlations between energy metabolic factors such as atp ets and the expression of functional genes and their enzymatic activities by rda and heatmap analysis the heatmap results fig 5 a indicated that atp ets showed a strong positive correlation with sod cat enzyme activity and its enzyme synthesis regulatory genes katg oxyr denitrification genes narh napa norb and resistance genes aac 6 ib9 aada6 qach ermx in addition denitrification genes were positively correlated with sugar metabolism genes eno sdhc kora sdhd and resistance genes these results further validate that under disinfectant stress the more tolerant denitrifying bacteria among sludge microorganisms can use the atp produced by respiration to synthesize more oxidative stress enzymes and reduce the effect of ros produced under microbial stress on bacteria thus ensuring the stability of processes such as nitrogen metabolism in the subsequent rda results fig 5b we also found positive correlations between atp and sod cat enzymes and it is worth noting that the microorganisms that had a greater correlation with these three factors were denitrifying bacteria mainly thauera paracoccus zobellella zoarcus combined with the results of transcript levels of key genes these findings further confirmed that the main gd resistant bacteria among the sludge microorganisms were p stutzeri t phenylacetica and t aminoaromatica these denitrifying bacteria accelerate the consumption of substrate and energy production to synthesize a large number of antioxidant enzymes to enhance their adaptation to disinfectant contaminated environments 3 7 effect of gd stress on the distribution of resistance genes among sludge microorganisms the expression of resistance genes is crucial for microorganisms to show resistance martinez et al 2015 and differences in the type of resistance genes contained in activated sludge and the expression level of each microorganism make them tolerant to gd to various degrees to further reveal the relationship between the distribution of resistance genes and functional microbial communities network analysis was conducted to investigate the differences in co occurrence patterns between resistance genes and microbial genera at two time points although statistically significant positive correlations between microorganisms and specific args cannot be considered direct evidence that microorganisms carry resistance they can reveal the potential host bacteria for resistance genes sun et al 2020 only some of the membrane permeation genes oprb omp38 lpta and efflux pump genes mexk mexw pmpm were positively correlated with genera at 0 h fig s6 this indicates that the response of sludge microorganisms to disinfectants is to preferentially regulate the expression of membrane permeability genes and change the cell membrane structure by increasing the expression of efflux pump genes on the membrane with the passage of time the positive correlations between various types of resistance genes and microorganisms increased significantly at 9 hours the expression of each resistance gene was gradually induced during this process to better evaluate changes in the correlation of functional microorganisms and each resistance gene at the two time points the correlation results were presented using a heatmap as shown in fig s7 rubrivivax was positively correlated with most of the resistance genes at 0 hour therefore it is presumed that rubrivivax was one of the potential major hosts of resistance genes in our experimental results the lptd omp38 ompa f slp msre ermx aada6 aada16 aac 6 ib cr ant 3 iic efpa macb carried by rubrivivax all switched from a negative to a positive correlation in other bacteria after 9 hours of exposure to disinfectant this is in agreement with the previous result in which rubrivivax was found to be the major resistant genus in wastewater treatment systems after long term exposure to antibiotics such as tetracycline and sulfonamide this genus carries the integrin intl1 which plays an important role in the vertical and horizontal migration of resistance genes du et al 2019b this indicates that all of the above genes may be inducibly expressed or horizontally transferred under disinfectant stress among them aada6 ermx aada16 aac 6 ib cr ant 3 iic which are hosted plasmids and transposons were more likely to be transferred in addition denitrifying microorganisms such as thauera pseudomonas azoarcus thioalkalicibrio and sulfur oxidizing bacteria all showed a significant increase in correlation with resistance genes after exposure to disinfectants this implies that such sensitive bacteria can induce expression of or receive resistance genes from the environment quickly under stress from disinfectants and develop resistance 4 discussion the outbreak and spread of afs in livestock and poultry farming cadena et al 2019 has led to a dramatic increase in the use of disinfectants to prevent virus transmission and control the pandemics zhang et al 2022 little is known about the impact of residual veterinary disinfectants on the front end biochemical treatment process of wwtps in the present study it was found that gd stress could reduce the performance of nitrogen and carbon removal by inhibiting the energy metabolism and functional enzyme activity of sludge microorganisms under the stress of low concentrations of gd and denitrifying bacteria could show stronger tolerance by accelerating energy metabolism and the expression of aminoglycoside resistance genes than aob and nob fig 6 however the induced expression and horizontal transfer of a large number of mobile resistance genes also made denitrifying bacteria a potential source of risk 4 1 the strong adaptability of denitrifying bacteria such as p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica is a key factor in stabilizing denitrification rates in this study we found that after 9 hours of gd stress the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the experimental group decreased significantly ammonia and nitrite removal were severely inhibited and the accumulation rate of nitrite was 30 higher than the control a similar phenomenon was observed in previous studies in which strong inhibition of nob was found after exposure to antibiotics such as tetracycline roxithromycin and fluoroquinolones shi et al 2021 song et al 2015 yu et al 2014 this might be related to the fact that ammonia oxidase amo hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nor which are distributed in the periplasm are more susceptible to attack by disinfectants or antibiotics cui et al 2020 du et al 2019a in addition nitrosomonas nitrospira and other nitrifying bacteria are autotrophic microorganisms slow growth rates result in slow recovery and decreased relative abundance after disinfectant inhibition as a result there is a lag between nitrite and nitrate removal during water quality testing fig 1 notably denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica were more tolerant than aob and nob to gd stress under high gd stress p stutzeri could enhance microbial cell synthesis by upregulating cyns ureb urec nitrogen assimilation genes thus improving adaptation in unfavorable environments in addition response mechanisms such as accelerated energy metabolism and upregulation of resistance gene expression also made denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica the dominant group of sludge microorganisms under low concentration gd stress meanwhile the upregulation of denitrification genes such as napa nosz norb and the active expression of denitrifying enzymes made denitrification more stable during gd stress 4 2 enhanced nitrate assimilation and coexpression of aminoglycoside resistance genes might be the main resistance mechanisms in gd tolerant bacteria when faced with an adverse environment microorganisms respond specifically to environmental changes and drive changes in microbial community structure and diversity logue et al 2015 which in turn alters the microbial community function to clarify the reasons for the changes in abundance differences between aob nob and denitrifying bacteria the response mechanisms of sludge microorganisms under different gd concentration stresses were explored by performing several assays including energy metabolism indicators antioxidant enzyme activities and macrotranscriptome sequencing first we found that after dosing with a high concentration of gd 10 mg l a large amount of glutaraldehyde could rapidly bind to microorganisms to form primary amides and accelerate protein alkylation fig s2 the resulting protein structure destruction was one of the important reasons for the inhibition of microbial activity in addition a high concentration of gd stress not only changes the bacterial protein structure but also induces microorganisms to produce excessive ros to damage dna rna proteins and lipids logue et al 2015 decreases the rate of microbial energy metabolism fig 2 disrupts the expression of pore protein genes lamb oprb fig s3 and eventually inhibits or inactivates microbial activity the most intuitive manifestation of the inhibition of sludge microorganisms is a reduction in denitrification efficiency and ammonia oxidation nitrification and denitrification processes are inhibited to different degrees it is worth noting that denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri can quickly respond to the oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species brought about by high gd stress fig s8f in addition p stutzeri with cation efflux and cell wall synthesis increased its resistance to gd in addition pseudomonas a common aerobic denitrifying genus in wwtps can not only reduce nitrate to nitrogen under aerobic conditions but also assimilate nitrate to intracellular nitrogen for cellular material synthesis lalucat et al 2006 in contrast the activities of aob and nob were severely inhibited by gd with high concentrations while some heterotrophic denitrifies could grow up rapidly by the aerobic oxidation of substrates such as p stutzeri in the presence of sufficient oxygen denitrifying microorganisms stimulate carbon metabolism to rapidly consume oxygen and use nitrate for assimilation yuan et al 2021 therefore even with stressed by high concentration gd p stutzeri still could assimilate nitrate nitrogen to intracellular nitrogen efficiently and increase its environmental adaptation capability by activating the mechanisms of the efflux pump and cell wall synthesis unlike the effects of high stress concentrations microorganisms produced only a small amount of ros 1 2 times that in the control when the gd concentration was no more than 1 mg l instead of inhibiting microbial activity small amounts of ros promoted dna damage and activated error prone reactive oxygen radical sos scavenging reactions chen et al 2015 leading to an increase in mutants or induction of the superoxide disputation reaction soxrs system at subinhibitory concentrations fu et al 2018 experimental results suggested that this system not only activated antioxidant defense systems to prevent oxidative stress damage leading to the upregulation of genes involved in encoding antioxidant enzymes katg sod1 sod2 ahpc ahpf but also induced the overexpression of resistance genes e g efflux pump genes mexb efrb smr qach membrane permeability genes oprb slp lpta lptc pmrf mcr 5 enzyme modification genes teto tetm ant 3 ia ant 3 iic tem 116 and hydrolase genes rphb mpha erea2 ermx etc interestingly although most of the sludge microorganisms began to cope with the negative effects by activating defense systems under low concentrations of gd denitrifying bacteria still dominated the microbial community which may be related to the distribution of resistance genes in bacteria it was found that denitrifying microorganisms p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica were susceptible to acquiring or inducing the expression of multiple antibiotic resistance genes from the environment during gd stress aminoglycoside photransferases aph aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases ant and aminoglycoside acetyltransferases aac modifying enzyme genes were the predominant antibiotic resistance genes which belong to aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance genes fig s8 aminoglycoside antibiotics are cationic antibiotics with a mechanism of action similar to that of gd which can cause synthetic protein mistranslation by altering bacterial outer membrane permeability to enter the cytosol and interact with the ribosome short et al 2021 despite the absence of additional antibiotic dosing in this study denitrifying microorganisms could still exhibit cross resistance by expressing multiple antibiotic resistance genes mainly aminoglycoside resistance genes indicating that microorganisms can be induced to exhibit cross resistance via similar bactericidal mechanisms 4 3 impact of gd on public health and environmental risk management the toxicological risks posed by wwtps as a sink and source of antibiotic resistance genes to the ecological environment have been of great concern michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 gd exposure induced microorganisms to exhibit cross resistance in particular a variety of resistance genes carried by plasmids or transposons showed significant upregulation under low exposure with aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance genes aac 6 iic aac 6 ⅰb9 aac 6 ⅰb cr aada10 aada5 aada6 and aada13 being predominant fig s7 it has been shown that aminoglycoside resistance genes as one of several common and abundant classes of resistance genes in sewage are found in various genetic backgrounds including small nonconjugative plasmids ramirez et al 2013 because of the similar bactericidal mechanism of gd and aminoglycoside antibiotics this may make the aminoglycoside resistance genes more abundant and easier to translocate under gd stress the results of our study confirmed this suspicion as a large number of aminoglycoside resistance genes migrated horizontally from the potential host rubrivivax to several sensitive receptor bacteria after 9 h of 1 mg l gd stress fig s7 with denitrifying microorganisms such as thauera pseudomonas azoarcus thioalkalicibrio being dominant this further explains why denitrifying bacteria were the dominant bacteria during gd stress therefore wastewater treatment plants serve as a sink and source of antibiotic resistance genes it is necessary to consider the residual disinfectants flowing into the wastewater treatment system as a potential risk source for resistance gene migration transformation in environment it is worth noting that not all concentration of disinfectants drove the migration of antibiotic resistance genes among microorganisms the expression levels of resistance genes were at same level as the control fig s3 when the gd was 0 1 mg l therefore pretreatment of the disinfection rinse water using physical adsorption or advanced oxidation techniques such as fenton like controlling the concentration of residual disinfectant flowing into the wastewater treatment system to less than 0 1 mg l as much as possible might be an effective way to reduce the risk 5 conclusion residual disinfectant was demonstrated as a potential disturbance factor that drove the changes in microbial community structure and enriched certain functional microorganisms e g denitrifiers in activated sludge correlation based macro genome sequencing results showed that the denitrifying bacteria dominated by p stutzeri t aminoaromatica thauera sp mzit t humireducens thauera sp k11 and t terpenica showed strong adaptability under different concentrations of gd stress which facilitated stable denitrification and carbon removal in the wastewater treatment system respectively however highly tolerant denitrifying bacteria also increased the relative abundance of aminoglycoside based resistance genes especially when concentration were as low as around 1 mg l this undoubtedly improving the risk of horizontal transfer of resistance genes among activated sludge microorganisms therefore we should pay attention to this issue and consciously assess the possible ecological consequences associated with the discharge of gd disinfectants into the environment during virus abatement declaration of competing interest

15318,glutaraldehyde and didecyldimethylammonium bromide gd is a disinfectant widely used to prevent african swine fever asf in livestock farms however the effect of residual gd on the activated sludge microbial ecology of receiving wastewater treatment plants wwtps remains largely unknown in this study seven simulated systems were established to research the effects of gd on wwtps and reveal the underlying mechanisms of microecological responses to gd at different concentrations both the nitrogen and carbon removal rates decreased with increasing gd concentrations and nitrogen metabolism was inhibited more obviously but the inhibition weakened with increasing stress duration microorganisms activated their soxrs systems to promote atp synthesis and electron transfer to support the hydrolysis and efflux of gd by producing a small number of ros when exposed to gd at less than 1 mg l the overproduction of ros led to a decrease of antioxidant and nitrogen removal enzyme activities and upregulation of the porin gene increased the risk of gd entering the intracellular space upon exposure to gd at concentrations higher than 1 mg l some denitrifiers survived via resistance and their basic capabilities of sugar metabolism and nitrogen assimilation notably low concentrations of disinfectants could promote vertical and horizontal transfer of multiple resistance genes especially aminoglycosides among microorganisms which might increase not only the adaptation capability of denitrifiers but also the risk to ecological systems therefore the risks of disinfectants targeting asf on ecology and health as well as the effects of disinfectant residuals from the covid 19 epidemic should receive more attention keywords glutaraldehyde and didecyldimethylammonium bromide disinfectant microecological response mechanism nitrogen metabolism resistance genes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years china s livestock industry has greatly developed to meet the continuous expansion of market demand and the livestock and poultry production mode has changed from scattered and small scale farming to large scale standardized and industrialized farming li et al 2020 however since 2018 african swine fever asf has spread in most provinces and cities across china there is still no effective vaccine standardized disinfection measures are considered the most effective and convenient means to prevent asf and efficient and cost effective disinfectants have become the first choice for large scale plant breeding tong et al 2021 at present the disinfectants commonly used in breeding production to prevent epidemics include sodium hydroxide quicklime sodium hypochlorite and quaternary ammonium salts gosling et al 2017 maertens et al 2020 as a new compound disinfectant glutaraldehyde didecyldimethylammonium bromide gd solution has the characteristics of quaternary ammonium salts in destroying cell membranes and disturbing ionic stability as well as the advantages of aldehyde disinfectants in changing the secondary structure of proteins therefore it is widely used in pig house environments and pool disinfection lin et al 2018 to deal with the normalized and complicated epidemics situation according to the production requirements besides daily disinfection to prevent from exotic invasion of virus great disinfection was generally conducted before a new production period and the residual disinfectants from production area converged into the wastewater treatment systems maertens et al 2019 which might affect the operation of the wastewater system and even be a bigger issue during serious outbreaks of african swine fever it had been reported that several type of daily cleaning agents e g savo domestos asanox clorox containing the disinfectants of sodium hypochlorite could reduce the cod removal efficiency of the receiving municipal sewage treatment facilities which might cause by the inhibition of the respiration rate and the functional enzyme activity of the activated sludge and excessive production of intracellular ros was also found in the sludge with expose to disinfectants bodik et al 2008 han et al 2016 the migration and spread of disinfectant or antibiotic resistance genes were also promoted by the daily disinfectants remained in municipal sewage treatment facilities eventually flowing to the environment and posing a serious threat to human health and ecosystem safety chacon et al 2021 therefore it is important and necessary to study the effects and mechanisms of different concentrations of gd exposure on artificial and natural ecosystems to accurately evaluate the effect of residual disinfectant gd on the construction and function of microbial communities and reveal its mechanism seven stimulated livestock wastewater treatment systems were established and the effect of gd disinfectant was studied in the present paper the effects of metabolism and the organic substances removal capability and its mechanisms on key functional genes and their expression levels bacterial community dynamics and the stress responses of ecological interaction networks were researched the results provide insight into the ecological risk of disinfectants and draw more attention to the rational use of disinfectants especially in the current environmental context of the prevalence of covid 19 and asf 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the two disinfectants didecyldimethylammonium bromide ddab 80 purity and glutaraldehyde ga 50 purity were purchased from mclean shanghai china and accustandard usa respectively hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from mclean shanghai china all other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade 2 2 establishment and operation of the stimulated aerobic reactors seven groups of stimulated aerobic reactors were established in the laboratory by adding 50 ml of activated sludge into each 100 ml container which was collected fetched from the one stage aerobic tank of a swine wwtp in guangdong province the activated sludge was washed three times with deionized water to avoid interference of background values and then was diluted to 50 ml with the simulated wastewater the simulated wastewater contains nh4cl 0 19 g l nano2 0 246 g l mgso4 0 6 g l nahco3 2 628 g l kh2po4 0 02 g l and cacl2 0 2 g l different concentrations of disinfectants were added to each group according to the detection results of gds concentration in livestock wastewater tables s1 and s2 so that the initial concentrations of each group were 20 mg l 10 mg l 5 mg l 1 mg l 0 5 mg l 0 1 mg l and 0 mg l the control respectively all conical flasks were incubated at 150 rpm in a shaker at 35 c for 48 h the water and biological samples were collected at 0 h 3 h 9 h and 24 h for testing and analysis the nitrogen and cod removal efficiency was used as an indicator of the stress effect of the disinfectant at various concentrations on the operation performance of activated sludge 2 3 determination of the effective concentration of disinfectants water samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was passed through a 0 22 μm millipore filter for subsequent analysis a total of 200 µl of water sample was mixed with 100 µl of 0 12 mmol 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine solution the mixture was incubated at 20 c for 30 min and the incubated solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm sterivex nylon filter chromatography experiments were performed using a triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer tsq endura thermo fisher usa the analytical column was a universil c18 with 3 μm particle size and 100 å pore size kromat usa mobile phase a consisted of 2 5 mmol ammonium acetate in water and mobile phase b was acetonitrile the flow rate was held constant at 500 μl min the column temperature was 40 c and the injection volume was 10 μl the mass spectrometer was used in esi negative ionization mode with an atomization gas flow of 50 psi a drying gas flow of 8 l min and a spray voltage of 4 5 kv 2 4 detection of reactive oxygen species ros and antioxidant enzymes in the experiment samples were collected at each time point for the detection of ros and antioxidant enzyme activities which were used to evaluate the response to each disinfectant at different concentrations intracellular ros production was measured by a ros detection kit containing h2dcf da han et al 2016 activated sludge samples were extracted from erlenmeyer flasks and resuspended in 0 154 mol l nacl solution briefly h2dcf da was added and the solution was incubated at 37 c for 60 min in the dark h2dcf da was intracellularly hydrolyzed into h2dcf and the extracellular residual probe was removed by centrifugation and washing after probe loading the samples were immediately measured in a flow cytometer flowsight merck usa at 488 nmex 530 nmem in addition a total superoxide dismutase sod assay kit nanjing jiancheng china and a catalase cat assay kit nanjing jiancheng china were used to detect the activities of the two antioxidant enzymes and a total protein quantitative assay kit nanjing jiancheng china was used to detect the protein content of the corresponding samples 2 5 electron transport system ets activity and atp assays ets activity was quantified according to the method reported by wang et al 2013 in addition the atp content was measured according to the instructions of the assay kit nanjing jiancheng china the sludge was first separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min the collected sludge was added to 300 500 µl of hot double distilled water and the mixture was placed in a hot water bath 90 100 c for homogenization and crushing afterwards the bacterial suspension was heated in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and removed for mixing and extraction for 1 minute finally the detection reagents were added and measured in a spectrophotometer 2 6 sample metatranscriptomics analysis sludge samples were collected from the experimental groups of compound disinfectants with four concentrations of 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l at time points 0 and 9 and the sludge rna was extracted using a soil rna mini kit r6825 01 omega usa then the residual dna was digested with the rnase free dnase ⅰset e1091 01 omega usa rna concentration and purity were quantified with microvolume uv vis spectrophotometers nanodrop one thermo scientific usa subsequently the rrna reads in the metatranscriptome were removed using sortmerna raw reads were filtered and trimmed using trimmomatic and then dehosted based on bowtie2 using kneaddata software the kraken2 microbial database was used to identify the species in the sample and then bracken was used to predict the relative abundance of the species in the sample humann2 software based on diamond was used to align the reads of each sample to the database its purpose is to efficiently and accurately profile the abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data starting from the clean reads with host genes removed fmap software was used for quality control and annotation of each sample by comparing the reads without host genes with the antibiotic resistance gene database card to obtain the abundance distribution of resistance genes 2 7 analytical methods cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined according to the national standard methods ceph 2002 concentration of gds in livestock wastewater detected by lc ms tsq endura thermo fisher usa cao et al 2014 menet et al 1997 the functional group fractions of sludge samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa wang et al 2021a 3 results 3 1 impact of gd on conventional nitrogen removal processes the removal efficiencies of total nitrogen tn and cod were used as indicators of the effects on activated sludge performance under the stress of disinfectants with different concentrations as shown in fig 1 a after 3 h of gd exposure microbial activity was gradually inhibited and the residual concentration of total nitrogen in the high concentration group with gd concentrations greater than 1 mg l was 30 40 mg l higher than that in the control group as the experiment proceeded to the 9th hour the inhibition effect intensified and the difference in the concentration of total nitrogen among the groups became significant the residual concentration of tn in the high concentration group was 60 of the initial concentration which was 60 70 mg l higher than that in the control group however the residual cod concentration was only 16 of the initial concentration after 9 h of stress at 20 mg l gd the results showed that the effect of gd on cod removal was weaker than that on tn to clarify the specific denitrification process mainly inhibited by the reduced denitrification efficiency the experiment was conducted to assess the degree of inhibition of each denitrification process by comparing the residual concentration ratios of ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen between each experimental group and the control group the experimental results showed that the ammonia oxidation process was inhibited first showing a significant increase in the ratio of ammonia nitrogen accumulation when gd stress was applied for 3 h while nitrite and nitrate showed significant accumulation only after 9 h thus the order of inhibition of denitrification processes was consistent with the traditional nitrogen cycle process of ammonia oxidation nitrosation denitrification notably the inhibition of nitrosation was most obvious throughout the denitrification process especially after 9 h of gd stress at 5 mg l and nitrite accumulation was approximately 30 fold higher than that of the control which may be a key step limiting the rate of total nitrogen removal unlike the pattern observed for the ammonia oxidation and nitrosation processes the experimental group exhibited lower residual nitrate nitrogen concentrations than the control group within three hours of 1 mg l gd stress indicating that denitrifying microorganisms have strong gd adaptability and can respond within a short period of time 3 2 effect of gd stress on atp and ets activity as two key indicators of the activity of denitrifying microorganisms the atp and ets of sludge samples are shown in fig 2 both ets and atp decreased in all experimental groups and had dose effect relationships with the gd stress concentration indicating that disinfectants at high concentrations inhibited the metabolic activity of sludge microorganisms moreover microorganisms do not directly convert organic matter into energy to support nitrogen metabolic processes when exposed to disinfectants at high concentrations notably the atp content was 4 fold higher than that of the control and the ets activity approached a maximum of 76 2 mg g h when the sludge was stressed by gd at the original concentration of 1 mg l for 9 hours meanwhile the associated nitrate removal was optimal with the remaining nitrate concentration 0 75 times that of the control group these results suggested that physiological processes such as nitrogen metabolism could be accelerated by increasing the atp content and electron transfer activity of sludge microorganisms under low concentration of gd stress 3 3 effect of gd on ros and the antioxidant enzymes sod cat compared with the control group the experimental group showed a significant increase in both reactive oxygen species ros and antioxidant enzyme activities under disinfectant stress fig 3 a sludge microorganisms induced excessive production of ros when exposed to the disinfectant gd and started to increase reactive oxygen hydrolases such as sod cat to decrease cell damage induced by ros amariei et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhang and chen 2020 the ros level strongly increased with the disinfectant concentration but the enzymatic activities of sod and cat did not show the same trend sod was very sensitive to gd stress and the sensitivity decreased with increasing gd concentration the sensitivity of cat first increased and then decreased with increasing gd concentration unlike the sod enzyme the cat enzyme still showed higher activity under high concentrations of disinfectant stress it could be inferred that the front end sod enzyme is unable to efficiently convert o2 to h2o2 under significant inhibition from high concentrations of disinfectant thus reducing the inhibitory effect of h2o2 on cat enzyme combining the experimental results for the cat enzyme and sod enzyme it was found that their activities were relatively high under disinfectant addition at 1 mg l with cat enzyme activity reaching its maximum under this condition combined with the results of previous water quality tests in session 3 1 these results showed that under the oxidative stress generated by a low concentration of disinfectant microorganisms could gradually adapt to the stress within 9 hours and the functional effects could be recovered relatively quickly however with a gd concentration higher than 1 mg l the microorganisms were unable to overcome the toxic effects of increasing ros because of the reduced capacity of antioxidant enzymes produced by the stress and the sludge activity and its function were significantly inhibited 3 4 changes in the microbial community with gd stress the response mechanisms of microorganisms under different concentrations of disinfectant stress could be explored according to the differences in community structure among different samples there were five main phyla in the microbial communities of all samples namely proteobacteria firmicutes nitrospirae euryarchaeota and actinobacteria fig 4 a the abundance levels changed for all phyla after disinfectant addition the relative abundances of the phylum proteobacteria and the phylum nitrospira showed a downward trend with increasing gd concentration most of the nitrogen removing bacteria in the wastewater treatment system belonged to these two phyla the results indicated that disinfectants had a certain inhibitory effect on nitrogen removing bacteria which is consistent with the water quality test results in session 3 1 to further explore the specific gd tolerant microbial species the species level abundance results fig 4b indicated that the microbial community of sludge was dominated by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas communis nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrospira defluvii and denitrification bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri thauera aminoaromatica thauera sp mzit thauera humireducens thauera sp k11 thauera terpenica the results showed that both aob and nob n europaea n communis n defluvii showed different degrees of abundance decreases which is consistent with the previous water quality test in which the nitrification process was severely lagged on the contrary denitrification bacteria showed good tolerance to both high and low concentrations of gd stress where strong disinfectant tolerance made p stutzeri the main dominant species while with the disinfectant concentration decreasing the t aminoaromatica thauera sp mzit t humireducens thauera sp k11 t terpenica gradually became the dominant bacteria in the activated sludge the strong adaptability of both types of denitrifying bacteria to different concentrations of gd is the main reason why the denitrification efficiency is less affected by gd 3 5 effect of different concentrations of gd on gene expression and enzymatic activity differential expression of genes by different bacteria in response to environmental changes is an important factor affecting the evolution of microbial communities meyer et al 2004 swingley et al 2007 to further investigate the effects of disinfectant stress on microbial gene transcription levels and enzyme activities nitrogen cycle genes resistance genes efflux pump genes membrane permeability genes enzyme modification genes and hydrolase genes and genes related to sugar metabolism and electron transfer were selected to observe their differences in expression before and after gd stress the results showed fig s3 that when the gd concentration increased to 10 mg l the expression of most of the resistance genes and their related enzyme activities were downregulated and some resistance genes showed disordered expression e g lamb oprb a pore protein gene responsible for the transmembrane transport of disinfectants was significantly upregulated meanwhile sugar metabolism genes and nitrogen metabolism genes and their related enzyme activities also showed different degrees of downregulation and only nitrogen assimilation genes were significantly upregulated this process was mainly dominated by p stutzeri fig s8 therefore we suggest that excessive gd concentration stress inhibits sugar metabolism and nitrogen conversion processes and reduces the expression of resistance genes thus resulting in reduced microbial activity and abundance only denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri maintained bacterial growth by upregulating nitrogen assimilation genes which is consistent with the higher abundance of pseudomonas spp fig 4 compared to 10 mg l disinfectant addition both 1 mg l and 0 1 mg l disinfectant stress induced upregulation of key genes involved in gluconeogenesis isocitrate dehydrogenase gene icd pyruvate kinase pyk and phosphoglycerate kinase glxk while key genes involved in electron transport e1 6 99 3 petb coq7 also showed higher expression in particular denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri t phenylacetica and t aminoaromatica showed elevated activities of the corresponding functional enzymes of sugar metabolism and electron transfer energy processes during low concentration gd stress fig s8 the results suggested that low concentration gd stress could induce energy metabolism and electron transfer in tolerant microorganisms in addition low concentrations of gd induced the upregulation of expression of most resistance genes which was dominated by resistance genes that require the hydrolysis of atp for energy support abc transporter family macb efrb membrane permeation genes lptg lptd lptc lptf lptb and modifier enzyme genes aac 6 in9 ant 3 ia in contrast all the genes involved in the nitrogen cycle except denitrification related genes napa nirk cnorb nosz showed different degrees of downregulation and the denitrification functional enzymes also showed the same trend which coincided with the water quality test results this suggests that denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri t phenylacetica and t aminoaromatica may accelerate the utilization of substrates and energy metabolism in water under stress from a low concentration of gd the effect of disinfectants on microorganisms was reduced through toxin efflux hydrolysis and membrane structure adjustment in contrast the inhibition of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob functional gene expression and enzyme activity explains the delay of ammonia oxidation and nitrosation in the experimental group in the first 9 hours of disinfectant addition compared with the control group surprisingly the expression levels of common quaternary genes suge emre ydge qaca qace etc tong et al 2021 and glutaraldehyde genes yqhd lptd huang et al 2019 vikram et al 2015 were relatively low and only the plasmid mediated quaternary efflux pump gene qach was significantly upregulated instead there was significant expression and upregulation of antibiotic resistance genes which were mainly aminoglycosides tetracyclines and multidrug efflux pump genes in contrast no antibiotics were added during the experiments so it could be speculated that the commonality of modes of action between disinfectants and antibiotics leads to the selection of mutants thus changing the action site of the drug and generating cross resistance 3 6 regulation of denitrification under low concentration gd stress our results above demonstrated that low concentration gd stress can induce more atp production by microorganisms atp serves as a central station for energy transfer and the energy generated from the oxidative breakdown of substrates can be used for the synthesis of cellular components and other life activities including the response mechanism of microorganisms under disinfectant stress deng and walther 2020 therefore to further understand the relationships between energy metabolism denitrification and disinfectant resistance experiments were conducted to assess the correlations between energy metabolic factors such as atp ets and the expression of functional genes and their enzymatic activities by rda and heatmap analysis the heatmap results fig 5 a indicated that atp ets showed a strong positive correlation with sod cat enzyme activity and its enzyme synthesis regulatory genes katg oxyr denitrification genes narh napa norb and resistance genes aac 6 ib9 aada6 qach ermx in addition denitrification genes were positively correlated with sugar metabolism genes eno sdhc kora sdhd and resistance genes these results further validate that under disinfectant stress the more tolerant denitrifying bacteria among sludge microorganisms can use the atp produced by respiration to synthesize more oxidative stress enzymes and reduce the effect of ros produced under microbial stress on bacteria thus ensuring the stability of processes such as nitrogen metabolism in the subsequent rda results fig 5b we also found positive correlations between atp and sod cat enzymes and it is worth noting that the microorganisms that had a greater correlation with these three factors were denitrifying bacteria mainly thauera paracoccus zobellella zoarcus combined with the results of transcript levels of key genes these findings further confirmed that the main gd resistant bacteria among the sludge microorganisms were p stutzeri t phenylacetica and t aminoaromatica these denitrifying bacteria accelerate the consumption of substrate and energy production to synthesize a large number of antioxidant enzymes to enhance their adaptation to disinfectant contaminated environments 3 7 effect of gd stress on the distribution of resistance genes among sludge microorganisms the expression of resistance genes is crucial for microorganisms to show resistance martinez et al 2015 and differences in the type of resistance genes contained in activated sludge and the expression level of each microorganism make them tolerant to gd to various degrees to further reveal the relationship between the distribution of resistance genes and functional microbial communities network analysis was conducted to investigate the differences in co occurrence patterns between resistance genes and microbial genera at two time points although statistically significant positive correlations between microorganisms and specific args cannot be considered direct evidence that microorganisms carry resistance they can reveal the potential host bacteria for resistance genes sun et al 2020 only some of the membrane permeation genes oprb omp38 lpta and efflux pump genes mexk mexw pmpm were positively correlated with genera at 0 h fig s6 this indicates that the response of sludge microorganisms to disinfectants is to preferentially regulate the expression of membrane permeability genes and change the cell membrane structure by increasing the expression of efflux pump genes on the membrane with the passage of time the positive correlations between various types of resistance genes and microorganisms increased significantly at 9 hours the expression of each resistance gene was gradually induced during this process to better evaluate changes in the correlation of functional microorganisms and each resistance gene at the two time points the correlation results were presented using a heatmap as shown in fig s7 rubrivivax was positively correlated with most of the resistance genes at 0 hour therefore it is presumed that rubrivivax was one of the potential major hosts of resistance genes in our experimental results the lptd omp38 ompa f slp msre ermx aada6 aada16 aac 6 ib cr ant 3 iic efpa macb carried by rubrivivax all switched from a negative to a positive correlation in other bacteria after 9 hours of exposure to disinfectant this is in agreement with the previous result in which rubrivivax was found to be the major resistant genus in wastewater treatment systems after long term exposure to antibiotics such as tetracycline and sulfonamide this genus carries the integrin intl1 which plays an important role in the vertical and horizontal migration of resistance genes du et al 2019b this indicates that all of the above genes may be inducibly expressed or horizontally transferred under disinfectant stress among them aada6 ermx aada16 aac 6 ib cr ant 3 iic which are hosted plasmids and transposons were more likely to be transferred in addition denitrifying microorganisms such as thauera pseudomonas azoarcus thioalkalicibrio and sulfur oxidizing bacteria all showed a significant increase in correlation with resistance genes after exposure to disinfectants this implies that such sensitive bacteria can induce expression of or receive resistance genes from the environment quickly under stress from disinfectants and develop resistance 4 discussion the outbreak and spread of afs in livestock and poultry farming cadena et al 2019 has led to a dramatic increase in the use of disinfectants to prevent virus transmission and control the pandemics zhang et al 2022 little is known about the impact of residual veterinary disinfectants on the front end biochemical treatment process of wwtps in the present study it was found that gd stress could reduce the performance of nitrogen and carbon removal by inhibiting the energy metabolism and functional enzyme activity of sludge microorganisms under the stress of low concentrations of gd and denitrifying bacteria could show stronger tolerance by accelerating energy metabolism and the expression of aminoglycoside resistance genes than aob and nob fig 6 however the induced expression and horizontal transfer of a large number of mobile resistance genes also made denitrifying bacteria a potential source of risk 4 1 the strong adaptability of denitrifying bacteria such as p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica is a key factor in stabilizing denitrification rates in this study we found that after 9 hours of gd stress the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in the experimental group decreased significantly ammonia and nitrite removal were severely inhibited and the accumulation rate of nitrite was 30 higher than the control a similar phenomenon was observed in previous studies in which strong inhibition of nob was found after exposure to antibiotics such as tetracycline roxithromycin and fluoroquinolones shi et al 2021 song et al 2015 yu et al 2014 this might be related to the fact that ammonia oxidase amo hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nor which are distributed in the periplasm are more susceptible to attack by disinfectants or antibiotics cui et al 2020 du et al 2019a in addition nitrosomonas nitrospira and other nitrifying bacteria are autotrophic microorganisms slow growth rates result in slow recovery and decreased relative abundance after disinfectant inhibition as a result there is a lag between nitrite and nitrate removal during water quality testing fig 1 notably denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica were more tolerant than aob and nob to gd stress under high gd stress p stutzeri could enhance microbial cell synthesis by upregulating cyns ureb urec nitrogen assimilation genes thus improving adaptation in unfavorable environments in addition response mechanisms such as accelerated energy metabolism and upregulation of resistance gene expression also made denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica the dominant group of sludge microorganisms under low concentration gd stress meanwhile the upregulation of denitrification genes such as napa nosz norb and the active expression of denitrifying enzymes made denitrification more stable during gd stress 4 2 enhanced nitrate assimilation and coexpression of aminoglycoside resistance genes might be the main resistance mechanisms in gd tolerant bacteria when faced with an adverse environment microorganisms respond specifically to environmental changes and drive changes in microbial community structure and diversity logue et al 2015 which in turn alters the microbial community function to clarify the reasons for the changes in abundance differences between aob nob and denitrifying bacteria the response mechanisms of sludge microorganisms under different gd concentration stresses were explored by performing several assays including energy metabolism indicators antioxidant enzyme activities and macrotranscriptome sequencing first we found that after dosing with a high concentration of gd 10 mg l a large amount of glutaraldehyde could rapidly bind to microorganisms to form primary amides and accelerate protein alkylation fig s2 the resulting protein structure destruction was one of the important reasons for the inhibition of microbial activity in addition a high concentration of gd stress not only changes the bacterial protein structure but also induces microorganisms to produce excessive ros to damage dna rna proteins and lipids logue et al 2015 decreases the rate of microbial energy metabolism fig 2 disrupts the expression of pore protein genes lamb oprb fig s3 and eventually inhibits or inactivates microbial activity the most intuitive manifestation of the inhibition of sludge microorganisms is a reduction in denitrification efficiency and ammonia oxidation nitrification and denitrification processes are inhibited to different degrees it is worth noting that denitrifying bacteria mainly p stutzeri can quickly respond to the oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species brought about by high gd stress fig s8f in addition p stutzeri with cation efflux and cell wall synthesis increased its resistance to gd in addition pseudomonas a common aerobic denitrifying genus in wwtps can not only reduce nitrate to nitrogen under aerobic conditions but also assimilate nitrate to intracellular nitrogen for cellular material synthesis lalucat et al 2006 in contrast the activities of aob and nob were severely inhibited by gd with high concentrations while some heterotrophic denitrifies could grow up rapidly by the aerobic oxidation of substrates such as p stutzeri in the presence of sufficient oxygen denitrifying microorganisms stimulate carbon metabolism to rapidly consume oxygen and use nitrate for assimilation yuan et al 2021 therefore even with stressed by high concentration gd p stutzeri still could assimilate nitrate nitrogen to intracellular nitrogen efficiently and increase its environmental adaptation capability by activating the mechanisms of the efflux pump and cell wall synthesis unlike the effects of high stress concentrations microorganisms produced only a small amount of ros 1 2 times that in the control when the gd concentration was no more than 1 mg l instead of inhibiting microbial activity small amounts of ros promoted dna damage and activated error prone reactive oxygen radical sos scavenging reactions chen et al 2015 leading to an increase in mutants or induction of the superoxide disputation reaction soxrs system at subinhibitory concentrations fu et al 2018 experimental results suggested that this system not only activated antioxidant defense systems to prevent oxidative stress damage leading to the upregulation of genes involved in encoding antioxidant enzymes katg sod1 sod2 ahpc ahpf but also induced the overexpression of resistance genes e g efflux pump genes mexb efrb smr qach membrane permeability genes oprb slp lpta lptc pmrf mcr 5 enzyme modification genes teto tetm ant 3 ia ant 3 iic tem 116 and hydrolase genes rphb mpha erea2 ermx etc interestingly although most of the sludge microorganisms began to cope with the negative effects by activating defense systems under low concentrations of gd denitrifying bacteria still dominated the microbial community which may be related to the distribution of resistance genes in bacteria it was found that denitrifying microorganisms p stutzeri and t aminoaromatica were susceptible to acquiring or inducing the expression of multiple antibiotic resistance genes from the environment during gd stress aminoglycoside photransferases aph aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases ant and aminoglycoside acetyltransferases aac modifying enzyme genes were the predominant antibiotic resistance genes which belong to aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance genes fig s8 aminoglycoside antibiotics are cationic antibiotics with a mechanism of action similar to that of gd which can cause synthetic protein mistranslation by altering bacterial outer membrane permeability to enter the cytosol and interact with the ribosome short et al 2021 despite the absence of additional antibiotic dosing in this study denitrifying microorganisms could still exhibit cross resistance by expressing multiple antibiotic resistance genes mainly aminoglycoside resistance genes indicating that microorganisms can be induced to exhibit cross resistance via similar bactericidal mechanisms 4 3 impact of gd on public health and environmental risk management the toxicological risks posed by wwtps as a sink and source of antibiotic resistance genes to the ecological environment have been of great concern michael et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 gd exposure induced microorganisms to exhibit cross resistance in particular a variety of resistance genes carried by plasmids or transposons showed significant upregulation under low exposure with aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance genes aac 6 iic aac 6 ⅰb9 aac 6 ⅰb cr aada10 aada5 aada6 and aada13 being predominant fig s7 it has been shown that aminoglycoside resistance genes as one of several common and abundant classes of resistance genes in sewage are found in various genetic backgrounds including small nonconjugative plasmids ramirez et al 2013 because of the similar bactericidal mechanism of gd and aminoglycoside antibiotics this may make the aminoglycoside resistance genes more abundant and easier to translocate under gd stress the results of our study confirmed this suspicion as a large number of aminoglycoside resistance genes migrated horizontally from the potential host rubrivivax to several sensitive receptor bacteria after 9 h of 1 mg l gd stress fig s7 with denitrifying microorganisms such as thauera pseudomonas azoarcus thioalkalicibrio being dominant this further explains why denitrifying bacteria were the dominant bacteria during gd stress therefore wastewater treatment plants serve as a sink and source of antibiotic resistance genes it is necessary to consider the residual disinfectants flowing into the wastewater treatment system as a potential risk source for resistance gene migration transformation in environment it is worth noting that not all concentration of disinfectants drove the migration of antibiotic resistance genes among microorganisms the expression levels of resistance genes were at same level as the control fig s3 when the gd was 0 1 mg l therefore pretreatment of the disinfection rinse water using physical adsorption or advanced oxidation techniques such as fenton like controlling the concentration of residual disinfectant flowing into the wastewater treatment system to less than 0 1 mg l as much as possible might be an effective way to reduce the risk 5 conclusion residual disinfectant was demonstrated as a potential disturbance factor that drove the changes in microbial community structure and enriched certain functional microorganisms e g denitrifiers in activated sludge correlation based macro genome sequencing results showed that the denitrifying bacteria dominated by p stutzeri t aminoaromatica thauera sp mzit t humireducens thauera sp k11 and t terpenica showed strong adaptability under different concentrations of gd stress which facilitated stable denitrification and carbon removal in the wastewater treatment system respectively however highly tolerant denitrifying bacteria also increased the relative abundance of aminoglycoside based resistance genes especially when concentration were as low as around 1 mg l this undoubtedly improving the risk of horizontal transfer of resistance genes among activated sludge microorganisms therefore we should pay attention to this issue and consciously assess the possible ecological consequences associated with the discharge of gd disinfectants into the environment during virus abatement declaration of competing interest

15319,surface complexation between arsenite as iii and colloidal metal hydroxides plays an important role not only in the immobilization and oxidation of as iii but also in the cycle of the metal and the fate of their ligands however the photochemical processes between cu ii and as iii are not sufficiently understood in this work the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of cu ii under neutral ph conditions was investigated in water containing 200 μm cu ii and 5 μm as iii under simulated solar irradiation consisting of uvb light the results confirmed the complexation between as iii and cu ii hydroxides and the photooxidation of as iii is attributed to the ligand to metal charge transfer lmct process and cu iii oxidation the light induced lmct process results in simultaneous as iii oxidation and cu ii reduction then produced cu i undergoes autooxidation with o2 to produce o2 and h2o2 and further the cu i fenton reaction produces cu iii that can oxidize as iii efficiently kcu iii

regarding their interaction and photo induced redox reactions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords copper hydroxide colloid arsenic species direct electron transfer trivalent copper kinetic simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is believed that the environmental photochemistry of cu ii complexes is important to the cycle of cu ii cu i the fate of their ligands and their bioavailability and toxicity cieśla et al 2004 sýkora 1997 in fact there are fewer studies on the environmental photochemical processes of cu ii complexes than those of fe iii mainly due to their lower abundance and photoactivity in natural waters all reports on cu ii photochemistry have involved cu ii complexes with various inorganic e g cl and co3 2 moffett and zika 1985 and organic ligands e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta langford et al 1973 moffett and zika 1985 amino acids hayase and zepp 1991 moffett and zika 1985 iminodiacetic acids mailhot et al 1995 dicarboxylates moffett and zika 1985 sun et al 1998 wu et al 2000 natural organic matter nom that has the same functional groups as these ligands is widely distributed in freshwater and seawater bodies the most common primary photochemical processes of cu ii complexes are ligand to metal charge transfer lmct reactions under irradiation with light of a wavelength corresponding to the lmct absorption band of the complexes resulting in the reduction of cu ii to cu i and oxidation of the ligands hayase and zepp 1991 langford et al 1973 mailhot et al 1995 moffett and zika 1985 sun et al 1998 vogler and kunkely 1990 wu et al 2000 the secondary reactions have also been discussed with respect to the interconversion of cu ii cu i i e cu ii reduction by h2o2 or o2 cu i oxidation by o2 o2 or h2o2 and photooxidation of cu i in the form of complexes with the original ligands e g cl these reactions are thought to be relevant to the abundant species since the steady state concentrations of the transients produced from the primary processes are decided by the reactions with them moffett and zika 1985 to the best of our knowledge both cu ii and ligands are in high abundance to form complexes and undergo photo induced lmct processes in some systems for wastewater treatment for example photolysis of cuclx complexes has been used to produce cl and cl2 gas for the removal of chloride ions from non ferrous metal smelting wastewater peng et al 2019 on the contrary photolysis of cu ii edta complexes provides a negligible contribution to the oxidation of the ligands in uv cl2 huang et al 2019 or uv vis tio2 systems lee et al 2015 moreover the photooxidation of some organic ligands possessing high activity toward direct photolysis such as ciprofloxacin is inhibited due to complexation with cu ii regardless of the lmct process wei et al 2015 these seemingly contradictory reports imply that the effectiveness of cu ii photochemistry toward the oxidation of ligands predominantly depends on the ligands used notably nearly no special investigations have been reported on the photochemistry of hydrated cu ii aquo ions or cu ii hydroxo cu ii oh complexes with the exception that several pieces of work have pointed out their absence morimoto and degraff 1975 or presence sun et al 2011 in the primary photochemical reactions studied however the hydrolysis of cu2 ions in water under neutral ph conditions produces a suspended amorphous cu oh 2 colloid even leading to its precipitation the amorphous and crystalline hydroxide structures are similar which contain linear chain cuo4 fragments in the direction of the crystallographic a axis kriventsov et al 1999 1998 knowledge of the photochemistry of amorphous cu oh 2 colloid in the presence of ligands is limited recently we found arsenite as iii is oxidized via a photo induced lmct process of as iii complexes on the surface of cu oh 2 colloid under irradiation with a uva lamp λmax 365 nm in an alkaline solution ph 8 ding et al 2020 as iii could also complex with fe iii hao et al 2022 and the lmct process occurs under near neutral ph conditions under irradiation with light λ 400 nm in our previous work xu et al 2014 kong et al also reported that the photooxidation of sb iii in the presence of fe iii occurs via the same mechanism at ph 4 10 under irradiation at 290 700 nm kong et al 2016 the question arises as to whether as iii oxidation in the presence of cu ii occurs under neutral or acid ph conditions upon changing the reaction conditions such as the irradiation wavelength and initial cu ii concentration we hypothesize that the lmct process plays a role in as iii oxidation under neutral ph conditions but with a different contribution and mechanism from that under alkaline ph conditions because of the inadequate formation of cu oh 2 colloid since acidic water or wastewater co contaminated with arsenic and copper is often discharged downstream of copper smelters matschullat 2000 copper mines and gold mines camm et al 2004 đorđievski et al 2018 milu et al 2002 the environmental significance of cu ii photochemistry may increase with a decrease in the acidity of the medium in natural or engineering systems in this study the photochemistry of cu ii in the presence of as iii in water under neutral ph conditions was investigated with the following goals in mind 1 to identify the probable lmct processes involving cu ii oh and cu ii as iii complexes and to evaluate their contribution toward the oxidation of as iii 2 to reveal the mechanism for as iii oxidation by cu iii and 3 to examine the implications of this work for the environmental photochemistry of cu ii and fate of as iii in water bodies contaminated with both cu ii and as iii the results of this work will help to understand the environmental chemistry of cu ii and as iii with respect to their interaction and photo induced redox reactions this work will also shed light on the role of cu iii and o2 in the cu ii cu i based fenton like redox mechanism initiated by the photolysis of cu ii complexes which may inspire researchers to revisit the cu ii induced transformation of emerging contaminants under irradiation with sunlight chen et al 2016 2015 lee et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were used as received and detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials text s1 2 2 experimental setup and procedures photochemical experiments were conducted under irradiation with uvb light at 25 1 c information regarding the reactor fig s1 and irradiation spectrum fig s2 is provided in text s2 as iii and cu ii stock solutions using an appropriate volume of ultrapure water were added to 500 ml glass jars with magnetic stirring and the ph was adjusted with naoh and h2so4 to the target value the uv lamps were switched on to initiate the experiment the dissolved oxygen and ph were automatically monitored in real time anoxic experiments were conducted under high purity n2 bubbling for at least 30 min before and during the photoreaction 2 3 analytical methods arsenic speciation was simultaneously analyzed by means of liquid chromatography hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry lc hg afs bohui innovation technology co ltd beijing china based on our previous study luo et al 2020 determination of the cu i concentration was based on the modified bathocuproine method moffett et al 1985 the h2o2 concentration was measured using modified n n diethyl p phenylenediamine horseradish peroxidase dpd pod spectrophotometry bader et al 1988 cu iii was probed using periodate spectrophotometry with a characteristic light absorbance at 415 nm balikungeri et al 1977 radicals were detected using dmpo as a

gaussian 16w and gauss view 6 0 gaussian inc usa frisch et al 2016 detailed experimental procedures and analytical methods are provided in the text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 the predominant active cu ii species since the main purpose of this study was to reveal the mechanism of the photochemical process under neutral ph conditions the appropriate concentration of cu ii was initially determined for the photochemical experiments fig 1 a shows the decrease in the as iii concentration was enhanced upon increasing the initial cu ii concentration over the range of 50 1000 μm at ph 7 the results of the control experiments fig s3 and mass balance of arsenic fig s4 confirmed the photooxidation of as iii and it follows the langmuir hinshelwood model over the cu ii concentration range studied fig 1b which indicates the photooxidation of as iii is an adsorption oxidation coupled process macroscopic particulates are formed and precipitate in solutions with cu ii concentrations 600 μm fig s5 to maintain the stability of the colloid and achieve a sufficient reaction rate for as iii oxidation in the solution in order to investigate the photochemistry under neutral ph conditions the initial concentration of cu ii was set at 200 μm for the majority of the photochemical reactions to identify the predominant cu ii species responsible for the photochemical process the photooxidation of as iii was investigated at ph 3 7 and 10 the results in fig 1c show as iii oxidation was increased upon increasing the ph whereas almost no as iii oxidation was observed at ph 3 in addition to as iii oxidation cu i was simultaneously detected as the product of the photoreduction of cu ii however the concentrations of cu i in the oxic reactant solutions were below the detection limit dlcu i 0 65 μm of the modified bathocuproine method used in this work the photogenerated cu i is thought to be labile and exists in low steady state concentrations subject to cu i autooxidation and disproportionation which are complicated and ph dependent liu et al 2016 therefore the photochemical process in anoxic solutions was investigated to determine the stoichiometry between as iii oxidation and cu i reduction fig 1d shows cu i generation increased along with irradiation time and the rates between cu i and as v generation during uvb irradiation were close to 2 0 0175 0 0083 at ph 7 which was in accordance with our previous investigation under uva irradiation under alkaline ph conditions ding et al 2020 according to the species distribution diagrams shown in fig s6 cu ii exists in the form of cu ii aqua ion cu2 at ph 3 100 and cu oh 2 colloids aggregated cu ii oh complexes at ph 7 98 and ph 10 100 while as iii exists as as oh 3 at ph 3 100 and ph 7 99 but aso oh 2 at ph 10 87 the dissolved cu ii and as iii which penetrate through the filter with a pore size of 0 22 μm buck et al 2007 decrease fig s7a while the amounts of cu oh 2 and cu ii as iii colloids cu oh 2 surface complexes with as iii as a ligand increase upon increasing the ph light absorption at a wavelength 285 nm by the reactant solutions increases upon increasing the ph from 3 to 10 fig s7b which was in agreement with the as iii oxidation furthermore no as iii oxidation was observed in supernatant at ph 7 containing about 50 μm dissolved cu ii fig s8 therefore the suspended cu oh 2 colloids and or cu ii as iii colloids may absorb uvb light under neutral or alkaline ph conditions and possess photoactivity to induce the oxidation of as iii this conclusion was in agreement with that of an investigation on the photochemistry of cu ii in urban river water which indicated the critical role of colloids with a high reactive surface area rather than particulates glazewski and morrison 1995 however cu i generation via the photolysis of anoxic cu ii solutions without as iii at ph 7 was below dlcu i fig 1d if the photolysis of cu ii can produce a sufficient concentration of cu i the autooxidation of cu i can result in as iii oxidation under dark conditions fig s9 therefore cu2 or cu oh 2 colloids are not thought to exhibit enough photoactivity for as iii oxidation under uvb irradiation which will be discussed in the following sections the only predominant photoactive cu ii species was attributed to the cu ii as iii colloids fig s10 shows the difference in the uv vis absorbance between the cu ii as iii and cu ii solutions confirmed the formation of the surface cu ii as iii complex and the absorption increases upon increasing the as iii concentration benesi and hildebrand 1949 the complex exhibits obvious absorption peaks at 348 nm which can be ascribed to the lmct charge transfer from as iii to cu ii processes calculated using dft adamescu et al 2014 2011 theoretically uvb irradiation which has a maximum wavelength of 313 nm could induce the lmct process with simultaneous as iii oxidation and cu ii reduction 3 2 role of ros the results in fig 2 a show that the oxidation of as iii was not completely inhibited in the anoxic solution by bubbling n2 gas which not only proves the occurrence of the lmct process in the absence of o2 but also indicates that reactive oxygen species ros were probably involved in the photochemistry of the cu ii as iii system in the presence of o2 the production of ros o2 h2o2 and oh in the cu ii as iii system at ph 7 can be attributed to the following three possible pathways i the photo induced lmct process of cu oh 2 that directly produces oh which is discussed in this section ii cu i autooxidation that subsequently produces o2 h2o2 and oh and iii the photolysis of h2o2 that indirectly produces oh oh fig 2a shows that no obvious inhibition of as iii oxidation was observed upon the addition of etoh as an oh scavenger which implied that oh in the bulk of reactant solution ohbulk was not responsible for the oxidation of as iii in the cu ii as iii system the esr spectrum of reactant solution of the cu ii as iii system in the presence of 100 mm dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide as a spin trapping agent for oh exhibited the dmpo oh adduct signals before and after irradiation fig s11a however oh generation was excluded in this case since the same dmpo oh adduct signals were obtained in the cu ii dmpo mixed solution without as iii in the dark fig s11b this signal results from the direct reaction between cu ii and dmpo at high concentrations hanna et al 1992 no obvious signal appeared when the dmpo concentration was reduced to 10 mm fig s11c in addition no detectable phenol was found when using benzene as the probe which also confirmed ohbulk was absent in the cu ii as iii system another possible working oxidant related to oh could be the surface oh cu ii ohsurf that cannot be scavenged by etoh however tba was found to inhibit as iii oxidation fig 2a which appeared to be in conflict with that observed during the etoh scavenging experiments since tba can also scavenge ohbulk rather than the surface oh meanwhile in light of the tba reaction with cu iii with k cu iii tba 1 0 0 4 107 pham et al 2013 we propose that cu iii rather than the surface oh may be acting as the oxidant for as iii which will be discussed in the next section o2 and h2o2 these two ros are relevant to each other in the presence of reductive species such as fe ii ding et al 2018 liu et al 2022 and cu i pham et al 2013 which can activate oxygen molecules two biological molecules superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were tentatively used to probe the roles of o2 and h2o2 respectively both of them show the effective inhibition of as iii oxidation fig s12 however the amino acids in enzymes or specific structures e g porphyrin in cat can complex with cu ii huszánk and horváth 2005 jiménez et al 1987 which increases the dissolution of the cu oh 2 colloids fig s13 therefore sod or cat cannot be used as scavengers in the cu ii as iii system for o2 or h2o2 similar to those scavengers that disrupt the formation of cu oh 2 colloids considering the rate constant between as iii and o2 k as oh 3 o2 3 6 106 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2005 is two orders of magnitude lower than that between cu ii and o2 k cu ii o2 6 6 0 7 108 m 1 s 1 zafiriou et al 1998 o2 is incapable of directly oxidizing as iii in the presence of cu ii at a 40 fold higher concentration than as iii esr with dmpo used as a spin trapping agent did not provide any evidence of o2 in this work fig s11 in this case detecting h2o2 was particularly important to reveal the reaction mechanism fig 2b shows nearly no h2o2 dlh2o2 0 03 μm was detected in the cu ii oh system in the absence of as iii in both the oxic and anoxic solutions indicating as iii was important for h2o2 production therefore in the absence of as iii the possibility of oh production by the photo induced lmct process of cu oh 2 colloids as well as cu ii oh complexes cu oh 2 hν cu oh 0 oh or h2o2 produced by the recombination of oh 2 oh h2o2 can be ruled out in the cu ii as iii system only sub micromolar concentrations of h2o2 were detected with o2 at ph 7 and 10 h2o2 generation at ph 10 was faster than that observed at ph 7 during the initial stage of the reaction subsequent h2o2 depletion occurred under both ph conditions which was faster at ph 10 since most of as iii exists as as oh 3 at ph 7 h2o2 could not oxidize as iii directly pettine et al 1999 in addition the reaction of h2o2 with cu ii k cu ii h2o2 1 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2016 and the photolysis of h2o2 to produce oh were also negligible when a low concentration of h2o2 was produced in the cu ii as iii system fig s14 although o2 or h2o2 were not the predominant oxidant directly responsible for the oxidation of as iii their indirect contribution via the production of cu iii must be clarified in this scenario 3 3 production of cu iii probing the production of cu iii in the cu ii oh or cu ii as iii system is essential to reveal the photochemical mechanism but it is very difficult to work with the previously reported techniques raman analysis used for the characterization of cu iii wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 has not been used due to the low yield of cu iii produced during the in situ reaction mode and uvb irradiation is required for the photo induced reaction our attempts to carry out the methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso reaction which is frequently used to probing high valent metal failed with cu iii being identified to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on using pmso to probe cu iii and cu iii may not be able to oxidize pmso to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 due to the relatively lower redox potential of cu iii cu ii 1 57 v she popova and aksenova 2003 when compared with other higher valent metals e g fe iv fe iii 1 8 2 v co iii co ii 1 80 1 92 v vs she yu et al 2022 however the previously reported periodate colorimetry methods li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 face the challenge of the photolysis of periodate in photochemical systems fig s15 shows the characteristic absorption peak at 415 nm increases with the irradiation time in the cu ii oh or cu ii as iii systems according to the reported molar absorption coefficient of the cu iii periodate complex ε 415 6235 m 1 cm 1 hu and li 2013 the cu iii concentration at 3 h was calculated to be about 72 and 70 μm in the cu ii oh and cu ii as iii systems respectively which are much higher than as iii in light of oh production via the photolysis of periodate zhang et al 2021 it is believed that periodate simultaneously participates in cu iii production to eliminate the interference from oh in the cu ii as iii io4 system an excess of methanol was added together with periodate since the reaction between methanol and cu iii can be neglected at ph 7 k cu iii meoh 4 105 m 1 s 1 johnson et al 1988 it is also noteworthy that the hydroxide ligand may stabilize cu iii resulting in the lower redox potential of the cu oh 2 cu oh couple relative to cu3 cu2 aq meyerstein 1971 the addition of 25 mm methanol reduces the production of cu iii fig 3 a and the uv vis difference spectra between 20 and 0 min obtained for the cu ii as iii io4 system upon adding various concentrations of methanol are shown in fig 3b excess methanol 100 mm can completely quench the oh produced via the photolysis of io4 while the part that could not be quenched was ascribed to cu iii produced in the cu ii as iii system in order to determine the second order rate constant k cu iii as iii for the reaction between cu iii and as iii producing as iv followed very fast oxidation by o2 k as iv o2 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 klüning et al 1989 the cu i h2o2 thermal reaction system under neutral ph conditions was utilized to oxidize as iii under anaerobic conditions where cu

2 10 μm k cu iii as iii was then calculated to be 1 02 109 m 1 s 1 with the method described in text s4 this rate constant was smaller than that of the reaction between oh and as iii k oh as iii 8 5

that probing cu iii in the cu i h2o2 system using the periodate method was not successful due to excess cu i scavenging cu iii at a high reaction rate k cu iii cu i 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 the rate constants of the reactions involved in the anoxic cu i h2o2 system table s1 were imported into the kinetic simulation text s5 and the simulated kinetic curves obtained for the reactants and products during the reaction are shown in fig s16 the calculated concentrations of as iii at 1 min using the kinetic simulation are in good agreement with the experimental values r 2 0 99 shown in fig 3d 3 4 proposed mechanism for as iii oxidation above we demonstrated that the combined effects of the lmct process and cu iii oxidation result in as iii oxidation in the cu ii as iii

s1 versus cu ii as iii complexes text s7 mechanism ii scheme s2 in mechanism i the photolysis of the cu ii oh complexes produces oh and cu i via the lmct process r1 although they are thought to be of very low photoreactivity in the absence of as iii as discussed above however the possibility that as iii inhibits the recombination of oh and cu i by scavenging oh which may facilitate lmct of cu ii

agreement with the experimental results shown in fig 4 a and b which showed r as iii n2 0 increases upon increasing as iii 0 eq 1 therefore mechanism i was not valid and the initial as iv should be

versus as iii 0 r 2 0 99 are presented in fig 4b mechanism ii in the presence of o2 was then demonstrated using kinetic analysis to explain the production of h2o2 and as iii oxidation text s8 the results confirm that the lmct process of the cu ii as iii complexes produces cu i and as iv which are responsible for the production of o2 via their reactions with o2 r11 and r17 k as iv o2 1 1 109 m

due to the cu ii cu i in the system this reaction is essential for the fast redox cycle of cu ii cu i h2o2 is mainly produced from the reaction between cu i and o2 r12 and depleted by cu i r13 it is noteworthy that as iv directly makes a greater contribution r17 than cu i r11 to o2 production and indirectly toward h2o2 production r12 and cu ii reduction to cu i r18 cu iii is produced predominantly from the reaction between cu i and h2o2 r13 and mainly depleted by as iii r7 as iii oxidation occurs via the lmct process of the cu ii as iii complexes and cu iii oxidation at a ratio of 62 38 text s8 o2 is mainly consumed by cu i and as iv and the concentration of dissolved oxygen did not change significantly during the reaction fig s17 the reaction rate constants involved in the cu ii as iii system with o2 table s2 were imported into kinetic simulation and the calculated concentrations of as iii as v and h2o2 were compared with their experimental values fig s18 fig 4d shows the calculated concentrations of as iii were nearly identical to the experimental values as iii exp 0 97 as iii cal r 2 0 98 while the calculated concentrations of h2o2 were less than the experimental values h2o2 exp 0 84 h2o2 cal r 2 0 70 and their correlation was less significant than that of as iii which could be due to the errors in the detection and simulation of h2o2 overall the following

s i v o 2 a challenge to mechanism ii is the weak complexation between cu ii and as iii at ph 7 since almost all of the as iii species exist as as oh 3 which can be separated with the suspended cu oh 2 colloids fig s6 the dft calculations also showed that it is difficult for as oh 3 to bind to the solid cu oh 2 in terms of its binding energy table s3 therefore a plausible explanation for the interaction between as oh 3 and the amorphous cu oh 2 colloids under neutral ph conditions could be outer sphere surface complexation occurring on the interfacial layer of the colloids adamescu et al 2016 2010 inorganic ligands salts typically form an outer sphere or weak electrostatic interactions with cu ii by sharing the water of hydration powell et al 2007 it has been reported that outer sphere cu ii complexes have lower photoreactivity than inner sphere complexes wu et al 2000 although the effect of coexisting matrix on non free radical reactions has selective merit to ros based reactions feng et al 2019 the inhibition of as iii oxidation by non photoreactive anions h2po4 hpo4 2 cl so4 2 and hco3 was observed fig s19 since h2po4 hpo4 2 are strong competitive ligands versus as oh 3 liu et al 2020 higher inhibition can be achieved with them in lower concentrations than cl so4 2 or hco3 in addition these anions can also inhibit the formation of cu oh 2 colloids figs s13 and s20 and consume radicals responsible for cu iii production after as iii oxidation the produced as v was adsorbed on the cu oh 2 colloid which cannot be detected in the filtered solution this indicates the formation of inner sphere complexes of as v mainly h2aso4 and haso4 2 on the cu oh 2 colloid despite the fact that the outer sphere complexes may exist simultaneously which is similar to as v adsorption on aluminum oxide or iron oxide arai et al 2001 r19 cu ii oh 2 oh 2 as iii hv cu ii oh 2 oh 2 as iii cu i oh as iv 3 5 application potential the complexation and photochemical processes of cu ii as iii complexes are strongly influenced by the presence of a high concentration of coexisting anions under neutral ph conditions figs s19 and s20 in addition fulvic acid 5 mg l 1 as a fraction of typical nom was found to inhibit as iii oxidation in the cu ii as iii system fig s21 the occurrence of the photochemistry of the cu ii as iii system in authentic water samples is challenged by the water quality when the system was introduced into local lake water it exhibited a lower efficiency ca 20 than that observed in ultrapure water fig s21 to validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism simulated pit water samples containing various concentrations of cu ii under neutral or weakly acidic ph conditions were irradiated with sunlight fig 5 shows that as iii was oxidized in the cu ii as iii system at ph 7 while a low efficiency was observed under acidic conditions over 8 h of irradiation as expected there was no significant change in the ph fig s22 obviously the effectiveness of the system mainly relies on the distribution of the cu ii and as iii species which was apparently related not only to the ph but also to the concentration of cu ii and as iii when the ph of water becomes neutral downstream from acid mine drainage amd ponds in the mining zones or ground water filled pits đorđievski et al 2018 the higher concentration of cu ii sub millimolar may facilitate the oxidation of as iii in terms of the proposed mechanism it is worth emphasizing that this mechanism for as iii oxidation may be important for the transformation of labile and mobile as iii species to less toxic and immobilized as v along with the precipitation of solid cu oh 2 as v was removed from the water samples thus the proposed mechanism in this work manifests its role in the self purification of cu ii and as iii contaminated water under irradiation with sunlight from the perspective of its engineering applications the photochemistry of cu ii complexes can be used for o2 activation to oxidize specific ligands regarded as contaminants it is believed that as iv is the key species activating o2 to generate ros in the cu ii as iii system therefore a suitable ligand is very important not only for the lmct process of the complex but also to its oxidative removal 4 conclusions this study investigated the photochemistry of cu ii in the presence of as iii in water under neutral ph conditions the results confirmed the complexation between as iii and cu ii hydroxides and the predominant photoactive cu ii species that induce the oxidation of as iii was attributed to the cu ii as iii complex rather than the cu ii oh complex the lmct process and cu iii which is produced from the cu i fenton reaction are two main pathways for the oxidation of as iii kinetic analysis and simulation proved the proposed mechanism the ph range of as iii oxidation could be extended to weakly acidic conditions in natural downstream water from copper smelters and mines this work helps to understand the environmental chemistry of cu ii and as iii and cu ii cu i based fenton like redox mechanism initiated by the photolysis of cu ii complexes credit authorship contribution statement yi

15319,surface complexation between arsenite as iii and colloidal metal hydroxides plays an important role not only in the immobilization and oxidation of as iii but also in the cycle of the metal and the fate of their ligands however the photochemical processes between cu ii and as iii are not sufficiently understood in this work the photooxidation of as iii in the presence of cu ii under neutral ph conditions was investigated in water containing 200 μm cu ii and 5 μm as iii under simulated solar irradiation consisting of uvb light the results confirmed the complexation between as iii and cu

oxidation and cu ii reduction then produced cu i undergoes autooxidation with o2 to produce o2 and h2o2 and further the cu i fenton reaction produces cu iii that can oxidize as iii efficiently kcu iii

i the fate of their ligands and their bioavailability and toxicity cieśla et al 2004 sýkora 1997 in fact there are fewer studies on the environmental photochemical processes of cu ii complexes than those of fe iii mainly due to their lower abundance and photoactivity in natural waters all reports on cu ii photochemistry have involved cu ii complexes with various inorganic e g cl and co3 2 moffett and zika 1985 and organic ligands e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta langford et al 1973 moffett and zika 1985 amino acids hayase and zepp 1991 moffett and zika 1985 iminodiacetic acids mailhot et al 1995 dicarboxylates moffett and zika 1985 sun et al 1998 wu et al 2000 natural organic matter nom that has the same functional groups as these ligands is widely distributed in freshwater and seawater bodies the most common primary photochemical processes of cu ii complexes are ligand to metal charge transfer lmct reactions under irradiation with light of a wavelength corresponding to the lmct absorption band of the complexes resulting in the reduction of cu ii to cu i and oxidation of the ligands hayase and zepp 1991 langford et al 1973 mailhot et al 1995 moffett and zika 1985 sun et al 1998 vogler and kunkely 1990 wu et al 2000 the secondary reactions have also been discussed with respect to the interconversion of cu ii cu i i e cu ii reduction by h2o2 or o2 cu i oxidation by o2 o2 or h2o2 and photooxidation of cu i in the form of complexes with the original ligands e g cl these reactions are thought to be relevant to the abundant species since the steady state concentrations of the transients produced from the primary processes are decided by the reactions with them moffett and zika 1985 to the best of our knowledge both cu ii and ligands are in high abundance to form complexes and undergo photo induced lmct processes in some systems for wastewater treatment for example photolysis of cuclx complexes has been used to produce cl and cl2 gas for the removal of chloride ions from non ferrous metal smelting wastewater peng et al 2019 on the contrary photolysis of cu ii edta complexes provides a negligible contribution to the oxidation of the ligands in uv cl2 huang et al 2019 or uv vis tio2 systems lee et al 2015 moreover the photooxidation of some organic ligands possessing high activity toward direct photolysis such as ciprofloxacin is inhibited due to complexation with cu ii regardless of the lmct process wei et al 2015 these seemingly contradictory reports imply that the effectiveness of cu ii photochemistry toward the oxidation of ligands predominantly depends on the ligands used notably nearly no special investigations have been reported on the photochemistry of hydrated cu ii aquo ions or cu ii hydroxo cu ii oh complexes with the exception that several pieces of work have pointed out their absence morimoto and degraff 1975 or presence sun et al 2011 in the primary photochemical reactions studied however the hydrolysis of cu2 ions in water under neutral ph conditions produces a suspended amorphous cu oh 2 colloid even leading to its precipitation the amorphous and crystalline hydroxide structures are similar which contain linear chain cuo4 fragments in the direction of the crystallographic a axis kriventsov et al 1999 1998 knowledge of the photochemistry of amorphous cu oh 2 colloid in the presence of ligands is limited recently we found arsenite as iii is oxidized via a photo induced lmct process of as iii complexes on the surface of cu oh 2 colloid under irradiation with a uva lamp λmax 365 nm in an alkaline solution ph 8 ding et al 2020 as iii could also complex with fe iii hao et al 2022 and the lmct process occurs under near neutral ph conditions under irradiation with light λ 400 nm in our previous work xu et al 2014 kong et al also reported that the photooxidation of sb iii in the presence of fe iii occurs via the same mechanism at ph 4 10 under irradiation at 290 700 nm kong et al 2016 the question arises as to whether as iii oxidation in the presence of cu ii occurs under neutral or acid ph conditions upon changing the reaction conditions such as the irradiation wavelength and initial cu ii concentration we hypothesize that the lmct process plays a role in as iii oxidation under neutral ph conditions but with a different contribution and mechanism from that under alkaline ph conditions because of the inadequate formation of cu oh 2 colloid since acidic water or wastewater co contaminated with arsenic and copper is often discharged downstream of copper smelters matschullat 2000 copper mines and gold mines camm et al 2004 đorđievski et al 2018 milu et al 2002 the environmental significance of cu ii photochemistry may increase with a decrease in the acidity of the medium in natural or engineering systems in this study the photochemistry of cu ii in the presence of as iii in water under neutral ph conditions was investigated with the following goals in mind 1 to identify the probable lmct processes involving cu ii oh and cu ii as iii complexes and to evaluate their contribution toward the oxidation of as iii 2 to reveal the mechanism for as iii oxidation by cu iii and 3 to examine the implications of this work for the environmental photochemistry of cu ii and fate of as iii in water bodies contaminated with both cu ii and as iii the results of this work will help to understand the environmental chemistry of cu ii and as iii with respect to their interaction and photo induced redox reactions this work will also shed light on the role of cu iii and o2 in the cu ii cu i based fenton like redox mechanism initiated by the photolysis of cu ii complexes which may inspire researchers to revisit the cu ii induced transformation of emerging

active cu ii species since the main purpose of this study was to reveal the mechanism of the photochemical process under neutral ph conditions the appropriate concentration of cu ii was initially determined for the photochemical experiments fig 1 a shows the decrease in the as iii concentration was enhanced upon increasing the initial cu ii concentration over the range of 50 1000 μm at ph 7 the results of the control experiments fig s3 and mass balance of arsenic fig s4 confirmed the photooxidation of as iii and it follows the langmuir hinshelwood model over the cu ii concentration range studied fig 1b which indicates the photooxidation of as iii is an adsorption oxidation coupled process macroscopic particulates are formed and precipitate in solutions with cu ii concentrations 600 μm fig s5 to maintain the stability of the colloid and achieve a sufficient reaction rate for as iii oxidation in the solution in order to investigate the photochemistry under neutral ph conditions the initial concentration of cu ii was set at 200 μm for the majority of the photochemical reactions to identify the predominant cu ii species responsible for the photochemical process the photooxidation of as iii was investigated at ph 3 7 and 10 the results in fig 1c show as iii oxidation was increased upon increasing the ph whereas almost no as iii oxidation was observed at ph 3 in addition to as iii oxidation cu i was simultaneously detected as the product of the photoreduction of cu ii however the concentrations of cu i in the oxic reactant solutions were below the detection limit dlcu i 0 65 μm of the modified bathocuproine method used in this work the photogenerated cu i is thought to be labile and exists in low steady state concentrations subject to cu i autooxidation and disproportionation which are complicated and ph dependent liu et al 2016 therefore the photochemical process in anoxic solutions was investigated to determine the stoichiometry between as iii oxidation and cu i reduction fig 1d shows cu i generation increased along with irradiation time and the rates between cu i and as v generation during uvb irradiation were close to 2 0 0175 0 0083 at ph 7 which was in accordance with our previous investigation under uva irradiation under alkaline ph conditions ding et al 2020 according to the species distribution diagrams shown in fig s6 cu ii exists in the form of cu ii aqua ion cu2 at ph 3 100 and cu oh 2 colloids aggregated cu ii oh complexes at ph 7 98 and ph 10 100 while as iii exists as as oh 3 at ph 3 100 and ph 7 99 but aso oh 2 at ph 10 87 the dissolved cu ii and as iii which penetrate through the filter with a pore size of 0 22 μm buck et al 2007 decrease fig s7a while the amounts of cu oh 2 and cu ii as iii colloids cu oh 2 surface complexes with as iii as a ligand increase upon increasing the ph light absorption at a wavelength 285 nm by the reactant solutions increases upon increasing the ph from 3 to 10 fig s7b which was in agreement with the as iii oxidation furthermore no as iii oxidation was observed in supernatant at ph 7 containing about 50 μm dissolved cu ii fig s8 therefore the suspended cu oh 2 colloids and or cu ii as iii colloids may absorb uvb light under neutral or alkaline ph conditions and possess photoactivity to induce the oxidation of as iii this conclusion was in agreement with that of an investigation on the photochemistry of cu ii in urban river water which indicated the critical role of colloids with a high reactive surface area rather than particulates glazewski and morrison 1995 however cu i generation via the photolysis of anoxic cu ii solutions without as iii at ph 7 was below dlcu i fig 1d if the photolysis of cu ii can produce a sufficient concentration of cu i the autooxidation of cu i can result in as iii oxidation under dark conditions fig s9 therefore cu2 or cu oh 2 colloids are not thought to exhibit enough photoactivity for as iii oxidation under uvb irradiation which will be discussed in the following sections the only predominant photoactive cu ii species was attributed to the cu ii as iii colloids fig s10 shows the difference in the uv vis absorbance between the cu ii as iii and cu ii solutions confirmed the formation of the surface cu ii as iii complex and the absorption increases upon increasing the as iii concentration benesi and hildebrand 1949 the complex exhibits obvious absorption peaks at 348 nm which can be ascribed to the lmct charge transfer from as iii to cu ii processes calculated using dft adamescu et al 2014 2011 theoretically uvb irradiation which has a maximum wavelength of 313 nm could induce the lmct process with simultaneous as iii oxidation and cu ii reduction 3 2 role of ros the results in fig 2 a show that the oxidation of as iii was not completely inhibited in the anoxic solution by bubbling n2 gas which not only proves the occurrence of the lmct process in the absence of o2 but also indicates that reactive oxygen species ros were probably involved in the photochemistry of the cu ii as iii system in the presence of o2 the production of ros o2 h2o2 and oh in the cu ii as iii system at ph 7 can be attributed to the following three possible pathways i the photo induced lmct process of cu oh 2 that directly produces oh which is discussed in this section ii cu i autooxidation that subsequently produces o2 h2o2 and oh and iii the photolysis of h2o2 that indirectly produces oh oh fig 2a shows that no obvious inhibition of as iii oxidation was observed upon the addition of etoh as an oh scavenger which implied that oh in the bulk of reactant solution ohbulk was not responsible for the oxidation of as iii in the cu ii as iii system the esr spectrum of reactant solution of the cu ii as iii system in the presence of 100 mm dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide as a spin trapping agent for oh exhibited the dmpo oh adduct signals before and after irradiation fig s11a however oh generation was excluded in this case since the same dmpo oh adduct signals were obtained in the cu ii dmpo mixed solution without as iii in the dark fig s11b this signal results from the direct reaction between cu ii and dmpo at high concentrations hanna et al 1992 no obvious signal appeared when the dmpo concentration was reduced to 10 mm fig s11c in addition no detectable phenol was found when using benzene as the probe which also confirmed ohbulk was absent in the cu ii as iii system another possible working oxidant related to oh could be the surface oh cu ii ohsurf that cannot be scavenged by etoh however tba was found to inhibit as iii oxidation fig 2a which appeared to be in conflict with that observed during the etoh scavenging experiments since tba can also scavenge ohbulk rather than the surface oh meanwhile in light of the tba reaction with cu iii with k cu iii tba 1 0 0 4 107 pham et al 2013 we propose that cu iii rather than the surface oh may be acting as the oxidant for as iii which will be discussed in the next section o2 and h2o2 these two ros are relevant to each other in the presence of reductive species such as fe ii ding et al 2018 liu et al 2022 and cu i pham et al 2013 which can activate oxygen molecules two biological molecules superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were tentatively used to probe the roles of o2 and h2o2 respectively both of them show the effective inhibition of as iii oxidation fig s12 however the amino acids in enzymes or specific structures e g porphyrin in cat can complex with cu ii huszánk and horváth 2005 jiménez et al 1987 which increases the dissolution of the cu oh 2 colloids fig s13 therefore sod or cat cannot be used as scavengers in the cu ii as iii system for o2 or h2o2 similar to those scavengers that disrupt the formation of cu oh 2 colloids considering the rate constant between as iii and o2 k as oh 3 o2 3 6 106 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2005 is two orders of magnitude lower than that between cu ii and o2 k cu ii o2 6 6 0 7 108 m 1 s 1 zafiriou et al 1998 o2 is incapable of directly oxidizing as iii in the presence of cu ii at a 40 fold higher concentration than as iii esr with dmpo used as a spin trapping agent did not provide any evidence of o2 in this work fig s11 in this case detecting h2o2 was particularly important to reveal the reaction mechanism fig 2b shows nearly no h2o2 dlh2o2 0 03 μm was detected in the cu ii oh system in the absence of as iii in both the oxic and anoxic solutions indicating as iii was important for h2o2 production therefore in the absence of as iii the possibility of oh production by the photo induced lmct process of cu oh 2 colloids as well as cu ii oh complexes cu oh 2 hν cu oh 0 oh or h2o2 produced by the recombination of oh 2 oh h2o2 can be ruled out in the cu ii as iii system only sub micromolar concentrations of h2o2 were detected with o2 at ph 7 and 10 h2o2 generation at ph 10 was faster than that observed at ph 7 during the initial stage of the reaction subsequent h2o2 depletion occurred under both ph conditions which was faster at ph 10 since most of as iii exists as as oh 3 at ph 7 h2o2 could not oxidize as iii directly pettine et al 1999 in addition the reaction of h2o2 with cu ii k cu ii h2o2 1 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2016 and the photolysis of h2o2 to produce oh were also negligible when a low concentration of h2o2 was produced in the cu ii as iii system fig s14 although o2 or h2o2 were not the predominant oxidant directly responsible for the oxidation of as iii their indirect contribution via the production of cu iii must be clarified in this scenario 3 3 production of cu iii probing the production of cu iii in the cu ii oh or cu ii as iii system is essential to reveal the photochemical mechanism but it is very difficult to work with the previously reported techniques raman analysis used for the characterization of cu iii wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 has not been used due to the low yield of cu iii produced during the in situ reaction mode and uvb irradiation is required for the photo induced reaction our attempts to carry out the methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso reaction which is frequently used to probing high valent metal failed with cu iii being identified to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on using pmso to probe cu iii and cu iii may not be able to oxidize pmso to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 due to the relatively lower redox potential of cu iii cu ii 1 57 v she popova and aksenova 2003 when compared with other higher valent metals e g fe iv fe iii 1 8 2 v co iii co ii 1 80 1 92 v vs she yu et al 2022 however the previously reported periodate colorimetry methods li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 face the challenge of the photolysis of periodate in photochemical systems fig s15 shows the characteristic absorption peak at 415 nm increases with the irradiation time in the cu ii oh or cu ii as iii systems according to the reported molar absorption coefficient of the cu iii periodate complex ε 415 6235 m 1 cm 1 hu and li 2013 the cu iii concentration at 3 h was calculated to be about 72 and 70 μm in the cu ii oh and cu ii as iii systems respectively which are much higher than as iii in light of oh production via the photolysis of periodate zhang et al 2021 it is believed that periodate simultaneously participates in cu iii production to eliminate the interference from oh in the cu ii as iii io4 system an excess of methanol was added together with periodate since the reaction between methanol and cu iii can be neglected at ph 7 k cu iii meoh 4 105 m 1 s 1 johnson et al 1988 it is also noteworthy that the hydroxide ligand may stabilize cu iii resulting in the lower redox potential of the cu oh 2 cu oh couple relative to cu3 cu2 aq meyerstein 1971 the addition of 25 mm methanol reduces the production of cu iii fig 3 a and the uv vis difference spectra between 20 and 0 min obtained for the cu ii as iii io4 system upon adding various concentrations of methanol are shown in fig 3b excess methanol 100 mm can completely quench the oh produced via the photolysis of io4 while the part that could not be quenched was ascribed to cu iii produced in the cu ii as iii system in order to determine the second order rate constant k cu iii as iii for the reaction between cu iii and as iii producing as iv followed very fast oxidation by o2 k as iv o2 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 klüning et al 1989 the cu i h2o2 thermal reaction system under neutral ph conditions was utilized to oxidize as iii under anaerobic conditions where cu iii can be regarded as the predominant oxidant xing et al 2018 fig 3c shows non linear fitting of the initial 1 min oxidation rates r 0 of as iii and the initial as iii concentrations in the range of 2 10 μm k cu iii as iii was then calculated to be 1 02 109 m 1 s 1 with the method described in text s4 this rate constant was smaller than that of the reaction between oh and as iii k oh as iii 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 klüning et al 1989 whereas it was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the reaction between cu iii and tba k cu iii tba 1 0 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 pham et al 2013 it must be pointed out that probing cu iii in the cu i h2o2 system using the periodate method was not successful due to excess cu i scavenging cu iii at a high reaction rate k cu iii cu i 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 ulanski and von sonntag 2000 the rate constants of the reactions involved in the anoxic cu i h2o2 system table s1 were imported into the kinetic simulation text s5 and the simulated kinetic curves obtained for the reactants and products during the reaction are shown in fig s16 the calculated concentrations of as iii at 1 min using the kinetic simulation are in good agreement with the experimental values r 2 0 99 shown in fig 3d 3 4 proposed mechanism for as iii oxidation above we demonstrated that the combined effects of the lmct process and cu iii oxidation result in as iii oxidation in the cu ii as iii system at ph 7 under uvb irradiation there are two possible mechanisms for the initial photochemical reaction in the cu ii as iii system i e lmcts of the cu ii oh complexes text s6 mechanism i scheme s1 versus cu ii as iii complexes text s7 mechanism ii scheme s2 in mechanism i the photolysis of the cu ii oh complexes produces oh and cu i via the lmct process r1 although they are thought to be of very low photoreactivity in the absence of as iii as discussed above however the possibility that as iii inhibits the recombination of oh and cu i by scavenging oh which may facilitate lmct of cu ii oh complexes must be excluded in the absence of oxygen the formed oh reacts with cu ii to produce cu iii oh and another molecule of cu i r2 k cu ii oh 3 1 108 m 1 s 1 goldstein et al 1992 however the

as iii in the cu ii as iii system without o2 was conducted in this case the reactions involving h2o2 and o2 can be simplified and cu iii produced via the reaction between cu ii and oh the as iv intermediate reacts with cu ii to form as v kinetic analysis text s6 shows the rate of as iii oxidation without o2 r as iii n2 0 was independent of as iii 0 according to mechanism i this was not in agreement with the experimental results shown in fig 4 a and b which showed r as iii n2 0 increases upon increasing as iii 0 eq 1 therefore mechanism i was not valid and the initial as iv should be

rates of as iii oxidation under oxic and anoxic conditions and h2o2 production increase upon increasing the initial as iii concentration and the significant linear fitting of these three parameters versus as iii 0 r 2 0 99 are presented in fig 4b mechanism ii in the presence of o2 was then demonstrated using kinetic analysis to explain the production of h2o2 and as iii oxidation text s8 the results confirm that the lmct process of the cu ii as iii complexes produces cu i and as iv which are responsible for the production of o2 via their reactions with o2 r11 and r17 k as iv o2 1 1 109 m

due to the cu ii cu i in the system this reaction is essential for the fast redox cycle of cu ii cu i h2o2 is mainly produced from the reaction between cu i and o2 r12 and depleted by cu i r13 it is noteworthy that as iv directly makes a greater contribution r17 than cu i r11 to o2 production and indirectly toward h2o2 production r12 and cu ii reduction to cu i r18 cu iii is produced predominantly from the reaction between cu i and h2o2 r13 and mainly depleted by as iii r7 as iii oxidation occurs via the lmct process of the cu ii as iii complexes and cu iii oxidation at a ratio of 62 38 text s8 o2 is mainly consumed by cu i and as iv and the concentration of dissolved oxygen did not change significantly during the reaction fig s17 the reaction rate constants involved in the cu ii as iii system with o2 table s2 were imported into kinetic simulation and the calculated concentrations of as iii as v and h2o2 were compared with their experimental values fig s18 fig 4d shows the calculated concentrations of as iii were nearly identical to the experimental values as iii exp 0 97 as iii cal r 2 0 98 while the calculated concentrations of h2o2 were less than the experimental values h2o2 exp 0 84 h2o2 cal r 2 0 70 and their correlation was less significant than that of as iii which could be due to the errors in the detection and simulation of h2o2 overall the following

s i v o 2 a challenge to mechanism ii is the weak complexation between cu ii and as iii at ph 7 since almost all of the as iii species exist as as oh 3 which can be separated with the suspended cu oh 2 colloids fig s6 the dft calculations also showed that it is difficult for as oh 3 to bind to the solid cu oh 2 in terms of its binding energy table s3 therefore a plausible explanation for the interaction between as oh 3 and the amorphous cu oh 2 colloids under neutral ph conditions could be outer sphere surface complexation occurring on the interfacial layer of the colloids adamescu et al 2016 2010 inorganic ligands salts typically form an outer sphere or weak electrostatic interactions with cu ii by sharing the water of hydration powell et al 2007 it has been reported that outer sphere cu ii complexes have lower photoreactivity than inner sphere complexes wu et al 2000 although the effect of coexisting matrix on non free radical reactions has selective merit to ros based reactions feng et al 2019 the inhibition of as iii oxidation by non photoreactive anions h2po4 hpo4 2 cl so4 2 and hco3 was observed fig s19 since h2po4 hpo4 2 are strong competitive ligands versus as oh 3 liu et al 2020 higher inhibition can be achieved with them in lower concentrations than cl so4 2 or hco3 in addition these anions can also inhibit the formation of cu oh 2 colloids figs s13 and s20 and consume radicals responsible for cu iii production after as iii oxidation the produced as v was adsorbed on the cu oh 2 colloid which cannot be detected in the filtered solution this indicates the formation of inner sphere complexes of as v mainly h2aso4 and haso4 2 on the cu oh 2 colloid despite the fact that the outer sphere complexes may exist simultaneously which is similar to as v adsorption on aluminum oxide or iron oxide arai et al 2001 r19 cu ii oh 2 oh 2 as iii hv cu ii oh 2 oh 2 as iii cu i oh as iv 3 5 application potential the complexation and photochemical processes of cu ii as iii complexes are strongly influenced by the presence of a high concentration of coexisting anions under neutral ph conditions figs s19 and s20 in addition fulvic acid 5 mg l 1 as a fraction of typical nom was found to inhibit as iii oxidation in the cu ii as iii system fig s21 the occurrence of the photochemistry of the cu ii as iii system in authentic water samples is challenged by the water quality when the system was introduced into local lake water it exhibited a lower efficiency ca 20 than that observed in ultrapure water fig s21 to validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism simulated pit water samples containing various concentrations of cu ii under neutral or weakly acidic ph conditions were irradiated with sunlight fig 5 shows that as iii was oxidized in the cu ii as iii system at ph 7 while a low efficiency was observed under acidic conditions over 8 h of irradiation as expected there was no significant change in the ph fig s22 obviously the effectiveness of the system mainly relies on the distribution of the cu ii and as iii species which was apparently related not only to the ph but also to the concentration of cu ii and as iii when the ph of water becomes neutral downstream from acid mine drainage amd ponds in the mining zones or ground water filled pits đorđievski et al 2018 the higher concentration of cu ii sub millimolar may facilitate the oxidation of as iii in terms of the proposed mechanism it is worth emphasizing that this mechanism for as iii oxidation may be important for the transformation of labile and mobile as iii species to less toxic and immobilized as v along with the precipitation of solid cu oh 2 as v was removed from the water samples thus the proposed mechanism in this work manifests its role in the self purification of cu ii and as iii contaminated water under irradiation with sunlight from the perspective of its engineering applications the photochemistry of cu ii complexes can be used for o2 activation to oxidize specific ligands regarded as contaminants it is believed that as iv is the key species activating o2 to generate ros in the cu ii as iii system therefore a suitable ligand is very important not only for the lmct process of the complex but also to its oxidative removal 4 conclusions this study investigated the photochemistry of cu ii in the presence of as iii in water under neutral ph conditions the results confirmed the complexation between as iii and cu ii hydroxides and the predominant photoactive cu ii species that induce the oxidation of as iii was attributed to the cu ii as iii complex rather than the cu ii oh complex the lmct process and cu iii which is produced from the cu i fenton reaction are two main pathways for the oxidation of as iii kinetic analysis and simulation proved the proposed mechanism the ph range of as iii oxidation could be extended to weakly acidic conditions in natural downstream water from copper smelters and mines this work helps to understand the environmental chemistry of cu ii and as iii and cu ii cu i based fenton like redox mechanism initiated by the photolysis of cu ii complexes credit authorship contribution statement yi
