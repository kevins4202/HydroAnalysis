5605,the ability to predict low river flows is critical to water resources planning to sustain a healthy river ecosystem however the estimation of reliable low flows is difficult for a variety of reasons including lack of its proper conceptualisation consequently arbitrary flow data transformation is done to enhance the influence of lower flows to help improve the goodness of fit during parameter optimisation in rainfall runoff modelling we carried out systematic model calibration using a range of flow data transformations to identify the one that results in best goodness of fits in 595 catchments across different rainfall regions of australia effects of transformation methods on the prediction of low flow surrogates namely the baseflow index bfi and cease to flow days or the zero flow days zfd were also investigated and regionalised we found that the square root transformation performed the best in modelling flow time series in all rainfall regions of australia and for different ranges of precipitation and forest cover model parameters from most flow transformations predicted the mean annual zfd and mean annual bfi well parameters from the log and reciprocal transformed flow were best in estimating the annual zfd while square root and no transformation did well in predicting the annual bfi the observed bfi and zfd were strongly correlated with the mean annual precipitation at a 5 significance level in all regions it is also the biggest influencing factor for zfd and bfi among several catchment attributes zfd and bfi had a strong negative correlation with each other implying that they may be interchangeable as low flow surrogates there was a clear and widespread reduction in the probability of baseflow occurrence during the australian millennium droughts of 2001 2010 the probabilities were reduced by up to 70 compared to the before drought baseflow probability keywords low flow estimation flow transformation baseflow cease to flow zero flow days 1 introduction the ability to predict low river flows and connectivity to groundwater systems during dry periods is critical to river operations and water resources planning low flow is quite sensitive to human activities like afforestation deforestation agriculture and extractive resource development e g mining which is compounded by climate change water metrics reflecting the entire range of river flow distribution are important to develop water plans to share water optimally between competing needs especially when the water is scarce reliable low flow estimates inform environmental watering and water quality management to sustain healthy ecosystems however whilst hydrological models can generally simulate the medium and high flows reasonably well accurate prediction of low flow remains a significant challenge nicolle et al 2014 the low flow prediction is difficult everywhere because of lack of established techniques and in some regions e g australia because of widely experienced semi arid conditions with a large majority of intermittent streams and the high runoff variability the definition of low flow is not universal and perhaps necessarily so as it depends on local hydroclimatic and other catchment characteristics and the purpose of its use efstratiadis et al 2014 pushpalatha et al 2012 smakhtin 2001 generally low flow has been defined as the flow of water in a stream during the drier period the year several low flow indicators including mean annual flow maf are adopted as an arbitrary upper bound of low flow various low flow indices are then expressed as a percentage of the maf smakhtin 2001 the absolute minimum flow has also been discussed ignoring the natural variability of streamflow in different regions aguilar and polo 2016 caruso 2002 evaluated temporal and spatial patterns of extreme flows in new zealand during a severe drought and used low flow as the mean annual 7 day low flow malf and 7 day low flow with a return period of 10 years 7q10 durations of low flow below malf and 7q10 were also used as indices of low flow laaha and bl√∂schl 2006 used a flow that is exceeded 95 of days q95 as their low flow whilst hannaford and marsh 2006 used annual minimum 7 and 30 day mean flows and number of days below the 70th and 90th percentile flows as surrogates of low flows in the uk no flow abstraction below q95 in all rivers was suggested implying that to be the minimum flow acreman et al 2008 we note that all these low flow indicators will invariably result in flow values that are zero for australian conditions where most of the streams are intermittent with some stream flowing for less than 30 of the time although zero flow may be taken as the lower bound of flow in intermittent and ephemeral streams smakhtin 2001 this is unhelpful for environmental flow planning various other indicators e g one percentile flow or arbitrarily defined low flow and low flow days were used in a recent study examining the comparative effects of coal and coal seam gas development on the environment over the no development scenario aryal et al 2018 in this study together with low flow we use runoff signatures the baseflow index bfi and cease to flow or the zero flow days zfd as low flow surrogates zhang et al 2018 baseflow index is the ratio of total baseflow volume to total flow volume over a given period several indices of zero flows e g period of consecutive zero flow days can be used as one of the indicators of stream ecosystem health larned et al 2010 modelling of low flow has been tricky although flow transformations to reduce the influence of higher flows on calibration have been practised oudin et al 2006 those transformations mostly have been arbitrary and without testing to see if the transformation is indeed most effective e g aryal et al 2018 chiew et al 1993 krause et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 pushpalatha et al 2012 evaluated the criteria for simulating low flow using a range of transformations to find that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse based on inverse reciprocal transformation is better suited in 940 french catchments since a majority of streams are perennial these transformations may not adequately characterise flow behaviour in regions with drier climate regimes such as australia therefore we will use six transformations to test their suitability and evaluate the best in rainfall regions across australia ecologists have sought the information on several low flow indicators e g the number of dry spells in streams as those play a major role in breeding and survival activities of invertebrates and other water dependent species including fish frogs turtles and waterbirds together with supporting the riverine flora and its ecosystems rolls et al 2012 sheldon 2017 stromberg et al 2007 furthermore effects of environmental changes on low flow e g baseflow are uncertain brown et al 2013 hamel et al 2017 price 2011 synthesised global literature investigating the relationship between baseflow and catchment characteristics concluding that the understanding of catchment characteristics on baseflow still remains to be resolved thus underscoring the need for further research therefore this research aims to enhance low flow prediction capability through understanding and knowledge of the processes influencing low flow and its surrogates by adapting hydrological models and data transformation and testing the models results against streamflow data from 595 catchments across australia the focus is to study the behaviour of low flow and its surrogates to elucidate its key drivers and the causative factors the evidence based low flow predictions will allow policymakers and water managers to make more informed decisions on water sharing e g in river basin plans and water infrastructure development impact of resource development on water dependent assets e g coal and coal seam gas development and river operations for environmental watering we ask the following questions i how to calibrate a model for low flow and what data transformation gives the best fit to observed low flows and its surrogates ii does the best transformation vary from region to region iii how effective is the regionalisation of the low flow modelling for estimating low flow or its surrogates in catchments with no observed data iv how do catchment characteristics and hydro climatic properties influence low flow and including baseflow and cease to flow events and v can we link the hydroclimatic characteristics catchment morphology and vegetation to the transformation type we also test our contention that lower flow characteristics vary from region to region and a single definition of low flow is neither possible nor meaningful the overall objective is to enhance hydrological modelling skills in predicting low flow metrics for each rainfall regions for estimation of low flow and its surrogates across australia to ground the technique behind the low flow modelling to evidence based knowledge the specific objectives include a applying six data transformations and explore their performance in modelling low flow and its surrogates b investigating the potential of parameter regionalisation for estimating low flow and its surrogate c exploring and quantifying effects of drought on low flow behaviour and d investigating how the flow surrogates hydroclimate variables and catchment characteristics are correlated the next section describes the area and data used in this study section 3 describes the methods used to investigate low flow characteristics and modelling the results are provided in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusion in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area and data daily streamflow precipitation evaporation and forest cover and other data of 595 catchments ranging from 50 to 4806 km2 median 346 km2 are available fig 1 these are a subset of 780 unregulated and unimpaired australian catchments not subjected to major diversion or irrigation https publications csiro au rpr pub pid csiro ep113194 ninety five per cent of selected catchments have 4 1 or less irrigated area and more than 80 have less than 1 area under any irrigation the flow data ranges from 1975 to 2012 with different extents of data gaps these catchments are distributed in four rainfall regions arid tropics winter and equiseasonal comprising 37 83 90 and 385 catchments respectively the regions represent arid to temperate as well as tropical and mediterranean climates with mean annual precipitation map of 530 mm 1465 mm 973 mm and 763 mm respectively during 2001 to 2009 much of south eastern australia experienced a prolonged dry condition known as the millennium drought that severely affected catchments runoff in the murray darling basin australian bureau of meteorology 2015 3 methods 3 1 low flow and its surrogates the model s ability to simulate low flow and its surrogates was tested by using a range of data transformations to enhance the lower flows and dampen the higher flows to different extents the baseflow and zero flow days were determined as described below 3 1 1 baseflow separation and calculation of baseflow index among many baseflow filters chapman 1999 found the use of one and three parameter filter leads to implausible results given by unrealistic base flow index and the baseflow hydrograph shape accordingly we used the two parameter filter by eckhardt 2005 as proposed by bates and aryal 2014 1 q b k a 1 b m a x q b k 1 b m a x 1 a y k 1 a b m a x subject to 1a q b 1 y 1 1b q b t y t where q b is the baseflow mm d y k is total streamflow mm d in time t d Œ± is the baseflow recession constant 1 d bmax is the maximum value of the bfi that can be produced by the filter and k is the number of ordinates in the storm hydrograph of interest the maximum value of baseflow index bmax is not an easy parameter to estimate and generally guesswork is applied based on catchment characteristics zhang et al 2017 in this study we used bmax values calculated using the baseflows derived from the one parameter filter lyne and hollick 1979 given by 2 q b k Œ± q b k 1 1 Œ± y k y k 1 2 subject to 1a and 1b the baseflow recession constant is determined for each of the 595 catchments using the observed data using a method by eckhardt 2008 the daily streamflow data y k which forms a part of the recession period for at least five days is considered such that 3 y k 3 y k 2 y k 1 y k y k 1 y k 2 eckhardt 2008 considers if the above were long enough the streamflow would consist entirely of baseflow if there is no groundwater recharge and assuming linear reservoir 4 y k 1 Œ± y k where Œ± is the baseflow recession constant used in eq 1 3 1 2 zero flow days calculation of zero flow cease to flow days is non trivial due to the asymptotic nature of streamflow cessation resulting in near zero flow for extended periods depending on the catchment size nature of flow and measurement limits of the streamflow gauge the amount that can be considered the zero flow can vary smakhtin 2001 the zero flow days are calculated using a staged process which assigned flow below a low threshold to zero flows depending on values of other observed flows using trial and error this threshold was gradually increased up to 0 5 mm any stream with greater than 0 5 mm runoff for the whole year is taken as perennial for that year this criterion is also adequate to evaluate hydrological model performance since there exists large uncertainty in hydrological models such as gr4j to simulate streamflow that approaches zero flow zhang et al 2014 3 1 3 effects of droughts on probability of baseflow in areas where baseflows have been sustained by regional groundwater or shallow aquifers prolonged absence of precipitation causes disconnection between groundwater and river channels resulting in cessation of the baseflow flow duration curves fdc of baseflow during the australian millennium drought of 2001 2010 see australian bureau of meteorology 2015 for the extent of the drought were compared with fdcs of that before the drought to determine the difference in the probability of any baseflow caused by the drought 3 2 hydrological model calibration we used the gr4j daily lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model perrin et al 2003 it is a four parameter x1 x2 x3 x4 model widely used under a variety of conditions e g coron et al 2012 li et al 2013 nepal et al 2017 the model uses precipitation and potential evapotranspiration depths mm as inputs it consists of two main storages the production store and the routing store fig s1 parameter x1 is the maximum capacity of the production store mm x2 determines the flux to from groundwater mm x3 is the maximum capacity of the routing store mm x4 controls the recession of the unit hydrograph day low flow in gr4j is generated by the percolation from the production store s outflow from the routing store r and the groundwater exchange function f which either imports water from or export water to the surrounding aquifers pushpalatha et al 2012 model calibrations are carried out using untransformed flow and six sets of flow transformations those are i log10 transform ii inverse reciprocal transform and iii to vi power transformations using 1 20 1 10 1 5 and 1 2 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 respectively exponents log and inverse transforms used a small error term to handle zero flows the optimisations were done using the modified kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 goodness of fit calculated using transformed values of both the observed and simulated flows for each of the six transformations the kge overcomes shortcomings of the widely used nse criterion using correlation coefficient between observed and simulated runoff r bias Œ≤ and variability ratio Œ≥ schaefli and gupta 2007 the ideal value of modified kge mkge is 1 nse and percentage bias pbias values were also calculated appendix a gives formulations for mkge nse and pbias a global optimiser the shuffled complex evolution sce ua duan et al 1994 was used for parameter optimisation the sce ua approach treats the global search as a process of natural evolution in this the number of sample population is divided into several complexes each of which is allowed to search in different directions these are then mixed and new complexes are formed through shuffling duan et al 1994 each point of a complex is a potential parent and varying combinations of these points produce offspring in every complex duan et al 1994 eckhardt and arnold 2001 to ensure that the evolution process is competitive and better parents contribute to the generation of offspring the points of lower fitness are replaced by better offsprings the global optimum is obtained by new points created in the feasible parameter space through mutation and recombination of the points into new complexes the shuffling duan et al 1994 eckhardt and arnold 2001 regionalisation of model parameters for estimation of low flow time series zfd and bfi is explored based on comparison of observed values with simulated values using the optimised donor parameters from single nearest neighbour catchments burn and boorman 1993 parajka et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 and from catchments considered similar based on physical similarity criteria zhang and chiew 2009 the nearest neighbour is chosen based on the shortest euclidian distance between two catchments centroids while three separate rank accumulated similarity criteria are evaluated to determine the similar catchments catchment attributes used as causative variables in this study are map mean annual potential evaporation pet catchment area forest cover and slope these attributes are also used in the causality analysis section 3 3 for each attribute the catchment with closest attribute value is considered ranked one to determine similar catchments for donor parameters catchments are ranked by i the aridity index pet map ii all causative variables with separate weight assigned to each based on the regression coefficients in table 1 and iii all causative variable with equal weight assigned each zhang and chiew 2009 donor catchments determined from all three physical similarity criteria are used in the regionalisation model evaluations are done using the mkge the nse and pbias are also used to judge the model s performance using on site and regionalised parameters the model performance in terms of the two low flow surrogates is tested using values derived from the observed and simulated flow time series we did not recalibrate the model using annual zfd and bfi as those from transformed flows are not physically meaningful 3 3 causality analysis 3 3 1 correlations the correlation and covariance among zfd bfi mean annual precipitation mean annual potential evaporation catchment area forest cover and slope are evaluated for the whole of australia and each of its rainfall regions shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 and normal quantile quantile plots are used to test the normality of these variables for data that do not follow the assumption of normality the spearman rank correlation can be used merz and bl√∂schl 2009 which gives a nonparametric measure of statistical dependence of variables without the assumption of data being normally distributed hauke and kossowski 2011 the spearman rank correlation coefficient œÅ is given by corder and foreman 2009 5 œÅ 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where di is the difference between each pair of the ranked variables x i y i and n is the number of ranked pair samples xiao et al 2016 relationships for data with ties in ranks are different from eq 5 cleff 2014 3 3 2 multiple linear regression in addition to one to one correlation regression relationship is established using the multiple linear regression to test the predictability of the two independent variables bfi and zfd by combining their most likely causative drivers de vera 1984 mcintyre et al 2007 past researchers have used linear regression to quantify a range of catchment characteristics on the baseflow index bloomfield et al 2009 lacey and grayson 1998 zhang et al 2013 the general model for multiple linear regression that relates dependent variable y to independent variables x s is given by 6 y Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 Œ≤ n x n where Œ≤0 is the intercept and Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ n are the regression coefficients associated with x 1 x 2 x n respectively although it is possible that relationships may be non linear we did not have a way of knowing the form of non linearly 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial patterns of baseflow and low flows across australia preliminary data analysis was done to investigate the characteristics of observed baseflow and zero flow days the distribution of mean annual bfis across australia generally showed lower bfis in semi arid most catchments of the pilbara region in northwest western australia and inland regions fig 2 a compared to coastal areas of south east victoria whole of tasmania tropical north queensland and south west of western australia similarly arid regions of the australian interior and semi arid pilbara region have mean annual zfds greater than 300 days streams in tasmania northern tropical regions and in east coast regions have much smaller zfds fig 2b 4 2 effect of the millennium drought on the baseflow the reduction in probability of baseflow correlated well with the extent of drought across australia during the millennium drought of 2001 2010 the flow duration curves for periods before and during the drought in the affected area containing 333 of 595 catchments australian bureau of meteorology 2015 were analysed they showed that greater than 80 of those catchments experienced a reduction in the probability of any occurrence of baseflow fig 3 more than 10 of the catchments showed greater than 30 reduction in the probability of baseflow for example for barker creek catchment in queensland 136208 the probability of any baseflow reduced from about 80 to 10 fig 3 4 3 causality analysis 4 3 1 correlation of annual zfd and bfi to other catchment attributes correlations among all causative and dependent variables were investigated fig 4 the spearman s rho œÅ and p values show that zfd is correlated with precipitation 0 7 and pet 0 29 at a 5 significance level p 0 01 overall the zfd was also negatively well correlated with slope œÅ 0 6 p 0 01 however no significant correlations between slope and zfd were found in arid and winter rainfall zones fig 4 precipitation pet and forest cover were correlated well with zfd at a 5 significance level across all rainfall regions the catchment area however had no correlation with zfd in the arid region but had a weak œÅ 0 13 but statistically significant correlation in the equiseasonal rainfall region a better correlation between zfd and catchment area was found in the other two regions good correlation also existed between forest cover and both the zfd œÅ 0 6 and bfi œÅ 0 45 the bfi was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to the pet catchment area had no statistically significant correlation with bfi in any of the rainfall regions bfi also had a strong and statistically significant positive correlation p 0 01 with precipitation in all rainfall regions the bfi however had no statistically significant correlation with pet in all regions except the equiseasonal rainfall region where it was negatively correlated œÅ 0 36 bfi had a good and statistically significant correlation with forest cover in all but the tropics region the zfd and bfi were also strongly negatively correlated œÅ 0 57 at 5 significance level for the whole of australia fig 4 as well as for each of the rainfall regions fig 5 these results are interpreted in the discussion section 4 3 2 regression relationships between zfd bfi and other variables the functional relationship between zfd and bfi and mean normalised causative variables using multiple linear regression showed that map pet and forest cover had a reasonable and statistically significant influence p 0 01 on zfd table 1 the catchment area however has almost no influence on zfd in combination with other variables the bfi also shows a similar dependence on these variables but with a smaller r 2 it is difficult to compare these results with those from earlier studies because of the different variables used in different studies 4 4 best transformation to model low flow 4 4 1 onsite calibrated parameters comparison of goodness of fit values showed that the square root transformation had the highest range of mkge calculated using transformed values of both the observed and simulated flow series for 595 catchments fig 6 a table 2 among all transformations the winter rainfall region had the highest median mkge and the arid had the lowest the square root transformation produced the best mkge also for different levels of forest cover and annual precipitation fig 6 b c as expected mkge values for all transformations are generally well correlated to each other at a 0 05 significance level fig s2 correlation of mkge between no transformation and the reciprocal transformation was the weakest œÅ 0 24 while the one fifth and one tenth transformations had the strongest correlation r 0 93 the square root transformation also resulted in best nse 0 77 and nearly the best pbias 0 6 4 4 2 regionalised parameters of three physical similarity criteria donor parameters from the first two resulted in worse goodness of fit mkge for simulating the flows than the one that assigned equal weight to all attributes consequently further results of only the best performing similarity donor are presented here unsurprisingly all the goodness of fit indicators using parameters from both the nearest neighbour donor and similarity based donor catchments were generally worse than those obtained from the on site calibrated parameters fig 7 table 2 4 5 best transformation for low flow surrogates 4 5 1 zero flow days estimation annual zfd values were estimated for all 595 catchments using observed and simulated flow series for all transformations using onsite calibrated parameters reciprocal and log transformations resulted in the better range of mkge and nse for annual zfd values across australia fig 8 a b suggesting their use for investigating maximum and minimum zfd in any given catchment the log transformation resulted in the best overall estimation of simulated long term mean annual zfds with mkge and nse of 0 95 and 0 97 respectively table 3 the performance of square root and reciprocal transformations were mixed in terms of mkge and nse as the second and third alternatives square root and log transformations resulted in better pbias values than the other transformations the model calibration using one tenth data transformation resulted in the worst overall mkge 0 56 and nse 0 60 and pbias 40 8 for zfd estimation using onsite calibrated parameters scatterplots of observed and simulated mean annual zfds depict their range across different rainfall regions fig 9 and the modelling performance for different rainfall regions log reciprocal and square root transformations gave a mix results for the best mkge and nse values tables 4 and 5 4 5 2 zfd regionalisation for all modelling the goodness of fit indicators obtained using the regionalised parameters were worse than those using the onsite calibrated parameters however the mkge values from regionalised parameters were greater than 0 6 for all except one tenth transformation table 3 scatterplots of observed and simulated zfd values using donor parameters from the nearest neighbour fig 10 a f and similarity criteria fig 10g l show performance slightly better than the former mkge nse and pbias values using data derived from the regression equation in table 1 were better than or comparable to those obtained from simulated regionalised parameters table 3 like the onsite calibrated parameters the nearest neighbour and similarity based donor parameters also resulted in better mkge values in most rainfall zones for log reciprocal and square root transformations table 4 nse values were mostly good for equiseasonal region using both two sets of donor parameters while they were much worse for the tropics region the rest had mixed results table 5 less than 10 pbias was observed in nearly all regions using the onsite and nearest neighbour donor parameters the similarity based donor parameters performed worse than those two in all except the arid region table s1 4 5 3 baseflow index estimation annual bfi values for all transformations were estimated using the observed and simulated flow series the square root and no transformations resulted in the best range of mkge for annual bfi values in all catchments fig s3 log and no transformation produced the best overall estimation of simulated mean annual bfis with mkge of 0 84 table 6 the model calibration using one tenth data transform resulted in the worst overall mkge 0 17 scatterplots of observed and simulated mean annual bfis show their value range across different rainfall regions fig 11 for the four rainfall regions three different transformations resulted in best mkge for mean annual bfis table 7 the mkges were much better than the nses table 8 4 5 4 bfi regionalisation for the whole of australia generally mkge values were better than nse values from both the nearest neighbour and similarity based donor parameters and were much closer to those from the onsite calibration table 6 the nearest neighbour parameters produced mixed results in terms of mkge and nse values for different transformation techniques depending on the rainfall regions table 7 table 8 the similarity based donor parameters also had a mixed performance depending on the rainfall region and their performance was also consistently worse than the nearest neighbour parameters the mkge from bfi derived from the regression relationship in table 1 was lower than those from the donor parameters the nse and pbias values however were better than or comparable to those obtained from regionalised parameters table 6 5 discussion low flow modelling has not been given the importance it deserves despite ongoing hydrological research knowledge of techniques for low flow estimation is rather limited generally modelling for low flow estimation is based on calibration using overall streamflow hydrographs and optimising on goodness of fit indicators e g nse that are biased towards higher flows mccuen et al 2006 staudinger et al 2011 on occasions when flow transformations are used to reduce the influence of higher flow on model calibration oudin et al 2006 they mostly have been arbitrary this is because limited research has tested the effectiveness of each transformation e g pushpalatha et al 2012 leading to no dependable method to model the low flow and its surrogates potentially leading to suboptimal low flow estimation e g aryal et al 2018 chiew et al 1993 zhang et al 2014 the optimal low flow estimation is also hampered by the lack of a proper definition of low flow as it depends on local hydroclimatic and other catchment characteristics and the purpose of its use low flow definition focussed on a given percentage of observed flows is not uniformly useful to all regions as it assigns different flow amounts in different catchments since the interest in low flow is not in its universal absolute or relative value but is in the existence of a minimum flow that serves a purpose for a riverine environment e g sustaining the crucial local stream ecosystem or fulfilling a consumptive or non consumptive use demand it may well also depend on how much flow or extent of no flow a given species within the ecosystem needs to survive therefore together with low flow we also studied estimation of its surrogates e g cease to flow days that the ecologists are interested in to evaluate the survival of stream ecosystems since zfd or the length of dry spells are critical to understanding the ecological health of the streams we investigated whether the flow transformations that provided better goodness of fit values were also better at estimating low flow surrogates as discussed earlier the threshold below which the flow is considered as zero varies from catchment to catchment therefore the estimation of zfds was not straightforward and had to be determined through an iterative process as described in section 3 1 2 the zfd had good and statistically significant correlations with catchment area forest cover slope pet and precipitation confirming that low flow characteristics vary from region to region and a single definition of low flow is neither possible nor meaningful the performance of different transformations for estimating annual low flow surrogates revealed that log reciprocal and square root transformations can be considered best as shown by the central tendencies mean or median of goodness of fit values one tenth or lower transformations performed the worst this interestingly suggests that the optimum flow calibration using a given transformation does not necessarily result in a corresponding better estimation of low flow surrogates therefore a few flow transformation techniques must be tested to ensure that crucial low flow surrogates are correctly estimated pushpalatha et al 2012 advised against using non transformed flow for evaluating low flows and suggested the use of reciprocal transform based on their study in the french catchments we found that the square root transformation provided better goodness of fit in australian streams than any other the non transformed flow was better in simulating low flow surrogates especially the mean annual bfi than a 1 10th or less power transformed flow this is because the bfi may also contain some medium flows ensued after a rainfall storm most transformations except very low order transformations were useful in predicting mean annual zero flow days and baseflow index we found that nearest neighbour parameters performed reasonably well in estimating low flow and its surrogates their performance however varied from region to region and transformation to transformation especially for the surrogates the parameters from physical similarity based donor catchments consistently performed worse than those from nearest neighbours regionalisation using nearest neighbours have been used with mixed results elsewhere for example merz and bl√∂schl 2004 found spatial proximity to be better for regionalisation than those dependent on catchment attributes chiew and siriwardena 2005 also found that parameters from nearest neighbour performed consistently better than those estimated from regionalisation relationships furthermore zhang and chiew 2009 also found that the nearest neighbour donors performed slightly better than those from the physical similarity approach in another study zhang et al 2014 compared the nearest neighbour method with three other spatial interpolation methods kriging spline and inverse distance weighting idw and found that nearest neighbour had a mixed performance for predicting hydrological indicators it is noted however that nearest neighbour with very different catchment and hydroclimatic attributes may not follow this rule li et al 2010 although modelling gives the needed flow time series we found that the mean annual zfd and bfi estimations using regression relations based on causative variables were better than those obtained from one tenth flow transformation using onsite calibrated parameters furthermore the performance of regression relationships in estimating mean annual zfd and bfi values was comparable to or better than those of the nearest neighbour or physically similarity based regionalisation techniques indicating the importance of such estimations in regionalisation the strong correlation between bfi and zfd for the whole of australia as well as for each rainfall regions suggests that either of these two surrogates can be used to estimate the other as the zfd can be determined from the observed streamflow data it can be used to estimate the bfi which is harder to determine as expected bfi and zfd also have a strong negative and positive correlation respectively with precipitation however both of those also had a statistically significant negative and positive correlation with the slope most of this correlation was dominated by the catchments in the equiseasonal rainfall region including the hilly tasmanian catchments fig 1 with lower zfds fig 2a the opposite applies to the bfi the determination of the cease to flow days is subjective as it depends on several factors e g accuracy of flow gauge at the lower scale which vary from catchment to catchment and therefore is harder to tract although its determination can have a marginal quantitative effect on our results our overall qualitative findings should be robust since based on the modelling and observation in australian catchments from a wide range of climates and rainfall regions these regions vary from arid to temperate and include tropical and mediterranean south west western australia climates and rainfall regions since the low flow modelling is investigated for each of these regions these findings should be transferrable to other geographies across the world finally our study investigates flow transformation methods for model parameter estimation geared towards the simulation of lower flows and identifies one that produces best goodness of fit each of these transformations enhances lower flows and dampens the higher flows by different extents to overcome the bias shown by goodness of fit indicators for high flows while evaluating the objective function during optimisation krause et al 2005 lower correlation of mkge between untransformed and reciprocally transformed flows was found compared to those between untransformed flow and log or square root transformed flows this implies that the reciprocal transform changes the flow characteristics more than any other transformation compared to that of the original data and that the mkge calculation is more sensitive to that transformation krause et al 2005 pushpalatha et al 2012 mention that the reciprocal transformation tends to focus on the 20 lowest flow on average as the reciprocal transformation both enhances the lower flows and dampens the higher flows to a proportionately much larger extent than any other transformations used here the question whether it serves the purpose of a low flow modelling needs to be resolved based on the objective of the modelling exercise this suggests that the best transformation for low flow modelling is dependent on the definition of low flow for a given purpose therefore the definition or range of low flow must be established to choose the transformation that serves the range for example if near zero flows are to be simulated well then reciprocal transformation may be the best as it gives the highest enhancement of the near zero flows as described in 4 5 1 6 summary and conclusion we studied the impact of different flow transformations on the modelling of lower flow and its surrogates using 595 catchments from different rainfall regions across australia the correlation of low flow surrogates and hydroclimatic variables and catchment characteristics were studied performance of three regionalisation techniques using donor parameters from nearest neighbour catchments and from catchments based on physical similarity criteria together with regression relationships were evaluated using annual time series and long term average values of zfd and bfi the derived regression relationship estimated the mean annual zfd well in comparison to the other regionalisation techniques estimation of mean annual bfi however was better with simulated regionalisation techniques the effect of the australian millennium drought on baseflow in the affected catchments was studied to quantify the changes in baseflow probability during the drought period we draw the following conclusions 1 the flow transformations resulting in the best goodness of fit did not change for different hydroclimatic regions rainfall range and extent of forest cover suggesting that none of the hydroclimatic variables or catchment characteristics influences the transformation type 2 most except very low order transformations were useful in predicting the long term mean annual zero flow days and baseflow index annual values of zfd however were predicted better with log and reciprocal transformation while untransformed and square root performed best for the annual bfi 3 there was a clear and widespread reduction in the probability of any baseflow in australia during the millennium drought of 2001 2010 the probabilities were reduced by up to 70 compared to the before drought baseflow probability 4 the mean annual baseflow index and zero flow cease to flow days are well correlated with mean annual precipitation and forest cover at a 5 significance level they are also strongly correlated with each other at a 5 significance level for all rainfall regions 5 the statistically significant multiple linear relationships between zfd and catchment area precipitation potential evaporation catchment slope and forest cover showed precipitation is the biggest influencing factor while the role of the catchment area is relatively insignificant credit authorship contribution statement santosh k aryal conceptualization

5605,the ability to predict low river flows is critical to water resources planning to sustain a healthy river ecosystem however the estimation of reliable low flows is difficult for a variety of reasons including lack of its proper conceptualisation consequently arbitrary flow data transformation is done to enhance the influence of lower flows to help improve the goodness of fit during parameter optimisation in rainfall runoff modelling we carried out systematic model calibration using a range of flow data transformations to identify the one that results in best goodness of fits in 595 catchments across different rainfall regions of australia effects of transformation methods on the prediction of low flow surrogates namely the baseflow index bfi and cease to flow days or the zero flow days zfd were also investigated and regionalised we found that the square root transformation performed the best in modelling flow time series in all rainfall regions of australia and for different ranges of precipitation and forest cover model parameters from most flow transformations predicted the mean annual zfd and mean annual bfi well parameters from the log and reciprocal transformed flow were best in estimating the annual zfd while square root and no transformation did well in predicting the annual bfi the observed bfi and zfd were strongly correlated with the mean annual precipitation at a 5 significance level in all regions it is also the biggest influencing factor for zfd and bfi among several catchment attributes zfd and bfi had a strong negative correlation with each other implying that they may be interchangeable as low flow surrogates there was a clear and widespread reduction in the probability of baseflow occurrence during the australian millennium droughts of 2001 2010 the probabilities were reduced by up to 70 compared to the before drought baseflow probability keywords low flow estimation flow transformation baseflow cease to flow zero flow days 1 introduction the ability to predict low river flows and connectivity to groundwater systems during dry periods is critical to river operations and water resources planning low flow is quite sensitive to human activities like afforestation deforestation agriculture and extractive resource development e g mining which is compounded by climate change water metrics reflecting the entire range of river flow distribution are important to develop water plans to share water optimally between competing needs especially when the water is scarce reliable low flow estimates inform environmental watering and water quality management to sustain healthy ecosystems however whilst hydrological models can generally simulate the medium and high flows reasonably well accurate prediction of low flow remains a significant challenge nicolle et al 2014 the low flow prediction is difficult everywhere because of lack of established techniques and in some regions e g australia because of widely experienced semi arid conditions with a large majority of intermittent streams and the high runoff variability the definition of low flow is not universal and perhaps necessarily so as it depends on local hydroclimatic and other catchment characteristics and the purpose of its use efstratiadis et al 2014 pushpalatha et al 2012 smakhtin 2001 generally low flow has been defined as the flow of water in a stream during the drier period the year several low flow indicators including mean annual flow maf are adopted as an arbitrary upper bound of low flow various low flow indices are then expressed as a percentage of the maf smakhtin 2001 the absolute minimum flow has also been discussed ignoring the natural variability of streamflow in different regions aguilar and polo 2016 caruso 2002 evaluated temporal and spatial patterns of extreme flows in new zealand during a severe drought and used low flow as the mean annual 7 day low flow malf and 7 day low flow with a return period of 10 years 7q10 durations of low flow below malf and 7q10 were also used as indices of low flow laaha and bl√∂schl 2006 used a flow that is exceeded 95 of days q95 as their low flow whilst hannaford and marsh 2006 used annual minimum 7 and 30 day mean flows and number of days below the 70th and 90th percentile flows as surrogates of low flows in the uk no flow abstraction below q95 in all rivers was suggested implying that to be the minimum flow acreman et al 2008 we note that all these low flow indicators will invariably result in flow values that are zero for australian conditions where most of the streams are intermittent with some stream flowing for less than 30 of the time although zero flow may be taken as the lower bound of flow in intermittent and ephemeral streams smakhtin 2001 this is unhelpful for environmental flow planning various other indicators e g one percentile flow or arbitrarily defined low flow and low flow days were used in a recent study examining the comparative effects of coal and coal seam gas development on the environment over the no development scenario aryal et al 2018 in this study together with low flow we use runoff signatures the baseflow index bfi and cease to flow or the zero flow days zfd as low flow surrogates zhang et al 2018 baseflow index is the ratio of total baseflow volume to total flow volume over a given period several indices of zero flows e g period of consecutive zero flow days can be used as one of the indicators of stream ecosystem health larned et al 2010 modelling of low flow has been tricky although flow transformations to reduce the influence of higher flows on calibration have been practised oudin et al 2006 those transformations mostly have been arbitrary and without testing to see if the transformation is indeed most effective e g aryal et al 2018 chiew et al 1993 krause et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 pushpalatha et al 2012 evaluated the criteria for simulating low flow using a range of transformations to find that the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse based on inverse reciprocal transformation is better suited in 940 french catchments since a majority of streams are perennial these transformations may not adequately characterise flow behaviour in regions with drier climate regimes such as australia therefore we will use six transformations to test their suitability and evaluate the best in rainfall regions across australia ecologists have sought the information on several low flow indicators e g the number of dry spells in streams as those play a major role in breeding and survival activities of invertebrates and other water dependent species including fish frogs turtles and waterbirds together with supporting the riverine flora and its ecosystems rolls et al 2012 sheldon 2017 stromberg et al 2007 furthermore effects of environmental changes on low flow e g baseflow are uncertain brown et al 2013 hamel et al 2017 price 2011 synthesised global literature investigating the relationship between baseflow and catchment characteristics concluding that the understanding of catchment characteristics on baseflow still remains to be resolved thus underscoring the need for further research therefore this research aims to enhance low flow prediction capability through understanding and knowledge of the processes influencing low flow and its surrogates by adapting hydrological models and data transformation and testing the models results against streamflow data from 595 catchments across australia the focus is to study the behaviour of low flow and its surrogates to elucidate its key drivers and the causative factors the evidence based low flow predictions will allow policymakers and water managers to make more informed decisions on water sharing e g in river basin plans and water infrastructure development impact of resource development on water dependent assets e g coal and coal seam gas development and river operations for environmental watering we ask the following questions i how to calibrate a model for low flow and what data transformation gives the best fit to observed low flows and its surrogates ii does the best transformation vary from region to region iii how effective is the regionalisation of the low flow modelling for estimating low flow or its surrogates in catchments with no observed data iv how do catchment characteristics and hydro climatic properties influence low flow and including baseflow and cease to flow events and v can we link the hydroclimatic characteristics catchment morphology and vegetation to the transformation type we also test our contention that lower flow characteristics vary from region to region and a single definition of low flow is neither possible nor meaningful the overall objective is to enhance hydrological modelling skills in predicting low flow metrics for each rainfall regions for estimation of low flow and its surrogates across australia to ground the technique behind the low flow modelling to evidence based knowledge the specific objectives include a applying six data transformations and explore their performance in modelling low flow and its surrogates b investigating the potential of parameter regionalisation for estimating low flow and its surrogate c exploring and quantifying effects of drought on low flow behaviour and d investigating how the flow surrogates hydroclimate variables and catchment characteristics are correlated the next section describes the area and data used in this study section 3 describes the methods used to investigate low flow characteristics and modelling the results are provided in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusion in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area and data daily streamflow precipitation evaporation and forest cover and other data of 595 catchments ranging from 50 to 4806 km2 median 346 km2 are available fig 1 these are a subset of 780 unregulated and unimpaired australian catchments not subjected to major diversion or irrigation https publications csiro au rpr pub pid csiro ep113194 ninety five per cent of selected catchments have 4 1 or less irrigated area and more than 80 have less than 1 area under any irrigation the flow data ranges from 1975 to 2012 with different extents of data gaps these catchments are distributed in four rainfall regions arid tropics winter and equiseasonal comprising 37 83 90 and 385 catchments respectively the regions represent arid to temperate as well as tropical and mediterranean climates with mean annual precipitation map of 530 mm 1465 mm 973 mm and 763 mm respectively during 2001 to 2009 much of south eastern australia experienced a prolonged dry condition known as the millennium drought that severely affected catchments runoff in the murray darling basin australian bureau of meteorology 2015 3 methods 3 1 low flow and its surrogates the model s ability to simulate low flow and its surrogates was tested by using a range of data transformations to enhance the lower flows and dampen the higher flows to different extents the baseflow and zero flow days were determined as described below 3 1 1 baseflow separation and calculation of baseflow index among many baseflow filters chapman 1999 found the use of one and three parameter filter leads to implausible results given by unrealistic base flow index and the baseflow hydrograph shape accordingly we used the two parameter filter by eckhardt 2005 as proposed by bates and aryal 2014 1 q b k a 1 b m a x q b k 1 b m a x 1 a y k 1 a b m a x subject to 1a q b 1 y 1 1b q b t y t where q b is the baseflow mm d y k is total streamflow mm d in time t d Œ± is the baseflow recession constant 1 d bmax is the maximum value of the bfi that can be produced by the filter and k is the number of ordinates in the storm hydrograph of interest the maximum value of baseflow index bmax is not an easy parameter to estimate and generally guesswork is applied based on catchment characteristics zhang et al 2017 in this study we used bmax values calculated using the baseflows derived from the one parameter filter lyne and hollick 1979 given by 2 q b k Œ± q b k 1 1 Œ± y k y k 1 2 subject to 1a and 1b the baseflow recession constant is determined for each of the 595 catchments using the observed data using a method by eckhardt 2008 the daily streamflow data y k which forms a part of the recession period for at least five days is considered such that 3 y k 3 y k 2 y k 1 y k y k 1 y k 2 eckhardt 2008 considers if the above were long enough the streamflow would consist entirely of baseflow if there is no groundwater recharge and assuming linear reservoir 4 y k 1 Œ± y k where Œ± is the baseflow recession constant used in eq 1 3 1 2 zero flow days calculation of zero flow cease to flow days is non trivial due to the asymptotic nature of streamflow cessation resulting in near zero flow for extended periods depending on the catchment size nature of flow and measurement limits of the streamflow gauge the amount that can be considered the zero flow can vary smakhtin 2001 the zero flow days are calculated using a staged process which assigned flow below a low threshold to zero flows depending on values of other observed flows using trial and error this threshold was gradually increased up to 0 5 mm any stream with greater than 0 5 mm runoff for the whole year is taken as perennial for that year this criterion is also adequate to evaluate hydrological model performance since there exists large uncertainty in hydrological models such as gr4j to simulate streamflow that approaches zero flow zhang et al 2014 3 1 3 effects of droughts on probability of baseflow in areas where baseflows have been sustained by regional groundwater or shallow aquifers prolonged absence of precipitation causes disconnection between groundwater and river channels resulting in cessation of the baseflow flow duration curves fdc of baseflow during the australian millennium drought of 2001 2010 see australian bureau of meteorology 2015 for the extent of the drought were compared with fdcs of that before the drought to determine the difference in the probability of any baseflow caused by the drought 3 2 hydrological model calibration we used the gr4j daily lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model perrin et al 2003 it is a four parameter x1 x2 x3 x4 model widely used under a variety of conditions e g coron et al 2012 li et al 2013 nepal et al 2017 the model uses precipitation and potential evapotranspiration depths mm as inputs it consists of two main storages the production store and the routing store fig s1 parameter x1 is the maximum capacity of the production store mm x2 determines the flux to from groundwater mm x3 is the maximum capacity of the routing store mm x4 controls the recession of the unit hydrograph day low flow in gr4j is generated by the percolation from the production store s outflow from the routing store r and the groundwater exchange function f which either imports water from or export water to the surrounding aquifers pushpalatha et al 2012 model calibrations are carried out using untransformed flow and six sets of flow transformations those are i log10 transform ii inverse reciprocal transform and iii to vi power transformations using 1 20 1 10 1 5 and 1 2 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 respectively exponents log and inverse transforms used a small error term to handle zero flows the optimisations were done using the modified kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 goodness of fit calculated using transformed values of both the observed and simulated flows for each of the six transformations the kge overcomes shortcomings of the widely used nse criterion using correlation coefficient between observed and simulated runoff r bias Œ≤ and variability ratio Œ≥ schaefli and gupta 2007 the ideal value of modified kge mkge is 1 nse and percentage bias pbias values were also calculated appendix a gives formulations for mkge nse and pbias a global optimiser the shuffled complex evolution sce ua duan et al 1994 was used for parameter optimisation the sce ua approach treats the global search as a process of natural evolution in this the number of sample population is divided into several complexes each of which is allowed to search in different directions these are then mixed and new complexes are formed through shuffling duan et al 1994 each point of a complex is a potential parent and varying combinations of these points produce offspring in every complex duan et al 1994 eckhardt and arnold 2001 to ensure that the evolution process is competitive and better parents contribute to the generation of offspring the points of lower fitness are replaced by better offsprings the global optimum is obtained by new points created in the feasible parameter space through mutation and recombination of the points into new complexes the shuffling duan et al 1994 eckhardt and arnold 2001 regionalisation of model parameters for estimation of low flow time series zfd and bfi is explored based on comparison of observed values with simulated values using the optimised donor parameters from single nearest neighbour catchments burn and boorman 1993 parajka et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 and from catchments considered similar based on physical similarity criteria zhang and chiew 2009 the nearest neighbour is chosen based on the shortest euclidian distance between two catchments centroids while three separate rank accumulated similarity criteria are evaluated to determine the similar catchments catchment attributes used as causative variables in this study are map mean annual potential evaporation pet catchment area forest cover and slope these attributes are also used in the causality analysis section 3 3 for each attribute the catchment with closest attribute value is considered ranked one to determine similar catchments for donor parameters catchments are ranked by i the aridity index pet map ii all causative variables with separate weight assigned to each based on the regression coefficients in table 1 and iii all causative variable with equal weight assigned each zhang and chiew 2009 donor catchments determined from all three physical similarity criteria are used in the regionalisation model evaluations are done using the mkge the nse and pbias are also used to judge the model s performance using on site and regionalised parameters the model performance in terms of the two low flow surrogates is tested using values derived from the observed and simulated flow time series we did not recalibrate the model using annual zfd and bfi as those from transformed flows are not physically meaningful 3 3 causality analysis 3 3 1 correlations the correlation and covariance among zfd bfi mean annual precipitation mean annual potential evaporation catchment area forest cover and slope are evaluated for the whole of australia and each of its rainfall regions shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 and normal quantile quantile plots are used to test the normality of these variables for data that do not follow the assumption of normality the spearman rank correlation can be used merz and bl√∂schl 2009 which gives a nonparametric measure of statistical dependence of variables without the assumption of data being normally distributed hauke and kossowski 2011 the spearman rank correlation coefficient œÅ is given by corder and foreman 2009 5 œÅ 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where di is the difference between each pair of the ranked variables x i y i and n is the number of ranked pair samples xiao et al 2016 relationships for data with ties in ranks are different from eq 5 cleff 2014 3 3 2 multiple linear regression in addition to one to one correlation regression relationship is established using the multiple linear regression to test the predictability of the two independent variables bfi and zfd by combining their most likely causative drivers de vera 1984 mcintyre et al 2007 past researchers have used linear regression to quantify a range of catchment characteristics on the baseflow index bloomfield et al 2009 lacey and grayson 1998 zhang et al 2013 the general model for multiple linear regression that relates dependent variable y to independent variables x s is given by 6 y Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 Œ≤ n x n where Œ≤0 is the intercept and Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 Œ≤ n are the regression coefficients associated with x 1 x 2 x n respectively although it is possible that relationships may be non linear we did not have a way of knowing the form of non linearly 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial patterns of baseflow and low flows across australia preliminary data analysis was done to investigate the characteristics of observed baseflow and zero flow days the distribution of mean annual bfis across australia generally showed lower bfis in semi arid most catchments of the pilbara region in northwest western australia and inland regions fig 2 a compared to coastal areas of south east victoria whole of tasmania tropical north queensland and south west of western australia similarly arid regions of the australian interior and semi arid pilbara region have mean annual zfds greater than 300 days streams in tasmania northern tropical regions and in east coast regions have much smaller zfds fig 2b 4 2 effect of the millennium drought on the baseflow the reduction in probability of baseflow correlated well with the extent of drought across australia during the millennium drought of 2001 2010 the flow duration curves for periods before and during the drought in the affected area containing 333 of 595 catchments australian bureau of meteorology 2015 were analysed they showed that greater than 80 of those catchments experienced a reduction in the probability of any occurrence of baseflow fig 3 more than 10 of the catchments showed greater than 30 reduction in the probability of baseflow for example for barker creek catchment in queensland 136208 the probability of any baseflow reduced from about 80 to 10 fig 3 4 3 causality analysis 4 3 1 correlation of annual zfd and bfi to other catchment attributes correlations among all causative and dependent variables were investigated fig 4 the spearman s rho œÅ and p values show that zfd is correlated with precipitation 0 7 and pet 0 29 at a 5 significance level p 0 01 overall the zfd was also negatively well correlated with slope œÅ 0 6 p 0 01 however no significant correlations between slope and zfd were found in arid and winter rainfall zones fig 4 precipitation pet and forest cover were correlated well with zfd at a 5 significance level across all rainfall regions the catchment area however had no correlation with zfd in the arid region but had a weak œÅ 0 13 but statistically significant correlation in the equiseasonal rainfall region a better correlation between zfd and catchment area was found in the other two regions good correlation also existed between forest cover and both the zfd œÅ 0 6 and bfi œÅ 0 45 the bfi was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to the pet catchment area had no statistically significant correlation with bfi in any of the rainfall regions bfi also had a strong and statistically significant positive correlation p 0 01 with precipitation in all rainfall regions the bfi however had no statistically significant correlation with pet in all regions except the equiseasonal rainfall region where it was negatively correlated œÅ 0 36 bfi had a good and statistically significant correlation with forest cover in all but the tropics region the zfd and bfi were also strongly negatively correlated œÅ 0 57 at 5 significance level for the whole of australia fig 4 as well as for each of the rainfall regions fig 5 these results are interpreted in the discussion section 4 3 2 regression relationships between zfd bfi and other variables the functional relationship between zfd and bfi and mean normalised causative variables using multiple linear regression showed that map pet and forest cover had a reasonable and statistically significant influence p 0 01 on zfd table 1 the catchment area however has almost no influence on zfd in combination with other variables the bfi also shows a similar dependence on these variables but with a smaller r 2 it is difficult to compare these results with those from earlier studies because of the different variables used in different studies 4 4 best transformation to model low flow 4 4 1 onsite calibrated parameters comparison of goodness of fit values showed that the square root transformation had the highest range of mkge calculated using transformed values of both the observed and simulated flow series for 595 catchments fig 6 a table 2 among all transformations the winter rainfall region had the highest median mkge and the arid had the lowest the square root transformation produced the best mkge also for different levels of forest cover and annual precipitation fig 6 b c as expected mkge values for all transformations are generally well correlated to each other at a 0 05 significance level fig s2 correlation of mkge between no transformation and the reciprocal transformation was the weakest œÅ 0 24 while the one fifth and one tenth transformations had the strongest correlation r 0 93 the square root transformation also resulted in best nse 0 77 and nearly the best pbias 0 6 4 4 2 regionalised parameters of three physical similarity criteria donor parameters from the first two resulted in worse goodness of fit mkge for simulating the flows than the one that assigned equal weight to all attributes consequently further results of only the best performing similarity donor are presented here unsurprisingly all the goodness of fit indicators using parameters from both the nearest neighbour donor and similarity based donor catchments were generally worse than those obtained from the on site calibrated parameters fig 7 table 2 4 5 best transformation for low flow surrogates 4 5 1 zero flow days estimation annual zfd values were estimated for all 595 catchments using observed and simulated flow series for all transformations using onsite calibrated parameters reciprocal and log transformations resulted in the better range of mkge and nse for annual zfd values across australia fig 8 a b suggesting their use for investigating maximum and minimum zfd in any given catchment the log transformation resulted in the best overall estimation of simulated long term mean annual zfds with mkge and nse of 0 95 and 0 97 respectively table 3 the performance of square root and reciprocal transformations were mixed in terms of mkge and nse as the second and third alternatives square root and log transformations resulted in better pbias values than the other transformations the model calibration using one tenth data transformation resulted in the worst overall mkge 0 56 and nse 0 60 and pbias 40 8 for zfd estimation using onsite calibrated parameters scatterplots of observed and simulated mean annual zfds depict their range across different rainfall regions fig 9 and the modelling performance for different rainfall regions log reciprocal and square root transformations gave a mix results for the best mkge and nse values tables 4 and 5 4 5 2 zfd regionalisation for all modelling the goodness of fit indicators obtained using the regionalised parameters were worse than those using the onsite calibrated parameters however the mkge values from regionalised parameters were greater than 0 6 for all except one tenth transformation table 3 scatterplots of observed and simulated zfd values using donor parameters from the nearest neighbour fig 10 a f and similarity criteria fig 10g l show performance slightly better than the former mkge nse and pbias values using data derived from the regression equation in table 1 were better than or comparable to those obtained from simulated regionalised parameters table 3 like the onsite calibrated parameters the nearest neighbour and similarity based donor parameters also resulted in better mkge values in most rainfall zones for log reciprocal and square root transformations table 4 nse values were mostly good for equiseasonal region using both two sets of donor parameters while they were much worse for the tropics region the rest had mixed results table 5 less than 10 pbias was observed in nearly all regions using the onsite and nearest neighbour donor parameters the similarity based donor parameters performed worse than those two in all except the arid region table s1 4 5 3 baseflow index estimation annual bfi values for all transformations were estimated using the observed and simulated flow series the square root and no transformations resulted in the best range of mkge for annual bfi values in all catchments fig s3 log and no transformation produced the best overall estimation of simulated mean annual bfis with mkge of 0 84 table 6 the model calibration using one tenth data transform resulted in the worst overall mkge 0 17 scatterplots of observed and simulated mean annual bfis show their value range across different rainfall regions fig 11 for the four rainfall regions three different transformations resulted in best mkge for mean annual bfis table 7 the mkges were much better than the nses table 8 4 5 4 bfi regionalisation for the whole of australia generally mkge values were better than nse values from both the nearest neighbour and similarity based donor parameters and were much closer to those from the onsite calibration table 6 the nearest neighbour parameters produced mixed results in terms of mkge and nse values for different transformation techniques depending on the rainfall regions table 7 table 8 the similarity based donor parameters also had a mixed performance depending on the rainfall region and their performance was also consistently worse than the nearest neighbour parameters the mkge from bfi derived from the regression relationship in table 1 was lower than those from the donor parameters the nse and pbias values however were better than or comparable to those obtained from regionalised parameters table 6 5 discussion low flow modelling has not been given the importance it deserves despite ongoing hydrological research knowledge of techniques for low flow estimation is rather limited generally modelling for low flow estimation is based on calibration using overall streamflow hydrographs and optimising on goodness of fit indicators e g nse that are biased towards higher flows mccuen et al 2006 staudinger et al 2011 on occasions when flow transformations are used to reduce the influence of higher flow on model calibration oudin et al 2006 they mostly have been arbitrary this is because limited research has tested the effectiveness of each transformation e g pushpalatha et al 2012 leading to no dependable method to model the low flow and its surrogates potentially leading to suboptimal low flow estimation e g aryal et al 2018 chiew et al 1993 zhang et al 2014 the optimal low flow estimation is also hampered by the lack of a proper definition of low flow as it depends on local hydroclimatic and other catchment characteristics and the purpose of its use low flow definition focussed on a given percentage of observed flows is not uniformly useful to all regions as it assigns different flow amounts in different catchments since the interest in low flow is not in its universal absolute or relative value but is in the existence of a minimum flow that serves a purpose for a riverine environment e g sustaining the crucial local stream ecosystem or fulfilling a consumptive or non consumptive use demand it may well also depend on how much flow or extent of no flow a given species within the ecosystem needs to survive therefore together with low flow we also studied estimation of its surrogates e g cease to flow days that the ecologists are interested in to evaluate the survival of stream ecosystems since zfd or the length of dry spells are critical to understanding the ecological health of the streams we investigated whether the flow transformations that provided better goodness of fit values were also better at estimating low flow surrogates as discussed earlier the threshold below which the flow is considered as zero varies from catchment to catchment therefore the estimation of zfds was not straightforward and had to be determined through an iterative process as described in section 3 1 2 the zfd had good and statistically significant correlations with catchment area forest cover slope pet and precipitation confirming that low flow characteristics vary from region to region and a single definition of low flow is neither possible nor meaningful the performance of different transformations for estimating annual low flow surrogates revealed that log reciprocal and square root transformations can be considered best as shown by the central tendencies mean or median of goodness of fit values one tenth or lower transformations performed the worst this interestingly suggests that the optimum flow calibration using a given transformation does not necessarily result in a corresponding better estimation of low flow surrogates therefore a few flow transformation techniques must be tested to ensure that crucial low flow surrogates are correctly estimated pushpalatha et al 2012 advised against using non transformed flow for evaluating low flows and suggested the use of reciprocal transform based on their study in the french catchments we found that the square root transformation provided better goodness of fit in australian streams than any other the non transformed flow was better in simulating low flow surrogates especially the mean annual bfi than a 1 10th or less power transformed flow this is because the bfi may also contain some medium flows ensued after a rainfall storm most transformations except very low order transformations were useful in predicting mean annual zero flow days and baseflow index we found that nearest neighbour parameters performed reasonably well in estimating low flow and its surrogates their performance however varied from region to region and transformation to transformation especially for the surrogates the parameters from physical similarity based donor catchments consistently performed worse than those from nearest neighbours regionalisation using nearest neighbours have been used with mixed results elsewhere for example merz and bl√∂schl 2004 found spatial proximity to be better for regionalisation than those dependent on catchment attributes chiew and siriwardena 2005 also found that parameters from nearest neighbour performed consistently better than those estimated from regionalisation relationships furthermore zhang and chiew 2009 also found that the nearest neighbour donors performed slightly better than those from the physical similarity approach in another study zhang et al 2014 compared the nearest neighbour method with three other spatial interpolation methods kriging spline and inverse distance weighting idw and found that nearest neighbour had a mixed performance for predicting hydrological indicators it is noted however that nearest neighbour with very different catchment and hydroclimatic attributes may not follow this rule li et al 2010 although modelling gives the needed flow time series we found that the mean annual zfd and bfi estimations using regression relations based on causative variables were better than those obtained from one tenth flow transformation using onsite calibrated parameters furthermore the performance of regression relationships in estimating mean annual zfd and bfi values was comparable to or better than those of the nearest neighbour or physically similarity based regionalisation techniques indicating the importance of such estimations in regionalisation the strong correlation between bfi and zfd for the whole of australia as well as for each rainfall regions suggests that either of these two surrogates can be used to estimate the other as the zfd can be determined from the observed streamflow data it can be used to estimate the bfi which is harder to determine as expected bfi and zfd also have a strong negative and positive correlation respectively with precipitation however both of those also had a statistically significant negative and positive correlation with the slope most of this correlation was dominated by the catchments in the equiseasonal rainfall region including the hilly tasmanian catchments fig 1 with lower zfds fig 2a the opposite applies to the bfi the determination of the cease to flow days is subjective as it depends on several factors e g accuracy of flow gauge at the lower scale which vary from catchment to catchment and therefore is harder to tract although its determination can have a marginal quantitative effect on our results our overall qualitative findings should be robust since based on the modelling and observation in australian catchments from a wide range of climates and rainfall regions these regions vary from arid to temperate and include tropical and mediterranean south west western australia climates and rainfall regions since the low flow modelling is investigated for each of these regions these findings should be transferrable to other geographies across the world finally our study investigates flow transformation methods for model parameter estimation geared towards the simulation of lower flows and identifies one that produces best goodness of fit each of these transformations enhances lower flows and dampens the higher flows by different extents to overcome the bias shown by goodness of fit indicators for high flows while evaluating the objective function during optimisation krause et al 2005 lower correlation of mkge between untransformed and reciprocally transformed flows was found compared to those between untransformed flow and log or square root transformed flows this implies that the reciprocal transform changes the flow characteristics more than any other transformation compared to that of the original data and that the mkge calculation is more sensitive to that transformation krause et al 2005 pushpalatha et al 2012 mention that the reciprocal transformation tends to focus on the 20 lowest flow on average as the reciprocal transformation both enhances the lower flows and dampens the higher flows to a proportionately much larger extent than any other transformations used here the question whether it serves the purpose of a low flow modelling needs to be resolved based on the objective of the modelling exercise this suggests that the best transformation for low flow modelling is dependent on the definition of low flow for a given purpose therefore the definition or range of low flow must be established to choose the transformation that serves the range for example if near zero flows are to be simulated well then reciprocal transformation may be the best as it gives the highest enhancement of the near zero flows as described in 4 5 1 6 summary and conclusion we studied the impact of different flow transformations on the modelling of lower flow and its surrogates using 595 catchments from different rainfall regions across australia the correlation of low flow surrogates and hydroclimatic variables and catchment characteristics were studied performance of three regionalisation techniques using donor parameters from nearest neighbour catchments and from catchments based on physical similarity criteria together with regression relationships were evaluated using annual time series and long term average values of zfd and bfi the derived regression relationship estimated the mean annual zfd well in comparison to the other regionalisation techniques estimation of mean annual bfi however was better with simulated regionalisation techniques the effect of the australian millennium drought on baseflow in the affected catchments was studied to quantify the changes in baseflow probability during the drought period we draw the following conclusions 1 the flow transformations resulting in the best goodness of fit did not change for different hydroclimatic regions rainfall range and extent of forest cover suggesting that none of the hydroclimatic variables or catchment characteristics influences the transformation type 2 most except very low order transformations were useful in predicting the long term mean annual zero flow days and baseflow index annual values of zfd however were predicted better with log and reciprocal transformation while untransformed and square root performed best for the annual bfi 3 there was a clear and widespread reduction in the probability of any baseflow in australia during the millennium drought of 2001 2010 the probabilities were reduced by up to 70 compared to the before drought baseflow probability 4 the mean annual baseflow index and zero flow cease to flow days are well correlated with mean annual precipitation and forest cover at a 5 significance level they are also strongly correlated with each other at a 5 significance level for all rainfall regions 5 the statistically significant multiple linear relationships between zfd and catchment area precipitation potential evaporation catchment slope and forest cover showed precipitation is the biggest influencing factor while the role of the catchment area is relatively insignificant credit authorship contribution statement santosh k aryal conceptualization

5606,this study interprets 11 years 2006 to 2016 and 6 months march to august in 2017 of respectively monthly and daily isotopic Œ¥d and Œ¥18o monitoring of rain at douala cameroon a humid tropical station in western africa the main scope is to analyze the climate controls on precipitation isotopes at different timescales firstly we examine the annual cycles of Œ¥18o over the 11 years of survey the annual cycle exhibits a w shape that is quite reproducible from year to year with two minima in spring and autumn periods based on back trajectory calculations and remote sensing observations of water vapor isotopic composition we show that the observed depletion in spring and autumn is due to strong convective activity along air mass trajectories the same effect of convective activity can be observed at the daily timescale at seasonal and daily time scales the isotopic composition is also strongly tied to the convective organization and cloud types more depleted precipitation is associated with larger areas of high clouds very low to low clouds are observed in july august mid level to high clouds are dominant in june and high to very high clouds characterize march april may thus explaining the enriched depleted values in summer spring finally this paper highlights the importance of large scale meteorological conditions controls on precipitation stable isotope composition in the gulf of guinea keywords Œ¥18o water vapor convective activity gpcp precipitation air back trajectory 1 introduction the atmosphere is an essential hydrological environment it contains all the water vapor 0 001 of all the water of the earth delmas et al 2005 that forms the clouds by condensation which can then generate precipitations liquid solid as a function of air temperature the atmosphere is also an essential place of transfer and exchange for the global functioning of the earth system its multiple interactions with the oceans the continent and the biosphere make it an important study environment for understanding global changes according to ipcc 1998 these global changes must affect tropical regions which are among the most vulnerable to possible anthropogenically induced climatic changes during the last decade the scientific community environmental institutions governments and local communities have increased their awareness of the importance of current tropical climate variability based on the premise that under increasing anthropogenic influence on the climate changes in regional and global circulation may lead to an intensification of extreme events i e floods or severe droughts e g pohl et al 2017 in parallel the use of stable isotopes of water both Œ¥d and Œ¥18o has provided insights in the study of atmospheric water cycle e g rozanski et al 1993 araguas araguas et al 2000 celle jeanton et al 2004 the key to understand the future climate changes or global changes relationship between Œ¥d and Œ¥18o in natural meteoric waters serves as a foundational reference to determine regional and local deviations from equilibrium processes and the potential origin of the water vapor moreover water losses due to evaporation incorporation of recycled atmospheric moisture and or mixing between isotopically distinct reservoirs leave a unique water fingerprint that can be used for climate reconstructions moerman et al 2013 recently isotopic composition of tropical meteoric water has also proven its usefulness as an indicator of modern climate variability vuille and werner 2005 ishizaki et al 2012 sanchez murillo 2015 while in extra tropical climates stable isotope variations in meteoric waters have been successfully explained by air temperature variability dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 the case of tropical humid regions proved to be very much complex since temperature variability is much weaker the amount effect occurs as a result of convective precipitation and can be nonlocal vimeux et al 2005 he et al 2015 the degree of organization of convective systems has been shown to impact the atmospheric conditions at the large scale tobin et al 2012 wing et al 2017 consistently it also impacts the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation many additional factors can potentially play a role such as orographic effects continental recycling or moisture origin combined with complex microclimates rozanski et al 1993 lachniet and paterson 2009 these problematics are of major importance for the paper what are the key factors controlling stable isotope ratios of meteoric waters in humid tropical areas of west and central africa answers to this question will contribute to the understanding of atmospheric processes in the study region unlike arid and semi arid african areas where isotopic variability has already been assessed in previous work e g taupin et al 1997 celle jeanton et al 2001 risi et al 2008b 2010 lutz et al 2011 tremoy 2012 tremoy et al 2014 the gulf of guinea gog region and tropical humid areas in central africa fig 1 are still under documented in isotopic data there the atmospheric cycle of water remains poorly documented and isotopic data may help improve their knowledge indirectly the paper will help to understand rainfall variability in douala and the origin of precipitated water through isotopic analysis in this objective we took advantage of the long term monthly monitoring set up in douala cameroon fig 1 as part of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip framework iaea wmo 2018 from 2006 in parallel a daily sampling has been carried out in 2017 this article represents the first valuation of precipitation isotope data in the region datasets of other gnip stations in the gog and central africa fig 1 are also integrated in this study together with remote sensing data that document water vapor isotopic composition convective activity and cloud properties 2 regional climate the west african monsoon wam dynamic seasonality in the tropics is mostly determined by the seasonal migrations of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz preston white and tyson 1988 schott et al 2003 a highly energetic feature of earth climate that is associated with deep convection the itcz or meteorological equator in africa is the result of convergence between the harmattan northeasterly dry wind and monsoon southwesterly wet wind in low levels of the atmosphere sultan and janicot 2000 fink et al 2018 nicholson and grist 2003 have shown that the rain belt over western and central africa is positively correlated with the migration of the itcz during the boreal spring mar apr may itcz holds a position of about 5 n half of the rain belt is located over the continent and the other one on the ocean waliser and gautier 1993 the mean rainfall amount calculated for this period according to gnip measurements is 232 mm for douala 138 4 mm for cotonou 137 7 mm for sao tome and 114 1 mm for bangui the relative humidity increases significantly over the continent and sea surface temperatures sst present their annual peak 27 c during this period dezfuli and nicholson 2013 then itcz abruptly shifts from 5 n to 10 n in june july sultan and janicot 2003 the so called monsoon jump causes a subsidence in the southern part of the gog and the development of a cold tongue complex gu and adler 2004 low ssts suppress then partly or totally rainfall as e g in sao tome fig 3 however in the gulf of biafra fig 1 ssts remain high enough 26 c to partly maintain convection odekunle and eludoyin 2008 moisture increases over land and enhances rainfall there simultaneously convective activity migrates to the north and the monsoon flow crosses the equator from south gog to north guinean and then sahelian africa at this time of the year jun jul aug a rainfall peak is observed fig 3 in douala 618 3 mm and bangui 145 5 mm in cotonou ogu et al 2016 have also shown a good correlation between ssts and precipitation connecting rainfall amount in june to anomalously warm waters of the gulf of benin the abruptness of the northward progression of the itcz is in sharp contrast to its withdrawal which appears as a more progressive southward progression like most regions in the equatorial latitudes the guinean coast central africa thus benefits from a double passage of the itcz in spring and autumn the unimodal distribution and the highest rainfall amount 4000 mm year observed in douala fig 3 is very particular as the whole region is generally characterized by a bimodal distribution with two precipitation maxima in april may or may june and october november or september october with a total amount lower than 2000 mm year the concave shape of the gulf of biafra may induce a convergence of southwesterly winds and topographic ascents forced by the relief of mount cameroon 4000 m fig 1 this mesoscale convergence and orographic influence vondou et al 2017 are all the more marked if the monsoon flow is intense and thick which is the case in the core of the summer monsoon when the itcz is far to the north these regional features can explain the unimodal regime observed at douala while further west in cotonou and in southern hemisphere sao tome the annual cycle is bimodal 3 data and methods 3 1 rainfall sampling and isotopes analyses this paper makes use of the 106 monthly samples of rainwater that have been collected from july 2006 to december 2016 at the gnip station of douala see details of the gnip stations in table 1 and fig 1 the sampling followed the standard protocols iaea 2012 samples were collected by using a rain gauge which consists of a plastic funnel diameter 10 cm coupled with a filter mesh to prevent contaminations by debris a 5 cm layer of mineral oil has been systematically added into the rain collector to avoid fractionation of the collected rainwater for each month total rainfall was collected samples were taken regularly stored in a totalizer and kept at 4 c before being transferred in 50 ml amber glass bottles tightly capped and sent to the international atomic energy agency iaea laboratory in vienna austria for stable isotopes determinations stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen were then analyzed by laser absorption spectroscopy following the method described by penna et al 2010 the rainwater daily survey was conducted from march to august 2017 at the campus of the university of douala x 9 7461 y 4 062 z 17 m a s l approximately at 7 km from the gnip station seventy samples were collected using a palmex rain gauge that presents the advantage to avoid evaporation without using medicinal paraffin oil gr√∂ning et al 2012 daily samples were stored using the same protocols as for monthly rainfall isotopes analyses were performed at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france by using a liquid water stable isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research aggarwal et al 2006 penna et al 2010 ratios of 18o Œ¥16o and 2h 1h are expressed in delta units parts per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical precision is 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 1 for deuterium local meteorological settings precipitation amount and duration air temperatures vapor pressure were provided by the national weather direction of cameroon 3 2 tropospheric emission spectrometer tes data with the advent of new technology in stable water isotopes such as spectrometer on board satellite it has become easier to analyze isotopic composition of water vapor based on indirect laser measurement aemisegger et al 2012 tes instrument on board on the aura satellite is a nadir viewing infrared fourier transform spectrometer from which the deuterium content of water vapor Œ¥dv can be retrieved worden et al 2006 worden et al 2007 the sensitivity of the retrieval is typically larger between 900 hpa and 400 hpa with a peak at 700 hpa on average Œ¥dv retrieved over these levels has a precision of 1 5 or about 15 parts per thousand per mile relative to standard mean ocean water uncertainties are reduced by averaging several measurements worden et al 2006 risi et al 2013 then the precision is sufficient for characterizing the global distribution of evaporation and condensation processes worden et al 2006 there is on average 1 8 degrees of freedom for Œ¥dv retrievals in the tropics worden et al 2012 meaning that vertical profiles bear information on more than one level to ensure good data quality we selected only the measurements for which the quality flag is set to unity and for which the degree of freedom of the signal is higher than 0 5 risi et al 2013 here to document the water vapor composition as close as possible to the surface we use the Œ¥d values retrieved by tes at 900 hpa from 2004 to 2008 at a monthly scale and we focus on a multi year mean seasonal cycle and temporal variations rather than absolute values 3 3 convection and cloud datasets convective activity associated with the west african monsoon wam was analyzed using the global precipitation climate project one degree daily gpcp 1dd huffman et al 2001 data the same dataset is used for both monthly and daily analyses

demonstrated in many studies e g huffman et al 1995 1997 adler et al 2017 through a comparison with other proxies of convection or by multi proxy studies olr outgoing longwave radiation and trmm tropical rainfall measurement mission gpcp products are a combination of precipitation data provided by a multiple sources of satellite gauge sg they are obtained by optimally merging precipitation

each data type mean sg products are computed by combining multi satellite estimates with rain gauge analysis huffman et al 2001 in this study we use the gpcp 1dd 1 degree grid over the entire globe at 1 day both for monthly and daily analyses to document the cloud types and convection organization in western central africa we use a cloud type ct product issued from geostationary msg meteosat second generation satellite data and developed by safnwc satellite application facilities in support to nowcasting msg algorithms for more information see http www nwcsaf org web guest scientific documentation clouds types are determined from their top temperature or pressure and for high level clouds from their opacity dommo et al 2018 seze 2015 the safnwc ct offers a classification of clouds into 12 classes free land free sea very low clouds low clouds medium clouds high clouds very high clouds thin cirrus medium cirrus thick cirrus fractional clouds and semi transparent above low or medium clouds at 3 km spatial resolution for regions close to msg sub satellite point 0 n 0e and a time step of 15 min for our study purposes focus is given to the altitude of clouds low medium high etc and their organization as measured by the spatial extent of connected cloud pixels to seek links with the isotopic contents of rainfall data are extracted for the region bounded by latitudes 10s 10 n and longitudes 0e 20e for the period from march to june 2017 based on these images very high clouds areas corresponding to very organized convective system around douala were calculated for each event using arcgis mapping software through the tool measure indeed since the contours of cloud masses or pixels are approximated to geometric forms circle rectangular trapezoidal shape etc the areas were calculated based on these forms this calculation was performed after a zoom of the image at 100 in order to limit uncertainties or errors by using the tool of the software for events with duration of 15 min we have taken the maximum cloud area throughout the duration of rainfall 3 4 back trajectories in order to assess the influence of air masses pathways on the isotopic composition of precipitation and the importance of the location of convective activity in the region we compute air back trajectories at 6 h time steps 10 days prior to arrival in the sampling site this operation was performed for monthly and daily scales when isotopic data is available winds at 900 hpa were simulated by using the general circulation model lmdz5a hourdin et al 2013 guided by reanalysis products era interim dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf back trajectories speed and direction were then computed with a 2d algorithm similar to vimeux et al 2005 in order to approximate the moisture transport near the ground surface 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual cycles of isotopes Œ¥ in precipitation of douala fig 2 presents the seasonal variations of Œ¥18o from 2006 to 2016 the annual cycle of Œ¥ is quite reproducible from year to year it exhibits a w shape most of the time with minima in spring and autumn periods because of this rather good reproducibility of Œ¥18o seasonal cycle from year to year we further consider a multi year mean seasonal cycle in the section 4 2 and investigate the factors associated with this w cycle of Œ¥ however the magnitude varies widely from one year to another for a given month such inter annual variability could either reflect variations i in the climate seasonal background or ii in synoptic intra seasonal variability which could modify seasonal mean fields through upscaling processes or eventually affect isotopic variations these hypotheses are tested and discussed below 4 2 factors responsible for precipitation isotopes variations at seasonal scale 4 2 1 highlighting of a regional context seasonal variations of Œ¥18o and precipitation amount for gnip stations in gog and central africa region are presented in fig 3 similarities can be observed in the seasonal evolution of Œ¥18o at cotonou bangui douala and sao tome fig 3 i from january february to april may Œ¥18o decreases ii an enrichment in isotopic content is observed in summer in june july or august depending on the station iii isotope contents then decrease until september or october and iv a new increase occurs until december this relative homogeneity suggests that isotopic seasonality is controlled by mechanisms of at least on regional scale correlation coefficients between Œ¥18o precipitation and temperature are very low for all the stations table 2 the weak correlation between Œ¥18o and air temperature table 2 highlights the lack of temperature effect in the gog and central africa regions despite the fact that in tropical maritime stations a local amount effect is often observed rozanski et al 1993 the poor correlation between Œ¥18o and local precipitation amount shows that this effect does not dominate the isotopic seasonality in central western africa therefore it is clear that the local climate parameters do not control the seasonal variation of Œ¥ in precipitation thus we hypothesize that convective activity at the regional scale could be involved this hypothesis is tested in the next section for the douala station 4 2 2 influence of regional convective activity many studies in china e g gao et al 2013 he et al 2015 yu et al 2016 guo et al 2017 shao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 india and indo pacific region e g chakraborty et al 2016 rahul and gosh 2016 cai et al 2016 he et al 2018 south america e g hoffmann et al 2003 vimeux et al 2005 villacis et al 2008 samuels crow et al 2014 and sahelian africa e g risi et al 2008b 2010b tremoy et al 2012 based on both observations and models have shown that convective activity that occurs upstream the pathway of air parcels is a major control of rainwater isotope composition in the tropics at daily seasonal and inter annual timescales convective activity is known to deplete water vapor through 3 main processes i precipitating downdrafts either at the convective scale or at the meso scale risi et al 2008a kurita 2013 bring down depleted water vapor from the mid troposphere to the boundary layer ii rain evaporation when concerning a small proportion of each raindrop adds depleted water vapor to the lower troposphere worden et al 2007 risi et al 2010 iii rain vapor diffusive exchanges in a saturated atmosphere can also deplete the water vapor lawrence et al 2004 gpcp precipitations are used to examine convective activity upstream the sampling site of douala fig 4 presents monthly mean precipitation and back trajectories calculated for each month as expected moisture comes from the atlantic ocean most of the time and precipitation at this timescale is entirely controlled by the seasonal migration of the itcz in november and december moisture comes from the north east without undergoing any convection from december to january there is an abrupt shift of air parcel from north easterly to south westerly in line with the beginning of long northward migration of the itcz from march to may spring season air masses undergo strong convective activity over the gulf of guinea during the period june august air parcels still travel over the gulf of guinea but air masses undergo a weak convective activity because the itcz has shifted further north over the sahel region from september to october autumn period the itcz retreats to the south so that air masses undergo strong convective activity once again the shift between october and november trajectories marks the transition to the dry season when the strength of monsoon winds weakens fig 5 by presenting the variability of monthly mean gpcp precipitation along the back trajectory over time in hours towards douala station for may spring period august summer period october autumn period and january winter period shows a quantitative analysis it reveals where along the trajectories convective activity becomes higher and thus impacts Œ¥18o of douala rainfall overall the gpcp precipitation data show an increasing trend from the southern atlantic to douala along the air back trajectories at 7 days 168 h to the sampling site precipitation is higher in august and may first significant changes are observable at 120 h when a decrease increase of gpcp precipitation occurs in january october it substantially increases in may and august at 3 days 72 h before douala convective activity is stronger in october and to a lesser extent in may than august and january since isotopic value of rainfall is depleted in spring and autumn figs 2 and 3 Œ¥18o seems to be mostly sensitive to convective activity only in the past few days before reaching douala this is consistent with the memory of convection in the isotopic composition of water as discussed by risi et al 2008a tuinenburg et al 2015 and gao et al 2013 stable isotopes are imprint of convection along air parcel trajectories and in the case of douala precipitation seems to acquire its signature on average 72 h before reaching the station fig 6 shows the precipitation averaged over the past 72 h 3 days along the backward trajectories for each month the precipitation Œ¥18o is significantly anti correlated with this average precipitation r2 0 60 this supports our hypothesis that convective activity along trajectories significantly controls the seasonality of precipitation Œ¥18o in douala in summary the moisture source at douala is most of the year in the gog two seasonal precipitation maxima along the trajectories fig 6 are related to the seasonal migration of the itcz thus even if precipitation in douala shows a unimodal regime with a rainfall peak in august Œ¥18o records bimodal cycle as in the source area this suggests that the regional convective activity is the main control of the isotopic composition of precipitation in douala in the following section we use the isotopic information of the water vapor to provide additional insights about the main processes controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation 4 2 3 information from the isotopic composition of water vapor Œ¥v the isotopic composition of the water vapor provided by the tes instrument can help to understand the variation of Œ¥ in precipitation it allows separating the relative effect of processes acting along the trajectories of the water vapor Œ¥ dv and local post condensational processes Œ¥ dp Œ¥ dv following the equation below 1 Œ¥ dp Œ¥ dv Œ¥ dp Œ¥ dv Œ¥dv and Œ¥dp fig 7 a show a similar seasonality r 2 0 57 both Œ¥dv and Œ¥dp present depleted values in april may and september october fig 7a corresponding to more active convection in the gog in addition there is always a positive offset between the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation thus the isotopic information on the advected water vapor is preserved in the isotopic composition of the rain however absolute values of Œ¥dp and tes Œ¥dv should not be directly compared tes was calibrated using in situ measurements on local sites worden et al 2012 but not specifically in west africa in addition tes data at 900 hpa represent an average over several vertical levels in the lower troposphere therefore focus is given instead to temporal variability yet assuming that the vertical Œ¥d gradient between 1000 and 900 hpa is constant Œ¥dp Œ¥dv variations can be interpreted as variations in the rain water vapor interaction processes the regression between Œ¥dp and Œ¥dv gives a slope of a1 1 whereas the values for Œ¥dp and Œ¥dp Œ¥dv are a2 0 68 and r 2 0 18 this insignificant r2 attests that the rain water vapor interaction processes do not control the Œ¥dp variations based on the slope a1 Œ¥dv accounts for 100 of the Œ¥dp variability a similar case has been reported in western tropical pacific conroy et al 2016 this confirms that the seasonal variability of the isotopic composition of rainfall is predominantly influenced by Œ¥dv i e by the processes that affect water vapor along the trajectories this means that the variability of Œ¥dp Œ¥dv acts only to dampen and to blur the variability of Œ¥dp for instance the evolution of Œ¥dp Œ¥dv presents a maximum in spring fig 7b and autumn when Œ¥dv is most depleted 4 3 main controls of precipitation isotopic composition at daily scale 4 3 1 temporal evolution of Œ¥ and link with upstream convection daily Œ¥18o in douala varies from 0 3 to 7 4 with a mean value of 3 0 close to the monthly weighted mean of 2 8 calculated for the 2006 2016 period these daily data appear then to be representative of the 2006 2016 mean seasonal cycles moreover as for the seasonal scale daily rainwater fig 8 is most depleted in spring april may and more enriched in summer july august in order to investigate upstream convection effects we calculated the correlation between the Œ¥18o of rainfall and the precipitation recorded at 1 to 3 days earlier along back trajectories table 3 in march april and august the correlations are significant 95 suggesting that like for the seasonal timescale the daily evolution is driven by convection along trajectories yet this mechanism is insufficient to explain completely the variability of Œ¥ in daily precipitation especially in may june and july 4 3 2 factors besides the upstream convection intensity continental recycling and organization of convective systems continental recycling the goal of this section is to test whether continental recycling has significant influence on Œ¥18o at the daily time scale to that end we calculated the percentage of time of the air parcel over the continent during the last 3 days 72 h along the trajectory hereafter fland this calculation was relatively simple since air back trajectories have been computed at 6 h time steps and then for instance the travel time of 36 h of air mass over the continent will correspond to fland equal to 50 however for this issue we calculated air back trajectories at different heights 800 850 900 950 and 980 hpa since moisture is typically transported at a spectrum of heights as it is the boundary layer that feeds the convection and it is with the water vapor from low layers that the rain is re evaporated investigation was not performed above 800 hpa results from this quantitative calculation not shown here of moisture transport for different heights show that there is no difference between them especially since we focus only on air back trajectory at 3 days before douala in june july and august fland is 0 for all rainy days except on june 11th when fland 25 table 4 presents the detailed results for spring period and shows an anti correlation between Œ¥18o and fland precipitation are thus more depleted when the transit time of air parcels over the continent is long during the last 3 days along the back trajectory this is in contradiction with the expected effect of a continental recycling since Œ¥ is controlled in spring by a convection upstream the sampling site the fact that Œ¥18o is more depleted with the increase of fland suggests a significant influence of convection intensity over the continent indeed xu and zipser 2012 demonstrated that convection is generally more intense over the land than over the ocean the more intense the convection along trajectories the more depleted the water vapor therefore moisture origin has only an indirect effect on isotopic composition of precipitation depending on whether air mass goes through regions of a strong convection the positive and significant correlation between fland and gpcp precipitation confirms this mechanism therefore we suggest that Œ¥ variations at a daily timescale are partly controlled by the intensity of the convection along air parcel trajectories and that continental recycling is not involved influence of the organization of convective systems several studies have shown that convective systems deplete the low level water vapor more efficiently when they are more organized lawrence et al 2004 risi et al 2008 tremoy et al 2014 probably because moister air in larger systems allows for more efficient rain vapour diffusive exchanges risi et al 2008a in addition convective systems deplete more vapor as they extend to the upper troposphere lacour et al 2018 and as the extent of their anvils measured by the fraction of stratiform clouds is large aggarwal et al 2016 these features are typically associated with higher degrees of organization here we test whether the type of convective organization has a significant impact on the Œ¥18o observed at douala by using satellite image from the saf classification we define 3 classes of clouds in the region from march to august according to their altitude i very low to low ii medium to high and ii very high clouds the low cloud class is mostly observed in july august table 5 and fig 9 the mid level to high cloud class is dominant in june and the very high clouds are mostly present in spring fig 9 the area of cloud systems increases throughout spring reaching a maximum in may and decreases again from june in july august the areas are too small to be calculated spatial organization of convective systems also determines rainfall event duration the latter increases globally from march to august fig 10 ranging from 12 min to 1278 min i e 21 h combining this information on cloud altitude cloud area and rainfall duration we can infer that in march april most convective systems correspond to deep mesoscale convective systems mcs mapes and houze 1993 laing and fritsch 1997 mathon et al 2001 fink et al 2006 tremoy et al 2014 in may june convective systems are mcs that become even larger and organized but extend less deep in altitude in june in contrast in july august convective systems are isolated characterized by small cumulonimbus in the middle of low to medium clouds fig 9b that follow one another throughout the day explaining the apparent long durations of rain events the type of convective organization emerges then as an important control on the precipitation isotopic composition cloud surface shows a significant negative correlation with precipitation Œ¥18o from march to june table 5 the larger the cloud area the more depleted the precipitation in addition the more the convective system is organized the longer is the duration of the event laurent and machado 2002 consistently event scale Œ¥18o is anti correlated with event duration in march r 2 0 44 april r 2 0 54 may r 2 0 64 and more weakly in june r 2 0 34 the longer is the convective system the more depleted is the precipitation these different types of convective organization can also explain the isotopic evolution at the seasonal scale in spring the organized deep mcs deplete the water vapor efficiently leading to the observed precipitation Œ¥18o minimum in contrast in july august the shallower small isolated cumulonimbus clouds deplete the water vapor less efficiently leading to the observed precipitation Œ¥18o maximum in spite of the local precipitation maximum observed at douala surprisingly the r2 between cloud area and Œ¥18o are close and even higher in may and june than that observed between Œ¥18o and upstream precipitation table 3 after verifying that upstream convection gpcp precipitation recorded at 72 h to douala along the trajectory and cloud area are uncorrelated table 5 we can assert that two independent parameters control Œ¥18o upstream convection intensity and the size of the convective system both at local scale and at upstream see the table 5 5 conclusion and outlook this study aims at investigating the processes controlling the year to year inter annual month to month seasonality and day to day intra seasonal variability of rainfall isotopic composition in the gulf of guinea gog region and especially in douala cameroon we observed that the annual cycle of Œ¥ is quite reproducible most years presents a w shape with minima in spring and autumn Œ¥18o and Œ¥dv appear to be mainly controlled by upstream convection and by the size of convective systems we identified that the continental recycling doesn t impact the rainwater isotopes in the humid tropical area of the gog in particular the Œ¥18o minima in spring and autumn are associated with strong convective activity in the gog and large long lived and deep mesoscale convective systems whereas the Œ¥18o maximum in july august is associated with reduced convective activity in the gog and isolated shallow convective systems the importance of upstream convective activity in controlling the Œ¥18o of precipitation at various time scales is in line with a large body of recent research in different tropical regions influenced by a monsoon system the importance of the type of convective system size organization vertical extension is also consistent with a growing number of recent studies but this is the first time that it is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of such a large number of individual convective systems the findings of this study obtained by integrating in situ and satellite measurements advance our understanding of the temporal variation of precipitation stable isotopes in humid tropical area such as douala and shed a new light on the importance of large scale meteorological conditions controls on precipitation stable isotope composition in the gog notwithstanding numerical climate modelling could be a useful complementary approach to further analyse the factors controlling rainfall isotopic composition in and around douala moreover the climate in douala being representative of a small area with monomodal rainfall regime surrounded by area with bimodal rainfall high resolution modelling is necessary to correctly capture such particularity more robust conclusions could be obtained with larger samples which could be obtained by extending the length of the record to better understand the role of convective organization on the isotopic composition sampling at the intra event scale is necessary finally measuring the isotopic composition in the water vapor in addition to precipitation would be useful to isolate the post condensation effects credit authorship contribution statement b

5606,this study interprets 11 years 2006 to 2016 and 6 months march to august in 2017 of respectively monthly and daily isotopic Œ¥d and Œ¥18o monitoring of rain at douala cameroon a humid tropical station in western africa the main scope is to analyze the climate controls on precipitation isotopes at different timescales firstly we examine the annual cycles of Œ¥18o over the 11 years of survey the annual cycle exhibits a w shape that is quite reproducible from year to year with two minima in spring and autumn periods based on back trajectory calculations and remote sensing observations of water vapor isotopic composition we show that the observed depletion in spring and autumn is due to strong convective activity along air mass trajectories the same effect of convective activity can be observed at the daily timescale at seasonal and daily time scales the isotopic composition is also strongly tied to the convective organization and cloud types more depleted precipitation is associated with larger areas of high clouds very low to low clouds are observed in july august mid level to high clouds are dominant in june and high to very high clouds characterize march april may thus explaining the enriched depleted values in summer spring finally this paper highlights the importance of large scale meteorological conditions controls on precipitation stable isotope composition

water vapor 0 001 of all the water of the earth delmas et al 2005 that forms the clouds by condensation which can then generate precipitations liquid solid as a function of air temperature the atmosphere is also an essential place of transfer and exchange for the global functioning of the earth system its multiple interactions with the oceans the continent and the biosphere make it an important study environment for understanding global changes according to ipcc 1998 these global changes must affect tropical regions which are among the most vulnerable to possible anthropogenically induced climatic changes during the last decade the scientific community environmental institutions governments and local communities have increased their awareness of the importance of current tropical climate variability based on the premise that under increasing anthropogenic influence on the climate changes in regional and global circulation may lead to an intensification of extreme events i e floods or severe droughts e g pohl et al 2017 in parallel the use of stable isotopes of water both Œ¥d and Œ¥18o has provided insights in the study of atmospheric water cycle e g rozanski et al 1993 araguas araguas et al 2000 celle jeanton et al 2004 the key to understand the future climate changes or global changes relationship between Œ¥d and Œ¥18o in natural meteoric waters serves as a foundational reference to determine regional and local deviations from equilibrium processes and the potential origin of the water vapor moreover water losses due to evaporation incorporation of recycled atmospheric moisture and or mixing between isotopically distinct reservoirs leave a unique water fingerprint that can be used for climate reconstructions moerman et al 2013 recently isotopic composition of tropical meteoric water has also proven its usefulness as an indicator of modern climate variability vuille and werner 2005 ishizaki et al 2012 sanchez murillo 2015 while in extra tropical climates stable isotope variations in meteoric waters have been successfully explained by air temperature variability dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 the case of tropical humid regions proved to be very much complex since temperature variability is much weaker the amount effect occurs as a result of convective precipitation and can be nonlocal vimeux et al 2005 he et al 2015 the degree of organization of convective systems has been shown to impact the atmospheric conditions at the large scale tobin et al 2012 wing et al 2017 consistently it also impacts the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation many additional factors can potentially play a role such as orographic effects continental recycling or moisture origin combined with complex microclimates rozanski et al 1993 lachniet and paterson 2009 these problematics are of major importance for the paper what are the key factors controlling stable isotope ratios of meteoric waters in humid tropical areas of west and central africa answers to this question will contribute to the understanding of atmospheric processes in the study region unlike arid and semi arid african areas where isotopic variability has already been assessed in previous work e g taupin et al 1997 celle jeanton et al 2001 risi et al 2008b 2010 lutz et al 2011 tremoy 2012 tremoy et al 2014 the gulf of guinea gog region and tropical humid areas in central africa fig 1 are still under documented in isotopic data there the atmospheric cycle of water remains poorly documented and isotopic data may help improve their knowledge indirectly the paper will help to understand rainfall variability in douala and the origin of precipitated water through isotopic analysis in this objective we took advantage of the long term monthly monitoring set up in douala cameroon fig 1 as part of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip framework iaea wmo 2018 from 2006 in parallel a daily sampling has been carried out in 2017 this article represents the first valuation of precipitation isotope data in the region datasets of other gnip stations in the gog and central africa fig 1 are also integrated in this study together with remote sensing data that document water vapor isotopic composition convective activity and cloud properties 2 regional climate the west african monsoon wam dynamic seasonality in the tropics is mostly determined by the seasonal migrations of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz preston white and tyson 1988 schott et al 2003 a highly energetic feature of earth climate that is associated with deep convection the itcz or meteorological equator in africa is the result of convergence between the harmattan northeasterly dry wind and monsoon southwesterly wet wind in low levels of the atmosphere sultan and janicot 2000 fink et al 2018 nicholson and grist 2003 have shown that the rain belt over western and central africa is positively correlated with the migration of the itcz during the boreal spring mar apr may itcz holds a position of about 5 n half of the rain belt is located over the continent and the other one on the ocean waliser and gautier 1993 the mean rainfall amount calculated for this period according to gnip measurements is 232 mm for douala 138 4 mm for cotonou 137 7 mm for sao tome and 114 1 mm for bangui the relative humidity increases significantly over the continent and sea surface temperatures sst present their annual peak 27 c during this period dezfuli and nicholson 2013 then itcz abruptly shifts from 5 n to 10 n in june july sultan and janicot 2003 the so called monsoon jump causes a subsidence in the southern part of the gog and the development of a cold tongue complex gu and adler 2004 low ssts suppress then partly or totally rainfall as e g in sao tome fig 3 however in the gulf of biafra fig 1 ssts remain high enough 26 c to partly maintain convection odekunle and eludoyin 2008 moisture increases over land and enhances rainfall there simultaneously convective activity migrates to the north and the monsoon flow crosses the equator from south gog to north guinean and then sahelian africa at this time of the year jun jul aug a rainfall peak is observed fig 3 in douala 618 3 mm and bangui 145 5 mm in cotonou ogu et al 2016 have also shown a good correlation between ssts and precipitation connecting rainfall amount in june to anomalously warm waters of the gulf of benin the abruptness of the northward progression of the itcz is in sharp contrast to its withdrawal which appears as a more progressive southward progression like most regions in the equatorial latitudes the guinean coast central africa thus benefits from a double passage of the itcz in spring and autumn the unimodal distribution and the highest rainfall amount 4000 mm year observed in douala fig 3 is very particular as the whole region is generally characterized by a bimodal distribution with two precipitation maxima in april may or may june and october november or september october with a total amount lower than 2000 mm year the concave shape of the gulf of biafra may induce a convergence of southwesterly winds and topographic ascents forced by the relief of mount cameroon 4000 m fig 1 this mesoscale convergence and orographic influence vondou et al 2017 are all the more marked if the monsoon flow is intense and thick which is the case in the core of the summer monsoon when the itcz is far to the north these regional features can explain the unimodal regime observed at douala while further west in cotonou and in southern hemisphere sao tome the annual cycle is bimodal 3 data and methods 3 1 rainfall sampling and isotopes analyses this paper makes use of the 106 monthly samples of rainwater that have been collected from july 2006 to december 2016 at the gnip station of douala see details of the gnip stations in table 1 and fig 1 the sampling followed the standard protocols iaea 2012 samples were collected by using a rain gauge which consists of a plastic funnel diameter 10 cm coupled with a filter mesh to prevent contaminations by debris a 5 cm layer of mineral oil has been systematically added into the rain collector to avoid fractionation of the collected rainwater for each month total rainfall was collected samples were taken regularly stored in a totalizer and kept at 4 c before being transferred in 50 ml amber glass bottles tightly capped and sent to the international atomic energy agency iaea laboratory in vienna austria for stable isotopes determinations stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen were then analyzed by laser absorption spectroscopy following the method described by penna et al 2010 the rainwater daily survey was conducted from march to august 2017 at the campus of the university of douala x 9 7461 y 4 062 z 17 m a s l approximately at 7 km from the gnip station seventy samples were collected using a palmex rain gauge that presents the advantage to avoid evaporation without using medicinal paraffin oil gr√∂ning et al 2012 daily samples were stored using the same protocols as for monthly rainfall isotopes analyses were performed at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france by using a liquid water stable isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research aggarwal et al 2006 penna et al 2010 ratios of 18o Œ¥16o

precipitation amount and duration air temperatures vapor pressure were provided by the national weather direction of cameroon 3 2 tropospheric emission spectrometer tes data with the advent of new technology in stable water isotopes such as spectrometer on board satellite it has become easier to analyze isotopic composition of water vapor based on indirect laser measurement aemisegger et al 2012 tes instrument on board on the aura satellite is a nadir viewing infrared fourier transform spectrometer from which the deuterium content of water vapor Œ¥dv can be retrieved worden et al 2006 worden et al 2007 the sensitivity of the retrieval is typically larger between 900 hpa and 400 hpa with a peak at 700 hpa on average Œ¥dv retrieved over these levels has a precision of 1 5 or about 15 parts per thousand per mile relative to standard mean ocean water uncertainties are reduced by averaging several measurements worden et al 2006 risi et al 2013 then the precision is sufficient for characterizing the global distribution of evaporation and condensation processes worden et al 2006 there is on average 1 8 degrees of freedom for Œ¥dv retrievals in the tropics worden et al 2012 meaning that vertical profiles bear information on more than one level to ensure good data quality we selected only the measurements for which the quality flag is set to unity and for which the degree of freedom of the signal is higher than 0 5 risi et al 2013 here to document the water vapor composition as close as possible to the surface we use the Œ¥d values retrieved by tes at 900 hpa from 2004 to 2008 at a monthly scale and we focus on a multi year mean seasonal cycle and temporal variations rather than absolute values 3 3 convection and cloud datasets convective activity associated with the west african monsoon wam was analyzed using the global precipitation climate project one degree daily gpcp 1dd huffman et al 2001 data the same dataset is used for both monthly and daily analyses

demonstrated in many studies e g huffman et al 1995 1997 adler et al 2017 through a comparison with other proxies of convection or by multi proxy studies olr outgoing longwave radiation and trmm

1 day both for monthly and daily analyses to document the cloud types and convection organization in western central africa we use a cloud type ct product issued from geostationary msg meteosat second generation satellite data and developed by safnwc satellite application facilities in support to nowcasting msg algorithms for more information see http www nwcsaf org web guest scientific documentation clouds types are determined from their top temperature or pressure and for high level clouds from their opacity dommo et al 2018 seze 2015 the safnwc ct offers a classification of clouds into 12 classes free land free sea very low clouds low clouds medium clouds high clouds very high clouds thin cirrus medium cirrus thick cirrus fractional clouds and semi transparent above low or

etc and their organization as measured by the spatial extent of connected cloud pixels to seek links with the isotopic contents of rainfall data are extracted for the region bounded by latitudes 10s 10 n and longitudes 0e 20e for the period from march to june 2017 based on these images very high clouds areas corresponding to very organized convective system around douala were calculated for each event using arcgis mapping software through the tool measure indeed since the contours of cloud masses or pixels are approximated to geometric forms circle rectangular trapezoidal shape etc the areas were calculated based on these forms this calculation was performed after a zoom of the image at 100 in order to limit uncertainties or errors by using the tool of the software for events with duration of 15 min we have taken the maximum cloud area throughout the duration of rainfall 3 4 back trajectories in order to assess the influence of air masses pathways on the isotopic composition of precipitation and the importance of the location of convective activity in the region we compute air back trajectories at 6 h time steps 10 days prior to arrival in the sampling site this operation was performed for monthly and daily scales when isotopic data is available winds at 900 hpa were simulated by using the general circulation model lmdz5a hourdin et al 2013 guided by reanalysis products era interim dee et al 2011 of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf back trajectories speed and direction were then computed with a 2d algorithm similar to vimeux et al 2005 in order to approximate the moisture transport near the ground surface 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual cycles of isotopes Œ¥ in precipitation of douala fig 2 presents the seasonal variations of Œ¥18o from 2006 to 2016 the annual cycle of Œ¥ is quite reproducible from year to year it exhibits a w shape most of the time with minima in spring and autumn periods because of this rather good reproducibility of Œ¥18o seasonal cycle from year to year we further consider a multi year mean seasonal cycle in the section 4 2 and investigate the factors associated with this w cycle of Œ¥ however the magnitude varies widely from one year to another for a given month such inter annual variability could either reflect variations i in the climate seasonal background or ii in synoptic intra seasonal variability which could modify seasonal mean fields through upscaling processes or eventually affect isotopic variations these hypotheses are tested and discussed below 4 2 factors responsible for precipitation isotopes variations at seasonal scale 4 2 1 highlighting of a regional context seasonal variations of Œ¥18o and precipitation amount for gnip stations in gog and central africa region are presented in fig 3 similarities can be observed in the seasonal evolution of Œ¥18o at cotonou bangui douala and sao tome fig 3 i from january february to april may Œ¥18o decreases ii an enrichment in isotopic content is observed in summer in june july or august depending on the station iii isotope contents then decrease until september or october and iv a new increase occurs until december this relative homogeneity suggests that isotopic seasonality is controlled by mechanisms of at least on regional scale correlation coefficients between Œ¥18o precipitation and temperature are very low for all the stations table 2 the weak correlation between Œ¥18o and air temperature table 2 highlights the lack of temperature effect in the gog and central africa regions despite the fact that in tropical maritime stations a local amount effect is often observed rozanski et al 1993 the poor correlation between Œ¥18o and local precipitation amount shows that this effect does not dominate the isotopic seasonality in central western africa therefore it is clear that the local climate parameters do not control the seasonal variation of Œ¥ in precipitation thus we hypothesize that convective activity at the regional scale could be involved this hypothesis is tested in the next section for the douala station 4 2 2 influence of regional convective activity many studies in china e g gao et al 2013 he et al 2015 yu et al 2016 guo et al 2017 shao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 india and indo pacific region e g chakraborty et al 2016 rahul and gosh 2016 cai et al 2016 he et al 2018 south america e g hoffmann et al 2003 vimeux et al 2005 villacis et al 2008 samuels crow et al 2014 and sahelian africa e g risi et al 2008b 2010b tremoy et al 2012 based on both observations and models have shown that convective activity that occurs upstream the pathway of air parcels is a major control of rainwater isotope composition in the tropics at daily seasonal and inter annual timescales convective activity is known to deplete water vapor through 3 main processes i precipitating downdrafts either at the convective scale or at the meso scale risi et al 2008a kurita 2013 bring down depleted water vapor from the mid troposphere to the boundary layer ii rain evaporation when concerning a small proportion of each raindrop adds depleted water vapor to the lower troposphere worden et al 2007 risi et al 2010 iii rain vapor diffusive exchanges in a saturated atmosphere can also deplete the water vapor lawrence et al 2004 gpcp precipitations are used to examine convective activity upstream the sampling site of douala fig 4 presents monthly mean precipitation and back trajectories calculated for each month as expected moisture comes from the atlantic ocean most of the time and precipitation at this timescale is entirely controlled by the seasonal migration of the itcz in november and december moisture comes from the north east without undergoing any convection from december to january there is an abrupt shift of air parcel from north easterly to south westerly in line with the beginning of long northward migration of the itcz from march to may spring season air masses undergo strong convective activity over the gulf of guinea during the period june august air parcels still travel over the gulf of guinea but air masses undergo a weak convective activity because the itcz has shifted further north over the sahel region from september to october autumn period the itcz retreats to the south so that air masses undergo strong convective activity once again the shift between october and november trajectories marks the transition to the dry season when the strength of monsoon winds weakens fig 5 by presenting the variability of monthly mean gpcp precipitation along the back trajectory over time in hours towards douala station for may spring period august summer period october autumn period and january winter period shows a quantitative analysis it reveals where along the trajectories convective activity becomes higher and thus impacts Œ¥18o of douala rainfall overall the gpcp precipitation data show an increasing trend from the southern atlantic to douala along the air back trajectories at 7 days 168 h to the sampling site precipitation is higher in august and may first significant changes are observable at 120 h when a decrease increase of gpcp precipitation occurs in january october it substantially increases in may and august at 3 days 72 h before douala convective activity is stronger in october and to a lesser extent in may than august and january since isotopic value of rainfall is depleted in spring and autumn figs 2 and 3 Œ¥18o seems to be mostly sensitive to convective activity only in the past few days before reaching douala this is consistent with the memory of convection in the isotopic composition of water as discussed by risi et al 2008a tuinenburg et al 2015 and gao et al 2013 stable isotopes are imprint of convection along air parcel trajectories and in the case of douala precipitation seems to acquire its signature on average 72 h before reaching the station fig 6 shows the precipitation averaged over the past 72 h 3 days along the backward trajectories for each month the precipitation Œ¥18o is significantly anti correlated with this average precipitation r2 0 60 this supports our hypothesis that convective activity along trajectories significantly controls the seasonality of precipitation Œ¥18o in douala in summary the moisture source at douala is most of the year in the gog two seasonal precipitation maxima along the trajectories fig 6 are related to the seasonal migration of the itcz thus even if precipitation in douala shows a unimodal regime with a rainfall peak in august Œ¥18o records bimodal cycle as in the source area this suggests that the regional convective activity is the main control of the isotopic composition of precipitation in douala in the following section we use the isotopic information of the water vapor to provide additional insights about the main processes controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation 4 2 3 information from the isotopic composition of water vapor Œ¥v the isotopic composition of the water vapor provided by the tes instrument can help to understand the variation of Œ¥ in precipitation it allows separating the relative effect of processes acting along the trajectories of the water vapor Œ¥ dv and local post condensational processes Œ¥ dp Œ¥ dv following the equation below 1 Œ¥ dp Œ¥ dv Œ¥ dp Œ¥ dv Œ¥dv and Œ¥dp fig 7 a show a similar seasonality r 2 0 57 both Œ¥dv and Œ¥dp present depleted values in april may and september october fig 7a corresponding to more active convection in the gog in addition there is always a positive offset between the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation thus the isotopic information on the advected water vapor is preserved in the isotopic composition of the rain however absolute values of Œ¥dp and tes Œ¥dv should not be directly compared tes was calibrated using in situ measurements on local sites worden et al 2012 but not specifically in west africa in addition tes data at 900 hpa represent an average over several vertical levels in the lower troposphere therefore focus is given instead to temporal variability yet assuming that the vertical Œ¥d gradient between 1000 and 900 hpa is constant Œ¥dp Œ¥dv variations can be interpreted as variations in the rain water vapor interaction processes the regression between Œ¥dp and Œ¥dv gives a slope of a1 1 whereas the values for Œ¥dp and Œ¥dp Œ¥dv are a2 0 68 and r 2 0 18 this insignificant r2 attests that the rain water vapor interaction processes do not control the Œ¥dp variations based on the slope a1 Œ¥dv accounts for 100 of the Œ¥dp variability a similar case has been reported in western tropical pacific conroy et al 2016 this confirms that the seasonal variability of the isotopic composition of rainfall is predominantly influenced by Œ¥dv i e by the processes that affect water vapor along the trajectories this means that the variability of Œ¥dp Œ¥dv acts only to dampen and to blur the variability of Œ¥dp for instance the evolution of Œ¥dp Œ¥dv presents a maximum in spring fig 7b and autumn when Œ¥dv is most depleted 4 3 main controls of precipitation isotopic composition at daily scale 4 3 1 temporal evolution of Œ¥ and link with upstream convection daily Œ¥18o in douala varies from 0 3 to 7 4 with a mean value of 3 0 close to the monthly weighted mean of 2 8 calculated for the 2006 2016 period these daily data appear then to be representative of the 2006 2016 mean seasonal cycles moreover as for the seasonal scale daily rainwater fig 8 is most depleted in spring april may and more enriched in summer july august in order to investigate upstream convection effects we calculated the correlation between the Œ¥18o of rainfall and the precipitation recorded at 1 to 3 days earlier along back trajectories table 3 in march april and august the correlations are significant 95 suggesting that like for the seasonal timescale the daily evolution is driven by convection along trajectories yet this mechanism is insufficient to explain completely the variability of Œ¥ in daily precipitation especially in may june and july 4 3 2 factors besides the upstream convection intensity continental recycling and organization of convective systems continental recycling the goal of this section is to test whether continental recycling has significant influence on Œ¥18o at the daily time scale to that end we calculated the percentage of time of the air parcel over the continent during the last 3 days 72 h along the trajectory hereafter fland this calculation was relatively simple since air back trajectories have been computed at 6 h time steps and then for instance the travel time of 36 h of air mass over the continent will correspond to fland equal to 50 however for this issue we calculated air back trajectories at different heights 800 850 900 950 and 980 hpa since moisture is typically transported at a spectrum of heights as it is the boundary layer that feeds the convection and it is with the water vapor from low layers that the rain is re evaporated investigation was not performed above 800 hpa results from this quantitative calculation not shown here of moisture transport for different heights show that there is no difference between them especially since we focus only on air back trajectory at 3 days before douala in june july and august fland is 0 for all rainy days except on june 11th when fland 25 table 4 presents the detailed results for spring period and shows an anti correlation between Œ¥18o and fland precipitation are thus more depleted when the transit time of air parcels over the continent is long during the last 3 days along the back trajectory this is in contradiction with the expected effect of a continental recycling since Œ¥ is controlled in spring by a convection upstream the sampling site the fact that Œ¥18o is more depleted with the increase of fland suggests a significant influence of convection intensity over the continent indeed xu and zipser 2012 demonstrated that convection is generally more intense over the land than over the ocean the more intense the convection along trajectories the more depleted the water vapor therefore moisture origin has only an indirect effect on isotopic composition of precipitation depending on whether air mass goes through regions of a strong convection the positive and significant correlation between fland and gpcp precipitation confirms this mechanism therefore we suggest that Œ¥ variations at a daily timescale are partly controlled by the intensity of the convection along air parcel trajectories and that continental recycling is not involved influence of the organization of convective systems several studies have shown that convective systems deplete the low level water vapor more efficiently when they are more organized lawrence et al 2004 risi et al 2008 tremoy et al 2014 probably because moister air in larger systems allows for more efficient rain vapour diffusive exchanges risi et al 2008a in addition convective systems deplete more vapor as they extend to the upper troposphere lacour et al 2018 and as the extent of their anvils measured by the fraction of stratiform clouds is large aggarwal et al 2016 these features are typically associated with higher degrees of organization here we test whether the type of convective organization has a significant impact on the Œ¥18o observed at douala by using satellite image from the saf classification we define 3 classes of clouds in the region from march to august according to their altitude i very low to low ii medium to high and ii very high clouds the low cloud class is mostly observed in july august table 5 and fig 9 the mid level to high cloud class is dominant in june and the very high clouds are mostly present in spring fig 9 the area of cloud systems increases throughout spring reaching a maximum in may and decreases again from june in july august the areas are too small to be calculated spatial organization of convective systems also determines rainfall event duration the latter increases globally from march to august fig 10 ranging from 12 min to 1278 min i e 21 h combining this information on cloud altitude cloud area and rainfall duration we can infer that in march april most convective systems correspond to deep mesoscale convective systems mcs mapes and houze 1993 laing and fritsch 1997 mathon et al 2001 fink et al 2006 tremoy et al 2014 in may june convective systems are mcs that become even larger and organized but extend less deep in altitude in june in contrast in july august convective systems are isolated characterized by small cumulonimbus in the middle of low to medium clouds fig 9b that follow one another throughout the day explaining the apparent long durations of rain events the type of convective organization emerges then as an important control on the precipitation isotopic composition cloud surface shows a significant negative correlation with precipitation Œ¥18o from march to june table 5 the larger the cloud area the more depleted the precipitation in addition the more the convective system is organized the longer is the duration of the event laurent and machado 2002 consistently event scale Œ¥18o is anti correlated with event duration in march r 2 0 44 april r 2 0 54 may r 2 0 64 and more weakly in june r 2 0 34 the longer is the convective system the more depleted is the precipitation these different types of convective organization can also explain the isotopic evolution at the seasonal scale in spring the organized deep mcs deplete the water vapor efficiently leading to the observed precipitation Œ¥18o minimum in contrast in july august the shallower small isolated cumulonimbus clouds deplete the water vapor less efficiently leading to the observed precipitation Œ¥18o maximum in spite of the local precipitation maximum observed at douala surprisingly the r2 between cloud area and Œ¥18o are close and even higher in may and june than that observed between Œ¥18o and upstream precipitation table 3 after verifying that upstream convection gpcp precipitation recorded at 72 h to douala along the trajectory and cloud area are uncorrelated table 5 we can assert that two independent parameters control Œ¥18o upstream convection intensity and the size of the convective system both at local scale and at upstream see the table 5 5 conclusion and outlook this study aims at investigating the processes controlling the year to year inter annual month to month seasonality and day to day intra seasonal variability of rainfall isotopic composition in the gulf of guinea gog region and especially in douala cameroon we observed that the annual cycle of Œ¥ is quite reproducible most years presents a w shape with minima in spring and autumn Œ¥18o and Œ¥dv appear to be mainly controlled by upstream convection and by the size of convective systems we identified that the continental recycling doesn t impact the rainwater isotopes in the humid tropical area of the gog in particular the Œ¥18o minima in spring and autumn are associated with strong convective activity in the gog and large long lived and deep mesoscale convective systems whereas the Œ¥18o maximum in july august is associated with reduced convective activity in the gog and isolated shallow convective systems the importance of upstream convective activity in controlling the Œ¥18o of precipitation at various time scales is in line with a large body of recent research in different tropical regions influenced by a monsoon system the importance of the type of convective system size organization vertical extension is also consistent with a growing number of recent studies but this is the first time that it is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of such a large number of individual convective systems the findings of this study obtained by integrating in situ and satellite measurements advance our understanding of the temporal variation of precipitation stable isotopes in humid tropical area such as douala and shed a new light on the importance of large scale meteorological conditions controls on precipitation stable isotope composition in the gog notwithstanding numerical climate modelling could be a useful complementary approach to further analyse the factors controlling rainfall isotopic composition in and around douala moreover the climate in douala being representative of a small area with monomodal rainfall regime surrounded by area with bimodal rainfall high resolution modelling is necessary to correctly capture such particularity more robust conclusions could be obtained with larger samples which could be obtained by extending the length of the record to better understand the role of convective organization on the isotopic composition sampling at the intra event scale is necessary finally measuring the isotopic composition in the water vapor in addition to precipitation would be useful to isolate the post condensation effects credit authorship contribution statement b

5607,groundwater on remote coral atoll islands in tropical oceans occurs in the form of freshwater groundwater lenses fgls that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants and ecosystems continuous recharge of freshwater from rainfall can flush out salt water and eventually create a fgl beneath the natural or reclaimed island however the process whereby a fgl grows in reclaimed islands and the dynamic mechanisms and formation process are unclear this study used numerical modeling for a reclaimed island in the south china sea to evaluate the process of mixing between freshwater and saltwater dynamic mechanisms and the formation process of fgls influenced by tidal action our results revealed that the long term average flow lines of fgls were superimposed by short term tidal fluctuations beneath the atoll island the tidal signals move rapidly inland from the lower aquifer and are then propagated upwards to drive the water level in the holocene sediments this causes an oscillation of the fgls and increased mixing between salt and fresh water the formation of the fgls can be divided into three stages preparatory formation and pseudo steady state yongshu island a reclaimed island was used as a case study the island s preparatory phase lasted approximately 2 5 years and will take 20 years to form a stable fgl with a thickness of about 15 m recharge rates and the nature of the contact between the holocene and the underlying pleistocene aquifers determine the shape of the fgls beneath the island abstraction during the formative period of the fgls will increase the time required to reach a stable state the results obtained enhance the understanding of the formation of fgls and can provide a reference for the management of freshwater resources on atoll islands keywords freshwater lens reclaimed island numerical simulation yongshu island dynamic mechanism formation process 1 introduction atolls are typically ring shaped reefs surrounding or partly surrounding a relatively shallow seawater lagoon or a sinking volcano and are usually associated with one or more small coral islands werner et al 2017 available information indicates that there are approximately 425 atolls in the world falkland 1992 and most of them are located in the indian ocean pacific ocean and atlantic ocean between 30 n and 30 s fig 1 a furthermore over one million people live on these atolls falkland 1991 barnett and adger 2003 unesco 2016 these tropical coral islands usually have a low elevation when the recharge from rainfall exceeds the losses through evapotranspiration discharge into the ocean and lagoon mixing with underlying seawater and groundwater abstraction for human use a fresh groundwater lens fgl may form post et al 2018a b and float above the denser saline groundwater originating from sea water origin werner et al 2017 these fgls are a vital source of freshwater for terrestrial ecosystems and domestic consumption especially during frequent and sometimes lengthy dry seasons therefore it is important to understand the formation process and the internal dynamic mechanisms of fgls underwood et al 1992 griggs and peterson 1993 bryan et al 2016 in the field survey undertaken by falkland s 1994 in the south cocos keeling atolls in the indian ocean the smallest island with a fgl was about 270 m wide under a recharge w of 1938 mm y if the island width is less than this value the precipitation will quickly flow into the ocean and cannot form a fgl underwood et al 1992 used numerical simulation to analyze the scale effect and concluded that if a threshold thickness of 2 3 m is required to maintain a developable lens the minimum viable island width was about 250 m for a recharge rate of 2 0 m yr a series of surveys and studies about barrier islands have been also carried out in the east frisian barrier island chain in northwestern germany recently r√∂per et al 2013 holt et al 2017 post et al 2019 the researchers found that a shallow freshwater lens can also be formed in such a barrier island and changed during the development of geomorphology however on such small islands the fgl is connected to the sea water through the pores or karst caves and the effects of tidal fluctuation on the fgl are direct and obvious in coastal aquifers tides influence the groundwater flow pattern salinity distribution and characteristics of groundwater flow to the sea werner et al 2013 when a tidal signal travels inland the amplitude reduction is quantified by the tidal efficiency Œµ which is the ratio of the tidal amplitude of the groundwater to that of the sea hunt and peterson 1980 the time difference between high or low tide in the ocean and the peak or trough of the groundwater fluctuation is referred to as tidal lag t œÑ hunt and peterson 1980 both Œµ and t œÑ can reflect the characteristics of the groundwater velocity field and the stratigraphic structure of atoll islands e g carr and kamp 1969 herman et al 1986 erskine 1991 underwood et al 1992 the impacts of geological heterogeneity spatially variable groundwater recharge and rising sea levels on the geometry of fgls has been addressed by schneider and kruse 2003 chui and terry 2013 and gulley et al 2016 however few studies have considered the detailed flow processes within the fgls especially under tidal boundary conditions which are crucial for the formation of fgls dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 usually no rivers or streams are found on atoll islands and atmospheric rainfall is the only replenishment source for the fgls during the rainwater seepage fresh water will flow to the island edge under the influence of the hydraulic gradient and continuously push the saltwater outward enabling the persistence of the fgls dose et al 2014 and stoeckl et al 2015 verified fgl velocity field characteristics by using physical experiments combined with tracer tests underwood et al 1992 used a variable density numerical model finite difference model to further explore the effect of tidal action and focused on the transition zone they concluded that the vertical component of longitudinal dispersion coupled with the vertical oscillations through the pleistocene aquifer will significantly affect the thickness of the transition zone however the larger longitudinal dispersion will intensify the mixing of fresh and salt water and result in a thinner fgl which is different from the behavior noted for continental coastal aquifers for continental aquifers longitudinal dispersion and transverse dispersion usually have the same contribution to the width of the transition zone abarca et al 2007 therefore in many subsequent works on non tidal atoll models the dispersivity parameters were adjusted to compensate for the lack of tidal effects on the transition zone width ghassemi et al 2000 alam et al 2002 comte et al 2014 atoll islands are generally composed of two overlying aquifer formations which comprise unconsolidated holocene sediments deposited unconformably on pleistocene limestone reef deposits ayers and vacher 1986 white and falkland 2010 this can be termed a binary geological structure bgs the contact between the holocene and pleistocene aquifers typically occurs at a depth of 10 25 m and is known as the thurber discontinuity or holocene pleistocene unconformity ayers and vacher 1986 buddemeier and oberdorfer 2004 werner et al 2017 a report made by cox 1951 on the arno atoll in the marshall islands provided a comprehensive description of an atoll island dual aquifer system vacher 1988 considered four general non homogeneous cases including the bgs case c and developed analytical models for each of them which was verified by dose et al 2014 therefore a more reliable conceptual hydrogeological model can be considered a dual aquifer system subjected to laterally and vertically propagated tidal signals examples of atoll islands with dual aquifer systems include those in the majuro atoll marshall islands the cocos keeling islands the diego garcia atoll as well as the yongxing island xisha islands and the yongshu atoll nansha islands at present many extensive islands have been created by filling the sea and these artificial islands not only provide valuable space for urban development but also can serve as valuable aquifers hu and jiao 2014 yao et al 2019 examples of reclaimed land include the largest artificial island palm island and its adjacent islands in dubai that span a recreational area of about 80 km2 the rectangular reclaimed island of kansai international airport 38 km2 in japan about 76 km2 of reclaimed island in singapore constructed for supporting its economic growth van ginkel 2015 donchyts et al 2016 yao et al 2019 recently reclaimed islands have also been constructed for others purposes in the south china sea fig 1b groundwater lenses beneath these reclaimed islands are analogous to those beneath natural islands werner et al 2017 but differences exist the difference between artificial islands and natural islands is manifested in their shape and the geological structure artificial sedimentary sequence created by multiple sources of filling materials and compaction technology yan et al 2013 alzaylaie and abdelaziz 2016 yao et al 2019 van ginkel 2015 discussed three artificial aquifers designs while constructing reclaimed islands and evaluated the efficiency of different mining methods yao et al 2019 used a series of 3 d density dependent flow and transport conceptual models seawat to investigate the mixing process of fresh and salt water and to quantify the potential maximum volume and formation time of fresh groundwater that can occur beneath reclaimed islands however this study is more theoretical and the stratigraphic structure of the model was set randomly which is in conflict with the actual situation for coral islands in addition limited by data availability and high computation requirements the study also did not consider tidal boundaries and the shape of islands on the basis of analytical models of islands proposed by fetter 1972 and vacher 1988 hu and jiao 2014 obtained steady state analytical solutions for groundwater levels and the thickness of fgls assuming the reclamation site of a single zone of uniform hydraulic parameters previous studies mainly focused on natural islands including the influence of climate factors human factors and sea level rise on the already formed freshwater lens alam and falkland 1997 bailey et al 2009 chui and terry 2013 bailey and jenson 2014 however the formation process and dynamics mechanisms of fgls remain poorly understood especially in the case of reclaimed islands werner et al 2017 post et al 2018a b while some works on the formation of island freshwater lenses have studied them physically analytically and numerically in detail fetter 1972 vacher 1988 dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 post et al 2018a b yao et al 2019 few investigations have considered the effect of the tidal boundary during the formation process of the fgls particularly in the cases of some reclaimed islands furthermore most of these previous works were conceptual and did not involve any realistic aquifer data or observation data in order to overcome these limitations it is also necessary to verify them using a practical case as the pressure induced by climate change and population increase intensifies the construction of reclaimed islands will become an increasingly popular method in the small island developing states sids furthermore a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the formation process of fgls can provide further information for future studies barnett and adger 2003 this study is the first to comprehensively characterize the groundwater flow system and formation process of fgls for a reclaimed island in the south china sea based on the previously unpublished observation and field data a numerical model of variable density flow and solute transport was established for the yongshu island which is an exemplar system of reclaimed atoll islands reclamation based on a dual aquifer system worldwide zhu et al 2014 the main objectives were to 1 describe the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of the fgl of the yongshu island 2 evaluate the impact of hydrogeological factors and abstraction on the formation process of the fgl and 3 to compare the difference between tidal and non tidal models and further analyze the adaptability of different models 2 study area the study area is located on the yongshu atoll of the nansha islands latitude 9 37 n longitude 112 58 e in the south china sea the yongshu island is a typical coral island fig 2 but has been modified its surface layer 3 4 m is composed of artificially filled coral sand the yongshu island reclamation project began in august 2014 and was finished in september 2015 before reclamation the land area mainly located in the southwest region was less than 0 2 km2 after reclamation the yongshu island had a length of 3 71 km and a maximum width of 0 99 km and had an area of 2 23 km2 the topography is flat and the elevation of the land surface is usually 3 4 m above the mean sea level msl the construction project for reclaimed islands in the south china sea adopted the overall technical routes of natural simulation the building techniques used in the yongshu island generally involved cutter suction dredging csd and or trailing hopper dredging thd large cutter suction dredgers were used to cut pump loose coral gravel excavated in the surrounding lagoon or other parts of the reef and fill or accumulate on the objective reef flat through a duct to form a foundation platform fig 2a please find more details of this process in the website https amti csis org maps generally speaking this process is very similar to the formation of natural coral islands which mainly depends on storm or tidal waves to move and carry coral debris to form the island werner et al 2017 but reclaimed islands have accelerated this process therefore the permeability properties of the artificial coral sand for reclaimed islands is very similar to those of natural sands zhu et al 2014 jiang 2018 in 1990 the nanyong 1 engineering geological borehole was drilled on the reef flat in this small atoll having a depth of 152 1 m it reached up to the early pleistocene of the quaternary period zhao et al 1992 later in 1994 the nanyong 2 engineering geological borehole was drilled reaching a depth of 413 7 m and progressing to the miocene of the tertiary period zhu et al 1997 according to drilling information fig 2b a seismic reflection time profile and a borehole section fig 2c obtained for the island the unconformity surface of the upper holocene and lower pleistocene aquifer is approximately 20 m below mean sea level msl sun et al 2003 zhu et al 2014 there are some sub aquifers in the holocene aquifer caused by the transport of deposits by waves and tides although it differs in granularities and shapes the lithology and hydrological properties do not change much across the region therefore we regard them as a hydrogeological units hgu furthermore the upper artificial layer is mainly composed of coral sand excavated from the lagoon and reef flat and shows some similarities to natural coral sand zhu et al 2014 jiang 2018 the average temperature of the yongshu atoll is above 28 0 and the average daily or monthly variations and the difference between winter and summer temperatures are small the lowest annual temperature 26 7 c is recorded in january and the highest temperature 29 6 c appears in may the average relative humidity of the yongshu island is 81 and the extreme minimum is 51 which occurs in january zhao 1996 according to our groundwater monitoring data variation in the groundwater temperature with time at different depths 2 m 5 m 8 m 20 m is shown in fig 3 below with the increase in depth fluctuation in the water temperature becomes smaller and the temperature remains mainly between 26 5 c and 28 5 c in addition the temperature variation at different depths at the same time is less than 0 8 c therefore the effect of temperature on mixing between seawater and fresh water at different depths can be considered negligible this is also the reason that we ignore the temperature boundary in our actual numerical simulation the distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration in the study area is shown in fig 4 a there is a small meteorological station on the island and monitoring records were available for the monitoring period from september 2016 to june 2018 it can be seen that annual rainfall is abundant at the yongshu atoll but the distribution among the months is extremely uneven the mean annual rainfall for this period was 2972 mm and the rainfall mainly concentrated from august to january of the following year when 67 of the annual rainfall occurred from february to may there was a very little rainfall which accounted for only 15 3 of the annual rainfall thus this period can be considered as the dry season on the island in addition the spatial distribution of rainfall was also uneven fig 4b because of some rainfall catchment system on the airport runway and some buildings the actual recharge of these region was established by referring to the report made by gingerich et al 2017 due to equipment constraints the potential evaporation data here were the surface evaporation data the diameter of the surface evaporator was 618 2 mm and a depth of 600 mm look like fig 4a and the accuracy of the water surface micrometer was 0 1 mm the potential evaporation was calculated by the difference in the water level under the influence of monsoon and high temperature the monthly average evaporation in the study area was only about 100 mm in general the groundwater recharge to a coral island is not equivalent to the rainfall the relationship between recharge and rainfall can be expressed as follows falkland and woodroffe 2004 comte et al 2014 werner et al 2017 post et al 2018a b 1 r p e t Œ¥ v where r is the recharge mm p is the rainfall mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm and Œ¥v is the change in storage within the soil moisture zone mm the water budget is calculated using long time steps 1 month and the coarse nature of sandy material ensures that the field capacity is very low and does not allow water retention therefore the available water content of the soil Œ¥v was usually neglected hunt and peterson 1980 falkland 1991 comte et al 2014 werner et al 2017 gingerich et al 2017 in addition because the yongshu island is an artificial refill island therefore the vegetation on the island is currently sparse surface runoff was neglected because of the high infiltration capacity of the soils the flat topography and the lack of surface flow features on the island roupsard et al 2006 reported an excellent correlation between the actual evapotranspiration et and the penman monteith potential evapotranspiration et0 for the vanuatu island south pacific 15 26 6 s 167 11 5 e which was verified by comte et al 2014 for grande glorieuse according to the following equation 2 e t 0 5 0 86 e t 0 0 62 0 3 r 2 0 98 using eqs 1 and 2 the monthly recharge r mm was calculated from the average monthly rainfall p mm fig 4a from the rainfall recharge formula the infiltration recharge was calculated to be 2150 mm per year which is 72 of the rainfall the study area is affected by the tropical weather system all year round the most important wind field is characterized by the monsoon which is characterized by the prevailing winter wind of the ne and the summer wind of the prevailing wind direction of the sw in addition it is also affected by the tropical cyclone but it is mainly concentrated at 10 n the tidal phenomena in the yongshu atoll area are mainly dominated by tidal waves carried into the south china sea by the bashi channel in the western pacific ocean the variation in the tidal fluctuation is generally no more than 1 6 m and results in an irregular full diurnal tide there is a high tide level and a low tide level every day fig 4b under the control of seasonal risk the surface current has a prevailing nw direction in winter and a prevailing ne direction in the summer the waves also show obvious seasonal changes ne waves prevail in winter and s and sw waves prevail in the summer zhao 1996 our groundwater monitoring work started in october 2016 with data recording intervals of 30 min at the time of investigation the reclamation project had been completed for one year in terms of the observation salinity data of the wells n8 n7 and n6 shown as the fig 2c the salinity of the groundwater at the depth of 2 m decreased to about 22 5 g l in october 2016 1 year later after completion of the land reclamation while the observed salinities of the three wells at the depth of 5 m were 33 5 g l 27 7 g l and 23 6 g l respectively two years after the reclamation project of the yongshu island the salinities of the groundwater at the depth of 2 m of the wells n8 n7 and n6 were 18 2 g l 7 7 g l and 6 3 g l respectively overall the salinity of all observation wells on the yongshu island suggested brackish water and no freshwater has been produced so far at present there are few residents on the island and their drinking water is mainly obtained using a desalinator additional sources of potable water are rainwater harvesting devices near the airport runway and on some rooftops in addition there are several pumping wells on the island but the amount of abstraction is limited by the high salinity of the groundwater therefore the yongshu island is an ideal island for studying the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of fresh groundwater lenses 3 numerical model 3 1 model set up the numerical simulation used in the present study was carried out using seawat ver 4 langevin et al 2008 a finite difference model developed by the us geological survey usgs which combines modflow and the mt3dms to simulate variable density groundwater flow and solute transport and has been verified and used widely for simulating seawater intrusion we used this code to solve the following coupled flow and transport equations langevin et al 2008 3 œÅ k f h f œÅ œÅ f œÅ f z œÅ s f h f t Œ∏ œÅ c c t œÅ s q s and 4 Œ∏ c t Œ∏ d c Œ∏ v c q s c s where œÅ is the fluid density ml 3 k f is the equivalent fresh water hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h f is the equivalent fresh

density in the source sink q s is the source sink flow rate t 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2t 1 v is the pore water velocity l t and cs is the salt concentration in the sources sinks long term time series i e decadal of tidal boundaries are often not available where fgl studies are needed this makes it difficult to calibrate 3 d models because when we want to simulate tidal boundaries we usually need to split the time period into small intervals e g 0 021 d so the model can feels the change of boundaries this incurs a large computation time and requires high storage capacity the other reason is that building and calibrating 3d models require substantial observation and aquifer data if we don t have so much data it will reduce the accuracy of numerical models therefore the present study opted to work with a 2d model based on the profile a a fig 2 to provide an understanding of the main processes occurring in the fgl fig 5 the cross section had a width of 1400 m including the island and reef flat in the vertical plane three distinctive geological structures were recognized an upper layer of 20 m of coarse coral derived carbonate sands artificial coral sand and an underlying cemented reef limestone the model domain was mainly discretized into uniform finite difference grids 10 m 1 m with 140 columns and 50 layers and 6731 active cells the thickness of the first layer varied according to the surface topography 3 2 initial and boundary conditions 3 2 1 initial conditions fgls usually form over long periods 20 150 years comte et al 2014 holding and allen 2015 and it is difficult to conduct tidal simulation for such a long time without parallel computing clusters therefore we used an iterative algorithm here to achieve a long time scale simulation of tidal action the simulation results concentration and head distribution of one stage were considered as the initial conditions of the next stage as for the initial stage before the fgl was formed the initial concentration for the entire model was 35 0 g l and the initial head of the model was the mean sea level 0 m after running the model for 120 d in the first stage with the tidal boundary the second stage was reached for which the steady state salinity and water head distribution obtained from the previous operation were set as the new initial conditions shown in table 1 the model was then run until it reached a pseudo steady state was attained where in salinity and water head of the fgl showed little changes and these changes were periodic and tide induced underwood et al 1992 holding and allen 2015 3 2 2 boundary conditions fig 5 shows the boundary conditions of the numerical model the topmost layer was assigned to the specified flux boundaries and depended on the calculated recharge rate in contrast the boundary fluid pressure was specified along the reef and lagoon basement to simulate the presence of sea water with source water at the nodes along these boundaries assigned a salt concentration of 35 0 g l to represent sea water the approach used for the addition of tidal boundaries is of note the tidal model has very large computational requirements because of the short length of the time steps which may be no more than 1 5 h so that the system can sense the effects of the tidal fluctuations underwood et al 1992 therefore we chose the tidal signal measured for 2880 h 120 d as the specified head condition shown as fig 4b and each stress period was 0 5 h the specified head can only change at the beginning of each stress period and therefore a step function was used to fit the tidal curve look like fig 5 mulligan et al 2011 specifically the complete tidal cycle was divided into 20 stress periods each with a duration of 0 021 d 30 min in addition no flow boundaries were assigned to the bottom of the mesh domain 3 3 model parameters model parameters were mainly obtained by field or laboratory tests and from literature bailey et al 2009 bailey et al 2014 deng and bailey 2017 jiang 2018 because the artificial coral sand is mainly above the groundwater table the hydrologic parameters of this aquifer were obtained through laboratory experiments however the horizontal and vertical k of the holocene aquifer were obtained by the pumping test undertaken by jiang 2018 parameters for the lower pleistocene layer are difficult to obtain using pumping tests because of the extremely high k therefore the initial k of the lower aquifer was based on results from a previous study on maldives atoll bailey et al 2009 bailey et al 2014 deng and bailey 2017 which was based on the considerations that the yongshu island is at the same latitude as the maldives and the type of coral reef and genetic environment at these two locations are similar therefore the hydrogeological parameters of the lower pleistocene layer have certain similarities in both cases the hydrogeological parameters assigned to the numerical model are summarized in the table 2 3 4 model output and calibration water level loggers were installed at different sites as shown in fig 2c we used the ltc levelogger solinst canada with specific observation depths at 2 m 5 m and 8 m beneath the water surface and a monitoring interval of 30 min the monitoring records were available for the monitoring period of october 2016 december 2017 the water level electrical conductivity and temperature were recorded for comparison with the modelled total dissolved solid tds concentrations the measured electricity conductivity ec values in units of ms cm were converted to tds in units of kg m3 by multiplying by 0 72 the ec tds conversion was obtained by comparison between ec and tds values when water chemistry data were available galvis rodriguez et al 2017 the model output results include the concentration distribution of different stages and the velocity fields under different stress periods we used a tds concentration of 0 875 kg m3 2 5 of the sea water to distinguish between potable fresh water and non potable sea water and to represent the boundary of the fgl bailey et al 2014 in addition tidal effects at different depths and locations on the island were also calculated these effects included the tidal efficiency Œµ which is the ratio of the groundwater tidal amplitude to that of the sea and tidal lag t œÑ which is the time difference between high or low tide in the ocean and the corresponding peak or trough of the groundwater fluctuation hunt and peterson 1980 the total simulation time was subdivided into a calibration period from october 2016 to december 2017 and a prediction period from december 2017 to the time when the fgl of the yongshu island reached a pseudo steady state the calibrated parameters were the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities kh and kv respectively porosity n and dispersivity horizontal longitudinal l and transverse t when the shape of the fgl reached a steady state we also used the analytical model case c proposed by vacher 1988 which was corrected by dose et al 2014 to verify the numerical solution due to the limitations of the analytical solution we had to undertake some generalizations of the aquifer to make the aquifer boundary more regular such that a probable result can be obtained shown in fig 5 therefore there were four calibration indicators for model accuracy a comparison of the curve of the water level for the simulation and observation results and calculation the root mean square error rmse b verification of the error of tidal effects tidal efficiency Œµ tidal lag t œÑ c comparison of concentrations of the multilevel observation wells were compared to the model calculated concentrations in the cells corresponding to the location and depth of the measurement point d ensuring thickness of the fgls are approximately the same as or smaller than the values of the analytic solution 4 results 4 1 calibration results fig 6 shows the comparison of the water level fluctuation and salinity of the multi level observation wells with the modeled results for the part of calibration and validation periods due to the equipment limitations we only obtained the water level fluctuation data at a depth of 5 m in observation wells n8 n7 and n6 and a depth of 2 m in the observation well n8 in the same period other depth observation data were incomplete for this same period the difference between the simulated water level and the observed water level was small with the final root mean square error rmse being 9 2 m 7 9 m 6 5 m and 24 5 m during the validation period respectively this represents scaled rmse values of 7 1 12 1 9 8 and 18 7 respectively indicating an acceptable level of model measurement mismatch for the proposed application of the model particularly considering the heterogeneous nature of the island s subsurface the high temporal dynamics and the manual approach to model calibration it is not sufficient for the model calibration to be based only on water levels therefore we also calibrated the model using groundwater salinity data fig 6e and f show the calibration of the groundwater salinity for the yongshu island after one and two years of reclamation although our monitoring period was limited there was a significant decrease in the salinity of the groundwater during this period and the salinity of groundwater at a depth of 2 m was approximately 20 of that of sea water in october 2017 moreover the calculated values of tidal lag and tidal efficiency based on the water level fluctuation data are shown in fig 7 as the distance from the coast increased the tidal efficiency gradually decreased while the tidal lag time increased in the same direction however in the center of the island the tidal lag and efficiency remained essentially the same and at values of 35 and 2 4 h respectively the model values match the geometry of the salinity distribution for the measured data reasonably well 4 2 dynamic mechanism of fgl based on the verification of the accuracy of the model the dynamic mechanisms of the fgl on the yongshu island was predicted as shown in fig 8 in terms of velocity fields fig 8a1 a5 the propagation pattern of tidal signals based on the simulated flow path can be clearly seen because the permeability of the lower aquifer is much larger than that of the upper unconsolidated sediments the tidal signal was propagated laterally very rapidly through the highly permeable pleistocene layer and then moved vertically into the upper aquifer if the timescale is long the time step was 10 days the velocities over short time scales caused by tidal effects can be neglected the velocity characteristics under such conditions are shown in fig 8 a6 the particle tracking code modpath pollock 2012 here was used for this evaluation a total of 102 particles were placed across the model domain to track flow paths this artificial groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall on the land surface with subsequent discharges to the sea in conclusion the present study showed that the dynamic mechanisms involved in the formation of fgls beneath an atoll island have two different timescales long term average flow lines that are superimposed by short term tidal fluctuations underwood et al 1992 yao et al 2019 4 3 formation process of fgl of yongshu island fig 9 shows the predicted formation process for the yongshu island s fgl the maximum simulation time was 50 years within 2 5 years after reclamation no fresh water accumulated fig 9b1 we regard this stage as a preparatory phase the coral sand is leached to remove the salt with continual infiltration from rainfall recharge the fgl gradually forms and increases in thickness five years after the reclamation project was completed on yongshu island the maximum thickness of the fgl was about 7 5 m fig 9b2 by approximately 2035 the fgl will reach a steady state and the maximum thickness of the fgl will be 15 m fig 9b5 the thickness of fgl is not evenly distributed in space the thickness on the northwest side is high the maximum thickness is 15 m and that on the southeast side is small reflecting the relationship between the freshwater lens and the hydrogeologic structure at the same period with continual infiltration of rainfall recharge the transition zone of the fgl gradually became thinner and the final thickness was 17 m at the center of the island besides we also compared the results between analytical and numerical solutions at the steady state it can be seen that there is a big difference between them the maximum thickness gave by the analytical solution is about 28 m which is much larger than the numerical result however this is acceptable that the analytical solution assumes that the system is in hydrostatic equilibrium and that freshwater and seawater are immiscible fluids separated by a sharp continuous interface of equivalent pressure vacher 1988 werner et al 2017 post et al 2018a b which will have a overestimate result sometimes we will discuss this phenomenon in more detail below in order to better realize the freshwater lens of the yongshu island we also carried out the establishment of a 3d model fig 10 shows the 3d shape of the fgl during a stable period for the yongshu island underwood et al 1992 ghassemi et al 2000 and comte et al 2014 have shown that non tidal models of atoll islands require modification of the dispersivity parameters to compensate for the lack of tidal effects on the mixing zone width alam et al 2002 compared their tidal model of bonriki island kiribati to the previous non tidal model proposed by alam and falkland 1997 and found that the tidal and non tidal variants required calibrated t values of 0 05 m and 1 m respectively in the present study we calibrated the 3d non tidal model based on the simulation results of profile a a by adjusting the dispersivity parameters it can be seen that topography also plays an important role in the formation of the fgl the thickness of the fgl varies at different positions and the maximum thickness of the fgl was near the profile a a 5 discussion 5 1 dynamic mechanism and tidal effects as a reclaimed island the yongshu island provides study opportunities that other natural islands do not provide specific attention has been paid to how fgls are formed and how large it is the changes with time and space in the fgl formation were captured reasonably well by the numerical model although our assessment of the formation process was largely subjective due to the limitation of the field data the calibration results and the use of model input parameters that fall within the range of expected values suggest that the model is an adequate tool for exploring fgl behavior under various boundary conditions our application of the model provided new insights into fgls compared to previous studies dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 yao et al 2019 these insights are important for understanding the physical processes that occur within atoll island settings tidal efficiency and average tidal lags were calculated for the upper and lower aquifer and these computations provided a means for analyzing the relation between tidal effects and depth or distance from a shoreline generally tidal effects are transmitted from the shoreline toward the center of the island and thus tidal efficiencies decrease inward whereas tidal lags increase in the same direction however in the present study the tidal effects in the central area of the island remained essentially unchanged which are consistent with the actual observation data obtained for some coral islands hunt and peterson 1980 herman et al 1986 ghassemi et al 2000 white and falkland 2010 for example a relationship between the tidal response and depth on enjebi island enewetak atoll obtained by herman et al 1986 showed that the Œµ varied from 5 to 10 near the water table but increased to 70 at a depth of 10 m below the msl similarly tœÑ decreased from 3 5 h at the water table to nearly 0 5 h at the 10 m below the msl in terms of distance the Œµ of the central area of the island remains basically the same about 5 but at the coastal zone it was above 60 due to the permeability of the pleistocene aquifer being very high 102 103 m d the tidal signals rapidly moved inland from the lower aquifers and then propagated upward to drive the water level in the holocene sediments causing the fgls to oscillate and thus increasing the mixing between salt and fresh water unlike the numerical simulation results without tidal boundary obtained by griggs and peterson 1993 and stoeckl et al 2015 more generally all four velocity field drawings fig 8a1 a5 serve to illustrate the dominant presence of vertical groundwater flow in the central portion of the island however if the timescale is longer time step is 10 d those velocity over short timescales caused by tide is no longer obvious the flow path looks like the fig 8 a6 where the groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall on the land surface with subsequent discharges to the sea this process mainly depends on the recharge rate and the density difference between seawater and fresh water these two scale velocity characteristics exist simultaneously and affect each other 5 2 stages of fgl formation on the whole the formation of a fgl can be divided into three stages fig 11 taking the yongshu island for example in the first stage about 2 5 years coral sand is leached and the salt is removed thus enabling a fgl to form this can be regarded as the preparatory phase with continual infiltration of rainfall recharge the fgl gradually forms and increases in thickness we refer to this as the formation stage this is the most important stage of fgl formation and may be affected by many factors for example if groundwater was abstracted from the fgl during this period the time needed for the fgl to reach a steady state will be extended the formation phase of a fgl usually takes 20 50 years comte et al 2014 holding and allen 2015 yao et al 2019 finally the fgl will reach a pseudo steady state at this stage the thickness of the fgl will fluctuate with the seasons and tides but the average thickness of the fgl does not change irrespective of whether natural islands or artificial islands models are used the formation process of fgl can be divided into these three stages if the concentration range of the transition zone is defined by salinities between 2 5 and 95 of seawater concentration it can be seen that the thickness of the transition zone is gradually reduced during the formation process this is mainly affected by two factors 1 the contact between the holocene and underlying pleistocene sediments known as the thurber discontinuity plays a vital influence here that restricts the further development of a freshwater lens due to the permeability coefficient of pleistocene aquifer being very large 102 103 m d the mixing between seawater and fresh water is severe so that freshwater is hard to preserve 2 with continual infiltration of rainfall recharge the fgl gradually forms and increases in thickness while the position of the underside of the transition zone does not change therefore the thickness of the transition zone is gradually reduced and finally reaches a steady state 5 3 comparison of tidal and nontidal models although we used an iterative algorithm to realize the long term simulation of a 2d tidal model and compared with the 3d nontidal model it was unclear whether this approach modification of dispersivity parameters suitably compensates for the lack of tidal effects in a non tidal model and this issue requires further study our model did however show that tidal action plays a major role in the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of fgls the tidal model simulates short term vertical fluctuations that are superimposed upon the long term flow regime fig 8 the non tidal model simulates only the long term flow regime another shortcoming of the non tidal model is that it cannot calibrate vertical permeabilities underwood et al 1992 pool et al 2015 studied the effects of tidal fluctuations and spatial heterogeneity on mixing and spreading in spatially heterogeneous coastal aquifers they found that once tidal oscillations boundary was included as the degree of heterogeneity increases the combined effect of heterogeneity and tidal oscillations on mixing and spreading of the interface reduces they also identified that the mixing behavior induced by tidal oscillations in heterogeneous coastal aquifers is controlled by the effective tidal mixing number n tm e which depends on the amplitude the period the storativity and the effective horizontal permeability however if the transition zone of the fgls is wide the analytical solution seems not suitable as stated in section 4 3 above the analytical solution assumes that the system is in hydrostatic equilibrium and that freshwater and seawater are immiscible fluids separated by a sharp continuous interface of equivalent pressure fetter 1972 vacher 1988 post et al 2018a b as a matter of fact this does not accord the fact especially for those tidal models because the broad transition zone that exists beneath the island is produced by the oscillating flow velocities that cause mixing between the fresh water and salt water on each tidal cycle ignoring tidally driven flow would mean ignoring this mixing mechanism and could lead to gross overestimation of the amount of potable water 2 5 seawater that might be available this could lead to unrealistic responses when the model is later used in a predictive mode oberdorfer et al 1990 the ghijben herzberg principle usually thought that the maximum fgl thickness is 40 times than the highest fgl water table elevation above msl post et al 2018a b however according to our research result this ratio seems a bit high especially for those thicker transition zone therefore we may need to modify this ratio in practical problem such as 20 40 we regard it as the effective ghijben herzberg ratio eghr vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 evaluated the influence of tides on groundwater dynamics and propagation of the tidal wave they provided an exhaustive insight in that there are two interfering flow cycles on the sloping shore the first is a shallow tidally fluctuating flow cycle on the shore due to the interaction of the gently sloping shore and the tidally oscillating sea level the second is a deeper flow cycle from the dunes towards the sea however this flow cycle is rarely found in coral islands because the coral island is surrounded by the reef flat which are flat and also not wide compared to the continental shore shown in fig 2 in addition the attenuation and time lag of the wave would be influenced by the large difference in storage s or specified yield sy change of the aquifer in tidal model because the fluctuation of the water level will cause the elasticity of the aquifer and of the water carr and kamp 1969 erskine 1991 vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 liu et al 2012 however in the non tidal model no matter how we change these two parameters s sy within reasonable limits they both play an insensitive role in the model because the water table acts as a constant head boundary during the whole simulation phase and does not influence the elastic release quantity the addition of tidal boundary also plays an important role in some hydrogeological events simulation underwood et al 1992 evaluated the effects of a drought event on fgls by the tidal model and non tidal model respectively after a steady state lens condition was reached the recharge was stopped for a 1 year simulation period however they found that during the drought period the transition zone thickness of the tidal model increased by approximately 20 with the greatest response occurring in the upper part of the transition zone however in the nontidal model the simulated transition zone thickness actually decreased by about 10 yang et al 2013 analyzed the effects of tides and storm surges on coastal aquifers groundwater and found that tidal activity would intensify for the formation of the recirculating zone beneath the upper part of intertidal zone but does not affect the position of the seawater freshwater interface the tidal model retains the true tidal boundary conditions and best describes the atoll island groundwater flow system and the transition zone thickness including the average permeability distributions permeability contrasts and estimates of freshwater storage however the large computational requirement is undesirable sometimes in addition groundwater modeling necessarily involves generalizations and simplifications and specific problems need specific solutions consequently more detailed analyses are needed to further improve our understanding of the responses of atoll fgls to tidal action 6 conclusions reclaimed islands not only provide valuable land for urban development e g industrial base national defense and commercial ground or residential area but can also be important freshwater aquifers for retaining rainfall and store fresh water the reported study investigated the formation process of a freshwater lens on a reclaimed island yongshu island whose reclamation project was completed in 2015 based on a comprehensive data set of meteorological geological and groundwater data a numerical model was constructed which was used to perform a series of numerical simulations to reveal the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of a shallow fgl on an atoll island the prediction of thickness and formation time of the fgl have also been discussed the results clearly show that there are two time scale dynamics that affect the formation of fgls on a short time scale about 0 5 1 h the tidal dynamics are dominant because lower pleistocene aquifers have a high conductivity tidal signals will rapidly move inland through the lower aquifers and will then be propagated upwards to influence the water level in the holocene sediments this causes fgl oscillations and increased mixing between the salt water and fresh water at long time scales the time step is longer and the boundary conditions are simplified to hydrostatic sea water conditions at this scale the groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall infiltration and groundwater is subsequently discharged to the sea the two time scales for fgl dynamics beneath an atoll island thus comprise short term tidal fluctuations superimposed on long term average flow lines fig 11 we divided the formation of a fgl on a reclaimed island into three stages in the first stage the preparatory stage approximately 2 5 years coral sand was leached and the salt was removed thus making it possible for a fgl to form the second stage was the formation stage with continuous infiltration of rainfall recharge the fgl gradually formed and became thicker this stage usually lasts longer than the preparatory stage the third stage was the pseudo steady state phase the fgl reached a long term equilibrium thickness and was in a pseudo steady state the recharge and the thurber discontinuity determined the thickness the preparatory stage clearly lasted 2 5 years with continual rainfall infiltration the fgl on the yongshu island will reached a pseudo stable state in approximately 20 years and the maximum thickness of the fgl was approximately 15 m although our monitoring period was mainly focused on the two years after the completion of the reclamation project on the yongshu island it is of great significance for studying the formation of fgls and overcome the shortcomings of the previous conceptual model large scale island reclamation projects similar to those undertaken in the south china sea are rare in the rest of the world and this is also the natural experimental site for studying the formation of fgls our results demonstrate the potential of retaining large volumes of freshwater in the aquifers of reclaimed islands as long as sufficient rainfall and island area can be ensured credit authorship contribution statement chong sheng conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation

5607,groundwater on remote coral atoll islands in tropical oceans occurs in the form of freshwater groundwater lenses fgls that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants and ecosystems continuous recharge of freshwater from rainfall can flush out salt water and eventually create a fgl beneath the natural or reclaimed island however the process whereby a fgl grows in reclaimed islands and the dynamic mechanisms and formation process are unclear this study used numerical modeling for a reclaimed island in the south china sea to evaluate the process of mixing between freshwater and saltwater dynamic mechanisms and the formation process of fgls influenced by tidal action our results revealed that the long term average flow lines of fgls were superimposed by short term tidal fluctuations beneath the atoll island the tidal signals move rapidly inland from the lower aquifer and are then propagated upwards to drive the water level in the holocene sediments this causes an oscillation of the fgls and increased mixing between salt and fresh water the formation of the fgls can be divided into three stages preparatory formation and pseudo steady state yongshu island a reclaimed island was used as a case study the island s preparatory phase lasted approximately 2 5 years and will take 20 years to form a stable fgl with a thickness of about 15 m recharge rates and the nature of the contact between the holocene and the underlying pleistocene aquifers determine the shape of the fgls beneath the island abstraction during the formative period of the fgls will increase the time required to reach a stable state the results obtained enhance the understanding of the formation of fgls and can provide a reference for the management of freshwater resources on atoll islands keywords freshwater lens reclaimed island numerical simulation yongshu island dynamic mechanism formation process 1 introduction atolls are typically ring shaped reefs surrounding or partly surrounding a relatively shallow seawater lagoon or a sinking volcano and are usually associated with one or more small coral islands werner et al 2017 available information indicates that there are approximately 425 atolls in the world falkland 1992 and most of them are located in the indian ocean pacific ocean and atlantic ocean between 30 n and 30 s fig 1 a furthermore over one million people live on these atolls falkland 1991 barnett and adger 2003 unesco 2016 these tropical coral islands usually have a low elevation when the recharge from rainfall exceeds the losses through evapotranspiration discharge into the ocean and lagoon mixing with underlying seawater and groundwater abstraction for human use a fresh groundwater lens fgl may form post et al 2018a b and float above the denser saline groundwater originating from sea water origin werner et al 2017 these fgls are a vital source of freshwater for terrestrial ecosystems and domestic consumption especially during frequent and sometimes lengthy dry seasons therefore it is important to understand the formation process and the internal dynamic mechanisms of fgls underwood et al 1992 griggs and peterson 1993 bryan et al 2016 in the field survey undertaken by falkland s 1994 in the south cocos keeling atolls in the indian ocean the smallest island with a fgl was about 270 m wide under a recharge w of 1938 mm y if the island width is less than this value the precipitation will quickly flow into the ocean and cannot form a fgl underwood et al 1992 used numerical simulation to analyze the scale effect and concluded that if a threshold thickness of 2 3 m is required to maintain a developable lens the minimum viable island width was about 250 m for a recharge rate of 2 0 m yr a series of surveys and studies about barrier islands have been also carried out in the east frisian barrier island chain in northwestern germany recently r√∂per et al 2013 holt et al 2017 post et al 2019 the researchers found that a shallow freshwater lens can also be formed in such a barrier island and changed during the development of geomorphology however on such small islands the fgl is connected to the sea water through the pores or karst caves and the effects of tidal fluctuation on the fgl are direct and obvious in coastal aquifers tides influence the groundwater flow pattern salinity distribution and characteristics of groundwater flow to the sea werner et al 2013 when a tidal signal travels inland the amplitude reduction is quantified by the tidal efficiency Œµ which is the ratio of the tidal amplitude of the groundwater to that of the sea hunt and peterson 1980 the time difference between high or low tide in the ocean and the peak or trough of the groundwater fluctuation is referred to as tidal lag t œÑ hunt and peterson 1980 both Œµ and t œÑ can reflect the characteristics of the groundwater velocity field and the stratigraphic structure of atoll islands e g carr and kamp 1969 herman et al 1986 erskine 1991 underwood et al 1992 the impacts of geological heterogeneity spatially variable groundwater recharge and rising sea levels on the geometry of fgls has been addressed by schneider and kruse 2003 chui and terry 2013 and gulley et al 2016 however few studies have considered the detailed flow processes within the fgls especially under tidal boundary conditions which are crucial for the formation of fgls dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 usually no rivers or streams are found on atoll islands and atmospheric rainfall is the only replenishment source for the fgls during the rainwater seepage fresh water will flow to the island edge under the influence of the hydraulic gradient and continuously push the saltwater outward enabling the persistence of the fgls dose et al 2014 and stoeckl et al 2015 verified fgl velocity field characteristics by using physical experiments combined with tracer tests underwood et al 1992 used a variable density numerical model finite difference model to further explore the effect of tidal action and focused on the transition zone they concluded that the vertical component of longitudinal dispersion coupled with the vertical oscillations through the pleistocene aquifer will significantly affect the thickness of the transition zone however the larger longitudinal dispersion will intensify the mixing of fresh and salt water and result in a thinner fgl which is different from the behavior noted for continental coastal aquifers for continental aquifers longitudinal dispersion and transverse dispersion usually have the same contribution to the width of the transition zone abarca et al 2007 therefore in many subsequent works on non tidal atoll models the dispersivity parameters were adjusted to compensate for the lack of tidal effects on the transition zone width ghassemi et al 2000 alam et al 2002 comte et al 2014 atoll islands are generally composed of two overlying aquifer formations which comprise unconsolidated holocene sediments deposited unconformably on pleistocene limestone reef deposits ayers and vacher 1986 white and falkland 2010 this can be termed a binary geological structure bgs the contact between the holocene and pleistocene aquifers typically occurs at a depth of 10 25 m and is known as the thurber discontinuity or holocene pleistocene unconformity ayers and vacher 1986 buddemeier and oberdorfer 2004 werner et al 2017 a report made by cox 1951 on the arno atoll in the marshall islands provided a comprehensive description of an atoll island dual aquifer system vacher 1988 considered four general non homogeneous cases including the bgs case c and developed analytical models for each of them which was verified by dose et al 2014 therefore a more reliable conceptual hydrogeological model can be considered a dual aquifer system subjected to laterally and vertically propagated tidal signals examples of atoll islands with dual aquifer systems include those in the majuro atoll marshall islands the cocos keeling islands the diego garcia atoll as well as the yongxing island xisha islands and the yongshu atoll nansha islands at present many extensive islands have been created by filling the sea and these artificial islands not only provide valuable space for urban development but also can serve as valuable aquifers hu and jiao 2014 yao et al 2019 examples of reclaimed land include the largest artificial island palm island and its adjacent islands in dubai that span a recreational area of about 80 km2 the rectangular reclaimed island of kansai international airport 38 km2 in japan about 76 km2 of reclaimed island in singapore constructed for supporting its economic growth van ginkel 2015 donchyts et al 2016 yao et al 2019 recently reclaimed islands have also been constructed for others purposes in the south china sea fig 1b groundwater lenses beneath these reclaimed islands are analogous to those beneath natural islands werner et al 2017 but differences exist the difference between artificial islands and natural islands is manifested in their shape and the geological structure artificial sedimentary sequence created by multiple sources of filling materials and compaction technology yan et al 2013 alzaylaie and abdelaziz 2016 yao et al 2019 van ginkel 2015 discussed three artificial aquifers designs while constructing reclaimed islands and evaluated the efficiency of different mining methods yao et al 2019 used a series of 3 d density dependent flow and transport conceptual models seawat to investigate the mixing process of fresh and salt water and to quantify the potential maximum volume and formation time of fresh groundwater that can occur beneath reclaimed islands however this study is more theoretical and the stratigraphic structure of the model was set randomly which is in conflict with the actual situation for coral islands in addition limited by data availability and high computation requirements the study also did not consider tidal boundaries and the shape of islands on the basis of analytical models of islands proposed by fetter 1972 and vacher 1988 hu and jiao 2014 obtained steady state analytical solutions for groundwater levels and the thickness of fgls assuming the reclamation site of a single zone of uniform hydraulic parameters previous studies mainly focused on natural islands including the influence of climate factors human factors and sea level rise on the already formed freshwater lens alam and falkland 1997 bailey et al 2009 chui and terry 2013 bailey and jenson 2014 however the formation process and dynamics mechanisms of fgls remain poorly understood especially in the case of reclaimed islands werner et al 2017 post et al 2018a b while some works on the formation of island freshwater lenses have studied them physically analytically and numerically in detail fetter 1972 vacher 1988 dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 post et al 2018a b yao et al 2019 few investigations have considered the effect of the tidal boundary during the formation process of the fgls particularly in the cases of some reclaimed islands furthermore most of these previous works were conceptual and did not involve any realistic aquifer data or observation data in order to overcome these limitations it is also necessary to verify them using a practical case as the pressure induced by climate change and population increase intensifies the construction of reclaimed islands will become an increasingly popular method in the small island developing states sids furthermore a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the formation process of fgls can provide further information for future studies barnett and adger 2003 this study is the first to comprehensively characterize the groundwater flow system and formation process of fgls for a reclaimed island in the south china sea based on the previously unpublished observation and field data a numerical model of variable density flow and solute transport was established for the yongshu island which is an exemplar system of reclaimed atoll islands reclamation based on a dual aquifer system worldwide zhu et al 2014 the main objectives were to 1 describe the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of the fgl of the yongshu island 2 evaluate the impact of hydrogeological factors and abstraction on the formation process of the fgl and 3 to compare the difference between tidal and non tidal models and further analyze the adaptability of different models 2 study area the study area is located on the yongshu atoll of the nansha islands latitude 9 37 n longitude 112 58 e in the south china sea the yongshu island is a typical coral island fig 2 but has been modified its surface layer 3 4 m is composed of artificially filled coral sand the yongshu island reclamation project began in august 2014 and was finished in september 2015 before reclamation the land area mainly located in the southwest region was less than 0 2 km2 after reclamation the yongshu island had a length of 3 71 km and a maximum width of 0 99 km and had an area of 2 23 km2 the topography is flat and the elevation of the land surface is usually 3 4 m above the mean sea level msl the construction project for reclaimed islands in the south china sea adopted the overall technical routes of natural simulation the building techniques used in the yongshu island generally involved cutter suction dredging csd and or trailing hopper dredging thd large cutter suction dredgers were used to cut pump loose coral gravel excavated in the surrounding lagoon or other parts of the reef and fill or accumulate on the objective reef flat through a duct to form a foundation platform fig 2a please find more details of this process in the website https amti csis org maps generally speaking this process is very similar to the formation of natural coral islands which mainly depends on storm or tidal waves to move and carry coral debris to form the island werner et al 2017 but reclaimed islands have accelerated this process therefore the permeability properties of the artificial coral sand for reclaimed islands is very similar to those of natural sands zhu et al 2014 jiang 2018 in 1990 the nanyong 1 engineering geological borehole was drilled on the reef flat in this small atoll having a depth of 152 1 m it reached up to the early pleistocene of the quaternary period zhao et al 1992 later in 1994 the nanyong 2 engineering geological borehole was drilled reaching a depth of 413 7 m and progressing to the miocene of the tertiary period zhu et al 1997 according to drilling information fig 2b a seismic reflection time profile and a borehole section fig 2c obtained for the island the unconformity surface of the upper holocene and lower pleistocene aquifer is approximately 20 m below mean sea level msl sun et al 2003 zhu et al 2014 there are some sub aquifers in the holocene aquifer caused by the transport of deposits by waves and tides although it differs in granularities and shapes the lithology and hydrological properties do not change much across the region therefore we regard them as a hydrogeological units hgu furthermore the upper artificial layer is mainly composed of coral sand excavated from the lagoon and reef flat and shows some similarities to natural coral sand zhu et al 2014 jiang 2018 the average temperature of the yongshu atoll is above 28 0 and the average daily or monthly variations and the difference between winter and summer temperatures are small the lowest annual temperature 26 7 c is recorded in january and the highest temperature 29 6 c appears in may the average relative humidity of the yongshu island is 81 and the extreme minimum is 51 which occurs in january zhao 1996 according to our groundwater monitoring data variation in the groundwater temperature with time at different depths 2 m 5 m 8 m 20 m is shown in fig 3 below with the increase in depth fluctuation in the water temperature becomes smaller and the temperature remains mainly between 26 5 c and 28 5 c in addition the temperature variation at different depths at the same time is less than 0 8 c therefore the effect of temperature on mixing between seawater and fresh water at different depths can be considered negligible this is also the reason that we ignore the temperature boundary in our actual numerical simulation the distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration in the study area is shown in fig 4 a there is a small meteorological station on the island and monitoring records were available for the monitoring period from september 2016 to june 2018 it can be seen that annual rainfall is abundant at the yongshu atoll but the distribution among the months is extremely uneven the mean annual rainfall for this period was 2972 mm and the rainfall mainly concentrated from august to january of the following year when 67 of the annual rainfall occurred from february to may there was a very little rainfall which accounted for only 15 3 of the annual rainfall thus this period can be considered as the dry season on the island in addition the spatial distribution of rainfall was also uneven fig 4b because of some rainfall catchment system on the airport runway and some buildings the actual recharge of these region was established by referring to the report made by gingerich et al 2017 due to equipment constraints the potential evaporation data here were the surface evaporation data the diameter of the surface evaporator was 618 2 mm and a depth of 600 mm look like fig 4a and the accuracy of the water surface micrometer was 0 1 mm the potential evaporation was calculated by the difference in the water level under the influence of monsoon and high temperature the monthly average evaporation in the study area was only about 100 mm in general the groundwater recharge to a coral island is not equivalent to the rainfall the relationship between recharge and rainfall can be expressed as follows falkland and woodroffe 2004 comte et al 2014 werner et al 2017 post et al 2018a b 1 r p e t Œ¥ v where r is the recharge mm p is the rainfall mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm and Œ¥v is the change in storage within the soil moisture zone mm the water budget is calculated using long time steps 1 month and the coarse nature of sandy material ensures that the field capacity is very low and does not allow water retention therefore the available water content of the soil Œ¥v was usually neglected hunt and peterson 1980 falkland 1991 comte et al 2014 werner et al 2017 gingerich et al 2017 in addition because the yongshu island is an artificial refill island therefore the vegetation on the island is currently sparse surface runoff was neglected because of the high infiltration capacity of the soils the flat topography and the lack of surface flow features on the island roupsard et al 2006 reported an excellent correlation between the actual evapotranspiration et and the penman monteith potential evapotranspiration et0 for the vanuatu island south pacific 15 26 6 s 167 11 5 e which was verified by comte et al 2014 for grande glorieuse according to the following equation 2 e t 0 5 0 86 e t 0 0 62 0 3 r 2 0 98 using eqs 1 and 2 the monthly recharge r mm was calculated from the average monthly rainfall p mm fig 4a from the rainfall recharge formula the infiltration recharge was calculated to be 2150 mm per year which is 72 of the rainfall the study area is affected by the tropical weather system all year round the most important wind field is characterized by the monsoon which is characterized by the prevailing winter wind of the ne and the summer wind of the prevailing wind direction of the sw in addition it is also affected by the tropical cyclone but it is mainly concentrated at 10 n the tidal phenomena in the yongshu atoll area are mainly dominated by tidal waves carried into the south china sea by the bashi channel in the western pacific ocean the variation in the tidal fluctuation is generally no more than 1 6 m and results in an irregular full diurnal tide there is a high tide level and a low tide level every day fig 4b under the control of seasonal risk the surface current has a prevailing nw direction in winter and a prevailing ne direction in the summer the waves also show obvious seasonal changes ne waves prevail in winter and s and sw waves prevail in the summer zhao 1996 our groundwater monitoring work started in october 2016 with data recording intervals of 30 min at the time of investigation the reclamation project had been completed for one year in terms of the observation salinity data of the wells n8 n7 and n6 shown as the fig 2c the salinity of the groundwater at the depth of 2 m decreased to about 22 5 g l in october 2016 1 year later after completion of the land reclamation while the observed salinities of the three wells at the depth of 5 m were 33 5 g l 27 7 g l and 23 6 g l respectively two years after the reclamation project of the yongshu island the salinities of the groundwater at the depth of 2 m of the wells n8 n7 and n6 were 18 2 g l 7 7 g l and 6 3 g l respectively overall the salinity of all observation wells on the yongshu island suggested brackish water and no freshwater has been produced so far at present there are few residents on the island and their drinking water is mainly obtained using a desalinator additional sources of potable water are rainwater harvesting devices near the airport runway and on some rooftops in addition there are several pumping wells on the island but the amount of abstraction is limited by the high salinity of the groundwater therefore the yongshu island is an ideal island for studying the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of fresh groundwater lenses 3 numerical model 3 1 model set up the numerical simulation used in the present study was carried out using seawat ver 4 langevin et al 2008 a finite difference model developed by the us geological survey usgs which combines modflow and the mt3dms to simulate variable density groundwater flow and solute transport and has been verified and used widely for simulating seawater intrusion we used this code to solve the following coupled flow and transport equations langevin et al 2008 3 œÅ k f h f œÅ œÅ f œÅ f z œÅ s f h f t Œ∏ œÅ c c t œÅ s q s and 4 Œ∏ c t Œ∏ d c Œ∏ v c q s c s where œÅ is the fluid density ml 3 k f is the equivalent fresh water hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h f is the equivalent fresh

density in the source sink q s is the source sink flow rate t 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2t 1 v is the pore water velocity l t and cs is the salt concentration in the sources sinks long term time series i e decadal of tidal boundaries are often not available where fgl studies are needed this makes it difficult to calibrate 3 d models because when we want to simulate tidal boundaries we usually need to split the time period into small intervals e g 0 021 d so the model can feels the change of boundaries this incurs a large computation time and requires high storage capacity the other reason is that building and calibrating 3d models require substantial observation and aquifer data if we don t have so much data it will reduce the accuracy of numerical models therefore the present study opted to work with a 2d model based on the profile a a fig 2 to provide an understanding of the main processes occurring in the fgl fig 5 the cross section had a width of 1400 m including the island and reef flat in the vertical plane three distinctive geological structures were recognized an upper layer of 20 m of coarse coral derived carbonate sands artificial coral sand and an underlying cemented reef limestone the model domain was mainly discretized into uniform finite difference grids 10 m 1 m with 140 columns and 50 layers and 6731 active cells the thickness of the first layer varied according to the surface topography 3 2 initial and boundary conditions 3 2 1 initial conditions fgls usually form over long periods 20 150 years comte et al 2014 holding and allen 2015 and it is difficult to conduct tidal simulation for such a long time without parallel computing clusters therefore we used an iterative algorithm here to achieve a long time scale simulation of tidal action the simulation results concentration and head distribution of one stage were considered as the initial conditions of the next stage as for the initial stage before the fgl was formed the initial concentration for the entire model was 35 0 g l and the initial head of the model was the mean sea level 0 m after running the model for 120 d in the first stage with the tidal boundary the second stage was reached for which the steady state salinity and water head distribution obtained from the previous operation were set as the new initial conditions shown in table 1 the model was then run until it reached a pseudo steady state was attained where in salinity and water head of the fgl showed little changes and these changes were periodic and tide induced underwood et al 1992 holding and allen 2015 3 2 2 boundary conditions fig 5 shows the boundary conditions of the numerical model the topmost layer was assigned to the specified flux boundaries and depended on the calculated recharge rate in contrast the boundary fluid pressure was specified along the reef and lagoon basement to simulate the presence of sea water with source water at the nodes along these boundaries assigned a salt concentration of 35 0 g l to represent sea water the approach used for the addition of tidal boundaries is of note the tidal model has very large computational requirements because of the short length of the time steps which may be no more than 1 5 h so that the system can sense the effects of the tidal fluctuations underwood et al 1992 therefore we chose the tidal signal measured for 2880 h 120 d as the specified head condition shown as fig 4b and each stress period was 0 5 h the specified head can only change at the beginning of each stress period and therefore a step function was used to fit the tidal curve look like fig 5 mulligan et al 2011 specifically the complete tidal cycle was divided into 20 stress periods each with a duration of 0 021 d 30 min in addition no flow boundaries were assigned to the bottom of the mesh domain 3 3 model parameters model parameters were mainly obtained by field or laboratory tests and from literature bailey et al 2009 bailey et al 2014 deng and bailey 2017 jiang 2018 because the artificial coral sand is mainly above the groundwater table the hydrologic parameters of this aquifer were obtained through laboratory experiments however the horizontal and vertical k of the holocene aquifer were obtained by the pumping test undertaken by jiang 2018 parameters for the lower pleistocene layer are difficult to obtain using pumping tests because of the extremely high k therefore the initial k of the lower aquifer was based on results from a previous study on maldives atoll bailey et al 2009 bailey et al 2014 deng and bailey 2017 which was based on the considerations that the yongshu island is at the same latitude as the maldives and the type of coral reef and genetic environment at these two locations are similar therefore the hydrogeological parameters of the lower pleistocene layer have certain similarities in both cases the hydrogeological parameters assigned to the numerical model are summarized in the table 2 3 4 model output and calibration water level loggers were installed at different sites as shown in fig 2c we used the ltc levelogger solinst canada with specific observation depths at 2 m 5 m and 8 m beneath the water surface and a monitoring interval of 30 min the monitoring records were available for the monitoring period of october 2016 december 2017 the water level electrical conductivity and temperature were recorded for comparison with the modelled total dissolved solid tds concentrations the measured electricity conductivity ec values in units of ms cm were converted to tds in units of kg m3 by multiplying by 0 72 the ec tds conversion was obtained by comparison between ec and tds values when water chemistry data were available galvis rodriguez et al 2017 the model output results include the concentration distribution of different stages and the velocity fields under different stress periods we used a tds concentration of 0 875 kg m3 2 5 of the sea water to distinguish between potable fresh water and non potable sea water and to represent the boundary of the fgl bailey et al 2014 in addition tidal effects at different depths and locations on the island were also calculated these effects included the tidal efficiency Œµ which is the ratio of the groundwater tidal amplitude to that of the sea and tidal lag t œÑ which is the time difference between high or low tide in the ocean and the corresponding peak or trough of the groundwater fluctuation hunt and peterson 1980 the total simulation time was subdivided into a calibration period from october 2016 to december 2017 and a prediction period from december 2017 to the time when the fgl of the yongshu island reached a pseudo steady state the calibrated parameters were the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities kh and kv respectively porosity n and dispersivity horizontal longitudinal l and transverse t when the shape of the fgl reached a steady state we also used the analytical model case c proposed by vacher 1988 which was corrected by dose et al 2014 to verify the numerical solution due to the limitations of the analytical solution we had to undertake some generalizations of the aquifer to make the aquifer boundary more regular such that a probable result can be obtained shown in fig 5 therefore there were four calibration indicators for model accuracy a comparison of the curve of the water level for the simulation and observation results and calculation the root mean square error rmse b verification of the error of tidal effects tidal efficiency Œµ tidal lag t œÑ c comparison of concentrations of the multilevel observation wells were compared to the model calculated concentrations in the cells corresponding to the location and depth of the measurement point d ensuring thickness of the fgls are approximately the same as or smaller than the values of the analytic solution 4 results 4 1 calibration results fig 6 shows the comparison of the water level fluctuation and salinity of the multi level observation wells with the modeled results for the part of calibration and validation periods due to the equipment limitations we only obtained the water level fluctuation data at a depth of 5 m in observation wells n8 n7 and n6 and a depth of 2 m in the observation well n8 in the same period other depth observation data were incomplete for this same period the difference between the simulated water level and the observed water level was small with the final root mean square error rmse being 9 2 m 7 9 m 6 5 m and 24 5 m during the validation period respectively this represents scaled rmse values of 7 1 12 1 9 8 and 18 7 respectively indicating an acceptable level of model measurement mismatch for the proposed application of the model particularly considering the heterogeneous nature of the island s subsurface the high temporal dynamics and the manual approach to model calibration it is not sufficient for the model calibration to be based only on water levels therefore we also calibrated the model using groundwater salinity data fig 6e and f show the calibration of the groundwater salinity for the yongshu island after one and two years of reclamation although our monitoring period was limited there was a significant decrease in the salinity of the groundwater during this period and the salinity of groundwater at a depth of 2 m was approximately 20 of that of sea water in october 2017 moreover the calculated values of tidal lag and tidal efficiency based on the water level fluctuation data are shown in fig 7 as the distance from the coast increased the tidal efficiency gradually decreased while the tidal lag time increased in the same direction however in the center of the island the tidal lag and efficiency remained essentially the same and at values of 35 and 2 4 h respectively the model values match the geometry of the salinity distribution for the measured data reasonably well 4 2 dynamic mechanism of fgl based on the verification of the accuracy of the model the dynamic mechanisms of the fgl on the yongshu island was predicted as shown in fig 8 in terms of velocity fields fig 8a1 a5 the propagation pattern of tidal signals based on the simulated flow path can be clearly seen because the permeability of the lower aquifer is much larger than that of the upper unconsolidated sediments the tidal signal was propagated laterally very rapidly through the highly permeable pleistocene layer and then moved vertically into the upper aquifer if the timescale is long the time step was 10 days the velocities over short time scales caused by tidal effects can be neglected the velocity characteristics under such conditions are shown in fig 8 a6 the particle tracking code modpath pollock 2012 here was used for this evaluation a total of 102 particles were placed across the model domain to track flow paths this artificial groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall on the land surface with subsequent discharges to the sea in conclusion the present study showed that the dynamic mechanisms involved in the formation of fgls beneath an atoll island have two different timescales long term average flow lines that are superimposed by short term tidal fluctuations underwood et al 1992 yao et al 2019 4 3 formation process of fgl of yongshu island fig 9 shows the predicted formation process for the yongshu island s fgl the maximum simulation time was 50 years within 2 5 years after reclamation no fresh water accumulated fig 9b1 we regard this stage as a preparatory phase the coral sand is leached to remove the salt with continual infiltration from rainfall recharge the fgl gradually forms and increases in thickness five years after the reclamation project was completed on yongshu island the maximum thickness of the fgl was about 7 5 m fig 9b2 by approximately 2035 the fgl will reach a steady state and the maximum thickness of the fgl will be 15 m fig 9b5 the thickness of fgl is not evenly distributed in space the thickness on the northwest side is high the maximum thickness is 15 m and that on the southeast side is small reflecting the relationship between the freshwater lens and the hydrogeologic structure at the same period with continual infiltration of rainfall recharge the transition zone of the fgl gradually became thinner and the final thickness was 17 m at the center of the island besides we also compared the results between analytical and numerical solutions at the steady state it can be seen that there is a big difference between them the maximum thickness gave by the analytical solution is about 28 m which is much larger than the numerical result however this is acceptable that the analytical solution assumes that the system is in hydrostatic equilibrium and that freshwater and seawater are immiscible fluids separated by a sharp continuous interface of equivalent pressure vacher 1988 werner et al 2017 post et al 2018a b which will have a overestimate result sometimes we will discuss this phenomenon in more detail below in order to better realize the freshwater lens of the yongshu island we also carried out the establishment of a 3d model fig 10 shows the 3d shape of the fgl during a stable period for the yongshu island underwood et al 1992 ghassemi et al 2000 and comte et al 2014 have shown that non tidal models of atoll islands require modification of the dispersivity parameters to compensate for the lack of tidal effects on the mixing zone width alam et al 2002 compared their tidal model of bonriki island kiribati to the previous non tidal model proposed by alam and falkland 1997 and found that the tidal and non tidal variants required calibrated t values of 0 05 m and 1 m respectively in the present study we calibrated the 3d non tidal model based on the simulation results of profile a a by adjusting the dispersivity parameters it can be seen that topography also plays an important role in the formation of the fgl the thickness of the fgl varies at different positions and the maximum thickness of the fgl was near the profile a a 5 discussion 5 1 dynamic mechanism and tidal effects as a reclaimed island the yongshu island provides study opportunities that other natural islands do not provide specific attention has been paid to how fgls are formed and how large it is the changes with time and space in the fgl formation were captured reasonably well by the numerical model although our assessment of the formation process was largely subjective due to the limitation of the field data the calibration results and the use of model input parameters that fall within the range of expected values suggest that the model is an adequate tool for exploring fgl behavior under various boundary conditions our application of the model provided new insights into fgls compared to previous studies dose et al 2014 stoeckl et al 2015 yao et al 2019 these insights are important for understanding the physical processes that occur within atoll island settings tidal efficiency and average tidal lags were calculated for the upper and lower aquifer and these computations provided a means for analyzing the relation between tidal effects and depth or distance from a shoreline generally tidal effects are transmitted from the shoreline toward the center of the island and thus tidal efficiencies decrease inward whereas tidal lags increase in the same direction however in the present study the tidal effects in the central area of the island remained essentially unchanged which are consistent with the actual observation data obtained for some coral islands hunt and peterson 1980 herman et al 1986 ghassemi et al 2000 white and falkland 2010 for example a relationship between the tidal response and depth on enjebi island enewetak atoll obtained by herman et al 1986 showed that the Œµ varied from 5 to 10 near the water table but increased to 70 at a depth of 10 m below the msl similarly tœÑ decreased from 3 5 h at the water table to nearly 0 5 h at the 10 m below the msl in terms of distance the Œµ of the central area of the island remains basically the same about 5 but at the coastal zone it was above 60 due to the permeability of the pleistocene aquifer being very high 102 103 m d the tidal signals rapidly moved inland from the lower aquifers and then propagated upward to drive the water level in the holocene sediments causing the fgls to oscillate and thus increasing the mixing between salt and fresh water unlike the numerical simulation results without tidal boundary obtained by griggs and peterson 1993 and stoeckl et al 2015 more generally all four velocity field drawings fig 8a1 a5 serve to illustrate the dominant presence of vertical groundwater flow in the central portion of the island however if the timescale is longer time step is 10 d those velocity over short timescales caused by tide is no longer obvious the flow path looks like the fig 8 a6 where the groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall on the land surface with subsequent discharges to the sea this process mainly depends on the recharge rate and the density difference between seawater and fresh water these two scale velocity characteristics exist simultaneously and affect each other 5 2 stages of fgl formation on the whole the formation of a fgl can be divided into three stages fig 11 taking the yongshu island for example in the first stage about 2 5 years coral sand is leached and the salt is removed thus enabling a fgl to form this can be regarded as the preparatory phase with continual infiltration of rainfall recharge the fgl gradually forms and increases in thickness we refer to this as the formation stage this is the most important stage of fgl formation and may be affected by many factors for example if groundwater was abstracted from the fgl during this period the time needed for the fgl to reach a steady state will be extended the formation phase of a fgl usually takes 20 50 years comte et al 2014 holding and allen 2015 yao et al 2019 finally the fgl will reach a pseudo steady state at this stage the thickness of the fgl will fluctuate with the seasons and tides but the average thickness of the fgl does not change irrespective of whether natural islands or artificial islands models are used the formation process of fgl can be divided into these three stages if the concentration range of the transition zone is defined by salinities between 2 5 and 95 of seawater concentration it can be seen that the thickness of the transition zone is gradually reduced during the formation process this is mainly affected by two factors 1 the contact between the holocene and underlying pleistocene sediments known as the thurber discontinuity plays a vital influence here that restricts the further development of a freshwater lens due to the permeability coefficient of pleistocene aquifer being very large 102 103 m d the mixing between seawater and fresh water is severe so that freshwater is hard to preserve 2 with continual infiltration of rainfall recharge the fgl gradually forms and increases in thickness while the position of the underside of the transition zone does not change therefore the thickness of the transition zone is gradually reduced and finally reaches a steady state 5 3 comparison of tidal and nontidal models although we used an iterative algorithm to realize the long term simulation of a 2d tidal model and compared with the 3d nontidal model it was unclear whether this approach modification of dispersivity parameters suitably compensates for the lack of tidal effects in a non tidal model and this issue requires further study our model did however show that tidal action plays a major role in the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of fgls the tidal model simulates short term vertical fluctuations that are superimposed upon the long term flow regime fig 8 the non tidal model simulates only the long term flow regime another shortcoming of the non tidal model is that it cannot calibrate vertical permeabilities underwood et al 1992 pool et al 2015 studied the effects of tidal fluctuations and spatial heterogeneity on mixing and spreading in spatially heterogeneous coastal aquifers they found that once tidal oscillations boundary was included as the degree of heterogeneity increases the combined effect of heterogeneity and tidal oscillations on mixing and spreading of the interface reduces they also identified that the mixing behavior induced by tidal oscillations in heterogeneous coastal aquifers is controlled by the effective tidal mixing number n tm e which depends on the amplitude the period the storativity and the effective horizontal permeability however if the transition zone of the fgls is wide the analytical solution seems not suitable as stated in section 4 3 above the analytical solution assumes that the system is in hydrostatic equilibrium and that freshwater and seawater are immiscible fluids separated by a sharp continuous interface of equivalent pressure fetter 1972 vacher 1988 post et al 2018a b as a matter of fact this does not accord the fact especially for those tidal models because the broad transition zone that exists beneath the island is produced by the oscillating flow velocities that cause mixing between the fresh water and salt water on each tidal cycle ignoring tidally driven flow would mean ignoring this mixing mechanism and could lead to gross overestimation of the amount of potable water 2 5 seawater that might be available this could lead to unrealistic responses when the model is later used in a predictive mode oberdorfer et al 1990 the ghijben herzberg principle usually thought that the maximum fgl thickness is 40 times than the highest fgl water table elevation above msl post et al 2018a b however according to our research result this ratio seems a bit high especially for those thicker transition zone therefore we may need to modify this ratio in practical problem such as 20 40 we regard it as the effective ghijben herzberg ratio eghr vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 evaluated the influence of tides on groundwater dynamics and propagation of the tidal wave they provided an exhaustive insight in that there are two interfering flow cycles on the sloping shore the first is a shallow tidally fluctuating flow cycle on the shore due to the interaction of the gently sloping shore and the tidally oscillating sea level the second is a deeper flow cycle from the dunes towards the sea however this flow cycle is rarely found in coral islands because the coral island is surrounded by the reef flat which are flat and also not wide compared to the continental shore shown in fig 2 in addition the attenuation and time lag of the wave would be influenced by the large difference in storage s or specified yield sy change of the aquifer in tidal model because the fluctuation of the water level will cause the elasticity of the aquifer and of the water carr and kamp 1969 erskine 1991 vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 liu et al 2012 however in the non tidal model no matter how we change these two parameters s sy within reasonable limits they both play an insensitive role in the model because the water table acts as a constant head boundary during the whole simulation phase and does not influence the elastic release quantity the addition of tidal boundary also plays an important role in some hydrogeological events simulation underwood et al 1992 evaluated the effects of a drought event on fgls by the tidal model and non tidal model respectively after a steady state lens condition was reached the recharge was stopped for a 1 year simulation period however they found that during the drought period the transition zone thickness of the tidal model increased by approximately 20 with the greatest response occurring in the upper part of the transition zone however in the nontidal model the simulated transition zone thickness actually decreased by about 10 yang et al 2013 analyzed the effects of tides and storm surges on coastal aquifers groundwater and found that tidal activity would intensify for the formation of the recirculating zone beneath the upper part of intertidal zone but does not affect the position of the seawater freshwater interface the tidal model retains the true tidal boundary conditions and best describes the atoll island groundwater flow system and the transition zone thickness including the average permeability distributions permeability contrasts and estimates of freshwater storage however the large computational requirement is undesirable sometimes in addition groundwater modeling necessarily involves generalizations and simplifications and specific problems need specific solutions consequently more detailed analyses are needed to further improve our understanding of the responses of atoll fgls to tidal action 6 conclusions reclaimed islands not only provide valuable land for urban development e g industrial base national defense and commercial ground or residential area but can also be important freshwater aquifers for retaining rainfall and store fresh water the reported study investigated the formation process of a freshwater lens on a reclaimed island yongshu island whose reclamation project was completed in 2015 based on a comprehensive data set of meteorological geological and groundwater data a numerical model was constructed which was used to perform a series of numerical simulations to reveal the dynamic mechanisms and formation process of a shallow fgl on an atoll island the prediction of thickness and formation time of the fgl have also been discussed the results clearly show that there are two time scale dynamics that affect the formation of fgls on a short time scale about 0 5 1 h the tidal dynamics are dominant because lower pleistocene aquifers have a high conductivity tidal signals will rapidly move inland through the lower aquifers and will then be propagated upwards to influence the water level in the holocene sediments this causes fgl oscillations and increased mixing between the salt water and fresh water at long time scales the time step is longer and the boundary conditions are simplified to hydrostatic sea water conditions at this scale the groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall infiltration and groundwater is subsequently discharged to the sea the two time scales for fgl dynamics beneath an atoll island thus comprise short term tidal fluctuations superimposed on long term average flow lines fig 11 we divided the formation of a fgl on a reclaimed island into three stages in the first stage the preparatory stage approximately 2 5 years coral sand was leached and the salt was removed thus making it possible for a fgl to form the second stage was the formation stage with continuous infiltration of rainfall recharge the fgl gradually formed and became thicker this stage usually lasts longer than the preparatory stage the third stage was the pseudo steady state phase the fgl reached a long term equilibrium thickness and was in a pseudo steady state the recharge and the thurber discontinuity determined the thickness the preparatory stage clearly lasted 2 5 years with continual rainfall infiltration the fgl on the yongshu island will reached a pseudo stable state in approximately 20 years and the maximum thickness of the fgl was approximately 15 m although our monitoring period was mainly focused on the two years after the completion of the reclamation project on the yongshu island it is of great significance for studying the formation of fgls and overcome the shortcomings of the previous conceptual model large scale island reclamation projects similar to those undertaken in the south china sea are rare in the rest of the world and this is also the natural experimental site for studying the formation of fgls our results demonstrate the potential of retaining large volumes of freshwater in the aquifers of reclaimed islands as long as sufficient rainfall and island area can be ensured credit authorship contribution statement chong sheng conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation

5608,water storage in the tibetan plateau tp is extremely sensitive to climate change observations in tp have revealed warming and moistening trends before 2004 and weakening of those trends after 2004 these changes in the course of climate warming altered hydrological components in tp from the early years of 1992 2003 to the recent decade of 2004 2015 resulting in strong changes of the terrestrial water storage tws in tp in this study hydrological and climatic data that determine the budget of tws in tp were compiled from multiple data sources for 1992 2015 an empirical formula was developed by correlation analysis of tws from these data with tws derived from grace data for 2003 2015 in tp the estimated tws by the formula highly agrees with grace data in describing tws variations across tp even though it underestimates the absolute value of annual tws in north tp the formula was used to estimate tws variations in 1992 2003 which were compared to those in 2004 2015 major results show that 1 in the warm and wet region of south tp the recently reduced rate of climate warming and moistening reversed the trend of annual tws from increase in 1992 2003 to significant decrease in 2004 2015 this change is largely caused by decreases of soil water and groundwater storage and increased runoff 2 in the cold and dry region of north tp the increase of tws in 1992 2003 accelerated in 2004 2015 because of increases of soil moisture and lake storage 3 the difference of tws change in the north and south tp altered the multi year balance of water storage over the entire tp decreasing tws from 2004 to 2015 lowered multi year mean tws in south tp while increasing tws in north tp raised its multi year mean tws the reduction of tws in south tp with decrease of streamflow and groundwater storage could threaten the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources for this critical source region of asia s large rivers the accumulation of tws following the rise of surface water in north tp could increase spilling of lakes and thus risks of floods and debris flows keywords weakening of climate warming terrestrial water storage grace tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has experienced substantial climate warming in recent decades from 1984 to 2009 observational records show tp surface temperature rising at 0 46 decade 1 nearly 1 5 times of the average rate of global temperature 0 32 decade 1 zhang et al 2013a the warming was particularly strong in the 1990s largely because of fast rising temperatures in the winter season liu et al 2009 spatially the rate of warming is larger in the north than in the south tp e g yang et al 2011 you et al 2016 in the vertical direction there has been growing evidence that the warming rate increases with elevation in and around tp li et al 2017a gao et al 2019 this amplifying warming with elevation has profound impacts on snow glaciers and permafrost which constitute the majority of terrestrial water storage tws of tp and threatens the sustainability of the water tower of asia s big rivers fig 1 the tws of tp is the sum of glacial ice ice snow water equivalent swe permafrost pm soil moisture sm surface water in rivers r and lakes sws and groundwater gws understanding spatial and temporal changes of tws and responses of its components to climate warming is challenging because of the extreme terrains and associated complexity of climate in tp in south tp which has warm and wet climate water cycle is fast the melt of glaciers snow and permafrost feeds to big rivers such as the indus brahmaputra ganges yangtze and yellow rivers fig 1 meanwhile the disappearance of portions of permafrost zone cheng and jin 2013 allows considerable flow to penetrate into groundwater at a faster time scale walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in contrast in north tp which has dry and cold climate water cycle is relatively slow the area has a larger percentage of continuous permafrost zone plenty of lakes but sparse river networks the continuous permafrost zone slows groundwater dynamics characterized by long flow paths through fault fracture zones and small recharge and discharge because of limited talik areas cheng and jin 2013 meltwater of snow and ice mass and precipitation in higher elevations accumulate in lakes through sparse river networks these differences have resulted in different responses of tws to climate change in tp it is found from the data of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace that annual tws during 2003 2014 decreased at 30 55 mm a 1 in south tp but increased at 10 35 mm a 1 in interior tp areas marked by 8a b and c in fig 1 gardner et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 meng et al 2019 the increase of tws in interior tp is suggested to be caused by increase in precipitation and expansion of lake areas on the other hand the decrease of tws in south tp is attributed to glacial melting following the rise of temperatures deng et al 2017 in a recent study by meng et al 2019 tws changes in the entire tp from 2003 to 2014 are attributed largely to variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration et tws increase in the upstream of the yangtze and yellow rivers areas marked by 4a b and 5a b in fig 1 is largely caused by increase of annual precipitation tws depletion in brahmaputra area 1 in fig 1 results from the increase of et although changes of tws can be estimated by summing the changes of its components the procedure is complicated because of water transfer among the tws pools in tp glacier retreat has been considered a primary cause of tws depletion in high elevation areas jacob et al 2012 matsuo and heki 2010 the melting water of glacier can lead to lake expansion and increase of surface water storage sws such as in the interior tp during 2003 2009 zhang et al 2016 yao et al 2013 wang et al 2016 degradation of permafrost zone can cause the increase of groundwater gws as observed in the qaidam basin area 7 in fig 1 during 2003 2012 jiao et al 2015 water exchanges among the pools components of tws in tp would be enhanced when the climate warms and more water takes liquid form when the duration of frozen soils was shortened by 16 8 day decade 1 from 1988 to 2007 in tp increasing exchange between groundwater and surface water resulted in rising baseflow of major rivers ge et al 2011 bense et al 2012 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 zhang et al 2018 these changes of hydrological components are mostly for the period before the early 2000s and changes of the tws pools in tp are for the period after 2002 when grace data became available since early 2000s a transition in climate has taken place and shown by the reduced slope rate of the warming trend in tp fyfe et al 2016 this change in climate makes it difficult to comprehend the results of the previous studies that looked at tws changes in tp at different time periods and different phases of the climate variation in the past decades it is beneficial to reevaluate tws variations in a continuous time frame and a consistent context in such a context we can not only examine variations of hydrological cycle with changing climate but also understand how tws in tp has responded to the recent change of the warming trend since 2002 the significance of this understanding is that changes in the warming rate would likely to repeat in the 21st century and beyond easterling and wehner 2009 and knowing tws responses to such variations of the temperature will equip managements in tp and large river basins across east asia to make and adjust proactive decisions the objective of this study is to quantify spatial and temporal changes of tws in tp in response to temperature change particularly before and after early 2000s our study period is from 1992 to 2015 tws and its budget for the period of 1992 2003 are compared and contrasted to those from 2004 to 2015 changes of tws and its components between the two periods reveal the differences of the tws responses to variations in the intensity of the warming 2 study area the study area is the tibetan plateau tp and shown in fig 1 tp covers about 3 01 million square kilometers it is regarded as the roof of the world with an average elevation over 4000 m fan et al 2010 decorated by the earth s highest mountains including the himalayas and the pamir the large east west mountain ranges through the middle of tp divide the plateau into two different climate regions cold and dry climate in the north of 32 n and temperate and subtropical monsoon climate in the south cold and dry climate in the north attributes its presence to the mountain ranges that block the northward transport of both moisture and heat mean annual temperature varies from 7 57 to 0 09 in north tp and from 2 11 to 8 09 in south tp mean annual precipitation ranges from 229 to 594 mm in the north and 287 1346 mm in the south table 1 snow cover is perennial in high elevations of the south and west tp pu et al 2007 high elevation areas of the south and north tp are featured with continuous permafrost mosaic distribution of permafrost patches of permafrost and seasonal frozen soils cheng and jin 2013 the cold interior tp from south of the kunlun mountains north of the tanggula mountains and west of the 94 e longitude fig 1 has about 75 of its area in perennial permafrost because of the complex orography and climate we divide tp into seventeen sub regions in this study according to tributaries of major rivers and lakes these sub regions are shown in fig 1 and listed in table 1 sub regions with large rivers are in the south and east tp including the indus river sub region 9 the upper brahmaputra river 1 the upper tarim river 10 the che erchen river 10 yangtze river 4a and 4b yellow river 5a and 5b salween river 2 and mekong river 3 these rivers originate at high altitudes and are fed primarily by snowmelt zhang et al 2013b there are more than 1500 lakes in tp with size ranging from 10 to 1000 km2 song et al 2014 large lakes are found in the qiantang plateau sub regions 8a 8b and 8c and qaidam basin sub region 7 most rivers in those four sub regions are ephemeral and about 90 of annual total discharge occurs in june september chen and guan 1989 3 data and methodologies 3 1 data 3 1 1 grace gravimetric terrestrial water storage tws data grace provides monthly data

2009 because only this one report is available the rate of change of pm is assumed to be unchanged in the study period 3 2 methodologies 3 2 1 estimation of changes of tws and its components tws change is determined from the budget equation 1 tws i c e p m s w e s m r s w s g w s because tws estimated from the grace data is anomalies of the terrestrial water storage from its mean base value of january 2004 december 2009 we derive the anomalies of each component on the right side of eq 1 from subtracting its mean value over that same period for the period before 2002 when grace data were unavailable we estimate tws from eq 1 using data reported in literature and published records and denote it by twsc for distinction examples of these estimates are shown in table 3 after 2002 tws is estimated using the grace data because different data sources are used to estimate twsc its estimated values from eq 1 could be different from tws using grace data shall they be available before 2002 to reduce this inconsistency we developed a regression relationship between twsc and tws derived from grace data from 2003 to 2015 because the grace data are available after april 2002 tws a twsc b where a and b are regression coefficients this regression is used to re calculate tws from twsc for the period of 1992 2003 to make a consistent time series of tws from 1992 to 2015 3 2 2 methods used to test trend and change point temporal trend of tws its components and climate conditions precipitation and temperature are tested using mann kendall mk method mann 1945 kendall 1975 along with trend

annual precipitation p and annual net water gain pe p et in the period of 1992 2015 in the south and north regions of and the entire tp are shown by the lines on the right side of fig 2 over this period t rose at the rate of 0 039 a and p and pe increased at the rate of 5 66 and 5 12 mm a respectively in the entire tp the increases are significant at the level of p 0 05 because a change of the trend of the hydrological variables is detected in 2004 see sections 4 2 and 4 3 we divide the entire study period into two sub periods at 2004 each of them has the length of 12 years creating these sub periods is for the purpose of comparisons and contrasts of similarity and difference of tws between the two periods of 1992 2003 and 2004 2015 the trends of the variables constituting tws averaged in the north south and entire tp are shown by the fitted lines on the right side of fig 2 these results show that the increase of t was intense before 2004 and has lessened and even reversed after 2004 this change is clearly shown by the different trend of t going from 0 049 a before 2004 to 0 024 a after 2004 the decrease trend of t becomes steeper after 2006 0 067 a the change of t is accompanied with a weakening trend of precipitation the rate of p decreased from 12 60 to 3 82 mm a meanwhile pe trend changed from 11 64 to 3 45 mm a before and after 2004 although the trends of t and p flattened or reversed after 2004 the actual value of mean annual temperature in 2004 2015 1 43 is still higher than the mean of the earlier period of 1992 2003 1 96 the average annual precipitation in 2004 2015 458 4 mm is also greater than the average of 1992 2003 400 7 mm the recent changes after 2004 suggest a relaxation of the warming process in tp before 2004 the rates of change of t p and pe before and after 2004 1992 2003 vs 2004 2015 in each of the sub regions in tp are shown by the columns on the left side panels of fig 2 before 2004 red bars annual t rose in all sub regions except for sub region 8b the rising trends are tested to be significant at the 5 confidence level for sub regions 4a 7 and 11 13 after 2004 green bars the annual t decreased in most sub regions in south tp significant in sub regions 1 and 11 13 in north tp the annual t continued to rise in most sub regions the rate of increase lessened however the rate in south tp 0 07 a is greater than that in north tp 0 032 a fig 2b and c shows the rates of change of p and pe in each of the sub regions and the trends of p and pe averaged in north south and the entire tp for the two periods before and after 2004 in 1992 2003 annual p and pe increased in most sub regions of tp except for some insignificant decease of p in sub region 5b and pe in sub regions 4b and 5b comparatively the increase of p and pe before 2004 is greater in north tp significant in sub regions 4a 6 7 8a 8c 9 and 10 the fitted lines in fig 2b and c show that the increase of p before 2004 is significant at the 5 confidence level in both south and north tp albeit the increase rate in south tp 4 99 mm a is smaller than that in north tp 6 08 mm a from 2004 to 2015 p and pe continued increasing but at a smaller rate fig 2b and c this is seen by flattened or even reversed rate of p and pe changes in most sub regions e g 4a 5b 6 7 8a and 13 similar changes are also evident for p and pe trend averaged in south and north tp these results indicate that tp experienced significant warming with more precipitation in 1992 2003 after 2004 that trend weakened and even reversed in some areas of tp the temperature change is stronger in south tp than in north tp fig 2a whereas the precipitation change is milder in south tp than in north tp a result in agreement with some previous studies e g yang et al 2014 4 2 changes of tws budget these changes in climate have led to overall decreases of glacier ice mass ice melt water from permafrost pm table 3 and snow water equivalent swe fig 3 a in most of sub regions in tp in recent three decades large loss of ice and swe is found in south tp and is caused by more precipitation falling as rain during summer months and by enhanced ice and snow melt from glaciers in lower elevations as also suggested in neckel et al 2017 also contributing to the loss of ice and swe is the reduction of surface albedo owing to increase in black carbon bc and dust deposition yasunari et al 2013 qu et al 2014 gertler et al 2016 li et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 our analysis shows that this process of losing ice and swe has become milder after 2004 when the warming trend lessened as shown in table 3 the annual rate of loss of ice in tp in 2004 2015 is much lower than that in 1992 2003 furthermore swe annual cumulative value changed from a little decrease before 2003 to increase after 2003 in north tp primarily caused by increase of swe in northeast sub regions 5b 6 and 7 decrease of swe in south tp has accelerated after 2004 because of significant decrease of swe in the warmest sub regions 1 3 and 11 13 fig 3 the changes of sm gws and r are different between the two periods as shown by the results in the panels on the right side of fig 3 detected by the moving t test significant changes occurred in 2004 for r sm and gws in south tp they were increasing at a greater rate before 2004 after 2004 they all reversed that trend it is a different story in north tp where r sm and gws all increased at a small rate over the entire study period except for a slight decrease in gws after 2004 annual lake storage sws in fig 3 shows significant increase after 2004 in most of the sub regions when averaged in north and south tp sws increased at a greater rate in north tp than in south tp contributing to an overall increase in tp after 2004 these regional trends of sws are confirming some results reported in previous studies e g lei et al 2014 yang et al 2014 since the mid 1990s major lakes in interior tp have expanded considerably both in surface area and depth due to enhanced meltwater from cryosphere when many lakes along the south and east flank of tp have been shrinking largely because of reduced precipitation fig 3c also see lei et al 2014 yang et al 2014 li et al 2011 4 3 estimated annual tws and its change before and after 2004 before examining the variations of tws in tp we validated the method discussed in section 3 2 1 for computing tws from 1992 to 2015 because of the band limited nature of grace tws from grace is suggested to be used for analysis in larger areas 200 000 km2 save et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 thus we compared annual series of tws observed from grace data and twsc computed from eq 2 using data from literature and published records in north south and the entire tp from 2003 to 2015 the results are shown in fig 4 a c fig 4d shows clearly a very high correlation of the two the regression formula derived from these analyses is tws 1 009 twsc 0 899 the r2 of twsc and tws is 0 951 in south tp 0 777 in north tp and 0 933 in the entire tp the mean absolute error mae of twsc and tws is 4 96 mm in north tp and 4 76 mm in south tp which are about 40 6 and 14 8 of their mean absolute value of tws respectively the error of annual twsc in north tp arises from the marked underestimation of twsc in the recent three years of 2011 2013 nonetheless the results in fig 4 assure that this underestimation does not alter the fact that significantly large trend of tws represents the direction of the change of tws in 2004 we thus use the regression formula to estimate the variations of annual tws from 1992 to 2003 variations of annual tws during 1992 2015 are shown in fig 5 tws in north tp increased in the entire period the increase is statistically insignificant in 1992 2003 but significant in 2004 2015 in south tp tws changed from significant increase in 1992 2003 to significant decrease in 2004 2015 the decrease rate is 8 65 mm a equivalent to a loss of 106 17 mm depth of water in the 12 years from 2004 to 2015 the variation of average tws anomaly of the entire tp follows primarily the change of tws in south tp where wet and warm climate puts large weights of tws of tp tws anomaly changed from increase at a rate of 4 25 mm a in 1992 2003 to decrease at a rate of 2 76 mm a in 2004 2015 these changes reflect a gain of 30 81 mm depth of water in the 12 years from 1993 to 2003 and a loss of 32 13 mm depth of water during 2004 2015 in tp 4 4 causes of different changes of tws the response of annual tws to variations of the climate p and t is examined using correlation analysis and its results are summarized in table 4 in south tp the variations of tws anomaly and its components of sm and r are highly correlated with p in 1992 2003 this relationship reflects a direct effect of the wet trends of the climate on soil moisture and runoff and subsequently on tws after 2004 and from 2004 to 2015 when warming and moistening trends flattened decreasing sm gws and r contributed to the decrease of tws even though the correlations of these variables with climate variables weakened this weakened correlation could be a consequence of weakened dependence of the water charged system to the climate especially when the climate is relaxing from a wet period this notion is supported by system consumption depletion of sm and gws as well as the contraction of glacial mass in 2004 2015 in north tp although p and pe increased significantly from 1992 to 2003 fig 2b and c their multi year mean annual values remained low those low values kept a low rate of increase for the terms on the right side of eq 1 and hence tws fig 5 in 2004 2015 those terms also were weakly correlated with p and t in north tp as shown in table 4 the tws increased in north tp and the increase is highly related to the accelerated increase of sm r and sws see table 4 for high correlations of sm r and sws with tws in north tp changes of annual tws can be understood in land surface water balance which can be described by Œ¥tws p et r or Œ¥tws pe r tws increases Œ¥tws 0 if there is net annual input pe r 0 it recharges tws if pe r 0 Œ¥tws 0 in the warm south tp large increase of tws resulted from the increase of pe and r in 1992 2003 e g the rate of increase of pe was 8 78 mm a and was much greater than 3 87 mm a for r in 2004 2015 tws decreased substantially because of larger decrease of r than increase of pe this budget result suggests that increasing pe but decreasing melt water from glacier table 3 and snow water equivalent fig 3a cannot sustain large drainages r in the recent climate in north tp which is colder and drier than south tp tws increased in correspondence to increase of r in 2004 2015 even though pe was decreasing this relationship indicates that pe r 0 e g mean p in 2004 2015 is 66 73 mm more than that in 1992 2003 table 5 so Œ¥tws 0 the multi year mean of the anomaly of the components of tws i c e s w e etc and their sum twsc in each of the two periods 1992 2003 and 2004 2015 is calculated to illustrate the difference of tws between the two periods Œ¥ twsc and the relative contributions of changes in the hydrological components to Œ¥ twsc the results show the effects of weakened warming from 2004 to 2015 on tws in tp and are summarized in table 5 table 5 shows that Œ¥ twsc is different in north and south tp in south tp Œ¥ twsc is negative indicating that the decade mean tws in 2004 2015 decreased from that in 1992 2003 examining the changes of individual terms in eq 1 also given in table 5 we find that the decreasing decade mean tws in south tp is primarily caused by the decrease of gws 40 and r 43 in 2004 2015 in north tp twsc in 2004 2015 is higher than that in 1992 2003 the increase of t w s in 2004 2015 is related to the increases of sm gws and r which account for 23 29 and 47 of the gain of twsc respectively interestingly when summarizing changes of the tws in north and south tp we arrive that twsc in entire tp only decreased by 8 9 mm from 1992 to 2003 to 2004 2015 the net decrease of twsc over tp is attributed to greater decrease of tws in south tp where gws r ice and swe all decreased the greater increase of sm and sws in north tp partially offsets the decrease of tws over the entire tp 5 discussions and conclusions observations have revealed a reduced rate of the warming trend of the climate after 2004 roemmich et al 2009 fyfe et al 2016 the reduced rate of warming is concurring with the weakening of a wet trend in earlier decades in tp these changes are particularly significant in south tp between 1992 and 2003 and 2004 2015 it is important to note that while the reduced rates of the warming and moistening occurred after 2004 the temperature and precipitation remain on a course of warmer and wetter only at milder rates overall the warming is stronger in south than in north tp whereas the north tp is becoming wetter faster than south tp these differences in the rate of change of warming and moistening across tp have different impacts on hydrological components and their outcome on the terrestrial water storage tws in tp to quantify tws changes in response to changes of the climate before and after 2004 we developed an empirical formula which uses multiple data sources and estimates tws anomalies in tp from 1992 to 2015 the utility of the formula is supported by significant 95 confidence correlations of its computed tws anomalies in tp with tws anomalies derived from grace data however this formula underestimates annual tws anomaly in north tp a possible source for this bias could be sparse observations in north tp e g yang et al 2014 although the absolute value of the estimated annual tws could deviate from that derived from grace the estimated variations of tws by this formula can capture that derived from grace in north south and the entire tp using this formula we computed tws over tp from 1992 to 2015 and examined the water budget and tws variations major results show that annual tws changed from strong increase in 1992 2003 to decrease in 2004 2015 in south tp in contrast tws changed from weak increase to strong increase in north tp these differences of tws changes between north and south tp indicate different responses of hydrological cycle to the weakening of the warming trend in different altitude land cover condition and orography the south tp has well interconnected flow networks through islands of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground water cycle is fast and the response time of hydrological processes to climate variation and temperature change is short according to the tritium tracer analysis wang 1990 groundwater cycle in south tp takes 1 4 years at this fast cycling rate in south tp changes of tws and its components fast respond to the weakening of climate warming and wetting the warming and moistening of 1992 2003 significantly accelerated the melt of ice and snow because regional recharges from the increased meltwater and precipitation moistening are greater than discharges of surface and subsurface storages leaving the region in streamflow tws increases when the warming slows down in 2004 2015 the recharge decreased and became smaller than the discharge significant decreases in meltwater from ice and snow surface water and subsurface storage cause the decrease of tws in the cold and dry regions of north tp perennial frozen zones prevent penetration of melt water and rainfall into deep aquifers and drainage from open taliks underneath the lakes the inflow outflow cycle is very slow as indicated by wang 1990 the cycling time of the inflow outflow in sub permafrost areas could be over 30 years in such slow water cycle regions even though the average annual values of components in the hydrological cycle are small the terrestrial storage takes a long term accumulation effect on net input continuing warming and moistening of the climate in those areas even with a slowdown of the process after 2004 could considerably increase the values of those components and cause the increase of tws e g by accumulation of water storages in soils rivers and lakes the depletion of tws in south tp could threaten the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources for the critical source regions of the asia s big rivers the consecutive accumulation of tws following the rise of surface water in north tp could increase spilling of lakes and thus risks of floods and debris flows credit authorship contribution statement jiarong wang investigation methodology software data curation writing

5608,water storage in the tibetan plateau tp is extremely sensitive to climate change observations in tp have revealed warming and moistening trends before 2004 and weakening of those trends after 2004 these changes in the course of climate warming altered hydrological components in tp from the early years of 1992 2003 to the recent decade of 2004 2015 resulting in strong changes of the terrestrial water storage tws in tp in this study hydrological and climatic data that determine the budget of tws in tp were compiled from multiple data sources for 1992 2015 an empirical formula was developed by correlation analysis of tws from these data with tws derived from grace data for 2003 2015 in tp the estimated tws by the formula highly agrees with grace data in describing tws variations across tp even though it underestimates the absolute value of annual tws in north tp the formula was used to estimate tws variations in 1992 2003 which were compared to those in 2004 2015 major results show that 1 in the warm and wet region of south tp the recently reduced rate of climate warming and moistening reversed the trend of annual tws from increase in 1992 2003 to significant decrease in 2004 2015 this change is largely caused by decreases of soil water and groundwater storage and increased runoff 2 in the cold and dry region of north tp the increase of tws in 1992 2003 accelerated in 2004 2015 because of increases of soil moisture and lake storage 3 the difference of tws change in the north and south tp altered the multi year balance of water storage over the entire tp decreasing tws from 2004 to 2015 lowered multi year mean tws in south tp while increasing tws in north tp raised its multi year mean tws the reduction of tws in south tp with decrease of streamflow and groundwater storage could threaten the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources for this critical source region of asia s large rivers the accumulation of tws following the rise of surface water in north tp could increase spilling of lakes and thus risks of floods and debris flows keywords weakening of climate warming terrestrial water storage grace tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has experienced substantial climate warming in recent decades from 1984 to 2009 observational records show tp surface temperature rising at 0 46 decade 1 nearly 1 5 times of the average rate of global temperature 0 32 decade 1 zhang et al 2013a the warming was particularly strong in the 1990s largely because of fast rising temperatures in the winter season liu et al 2009 spatially the rate of warming is larger in the north than in the south tp e g yang et al 2011 you et al 2016 in the vertical direction there has been growing evidence that the warming rate increases with elevation in and around tp li et al 2017a gao et al 2019 this amplifying warming with elevation has profound impacts on snow glaciers and permafrost which constitute the majority of terrestrial water storage tws of tp and threatens the sustainability of the water tower of asia s big rivers fig 1 the tws of tp is the sum of glacial ice ice snow water equivalent swe permafrost pm soil moisture sm surface water in rivers r and lakes sws and groundwater gws understanding spatial and temporal changes of tws and responses of its components to climate warming is challenging because of the extreme terrains and associated complexity of climate in tp in south tp which has warm and wet climate water cycle is fast the melt of glaciers snow and permafrost feeds to big rivers such as the indus brahmaputra ganges yangtze and yellow rivers fig 1 meanwhile the disappearance of portions of permafrost zone cheng and jin 2013 allows considerable flow to penetrate into groundwater at a faster time scale walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in contrast in north tp which has dry and cold climate water cycle is relatively slow the area has a larger percentage of continuous permafrost zone plenty of lakes but sparse river networks the continuous permafrost zone slows groundwater dynamics characterized by long flow paths through fault fracture zones and small recharge and discharge because of limited talik areas cheng and jin 2013 meltwater of snow and ice mass and precipitation in higher elevations accumulate in lakes through sparse river networks these differences have resulted in different responses of tws to climate change in tp it is found from the data of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace that annual tws during 2003 2014 decreased at 30 55 mm a 1 in south tp but increased at 10 35 mm a 1 in interior tp areas marked by 8a b and c in fig 1 gardner et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 meng et al 2019 the increase of tws in interior tp is suggested to be caused by increase in precipitation and expansion of lake areas on the other hand the decrease of tws in south tp is attributed to glacial melting following the rise of temperatures deng et al 2017 in a recent study by meng et al 2019 tws changes in the entire tp from 2003 to 2014 are attributed largely to variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration et tws increase in the upstream of the yangtze and yellow rivers areas marked by 4a b and 5a b in fig 1 is largely caused by increase of annual precipitation tws depletion in brahmaputra area 1 in fig 1 results from the increase of et although changes of tws can be estimated by summing the changes of its components the procedure is complicated because of water transfer among the tws pools in tp glacier retreat has been considered a primary cause of tws depletion in high elevation areas jacob et al 2012 matsuo and heki 2010 the melting water of glacier can lead to lake expansion and increase of surface water storage sws such as in the interior tp during 2003 2009 zhang et al 2016 yao et al 2013 wang et al 2016 degradation of permafrost zone can cause the increase of groundwater gws as observed in the qaidam basin area 7 in fig 1 during 2003 2012 jiao et al 2015 water exchanges among the pools components of tws in tp would be enhanced when the climate warms and more water takes liquid form when the duration of frozen soils was shortened by 16 8 day decade 1 from 1988 to 2007 in tp increasing exchange between groundwater and surface water resulted in rising baseflow of major rivers ge et al 2011 bense et al 2012 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 zhang et al 2018 these changes of hydrological components are mostly for the period before the early 2000s and changes of the tws pools in tp are for the period after 2002 when grace data became available since early 2000s a transition in climate has taken place and shown by the reduced slope rate of the warming trend in tp fyfe et al 2016 this change in climate makes it difficult to comprehend the results of the previous studies that looked at tws changes in tp at different time periods and different phases of the climate variation in the past decades it is beneficial to reevaluate tws variations in a continuous time frame and a consistent context in such a context we can not only examine variations of hydrological cycle with changing climate but also understand how tws in tp has responded to the recent change of the warming trend since 2002 the significance of this understanding is that changes in the warming rate would likely to repeat in the 21st century and beyond easterling and wehner 2009 and knowing tws responses to such variations of the temperature will equip managements in tp and large river basins across east asia to make and adjust proactive decisions the objective of this study is to quantify spatial and temporal changes of tws in tp in response to temperature change particularly before and after early 2000s our study period is from 1992 to 2015 tws and its budget for the period of 1992 2003 are compared and contrasted to those from 2004 to 2015 changes of tws and its components between the two periods reveal the differences of the tws responses to variations in the intensity of the warming 2 study area the study area is the tibetan plateau tp and shown in fig 1 tp covers about 3 01 million square kilometers it is regarded as the roof of the world with an average elevation over 4000 m fan et al 2010 decorated by the earth s highest mountains including the himalayas and the pamir the large east west mountain ranges through the middle of tp divide the plateau into two different climate regions cold and dry climate in the north of 32 n and temperate and subtropical monsoon climate in the south cold and dry climate in the north attributes its presence to the mountain ranges that block the northward transport of both moisture and heat mean annual temperature varies from 7 57 to 0 09 in north tp and from 2 11 to 8 09 in south tp mean annual precipitation ranges from 229 to 594 mm in the north and 287 1346 mm in the south table 1 snow cover is perennial in high elevations of the south and west tp pu et al 2007 high elevation areas of the south and north tp are featured with continuous permafrost mosaic distribution of permafrost patches of permafrost and seasonal frozen soils cheng and jin 2013 the cold interior tp from south of the kunlun mountains north of the tanggula mountains and west of the 94 e longitude fig 1 has about 75 of its area in perennial permafrost because of the complex orography and climate we divide tp into seventeen sub regions in this study according to tributaries of major rivers and lakes these sub regions are shown in fig 1 and listed in table 1 sub regions with large rivers are in the south and east tp including the indus river sub region 9 the upper brahmaputra river 1 the upper tarim river 10 the che erchen river 10 yangtze river 4a and 4b yellow river 5a and 5b salween river 2 and mekong river 3 these rivers originate at high altitudes and are fed primarily by snowmelt zhang et al 2013b there are more than 1500 lakes in tp with size ranging from 10 to 1000 km2 song et al 2014 large lakes are found in the qiantang plateau sub regions 8a 8b and 8c and qaidam basin sub region 7 most rivers in those four sub regions are ephemeral and about 90 of annual total discharge occurs in june september chen and guan 1989 3 data and methodologies 3 1 data 3 1 1 grace gravimetric terrestrial water storage tws data grace provides monthly data

2009 because only this one report is available the rate of change of pm is assumed to be unchanged in the study period 3 2 methodologies 3 2 1 estimation of changes of tws and its components tws change is determined from the budget equation 1 tws i c e p m s w e s m r s w s g w s because tws estimated from the grace data is anomalies of the terrestrial water storage from its mean base value of january 2004 december 2009 we derive the anomalies of each component on the right side of eq 1 from subtracting its mean value over that same period for the period before 2002 when grace data were unavailable we estimate tws from eq 1 using data reported in literature and published records and denote it by twsc for distinction examples of these estimates are shown in table 3 after 2002 tws is estimated using the grace data because different data sources are used to estimate twsc its estimated values from eq 1 could be different from tws using grace data shall they be available before 2002 to reduce this inconsistency we developed a regression relationship between twsc and tws derived from grace data from 2003 to 2015 because the grace data are available after april 2002 tws a twsc b where a and b are regression coefficients this regression is used to re calculate tws from twsc for the period of 1992 2003 to make a consistent time series of tws from 1992 to 2015 3 2 2 methods used to test trend and change point temporal trend of tws its components and climate conditions precipitation and temperature are tested using mann kendall mk method mann 1945 kendall 1975 along with trend

annual precipitation p and annual net water gain pe p et in the period of 1992 2015 in the south and north regions of and the entire tp are shown by the lines on the right side of fig 2 over this period t rose at the rate of 0 039 a and p and pe increased at the rate of 5 66 and 5 12 mm a respectively in the entire tp the increases are significant at the level of p 0 05 because a change of the trend of the hydrological variables is detected in 2004 see sections 4 2 and 4 3 we divide the entire study period into two sub periods at 2004 each of them has the length of 12 years creating these sub periods is for the purpose of comparisons and contrasts of similarity and difference of tws between the two periods of 1992 2003 and 2004 2015 the trends of the variables constituting tws averaged in the north south and entire tp are shown by the fitted lines on the right side of fig 2 these results show that the increase of t was intense before 2004 and has lessened and even reversed after 2004 this change is clearly shown by the different trend of t going from 0 049 a before 2004 to 0 024 a after 2004 the decrease trend of t becomes steeper after 2006 0 067 a the change of t is accompanied with a weakening trend of precipitation the rate of p decreased from 12 60 to 3 82 mm a meanwhile pe trend changed from 11 64 to 3 45 mm a before and after 2004 although the trends of t and p flattened or reversed after 2004 the actual value of mean annual temperature in 2004 2015 1 43 is still higher than the mean of the earlier period of 1992 2003 1 96 the average annual precipitation in 2004 2015 458 4 mm is also greater than the average of 1992 2003 400 7 mm the recent changes after 2004 suggest a relaxation of the warming process in tp before 2004 the rates of change of t p and pe before and after 2004 1992 2003 vs 2004 2015 in each of the sub regions in tp are shown by the columns on the left side panels of fig 2 before 2004 red bars annual t rose in all sub regions except for sub region 8b the rising trends are tested to be significant at the 5 confidence level for sub regions 4a 7 and 11 13 after 2004 green bars the annual t decreased in most sub regions in south tp significant in sub regions 1 and 11 13 in north tp the annual t continued to rise in most sub regions the rate of increase lessened however the rate in south tp 0 07 a is greater than that in north tp 0 032 a fig 2b and c shows the rates of change of p and pe in each of the sub regions and the trends of p and pe averaged in north south and the entire tp for the two periods before and after 2004 in 1992 2003 annual p and pe increased in most sub regions of tp except for some insignificant decease of p in sub region 5b and pe in sub regions 4b and 5b comparatively the increase of p and pe before 2004 is greater in north tp significant in sub regions 4a 6 7 8a 8c 9 and 10 the fitted lines in fig 2b and c show that the increase of p before 2004 is significant at the 5 confidence level in both south and north tp albeit the increase rate in south tp 4 99 mm a is smaller than that in north tp 6 08 mm a from 2004 to 2015 p and pe continued increasing but at a smaller rate fig 2b and c this is seen by flattened or even reversed rate of p and pe changes in most sub regions e g 4a 5b 6 7 8a and 13 similar changes are also evident for p and pe trend averaged in south and north tp these results indicate that tp experienced significant warming with more precipitation in 1992 2003 after 2004 that trend weakened and even reversed in some areas of tp the temperature change is stronger in south tp than in north tp fig 2a whereas the precipitation change is milder in south tp than in north tp a result in agreement with some previous studies e g yang et al 2014 4 2 changes of tws budget these changes in climate have led to overall decreases of glacier ice mass ice melt water from permafrost pm table 3 and snow water equivalent swe fig 3 a in most of sub regions in tp in recent three decades large loss of ice and swe is found in south tp and is caused by more precipitation falling as rain during summer months and by enhanced ice and snow melt from glaciers in lower elevations as also suggested in neckel et al 2017 also contributing to the loss of ice and swe is the reduction of surface albedo owing to increase in black carbon bc and dust deposition yasunari et al 2013 qu et al 2014 gertler et al 2016 li et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 our analysis shows that this process of losing ice and swe has become milder after 2004 when the warming trend lessened as shown in table 3 the annual rate of loss of ice in tp in 2004 2015 is much lower than that in 1992 2003 furthermore swe annual cumulative value changed from a little decrease before 2003 to increase after 2003 in north tp primarily caused by increase of swe in northeast sub regions 5b 6 and 7 decrease of swe in south tp has accelerated after 2004 because of significant decrease of swe in the warmest sub regions 1 3 and 11 13 fig 3 the changes of sm gws and r are different between the two periods as shown by the results in the panels on the right side of fig 3 detected by the moving t test significant changes occurred in 2004 for r sm and gws in south tp they were increasing at a greater rate before 2004 after 2004 they all reversed that trend it is a different story in north tp where r sm and gws all increased at a small rate over the entire study period except for a slight decrease in gws after 2004 annual lake storage sws in fig 3 shows significant increase after 2004 in most of the sub regions when averaged in north and south tp sws increased at a greater rate in north tp than in south tp contributing to an overall increase in tp after 2004 these regional trends of sws are confirming some results reported in previous studies e g lei et al 2014 yang et al 2014 since the mid 1990s major lakes in interior tp have expanded considerably both in surface area and depth due to enhanced meltwater from cryosphere when many lakes along the south and east flank of tp have been shrinking largely because of reduced precipitation fig 3c also see lei et al 2014 yang et al 2014 li et al 2011 4 3 estimated annual tws and its change before and after 2004 before examining the variations of tws in tp we validated the method discussed in section 3 2 1 for computing tws from 1992 to 2015 because of the band limited nature of grace tws from grace is suggested to be used for analysis in larger areas 200 000 km2 save et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 thus we compared annual series of tws observed from grace data and twsc computed from eq 2 using data from literature and published records in north south and the entire tp from 2003 to 2015 the results are shown in fig 4 a c fig 4d shows clearly a very high correlation of the two the regression formula derived from these analyses is tws 1 009 twsc 0 899 the r2 of twsc and tws is 0 951 in south tp 0 777 in north tp and 0 933 in the entire tp the mean absolute error mae of twsc and tws is 4 96 mm in north tp and 4 76 mm in south tp which are about 40 6 and 14 8 of their mean absolute value of tws respectively the error of annual twsc in north tp arises from the marked underestimation of twsc in the recent three years of 2011 2013 nonetheless the results in fig 4 assure that this underestimation does not alter the fact that significantly large trend of tws represents the direction of the change of tws in 2004 we thus use the regression formula to estimate the variations of annual tws from 1992 to 2003 variations of annual tws during 1992 2015 are shown in fig 5 tws in north tp increased in the entire period the increase is statistically insignificant in 1992 2003 but significant in 2004 2015 in south tp tws changed from significant increase in 1992 2003 to significant decrease in 2004 2015 the decrease rate is 8 65 mm a equivalent to a loss of 106 17 mm depth of water in the 12 years from 2004 to 2015 the variation of average tws anomaly of the entire tp follows primarily the change of tws in south tp where wet and warm climate puts large weights of tws of tp tws anomaly changed from increase at a rate of 4 25 mm a in 1992 2003 to decrease at a rate of 2 76 mm a in 2004 2015 these changes reflect a gain of 30 81 mm depth of water in the 12 years from 1993 to 2003 and a loss of 32 13 mm depth of water during 2004 2015 in tp 4 4 causes of different changes of tws the response of annual tws to variations of the climate p and t is examined using correlation analysis and its results are summarized in table 4 in south tp the variations of tws anomaly and its components of sm and r are highly correlated with p in 1992 2003 this relationship reflects a direct effect of the wet trends of the climate on soil moisture and runoff and subsequently on tws after 2004 and from 2004 to 2015 when warming and moistening trends flattened decreasing sm gws and r contributed to the decrease of tws even though the correlations of these variables with climate variables weakened this weakened correlation could be a consequence of weakened dependence of the water charged system to the climate especially when the climate is relaxing from a wet period this notion is supported by system consumption depletion of sm and gws as well as the contraction of glacial mass in 2004 2015 in north tp although p and pe increased significantly from 1992 to 2003 fig 2b and c their multi year mean annual values remained low those low values kept a low rate of increase for the terms on the right side of eq 1 and hence tws fig 5 in 2004 2015 those terms also were weakly correlated with p and t in north tp as shown in table 4 the tws increased in north tp and the increase is highly related to the accelerated increase of sm r and sws see table 4 for high correlations of sm r and sws with tws in north tp changes of annual tws can be understood in land surface water balance which can be described by Œ¥tws p et r or Œ¥tws pe r tws increases Œ¥tws 0 if there is net annual input pe r 0 it recharges tws if pe r 0 Œ¥tws 0 in the warm south tp large increase of tws resulted from the increase of pe and r in 1992 2003 e g the rate of increase of pe was 8 78 mm a and was much greater than 3 87 mm a for r in 2004 2015 tws decreased substantially because of larger decrease of r than increase of pe this budget result suggests that increasing pe but decreasing melt water from glacier table 3 and snow water equivalent fig 3a cannot sustain large drainages r in the recent climate in north tp which is colder and drier than south tp tws increased in correspondence to increase of r in 2004 2015 even though pe was decreasing this relationship indicates that pe r 0 e g mean p in 2004 2015 is 66 73 mm more than that in 1992 2003 table 5 so Œ¥tws 0 the multi year mean of the anomaly of the components of tws i c e s w e etc and their sum twsc in each of the two periods 1992 2003 and 2004 2015 is calculated to illustrate the difference of tws between the two periods Œ¥ twsc and the relative contributions of changes in the hydrological components to Œ¥ twsc the results show the effects of weakened warming from 2004 to 2015 on tws in tp and are summarized in table 5 table 5 shows that Œ¥ twsc is different in north and south tp in south tp Œ¥ twsc is negative indicating that the decade mean tws in 2004 2015 decreased from that in 1992 2003 examining the changes of individual terms in eq 1 also given in table 5 we find that the decreasing decade mean tws in south tp is primarily caused by the decrease of gws 40 and r 43 in 2004 2015 in north tp twsc in 2004 2015 is higher than that in 1992 2003 the increase of t w s in 2004 2015 is related to the increases of sm gws and r which account for 23 29 and 47 of the gain of twsc respectively interestingly when summarizing changes of the tws in north and south tp we arrive that twsc in entire tp only decreased by 8 9 mm from 1992 to 2003 to 2004 2015 the net decrease of twsc over tp is attributed to greater decrease of tws in south tp where gws r ice and swe all decreased the greater increase of sm and sws in north tp partially offsets the decrease of tws over the entire tp 5 discussions and conclusions observations have revealed a reduced rate of the warming trend of the climate after 2004 roemmich et al 2009 fyfe et al 2016 the reduced rate of warming is concurring with the weakening of a wet trend in earlier decades in tp these changes are particularly significant in south tp between 1992 and 2003 and 2004 2015 it is important to note that while the reduced rates of the warming and moistening occurred after 2004 the temperature and precipitation remain on a course of warmer and wetter only at milder rates overall the warming is stronger in south than in north tp whereas the north tp is becoming wetter faster than south tp these differences in the rate of change of warming and moistening across tp have different impacts on hydrological components and their outcome on the terrestrial water storage tws in tp to quantify tws changes in response to changes of the climate before and after 2004 we developed an empirical formula which uses multiple data sources and estimates tws anomalies in tp from 1992 to 2015 the utility of the formula is supported by significant 95 confidence correlations of its computed tws anomalies in tp with tws anomalies derived from grace data however this formula underestimates annual tws anomaly in north tp a possible source for this bias could be sparse observations in north tp e g yang et al 2014 although the absolute value of the estimated annual tws could deviate from that derived from grace the estimated variations of tws by this formula can capture that derived from grace in north south and the entire tp using this formula we computed tws over tp from 1992 to 2015 and examined the water budget and tws variations major results show that annual tws changed from strong increase in 1992 2003 to decrease in 2004 2015 in south tp in contrast tws changed from weak increase to strong increase in north tp these differences of tws changes between north and south tp indicate different responses of hydrological cycle to the weakening of the warming trend in different altitude land cover condition and orography the south tp has well interconnected flow networks through islands of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground water cycle is fast and the response time of hydrological processes to climate variation and temperature change is short according to the tritium tracer analysis wang 1990 groundwater cycle in south tp takes 1 4 years at this fast cycling rate in south tp changes of tws and its components fast respond to the weakening of climate warming and wetting the warming and moistening of 1992 2003 significantly accelerated the melt of ice and snow because regional recharges from the increased meltwater and precipitation moistening are greater than discharges of surface and subsurface storages leaving the region in streamflow tws increases when the warming slows down in 2004 2015 the recharge decreased and became smaller than the discharge significant decreases in meltwater from ice and snow surface water and subsurface storage cause the decrease of tws in the cold and dry regions of north tp perennial frozen zones prevent penetration of melt water and rainfall into deep aquifers and drainage from open taliks underneath the lakes the inflow outflow cycle is very slow as indicated by wang 1990 the cycling time of the inflow outflow in sub permafrost areas could be over 30 years in such slow water cycle regions even though the average annual values of components in the hydrological cycle are small the terrestrial storage takes a long term accumulation effect on net input continuing warming and moistening of the climate in those areas even with a slowdown of the process after 2004 could considerably increase the values of those components and cause the increase of tws e g by accumulation of water storages in soils rivers and lakes the depletion of tws in south tp could threaten the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources for the critical source regions of the asia s big rivers the consecutive accumulation of tws following the rise of surface water in north tp could increase spilling of lakes and thus risks of floods and debris flows credit authorship contribution statement jiarong wang investigation methodology software data curation writing

5609,in many regions precipitation does not reliably meet crop water demands a situation that climate change will likely exacerbate supplemental irrigation can help enhance and stabilize crop yields but the need of water for irrigation has often led to groundwater over exploitation on farm ponds can provide a more sustainable water source their use has often been promoted by local authorities but by converting a portion of cultivated area to water storage and reducing water availability downstream on farm ponds also imply constraints and trade offs for an effective exploitation of their potential benefits they must be carefully designed and managed based on the local edaphic and climate conditions a non trivial task because of the cascading effects of rainfall unpredictability here we identify the most suitable on farm pond size according to two criteria maximization of average yield i e production maximization and achievement of a minimum acceptable yield i e risk minimization accounting for the farmer s risk aversion to this aim we develop a minimalist model requiring few physically based parameters coupling crop biomass soil moisture and water stored in the pond while general the model is here applied to a case study in the lower mississippi river basin usa simulations show that yield maximization and risk minimization are goals hard to reconcile regardless of climatic conditions soil type and irrigation strategy with smaller ponds allowing the maximum average yield at the cost of reducing its stability from year to year stress avoidance irrigation ensures higher yields than deficit irrigation even if it implies a faster use of the stored water future more extreme climates will result in lower maximum average yields and narrower ranges of pond sizes ensuring desirable minimum yields keywords on farm pond irrigation crop yield sustainability risk aversion lower mississippi river basin 1 introduction societies are faced with the challenge of reliably producing a sufficient amount of food in a sustainable way achieving this goal requires ensuring continuous and sufficient water availability for crops to thrive nevertheless in many regions rainfall does not reliably meet crop water demands due to insufficient or intermittent precipitation during the crop growing season this situation could worsen under future climates when it is expected that there will be an increase in frequency and duration of dry spells in many regions ipcc 2014 also warmer temperatures could enhance plant transpiration rate and consequent irrigation demands unless these changes are balanced out by faster plant development and hence shorter growing seasons supplemental irrigation can enhance and stabilize yields in many agricultural systems troy et al 2015 fox and rockstr√∂m 2003 kumar et al 2016 yet irrigation applications require access to reliable water resources groundwater has often been used for this purpose siebert et al 2010 but the implementation of irrigation has led to an unsustainable exploitation of aquifers with pumping often exceeding recharge and leading to plummeting water table levels scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 el naqa et al 2007 water harvesting techniques such as on farm ponds can provide an alternative more sustainable solution mitigating dry spells while avoiding the over exploitation of increasingly scarce groundwater resources indeed on farm ponds can store water when it is abundant e g during the off season when losses via evapotranspiration are low for use in dry spells as supplemental irrigation ponds are also of interest in locations where precipitation intensity often exceeds the soil infiltration capacity or in seasonally dry climates when the crop growing season does not coincide with the wet season their use can lead to an increase in crop production wisser et al 2010 and groundwater levels thanks to the reduction in water abstractions sikka et al 2017 moreover on farm ponds can provide a variety of ecosystem services moore and hunt 2012 bouldin et al 2004 such as enhanced biodiversity cereghino et al 2014 winter habitat for migratory waterfowl reinecke et al 1989 improved water quality omer and baker 2019 and suspended solids and nutrient recycling omer et al 2017 energy use for irrigation can also be reduced bouldin et al 2004 not surprisingly this simple yet effective tool is quite widespread and actively encouraged by local and national authorities national rainfed area authority 2012 rao et al 2017 acheampong et al 2018 nrcs 2014 palanisami et al 2010 bouldin et al 2004 in spite of their construction and maintenance costs pond prevalence is increasing rapidly also in locations where they have not been used historically for the usa see omer and baker 2019 omer et al 2019 nevertheless on farm ponds also imply constraints and trade offs regionally they can reduce the water availability downstream krol et al 2011 liebe et al 2005 locally ponds can diminish the cultivated area by occupying arable land hence ponds must be sized so that the amount of water they store is sufficient to meet the farm water requirements under most years thus ensuring high and stable yields at the same time their size should be the minimum possible to reduce the impacts on the regional water balance but also allowing larger cultivated areas in the absence of topographic relief pond depth is generally not a decision variable but rather a building constraint hence a trade off emerges between ensuring that the pond is of adequate size to meet water demands and minimizing its negative effects pond size needed depends on the implemented irrigation strategy e g whether irrigation is used to completely avoid water stress stress avoidance irrigation or if a certain level of water stress is considered acceptable deficit irrigation english and raja 1996 fereres and soriano 2007 stress avoidance irrigation might not always be the most productive approach since it implies a faster use of the stored water and consequently a higher risk of running out of water before the end of the growing season conversely deficit irrigation can limit this risk and maximize on farm water productivity geerts and raes 2009 but it can reduce the final yield because of the negative effects of water stress on crop growth hsiao 1973 each of these trade offs may limit the adoption of on farm ponds for supplemental irrigation kumar et al 2016 for a wider use of on farm ponds it is thus necessary to develop approaches for the most suitable sizing and management taking into account local edaphic and climate conditions currently most ponds are sized based on empirical approaches often recommended by local and national agencies for the usa see usda agricultural handbook 1982 while of simple applicability these rules may not be robust to changes in the climatic conditions or crop choice and do not allow the exploration of radically different management strategies models are a useful tool in support of the sizing and management of on farm ponds ouyang et al 2016 as they allow testing different climatic and management scenarios several models based on different principles have been proposed to size on farm ponds arnold and stockle 1991 suresh and mujumdar 2004 ouyang et al 2016 ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2017 georgiou and papamichail 2008 kumar et al 2006 roy et al 2009 nevertheless due to their complexity and large number of parameters these models can be difficult to apply in practice an alternative approach is represented by minimalist models requiring fewer physically meaningful parameters for easier application to different crops and sites albeit less detailed they can simulate the key mechanisms driving the crop soil water dynamics corroborating existing empirical approaches and allowing the exploration of additional climatic and management scenarios moreover minimalist models by allowing a large number of simulations easily provide quantitative information on the likelihood of specific outcomes allowing the integrations of aspects of decision making under uncertainty including risk attitude here we develop a minimalist model coupling soil water dynamics crop development and pond water availability the model permits the explicit consideration of precipitation patterns and the farmer s risk attitude an aspect seldom considered when designing management strategies for an example see pande and savenije 2016 we use the model to identify the most suitable pond size with reference to two contrasting criteria farm production maximization and low yield risk minimization specifically we aim at answering the following questions i what is the pond size that ensures the highest farm productivity or the most stable yields ii are these criteria in conflict iii how should the pond size change to meet these goals under future more extreme climates while general and easily transferable the model is applied to the case of on farm ponds in the lower mississippi river basin in the southeastern usa groundwater from the shallow mississippi river basin alluvial aquifer has long been the primary source for irrigation in the region supplying more water for irrigation than any other aquifer in the usa except the high plains aquifer system maupin et al 2014 reba et al 2017 shallow groundwater has historically been available uniformly across the landscape with on average one groundwater well serving approximately 40 hectares christy 2019 however declines in the water table across the region have resulted in critically low groundwater levels particularly in arkansas where supply from the alluvial aquifer is no longer dependable in large areas yaeger et al 2018 since in arkansas and mississippi water is not regulated until it reaches a surface water body or aquifer local authorities are promoting the use of small reservoirs as a source of supplemental irrigation this is possible because it is now common in the region for fields to have been precision graded to a slope of approximately 0 002 m m 1 and to be bordered by low levees with outlet pipes that convey runoff from the field to adjacent ditches which route runoff toward the reservoir currently the sizing of such reservoirs is based on empirical approaches usda agricultural handbook 1982 with a suggested cultivated area to pond ratios of 13 1 to 16 1 assuming the standard pond depth of 2 4 m ouyang et al 2016 yet these empirical approaches do not take into account the farmer s risk coping attitude and might no longer be suitable under future more extreme climates 2 methods 2 1 model structure the model represents arable land e g a farm of size a tot partially cultivated and partially occupied by a water reservoir during the growing season the crop grows on the cultivated fraction a c at a rate depending on soil water availability the soil water is provided by the unpredictable occurrence of precipitation and can be supplemented by irrigation when soil water is so low to cause crop water stress irrigation is assumed to be extracted solely from the on farm pond in turn the on farm pond captures and stores surface runoff throughout the year thanks to a system of levees and ditches the model describes the coupled dynamics of soil moisture crop biomass and the water stored in the on farm reservoir via a set of differential equations the main variables of the model are table 1 i soil moisture s 0 s 1 ii depth of the water stored in the pond h and iii total crop biomass in the farm b to facilitate the exploration of different climatic scenarios rainfall is represented as a stochastic process the evolution of the system is investigated over the period of duration t seas corresponding to the main growing season extending from soon after seedling emergence to when plant biomass growth tapers off 2 1 1 soil moisture dynamics the water available to the plants is determined based on the water balance averaged over the active root zone z r where most of the roots are located the state variable is the relative soil moisture or saturation level defined as the volume of water per pore volume i e s t Œ∏ n 1 where Œ∏ is the soil volumetric water content and n the soil porosity as such 0 s 1 with 0 corresponding to oven dry soil and 1 to saturation the soil moisture dynamics is driven by the balance between the inputs via precipitation and irrigation and the losses via evapotranspiration surface runoff and percolation below the rooting zone e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the water table is assumed to be well below the rooting zone and as such to not influence its water content as common in the study site in many locations including the lower mississippi river basin the surface runoff is collected and used to recharge the on farm ponds but no tail drainage system is in place so deep percolation is lost from the system it is thus necessary to separate losses via surface runoff from those via deep percolation to this aim we employ a minimalist model for the soil water budget to be interpreted at the subdaily scale and assuming instantaneous redistribution of moisture kim et al 1996 rigby and porporato 2006 the temporal evolution of soil moisture is the result of the concatenation of the soil moisture dynamics during i between storm periods dry downs where the only possible input is via irrigation assumed not to generate any runoff and ii in storm periods when runoff is possible under intense precipitation during the dry down there is no infiltration so that the soil moisture dynamics can be written as 1 nz r ds t dt i irr s h et s l s where n is the soil porosity z r is the depth of the active rooting zone the only input is the irrigation i irr s h and losses occur via evapotranspiration with rate et s and deep percolation below the rooting zone with rate l s irrigation is assumed to be demand based i e an irrigation is triggered by soil moisture reaching a pre set level s intervention level this approach corresponds to setting a management allowable depletion mad allen et al 1998 of nz r s fc s where s fc is the soil field capacity each irrigation provides a pre set water depth such that soil moisture is brought up to a target level s if there is enough residual water in the pond to perform the desired irrigation over the entire cultivated area for simplicity irrigation is idealized as an instantaneous application it follows that 2 i irr s h nz r s s s s and 1 a c a c h nz r s s 0 otherwise considering an idealized pond with a rectangular parallelepiped shape the term 1 a c a c 1 h is the volume of water per unit cultivated land that is still available in the pond when the water depth in the pond is h the two conditions imposed on the occurrence of an irrigation application mirror the demand based nature of the irrigation strategy s s and the fact that due to technological limitations shallower irrigation application than those for which the system is designed are difficult and costly to implement as such no irrigation application occurs if there is not sufficient water in the pond to irrigate the entire cultivated area restoring the soil moisture s the less than unitary irrigation efficiency e g vico and porporato 2011 and references therein is not explicitly included here because it is assumed that any water excess is recaptured by the surface runoff collection system and rerouted to the on farm pond as such i irr s h is to be interpreted as an effective irrigation and no surface runoff is included in eq 1 the evapotranspiration term et includes losses via soil water evaporation and plant transpiration a piecewise linear function of soil moisture is considered here e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 3 et s 0 s s w et max t s s w s s w s w s s et max t s s where et max t is the maximum evapotranspiration rate corresponding to well watered conditions s is the soil moisture at incipient stomatal closure and s w is the soil moisture at the plant wilting point below which the residual water in the soil is no longer available for uptake by the plants losses below the plant wilting point are neglected for easier parameterization et max t is to be interpreted here as the average daily value i e the above dynamics does not distinguish between day and night the maximum evapotranspiration rate depends on several environmental variables chiefly air temperature and humidity and solar radiation below et max is varied along with the other climatic parameters to explore different climate scenarios note that for a canopy well coupled to the atmosphere the evapotranspiration rate also depends on the crop leaf area and hence on the crop development stage however we assumed that vegetation affects the evapotranspiration partitioning wang et al 2014 but not the overall evapotranspiration rate as the higher transpiration for larger and closed canopies is balanced by the reduction in soil water evaporation anapalli et al 2019 vico and porporato 2013 we instead consider that et max t changes with air temperature and solar radiation see section 2 3 4 for details losses via deep percolation are described as power law dependence on soil moisture 4 l s k s s c 1 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and c 2 m 2 with m being the pore size distribution index e g campbell 1974 during the storm soil moisture in the rooting zone increases from the soil moisture at the end of the preceding dry down s 0 as the result of infiltration for simplicity it is assumed that the storm is of short duration with respect to the typical dry down so that losses via evapotranspiration during the storm can be neglected and that no irrigation becomes necessary during the storm despite the losses via deep percolation hence the rate of soil moisture increase is equal to the infiltration rate until saturation is reached minus losses via deep percolation i e 5 nz r ds t dt i infl p s 0 t l s s t 1 0 s t 1 where i infl p s 0 t is the time dependent infiltration rate under a precipitation of rate p starting when soil moisture is at the level s 0 and as above l is the deep percolation rate the infiltration rate i infl is determined employing approximate solutions to the richards equation kim et al 1996 and references therein briefly i infl is assumed to equal the precipitation rate until ponding occurs and to be the head controlled infiltration rate i infl h after ponding i e 6 i infl p s 0 t p 0 t t p

consistency assuming œà s in mpa and k s in m d 1 the equivalent and actual times to ponding are calculated exploiting the time compression approximation i e employing the cumulative infiltration as a

irrigation is assumed to be self sufficient i e only farm runoff is available for subsequent irrigation applications with no inputs from outside the area a tot during the dry down the temporal

where i irr is the irrigation eq 2 Œ∏ is the heaviside function and e is the evaporation rate from the pond surface the coefficient a c 1 a c 1 converts the volume of applied irrigation per unit cultivated area to depth of water in the pond losses due to infiltration and seepage are neglected here these losses appear highly variable according to some estimates they range between 0 4 and 1 5 mm d 1 pringle 1994 i e almost one order of magnitude smaller that evaporation rate other estimates suggest rates between 1 5 and 11 mm d 1 omer et al 2018 part of the uncertainty is due to the fact that seepage depends on the age of the pond and tends to diminish over time as sediments accumulate on the bottom shao et al 2013 during the storm h increases as the result of precipitation falling directly on the pond surface and recharge via runoff collected over the cultivated area during the precipitation events i e by the fraction of precipitation that does not infiltrate in the soil when the pond is filled to its capacity i e h h max any water reaching it is lost it follows that 11 dh t dt p a c 1 a c p i infl p s 0 t h t h max 0 h t h max where p is the precipitation rate and i infl is the infiltration rate eq 6 similar to the soil moisture dynamics the evaporation term is neglected during the precipitation event the inclusion of the runoff allows consideration of the within growing season pond recharge which exploits the capture and storage of water exceeding the soil water holding capacity in the cultivated area this also allows the recharge of the pond during the non growing season 2 1 3 crop development and yield the total crop biomass b over the cultivated area is assumed to grow exponentially as 12 db t dt g s b t where the relative growth rate g s depends on soil moisture in the active rooting zone and it is to be interpreted as the average daily value i e the above description does not distinguish between day and night even if the cultivated area is not explicit in the equation b t depends on it since the initial value b 0 is given by b 0 a c a tot where b 0 is the amount of initial crop per unit of ground area and a tot is the total arable land we describe the dependence of the relative crop growth rate on soil moisture s as a piecewise linear function similar to that of evapotranspiration 13 g s Œº s s w Œº g max Œº s s w s s w s w s s g max s

point and s is the soil moisture corresponding to the point of incipient stomatal closure below which co2 uptake rate is reduced see section 2 1 1 daly et al 2004 vico and porporato 2008 this description hinges on the close relation between plant transpiration and carbon fixation at the leaf level under water stress stomata are progressively closed and thus carbon fixation is reduced with negative effects on plant ability to produce biomass e g hsiao 1973 note that when no water is available for plant uptake i e s s w g becomes negative g s w Œº implying that the biomass decreases the biological interpretation is that some plants die after a long dry period b t can then near zero meaning that almost all the plants die the plant biomass at the end of the main growing season is related to the marketable yields in many grain crops hence knowledge of b t seas allows estimating the final yield exploiting the concept of harvest index i e y hi b t seas evans and fischer 1999 atwell 1999 for simplicity the harvest index is assumed to be independent of biomass production realistic if the biomass at the end of the main growing season b t seas is larger than 70 of the maximum attainable biomass g max t seas fereres and soriano 2007 2 1 4 precipitation while the above description of the soil moisture and pond water dynamics is of general applicability and could be driven by measured precipitation here we employ artificially generated precipitation to facilitate the exploration of climatic scenarios specifically the occurrence of precipitation is idealized as a marked poisson process e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 with average frequency Œª hence the durations of the dry downs œÑ have probability density function 14 p œÑ œÑ Œª exp Œª œÑ precipitation depths Œ∂ are exponentially distributed with average Œ± 15 p Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 Œ± exp Œ∂ Œ± each precipitation event has a duration d 2 2 criteria for pond sizing the model allows the quantitative investigation of the interplay of the climatic conditions and the on farm pond size relative to the total arable land a tot or equivalently the fraction of cultivated area a c we use the model to identify the most suitable pond size and irrigation strategy under different climate scenarios soil types and irrigation strategies two alternative criteria were considered to define the most suitable fraction of cultivated land i e not occupied by the reservoir a c i the fraction a c maximizing the average yield ii the fraction a c ensuring a certain minimum yield is attained every year these criteria can be described as production maximizing and risk minimizing respectively while the first criterion is preferable under the production and profit points of view the latter criterion might be chosen by a risk averse farmer i e a provident farmer who prefers the certainty of achieving at least a set target yield y Àá with minimum probability p r Àá in some years a pond designed based on the risk minimization criterion however can lead to lower yields than one would achieve with a yield maximizing pond so that the average yield is lower under the risk minimizing criterion while the production maximizing criterion leads to the definition of a single a c a c hereafter the risk minimizing criterion leads to the identification of a range of values for a c all ensuring the desired minimum yield for given management choices and pedoclimatic conditions we refer to this range as the safe interval the choice of the desired minimum yield y Àá clearly depends on a farmer s production costs but also depends on personal preferences with respect to risk aversion and hence is somewhat arbitrary the same applies to the minimum probability p r Àá with which such minimum yield is achieved we thus consider different options 2 3 model parameterization while of general usability the model was calibrated for corn grown in the lower mississippi river basin the rationale of the parameter value selection is presented in detail in the next sections the parameters are summarized in tables 2 and 3 2 3 1 crop and soil parameters crops cultivated in the area are soybean corn rice and cotton kebede et al 2014 we focus here on corn zea mays because it has intermediate water requirements among the other crops the active rooting depth z r is set to 0 3 m the length of the main growing season t seas at 70 d which is the time for corn to develop from the early vegetative stage to the first reproductive stages the emergence date is set on april 25th doy 115 i e 10 days after the average sowing date in the region nass 1997 we assume that no supplemental irrigation is applied during the reproductive stages to maturity regarding the crop growth parameters g max corresponds to the maximum relative growth rate while Œº can be interpreted as the rate of carbon loss when respiration is dominant under extreme water stress the photosynthesis is halted hsiao 1973 we set g max 0 047 d 1 i e to a rate that leads to a crop biomass at silking of about 24 ton ha 1 under well watered conditions considering a harvest index hi 0 52 evans and fischer 1999 hay 1995 this corresponds to a maximum yield of 13 96 ton ha 1 the deterioration rate Œº was set to be a fraction of the maximum relative growth rate Œº 0 2 g max 0 0094 d 1 the value 0 2 was chosen considering that under well watered conditions plant respiration rate is generally around 10 20 of the plant photosynthetic rate and that the respiration rate generally decreases in conditions of water stress but can also increase in some species flexas et al 2006 soil in the lower mississippi river basin are highly variable in texture ranging from silt loam to clay see e g mostovoy and anantharaj 2008 livneh et al 2015 the model was calibrated for a silt loam setting the porosity at n 0 485 the pore distribution index at m 1 5 30 and the soil water at air entry at œà s 7 8 10 3 mpa clapp and hornberger 1978 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was set to k s 0 13 m d 1 at the lower end of the range measured in agricultural soils in the mississippi delta region by perkins et al 2011 the choice of the lower end is motivated by the consideration that soils in the region are often finer than those considered by perkins et al 2011 to explore the variability in soil textures in the region also a clay soil

parameters in the demand based irrigation implemented in the model each irrigation application brings soil moisture from the intervention point s to the target level s by providing a water volume per unit cultivated area equal to nz r s s the range of feasible irrigation depths depends on the irrigation technology employed with shallower applications requiring more sophisticated and more expensive techniques vico and porporato 2011 here we consider a furrow irrigation i e the irrigation technique most commonly employed in the lower mississippi river basin kebede et al 2014 and set s s 0 2 in the results below we consider three intervention points s s s s 0 08 and s s 0 16 with the purpose of identifying the most productive irrigation strategy section 3 2 an intervention point at or above the point of incipient stomatal closure s corresponds to a stress avoidance while s s results in a deficit irrigation english and raja 1996 fereres and soriano 2007 in the latter case a certain level of water stress is considered acceptable as a way to reduce water demands for irrigation despite the potential detrimental effects on crop development 2 3 3 farm and pond parameters the total area of the farm is nominally assigned a unit value a tot 1 ha while this value is smaller than the average farm size in the region such a nominal value allows obtaining easy to interpret total farm yields expressed in mass over a tot and hence ton ha 1 larger farms would have proportionally larger average yields and standard deviations but the pattern presented below would remain unaltered regarding the pond its depth is typically not a decision variable in the lower mississippi river basin in the absence of natural topographic relief ponds are created by the construction of levees with standard cross sectional geometry around the full perimeter of a reservoir site the cost of construction is principally the cost of moving earth to form the levees and therefore a function of levee volume geometrically the volume of the levee and therefore levee costs increases with the square of the height while the volume of the reservoir increases linearly with levee height rodrigue 2019 while this leaves some room for treating depth as a design variable in practice the depth is standardized in the region hence a maximum water depth h max of 2 4 m is assumed in line with the typical depth in the region rodrigue 2019 conversely a range of pond sizes are considered from no pond fraction of cultivated area a c 1 to a pond covering 30 of the total arable land a c 0 7 2 3 4 climatic parameters the parameters of the precipitation regime Œ± and Œª were estimated on the basis of daily rainfall data from the lower mississippi river basin the climatic conditions are relatively uniform across the region e g dyer and mercer 2013 we chose the ncdc noaa meteorological station in yazoo city 5 nne ms usa 32 9027 n 90 3816 w elevation 32 6 m for which data are available over the period 1960 2017 focusing on the growing season of corn in the region april 15th july 15th we determined Œ± as the average precipitation amount over the days where an event was observed Œª was determined as the inverse of the average duration of periods between two subsequent events the parameters values were Œ± 0 015 m and Œª 0 26 d 1 equivalently to a mean interval between two subsequent precipitation events of 3 8 d similar values were obtained when considering a nearby meteorological station for the period 1942 2017 lambert 1 w ms usa 34 2044 n 90 2909 w elevation 47 2 m thus lending support to these estimates as representative of the region fewer precipitation data are available at the subdaily time scale thus making it difficult to obtain a robust estimate of the precipitation duration and its distribution previous analyses of precipitation in the southeastern usa show that summer precipitation events have average durations of the order of 2 h robinson and henderson 1992 and that even precipitations of durations longer than 3 h do not on average exceed 4 5 h in duration in mississippi brommer et al 2013 on these basis we selected a fixed precipitation duration d 2 hrs the maximum evapotranspiration rate averaged over the day et max t is assumed to increase during the growing season along with the increase in seasonal temperature and solar radiation conversely no fluctuations around et max t are considered as they are less significant than rainfall pulses for the soil water balance daly and porporato 2006 to reduce the need for meteorological data and facilitate the exploration of different climatic scenarios et max t was determined following the priestley taylor formula as priestley and taylor 1972 17 et max t Œ± pt s s s s Œ≥ q net g where the constant Œ± pt is set to 1 26 s s is the slope of the saturation water pressure curve a function of air temperature Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant q net is the total incoming net short and long wave radiation and g is the soil heat flux the net radiation is determined as the difference between the absorbed short wave radiation and the emitted long wave radiation q net q s q l q s is calculated as the function of latitude day of the year and temperature as the sum of the direct and diffuse radiation on a horizontal surface dingman 1994 with the transmissivity to direct radiation reduced to 80 of the clear sky value to account for the role of cloudiness only a fraction 1 Œ± v of the incoming short wave radiation is absorbed by the vegetation with the albedo Œ± v set to 0 22 a typical values for crops campbell and norman 1998 q l is determined based on the mean daily air temperature following allen et al 1998 assuming a relative humidity of air of 70 finally the soil heat flux is estimated as 10 of the short wave absorbed radiation a standard approach for dense canopies allen et al 1998 for each day during the growing season the minimum and maximum daily air temperatures were obtained by fitting a sinusoidal dependence on the day to the year to the temperatures measured by the meteorological station in yazoo city 5 nne ms usa and averaged to obtained the daily average temperature a comparison with pan evaporator data measured in the same station shows that the approach leads to et max comparable with the observed ones once the pan evaporator coefficient of 0 75 is considered supplementary information fig s2 the resulting values are also in line with those estimated for the same region based on the penman monteith equation anapalli et al 2019 yasarer et al 2017 the pond evaporation rate e was set equal to et max these precipitation and temperature regimes based on the data from yazoo city 5 nne were used in all the simulations below except when exploring different climate scenarios see next section 2 3 5 climate change scenarios to simulate different climate scenarios we varied the most climate sensitive parameters namely the seasonal pattern of air temperature and hence et max t and the rainfall parameters Œª and Œ± as we were interested in understanding the possible effects of global warming we selected two climate change scenarios especially suitable to represent the transition from the current climate toward warmer and more extreme ones the two resulting climate change scenarios intermediate and extreme differ for the extent of these changes their parameters are summarized in table 3 the predicted increase in evaporative demand with increasing temperature was captured by augmenting the observed temperatures in yazoo city 5 nne by 2 and 4 c for the intermediate and extreme scenarios respectively because the temperature dependence of et max is not linear this lead to an increase in et max with respect to the current climate between 5 1 and 4 2 for the intermediate climate and 10 3 and 8 5 for the extreme climate with the biggest increase occurring early in the growing season see supplementary information fig s2 c despite this change in temperature the length of the growing season was maintained unaltered thus leading to a conservative estimate of water demands for irrigation under global warming precipitations are predicted to become less frequent but more intense ipcc 2014 nikulin et al 2011 this is in line with the specific projections for the study area where precipitations are expected to become more variable in the future projection for the period 2041 2070 but with no significant change in the average total amount yasarer et al 2017 to simulate less frequent rainfall events we decreased the average precipitation frequency Œª to simulate on average larger precipitation events we decreased the value of Œ± we kept the product Œª Œ± constant i e assumed constant average cumulated seasonal precipitation given the high uncertainty in the future duration of precipitations the parameter d was not altered 2 3 6 initial conditions and numerical solution because outside of the growing season the evapotranspiration rate is likely low we assume that the pond is full at the beginning of each growing season h 0 h max and that the soil moisture is at the point of incipient stomatal closure s t 0 s the equations are solved via numerical integration via an explicit euler scheme with integration step of 0 005 d to best capture the highly non linear infiltration runoff process despite a sub daily time step the diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration and crop growth are not explicitly modelled rather et max g and Œº are to be interpreted as daily average rates different realizations of the precipitation forcing results in different trajectories of the key model variables the results below are based on the analyses of 3000 numerically simulated trajectories of the key variables they were obtained by generating 3000 precipitation series by extracting the precipitation amounts and the duration of the dry downs from their corresponding distributions eqs 14 and 15 the precipitation time series were then used to force eqs 1 5 10 12 below the results of the simulations are summarized via the average total yield its standard deviation and the likelihood of achieving a certain target yield for completeness we report also the average time at which the water in the pond first falls below the level necessary to perform an irrigation over the entire cultivated area the goal is to evaluate the joint effect of pond size climatic conditions soil type and irrigation strategy on farm productivity and yield stability 3 results 3 1 model dynamics fig 1 shows an example of how the system evolves over time soil moisture fig 1a increases quickly as a result of the unpredictable rainfall events and irrigation applications triggered by s reaching s and occurring provided there is enough water in the pond the irrigation forces soil moisture at or above s throughout the season unless the residual water in the pond is insufficient to perform an irrigation application the pond water level fig 1b quickly increases during precipitation events and declines during the dry down gradually because of evaporative losses and abruptly at each irrigation application no irrigation is applied if the remaining water is insufficient for an irrigation application over the whole cultivated area fig 1b far right in turn s affects plant biomass growth rate and hence the temporal evolution of b t over the entire growing season with reduced relative growth rate when s s fig 1c far right 3 2 role of irrigation strategy fig 2 a b show the average total farm yield y and its standard deviation s y respectively as a function of the fraction of cultivated area a c for different irrigation strategies under the current climate scenario stress avoidance irrigation s s solid line is contrasted to a mild s s 0 08 dashed lines and a severe s s 0 16 dotted lines deficit irrigation in all cases the difference s s was maintained constant i e it was assumed that the irrigation technique remained the same see section 2 3 2 for both stress avoidance and deficit irrigation there is an intermediate value of a c that maximizes the total average yield hereafter denoted as a c thin vertical lines in fig 2a its value depends on the irrigation strategy with increasingly large a c for decreasing s i e transitioning from stress avoidance irrigation to deficit irrigation in other words deficit irrigation smaller values of s needs smaller ponds to achieve the maximum attainable farm yield allowing a larger cultivated area higher values of a c nevertheless in spite of a larger cultivated area deficit irrigation leads to an average total farm yield lower than that of stress avoidance irrigation for all but the largest cultivated fractions indeed stress avoidance irrigation is the most productive irrigation strategy in the absence of water constraints i e for larger ponds because it allows an unrestricted growth rate throughout the growing season see eq 13 when water availability is limited by the pond storage capacity i e for a c a c stress avoidance irrigation cannot be performed over the entire season the average total yields decline to the point of becoming comparable to those obtained via deficit irrigation stress avoidance irrigation also minimizes yield variability for a c a c fig 2b by ensuring that no water stress negatively affects the crop when the pond is large enough to guarantee a stress avoidance irrigation for the entire growing season the yield standard deviation is 0 fig 2b solid line because no disturbance other than potential water stress is considered nevertheless when the water availability is limited by the pond storage capacity i e for a c a c the chosen irrigation strategy cannot be performed over the entire growing season and the crop must rely on the unpredictable precipitation for its water supply under these conditions stress avoidance irrigation can lead to a higher yield variability than deficit irrigation since it implies higher irrigation demands and a faster use of water early in the season and consequently a higher risk of running out of pond water before the end of the growing season this total yield yield stability trade off emerges even more clearly when considering risk minimization as a criterion for pond sizing for stress avoidance irrigation there is a safe interval fig 2 horizontal line but that range of pond sizes do not include that maximizing yields furthermore the implementation of deficit irrigation greatly reduces the width of the safe interval to the point that the safe interval no longer exists for the parameters used in fig 2 even the mild deficit irrigation leads to the disappearance of the safe interval the fraction of cultivated area corresponding to the highest average productivity a c is also the one that on average leads to insufficient water for irrigation in the pond for the first time towards the end of the growing season but not much earlier for the most productive a c the remaining water becomes insufficient for the next irrigation on average 10 20 days before the end of the season see fig 2c regardless of irrigation strategy curves above a c are not smooth because calculations are made assuming that no irrigation application occurs when the residual water in the pond becomes insufficient for a full irrigation application i e when h h min with h min a c 1 a c 1 nz r s s eq 2 as such a small decrease in cultivated area i e a small increase in pond size might not lead to appreciable effects on yield and its stability if the change in a c is insufficient to ensure one additional irrigation application the decrease in a c necessary to ensure an additional irrigation application decreases with decreasing a c because the pond depth for a single irrigation application is proportional to a c 1 a c 1 see eq 10 3 3 role of climatic conditions and soil type focusing on the most productive irrigation strategy on average i e stress avoidance irrigation fig 2a we investigated the effects of a shift in climatic conditions on productivity and its stability for different fractions of cultivated area a c fig 3 for completeness the different climate scenarios table 3 colors in fig 3 are explored for two soil types table 2 cf columns in fig 3 the curves exhibit the same behaviour under all the climatic scenarios with an intermediate value corresponding to the highest average yield vertical thin lines and a range of a c ensuring the desired minimum yield horizontal lines in all the climatic scenarios a c does not fall within the safe interval i e the production maximization and risk minimization criteria lead to divergent results climate change scenarios orange and red lines in fig 3 reduce the most productive fraction of cultivated area a c and the total average yield in the case of a c a c irrespective of soil type fig 3a c furthermore more extreme climates can result in a higher yield variability for fractions of cultivated areas above a c although not for extremely high a c fig 3b d because of these changes in average yield and its variability the climatic conditions affect also the safe interval its upper end is reduced as the climate becomes more extreme despite the unaltered average precipitation total this is due to the less uniform precipitation distribution and the higher evapotranspiration rate and hence faster soil water depletion assumed in the climate change scenarios table 3 finer soils slightly increase the most productive fraction of cultivated area a c and the width of the safe interval in particular under current climatic conditions cfr fig 3 a and c these shifts are the results of the lower infiltration capacity of finer soils and hence enhanced pond water recharge 3 4 role of farmer s preferences the definition of the safe interval is based on two subjective parameters the desired minimum yield y Àá and the minimum probability of achieving such yield p r Àá the results in fig 2 and 3 are based on a strong risk minimization criterion where a relatively low desired minimum yield equivalent to 80 of maximum attainable yield must be obtained in all years p r Àá 1 we relax this last requirement in fig 4 considering also cases in which the desired minimum yield is obtained with p r Àá 1 i e assuming a weak risk minimization criterion the safe interval widens when decreasing the desired minimum yields y Àá reduced in fig 4 and desired minimum probability levels p r Àá lightening gray shades in fig 4 the lower end of the safe interval is affected solely by the desired minimum yield conversely its upper end is the result of the interplay between both minimum yield and minimum probability of that yield lower y Àá and p r Àá increase the upper bound of the safe interval for p r Àá 1 i e for a weak risk minimization criterion the fraction of cultivated land that maximizes the average yield a c falls inside the safe interval i e it is possible to select a pond size that maximizes the production and minimizes the risks 4 discussion 4 1 implications of modelling assumptions the proposed model describes the coupled dynamics of soil moisture crop development and pond water storage table 1 based on few parameters with clear physical meaning table 2 and 3 because the model follows step by step the crop development during the growing season it is especially suitable to explore the dependence of crop yields on precipitation timing and the evolution of stored water availability this allows comparing the outcomes of climatic scenarios differing just in precipitation timing and intensity but not in average totals furthermore the model allows determining the most suitable size for the on farm pond for different farmer s risk coping attitude an aspect less often considered when sizing irrigation infrastructure and in general discussing water management solutions the model results rest on some assumptions first crop development can be subject to limitations other than water availability and damaging events other than dry spells can further reduce yields as such the yield estimates reported above are to be interpreted as potential yields second the results presented are obtained assuming a closed system i e that the on farm pond is recharged only by on farm runoff currently in the lower mississippi river basin ponds might rely on larger collection areas i e on off farm inflows omer et al 2018 a closed system represents the worst case scenario and a fully sustainable system indeed a larger water collection area can reduce the pond size needed because of the faster recharge during storms nevertheless the reduction in pond size will not be proportional to the collection area the pond needs to be of a size such that it can store sufficient water to cope with typical dry spells during which by definition no pond recharge occurs finally it is assumed that thanks to the winter precipitation at the beginning of the main growing season soil moisture is at the point of incipient stomatal closure s t 0 s and the pond is completely full h t 0 h max particularly dry winters and springs might reduce the initial soil and pond water content thus enhancing the need for irrigation and the likelihood of the pond emptying under prolonged dry spells in climates or locations when dry off seasons are the norm or when the off season recharge is uncertain due to a large interannual variability in precipitation totals on farm ponds might need to be sized to store the water necessary for more than one growing season the model could be adjusted to this case by considering different initial soil moistures and water depths in the pond these initial conditions could also be extracted from suitable probability distributions to mimic the role of large interannual variability to facilitate the exploration of precipitation scenarios a minimalist precipitation model is employed the current climate is parameterized with daily meteorological data in the region a comparison of the distribution of observed intervals between rainfall events and event depths with the assumed theoretical distributions eqs 14 and 15 lends support to this minimalist description of precipitation supplementary information fig s1 moreover model runs with observed precipitation lead to qualitatively similar results although it is not possible to run more than 67 simulations corresponding to the years for data are available so that the definition of the safe interval is more uncertain data at subdaily time scales have limited temporal coverage in the region thus not permitting a similar comparison including also the precipitation duration nevertheless a sensitivity analysis on the duration of precipitation events d showed that this parameter plays a secondary role when maintained within realistic values for the region robinson and henderson 1992 brommer et al 2013 hence its choice and the fact that the duration of precipitation events is assumed to be fixed do not remarkably affect our results and conclusions the model is parameterized for corn a crop common in the region with intermediate water demands between the other two common crops there i e soybean glycine max and cotton gossypium hirsutum kebede et al 2014 similar patterns as those presented above are obtained for other crop although the most suitable fractions of cultivated land for production maximization and risk minimization could change crops with higher water requirements like cotton could result in a faster depletion of water stored in the soil thus enhancing the irrigation requirements and potentially reducing the runoff during precipitation events as such more water demanding crops would result in a shift of the cultivated fraction corresponding to the highest average yields towards lower values a similar shift is to be expected under conditions leading to higher maximum evapotranspiration rates 4 2 comparison with existing on farm ponds in the mississippi river alluvial valley the recommended ratio of cultivated area to reservoir area is currently 13 1 to 16 1 meaning that every 13 16 ha of cropped area would require a 1 ha reservoir these ratios correspond to a c between 13 14 0 93 and 16 17 0 94 these empirical ratios are based on an average irrigation demand of around 0 3 m per growing season and a 2 4 m depth of a typical pond rodrigue 2019 thus based on this design a full reservoir could supply between two thirds if 13 1 and one half if 16 1 of the average irrigation demand for a growing season i e within season runoff must fully recharge the pond at least once the water supply provided by the pond size identified through our model is very similar to these recommendations under current climates and stress avoidance irrigation the most productive fraction of cultivated area is around 0 92 corresponding to a cultivated area to pond ratio of 11 5 1 the similarity in resulting pond sizes for maximum productivity lends support to our modelling approach and parameterization the fact that these values are lower than the recommended ones can be ascribed to the assumption of no off farm contribution to the pond recharge and the focus on the main growing season only yet the comparison with existing ponds also shows that for system that are efficient in capturing the superficial runoff and storing it in the on farm pond the need for off farm flows is rather small as such on farm pond systems can remain a feasible approach also should their use become widespread in an agricultural district moreover these results show that recommended on farm ponds match the most suitable pond size for production maximization but are smaller then those within the safe interval future climates are expected to require a reduction in a c and thus a shift towards cultivated to pond area ratios smaller than the currently recommended ratios another potential reason explaining differences between current recommendation and the model results is that ponds are generally not designed for single crops but rather for a combination of them as different crops may be cultivated over the land serviced by the pond in different years we note however that corn has an intermediate water demand between two other crops common in the region cotton and soybean and was chosen in the effort of capturing the average crop water use rice is also cultivated in the region but it is not the prevalent crop kebede et al 2014 4 3 implications for on farm pond sizing production maximization vs risk minimization regardless of climatic conditions and soil texture the average total yields y increase gradually with increasing fraction of cultivated area until the fraction leading to the maximum productivity a c for even larger a c average yields sharply decline and yield variability increases this asymmetric response suggests that when comparing two ponds that differ by the same amount from the one corresponding to the highest productivity one larger one smaller than a c the oversized pond is preferable to the undersized one an oversized pond implies a reduction of the cultivated area and consequently a loss in productivity but an undersized pond and hence a possible insufficient water availability leads to much sharper losses in terms of yields and increases in yield variability an oversized pond also corresponds to being further away from the safe interval different criteria for pond sizing lead to divergent solutions i e the fraction of cultivated land for production maximization does not fall within the range of cultivated land that minimizes the risk of not achieving the desirable minimum yield consequently a farmer has to choose between being prudent i e minimizing the risk of a low yield in certain years or maximizing the average crop if they choose to maximize the average crop they must expect that during some years the final crop will be lower than the desired minimum yield y Àá more in general a trade off emerges between average yield and yield stability two of the pillars of food security the production maximisation and risk minimization criteria can be reconciled only if a certain probability of not reaching the desirable minimum yield i e if p r Àá 1 is considered acceptable stress avoidance irrigation is the most productive strategy on average under most cultivated areas a result in line with brasil and medeiros 2018 furthermore the width of the safe interval is drastically reduced under deficit irrigation to the point that the safe interval no longer exist making this strategy unsuitable for more prevident farmers finally under climate change scenarios namely with higher evapotranspiration rates and with less frequent but more intense precipitation events the maximum average yields declines and requires a larger area devoted to the pond the safe interval becomes narrower fig 3 hence even just a change in rainfall pattern without a change in rainfall total accompanied by an increase in evapotranspiration rates will require a revision of the recommended cultivated to pond area ratios according to our results to maximize the average yield ratios will need to be of 8 1 1 to 10 5 1 depending on the soil type and extent of change in climatic conditions a sharp reduction with respect to the current practice of 13 1 to 16 1 similar patterns emerge when considering future rainfall scenarios involving also a decline in average total seasonal precipitation not shown 5 conclusions irrigation can stabilize yields but this positive effect often comes at the cost of overexploitation of groundwater resources where allowed by local regulations on farm water collection and storage in small ponds have the potential to mitigate the effects of dry spells on crop productivity in a more sustainable way allowing irrigation based on renewable water resources yet the sizing of the on farm pond is not trivial because of the cascading effects of the unpredictability of precipitation events currently ponds are mostly sized based on local empirical ratios which however could become obsolete under future more extreme climates and do not allow to consider the farmer s preferences when coping with uncertainty we developed a minimalist model capturing the coupled dynamics of plant available water on farm pond water storage and crop development and final yield requiring few physically based parameters the model was calibrated for the lower mississippi river basin a region where groundwater levels are plummeting as a result of water abstractions for irrigation nevertheless its applicability is general the model was used to identify the most suitable irrigation strategy and pond size according to two criteria production maximization and risk minimization thus taking into account the farmer s preferences and risk coping attitude different climatic scenarios soil textures irrigation strategies and farmer s preferences were considered results relative to current climates for production maximization are comparable with the practice in the region thus lending support to our approach the model helps in understanding how the effectiveness of a pond is affected by different factors such as climate soil texture and irrigation strategy when compared to deficit irrigation stress avoidance irrigation maximizes yields but increases its variability for small ponds moreover it can be difficult to reconcile the goal of maximizing average production with that minimizing the risk of low yields unless a certain level of risk is considered acceptable by the farmer finally even if not involving a decline in average precipitation totals future more extreme conditions are expected to lead in lower average maximum yields the need for larger ponds to maximize yields and a narrower set of pond sizes for risk minimization the model provides the foundation for analysing management trade offs under stochastic precipitation for a variety of increasingly complex risk mitigation strategies explicitly considering the farmer s preferences its simplicity allows easy applicability across systems also when lacking detailed information on the water capture and storage systems crop physiology and weather data credit authorship

5609,in many regions precipitation does not reliably meet crop water demands a situation that climate change will likely exacerbate supplemental irrigation can help enhance and stabilize crop yields but the need of water for irrigation has often led to groundwater over exploitation on farm ponds can provide a more sustainable water source their use has often been promoted by local authorities but by converting a portion of cultivated area to water storage and reducing water availability downstream on farm ponds also imply constraints and trade offs for an effective exploitation of their potential benefits they must be carefully designed and managed based on the local edaphic and climate conditions a non trivial task because of the cascading effects of rainfall unpredictability here we identify the most suitable on farm pond size according to two criteria maximization of average yield i e production maximization and achievement of a minimum acceptable yield i e risk minimization accounting for the farmer s risk aversion to this aim we develop a minimalist model requiring few physically based parameters coupling crop biomass soil moisture and water stored in the pond while general the model is here applied to a case study in the lower mississippi river basin usa simulations show that yield maximization and risk minimization are goals hard to reconcile regardless of climatic conditions soil type and irrigation strategy with smaller ponds allowing the maximum average yield at the cost of reducing its stability from year to year stress avoidance irrigation ensures higher yields than deficit irrigation even if it implies a faster use of the stored water future more extreme climates will result in lower maximum average yields and narrower ranges of pond sizes ensuring desirable minimum yields keywords on farm pond irrigation crop yield sustainability risk aversion lower mississippi river basin 1 introduction societies are faced with the challenge of reliably producing a sufficient amount of food in a sustainable way achieving this goal requires ensuring continuous and sufficient water availability for crops to thrive nevertheless in many regions rainfall does not reliably meet crop water demands due to insufficient or intermittent precipitation during the crop growing season this situation could worsen under future climates when it is expected that there will be an increase in frequency and duration of dry spells in many regions ipcc 2014 also warmer temperatures could enhance plant transpiration rate and consequent irrigation demands unless these changes are balanced out by faster plant development and hence shorter growing seasons supplemental irrigation can enhance and stabilize yields in many agricultural systems troy et al 2015 fox and rockstr√∂m 2003 kumar et al 2016 yet irrigation applications require access to reliable water resources groundwater has often been used for this purpose siebert et al 2010 but the implementation of irrigation has led to an unsustainable exploitation of aquifers with pumping often exceeding recharge and leading to plummeting water table levels scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 el naqa et al 2007 water harvesting techniques such as on farm ponds can provide an alternative more sustainable solution mitigating dry spells while avoiding the over exploitation of increasingly scarce groundwater resources indeed on farm ponds can store water when it is abundant e g during the off season when losses via evapotranspiration are low for use in dry spells as supplemental irrigation ponds are also of interest in locations where precipitation intensity often exceeds the soil infiltration capacity or in seasonally dry climates when the crop growing season does not coincide with the wet season their use can lead to an increase in crop production wisser et al 2010 and groundwater levels thanks to the reduction in water abstractions sikka et al 2017 moreover on farm ponds can provide a variety of ecosystem services moore and hunt 2012 bouldin et al 2004 such as enhanced biodiversity cereghino et al 2014 winter habitat for migratory waterfowl reinecke et al 1989 improved water quality omer and baker 2019 and suspended solids and nutrient recycling omer et al 2017 energy use for irrigation can also be reduced bouldin et al 2004 not surprisingly this simple yet effective tool is quite widespread and actively encouraged by local and national authorities national rainfed area authority 2012 rao et al 2017 acheampong et al 2018 nrcs 2014 palanisami et al 2010 bouldin et al 2004 in spite of their construction and maintenance costs pond prevalence is increasing rapidly also in locations where they have not been used historically for the usa see omer and baker 2019 omer et al 2019 nevertheless on farm ponds also imply constraints and trade offs regionally they can reduce the water availability downstream krol et al 2011 liebe et al 2005 locally ponds can diminish the cultivated area by occupying arable land hence ponds must be sized so that the amount of water they store is sufficient to meet the farm water requirements under most years thus ensuring high and stable yields at the same time their size should be the minimum possible to reduce the impacts on the regional water balance but also allowing larger cultivated areas in the absence of topographic relief pond depth is generally not a decision variable but rather a building constraint hence a trade off emerges between ensuring that the pond is of adequate size to meet water demands and minimizing its negative effects pond size needed depends on the implemented irrigation strategy e g whether irrigation is used to completely avoid water stress stress avoidance irrigation or if a certain level of water stress is considered acceptable deficit irrigation english and raja 1996 fereres and soriano 2007 stress avoidance irrigation might not always be the most productive approach since it implies a faster use of the stored water and consequently a higher risk of running out of water before the end of the growing season conversely deficit irrigation can limit this risk and maximize on farm water productivity geerts and raes 2009 but it can reduce the final yield because of the negative effects of water stress on crop growth hsiao 1973 each of these trade offs may limit the adoption of on farm ponds for supplemental irrigation kumar et al 2016 for a wider use of on farm ponds it is thus necessary to develop approaches for the most suitable sizing and management taking into account local edaphic and climate conditions currently most ponds are sized based on empirical approaches often recommended by local and national agencies for the usa see usda agricultural handbook 1982 while of simple applicability these rules may not be robust to changes in the climatic conditions or crop choice and do not allow the exploration of radically different management strategies models are a useful tool in support of the sizing and management of on farm ponds ouyang et al 2016 as they allow testing different climatic and management scenarios several models based on different principles have been proposed to size on farm ponds arnold and stockle 1991 suresh and mujumdar 2004 ouyang et al 2016 ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2017 georgiou and papamichail 2008 kumar et al 2006 roy et al 2009 nevertheless due to their complexity and large number of parameters these models can be difficult to apply in practice an alternative approach is represented by minimalist models requiring fewer physically meaningful parameters for easier application to different crops and sites albeit less detailed they can simulate the key mechanisms driving the crop soil water dynamics corroborating existing empirical approaches and allowing the exploration of additional climatic and management scenarios moreover minimalist models by allowing a large number of simulations easily provide quantitative information on the likelihood of specific outcomes allowing the integrations of aspects of decision making under uncertainty including risk attitude here we develop a minimalist model coupling soil water dynamics crop development and pond water availability the model permits the explicit consideration of precipitation patterns and the farmer s risk attitude an aspect seldom considered when designing management strategies for an example see pande and savenije 2016 we use the model to identify the most suitable pond size with reference to two contrasting criteria farm production maximization and low yield risk minimization specifically we aim at answering the following questions i what is the pond size that ensures the highest farm productivity or the most stable yields ii are these criteria in conflict iii how should the pond size change to meet these goals under future more extreme climates while general and easily transferable the model is applied to the case of on farm ponds in the lower mississippi river basin in the southeastern usa groundwater from the shallow mississippi river basin alluvial aquifer has long been the primary source for irrigation in the region supplying more water for irrigation than any other aquifer in the usa except the high plains aquifer system maupin et al 2014 reba et al 2017 shallow groundwater has historically been available uniformly across the landscape with on average one groundwater well serving approximately 40 hectares christy 2019 however declines in the water table across the region have resulted in critically low groundwater levels particularly in arkansas where supply from the alluvial aquifer is no longer dependable in large areas yaeger et al 2018 since in arkansas and mississippi water is not regulated until it reaches a surface water body or aquifer local authorities are promoting the use of small reservoirs as a source of supplemental irrigation this is possible because it is now common in the region for fields to have been precision graded to a slope of approximately 0 002 m m 1 and to be bordered by low levees with outlet pipes that convey runoff from the field to adjacent ditches which route runoff toward the reservoir currently the sizing of such reservoirs is based on empirical approaches usda agricultural handbook 1982 with a suggested cultivated area to pond ratios of 13 1 to 16 1 assuming the standard pond depth of 2 4 m ouyang et al 2016 yet these empirical approaches do not take into account the farmer s risk coping attitude and might no longer be suitable under future more extreme climates 2 methods 2 1 model structure the model represents arable land e g a farm of size a tot partially cultivated and partially occupied by a water reservoir during the growing season the crop grows on the cultivated fraction a c at a rate depending on soil water availability the soil water is provided by the unpredictable occurrence of precipitation and can be supplemented by irrigation when soil water is so low to cause crop water stress irrigation is assumed to be extracted solely from the on farm pond in turn the on farm pond captures and stores surface runoff throughout the year thanks to a system of levees and ditches the model describes the coupled dynamics of soil moisture crop biomass and the water stored in the on farm reservoir via a set of differential equations the main variables of the model are table 1 i soil moisture s 0 s 1 ii depth of the water stored in the pond h and iii total crop biomass in the farm b to facilitate the exploration of different climatic scenarios rainfall is represented as a stochastic process the evolution of the system is investigated over the period of duration t seas corresponding to the main growing season extending from soon after seedling emergence to when plant biomass growth tapers off 2 1 1 soil moisture dynamics the water available to the plants is determined based on the water balance averaged over the active root zone z r where most of the roots are located the state variable is the relative soil moisture or saturation level defined as the volume of water per pore volume i e s t Œ∏ n 1 where Œ∏ is the soil volumetric water content and n the soil porosity as such 0 s 1 with 0 corresponding to oven dry soil and 1 to saturation the soil moisture dynamics is driven by the balance between the inputs via precipitation and irrigation and the losses via evapotranspiration surface runoff and percolation below the rooting zone e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the water table is assumed to be well below the rooting zone and as such to not influence its water content as common in the study site in many locations including the lower mississippi river basin the surface runoff is collected and used to recharge the on farm ponds but no tail drainage system is in place so deep percolation is lost from the system it is thus necessary to separate losses via surface runoff from those via deep percolation to this aim we employ a minimalist model for the soil water budget to be interpreted at the subdaily scale and assuming instantaneous redistribution of moisture kim et al 1996 rigby and porporato 2006 the temporal evolution of soil moisture is the result of the concatenation of the soil moisture dynamics during i between storm periods dry downs where the only possible input is via irrigation assumed not to generate any runoff and ii in storm periods when runoff is possible under intense precipitation during the dry down there is no infiltration so that the soil moisture dynamics can be written as 1 nz r ds t dt i irr s h et s l s where n is the soil porosity z r is the depth of the active rooting zone the only input is the irrigation i irr s h and losses occur via evapotranspiration with rate et s and deep percolation below the rooting zone with rate l s irrigation is assumed to be demand based i e an irrigation is triggered by soil moisture reaching a pre set level s intervention level this approach corresponds to setting a management allowable depletion mad allen et al 1998 of nz r s fc s where s fc is the soil field capacity each irrigation provides a pre set water depth such that soil moisture is brought up to a target level s if there is enough residual water in the pond to perform the desired irrigation over the entire cultivated area for simplicity irrigation is idealized as an instantaneous application it follows that 2 i irr s h nz r s s s s and 1 a c a c h nz r s s 0 otherwise considering an idealized pond with a rectangular parallelepiped shape the term 1 a c a c 1 h is the volume of water per unit cultivated land that is still available in the pond when the water depth in the pond is h the two conditions imposed on the occurrence of an irrigation application mirror the demand based nature of the irrigation strategy s s and the fact that due to technological limitations shallower irrigation application than those for which the system is designed are difficult and costly to implement as such no irrigation application occurs if there is not sufficient water in the pond to irrigate the entire cultivated area restoring the soil moisture s the less than unitary irrigation efficiency e g vico and porporato 2011 and references therein is not explicitly included here because it is assumed that any water excess is recaptured by the surface runoff collection system and rerouted to the on farm pond as such i irr s h is to be interpreted as an effective irrigation and no surface runoff is included in eq 1 the evapotranspiration term et includes losses via soil water evaporation and plant transpiration a piecewise linear function of soil moisture is considered here e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 3 et s 0 s s w et max t s s w s s w s w s s et max t s s where et max t is the maximum evapotranspiration rate corresponding to well watered conditions s is the soil moisture at incipient stomatal closure and s w is the soil moisture at the plant wilting point below which the residual water in the soil is no longer available for uptake by the plants losses below the plant wilting point are neglected for easier parameterization et max t is to be interpreted here as the average daily value i e the above dynamics does not distinguish between day and night the maximum evapotranspiration rate depends on several environmental variables chiefly air temperature and humidity and solar radiation below et max is varied along with the other climatic parameters to explore different climate scenarios note that for a canopy well coupled to the atmosphere the evapotranspiration rate also depends on the crop leaf area and hence on the crop development stage however we assumed that vegetation affects the evapotranspiration partitioning wang et al 2014 but not the overall evapotranspiration rate as the higher transpiration for larger and closed canopies is balanced by the reduction in soil water evaporation anapalli et al 2019 vico and porporato 2013 we instead consider that et max t changes with air temperature and solar radiation see section 2 3 4 for details losses via deep percolation are described as power law dependence on soil moisture 4 l s k s s c 1 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and c 2 m 2 with m being the pore size distribution index e g campbell 1974 during the storm soil moisture in the rooting zone increases from the soil moisture at the end of the preceding dry down s 0 as the result of infiltration for simplicity it is assumed that the storm is of short duration with respect to the typical dry down so that losses via evapotranspiration during the storm can be neglected and that no irrigation becomes necessary during the storm despite the losses via deep percolation hence the rate of soil moisture increase is equal to the infiltration rate until saturation is reached minus losses via deep percolation i e 5 nz r ds t dt i infl p s 0 t l s s t 1 0 s t 1 where i infl p s 0 t is the time dependent infiltration rate under a precipitation of rate p starting when soil moisture is at the level s 0 and as above l is the deep percolation rate the infiltration rate i infl is determined employing approximate solutions to the richards equation kim et al 1996 and references therein briefly i infl is assumed to equal the precipitation rate until ponding occurs and to be the head controlled infiltration rate i infl h after ponding i e 6 i infl p s 0 t p 0 t t p i infl h 1 2 s s 0 t t p t e 1 2 k s t t p where s s 0 is the soil sorptivity t p is the actual time to ponding and t e is the equivalent time to ponding the sorptivity is determined as kim et al 1996 smith and parlange 1978 7 s s 0 2 n 1 s 0 œà s 1 3 m 10 6 98 6 s 0 1 3 m m 1 1 2 k s 1 2 where œà s is the air entry soil water potential and the coefficient 10 6 98 6 transforms mpa into m for unit consistency assuming œà s in mpa and k s in m d 1 the equivalent and actual times to ponding are calculated exploiting the time compression approximation i e employing the cumulative infiltration as a surrogate of time see kim et al 1996 and references therein the effective time to ponding is the time at which the precipitation driven and head controlled infiltration rates are the same 8 t e s s 0

t p to the total head controlled infiltration up to t e from which a relation between t e and t p is obtained 9 t p t e 2 p k s p 2 1 2 pond water storage the system of water capturing and re use for irrigation is assumed to be self sufficient i e only farm runoff is available for subsequent irrigation applications with no inputs from outside the area a tot during the dry down the temporal evolution of the pond water depth h is driven by losses via withdrawals for irrigation purposes and direct evaporation from the pond surface during the dry down i e 10 dh t dt a c 1 a c i irr Œ∏ h e where i irr is the irrigation eq 2 Œ∏ is the heaviside function and e is the evaporation rate from the pond surface the coefficient a c 1 a c 1 converts the volume of applied irrigation per unit cultivated area to depth of water in the pond losses due to infiltration and seepage are neglected here these losses appear highly variable according to some estimates they range between 0 4 and 1 5 mm d 1 pringle 1994 i e almost one order of magnitude smaller that evaporation rate other estimates suggest rates between 1 5 and 11 mm d 1 omer et al 2018 part of the uncertainty is due to the fact that seepage depends on the age of the pond and tends to diminish over time as sediments accumulate on the bottom shao et al 2013 during the storm h increases as the result of precipitation falling directly on the pond surface and recharge via runoff collected over the cultivated area during the precipitation events i e by the fraction of precipitation that does not infiltrate in the soil when the pond is filled to its capacity i e h h max any water reaching it is lost it follows that 11 dh t dt p a c 1 a c p i infl p s 0 t h t h max 0 h t h max where p is the precipitation rate and i infl is the infiltration rate eq 6 similar to the soil moisture dynamics the evaporation term is neglected during the precipitation event the inclusion of the runoff allows consideration of the within growing season pond recharge which exploits the capture and storage of water exceeding the soil water holding capacity in the cultivated area this also allows the recharge of the pond during the non growing season 2 1 3 crop development and yield the total crop biomass b over the cultivated area is assumed to grow exponentially as 12 db t dt g s b t where the relative growth rate g s depends on soil moisture in the active rooting zone and it is to be interpreted as the average daily value i e the above description does not distinguish between day and night even if the cultivated area is not explicit in the equation b t depends on it since the initial value b 0 is given by b 0 a c a tot where b 0 is the amount of initial crop per unit of ground area and a tot is the total arable land we describe the dependence of the relative crop growth rate on soil moisture s as a piecewise linear function similar to that of evapotranspiration 13 g s Œº s s w Œº g max Œº s s w s s w s w s s g max s s where Œº is the deterioration rate accounting for the negative effects of plant water stress g max is the maximum relative growth rate corresponding to well watered conditions s w is the wilting point and s is the soil moisture corresponding to the point of incipient stomatal closure below which co2 uptake rate is reduced see section 2 1 1 daly et al 2004 vico and porporato 2008 this description hinges on the close relation between plant transpiration and carbon fixation at the leaf level under water stress stomata are progressively closed and thus carbon fixation is reduced with negative effects on plant ability to produce biomass e g hsiao 1973 note that when no water is available for plant uptake i e s s w g becomes negative g s w Œº implying that the biomass decreases the biological interpretation is that some plants die after a long dry period b t can then near zero meaning that almost all the plants die the plant biomass at the end of the main growing season is related to the marketable yields in many grain crops hence knowledge of b t seas allows estimating the final yield exploiting the concept of harvest index i e y hi b t seas evans and fischer 1999 atwell 1999 for simplicity the harvest index is assumed to be independent of biomass production realistic if the biomass at the end of the main growing season b t seas is larger than 70 of the maximum attainable biomass g max t seas fereres and soriano 2007 2 1 4 precipitation while the above description of the soil moisture and pond water dynamics is of general applicability and could be driven by measured precipitation here we employ artificially generated precipitation to facilitate the exploration of climatic scenarios specifically the occurrence of precipitation is idealized as a marked poisson process e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 with average frequency Œª hence the durations of the dry downs œÑ have probability density function 14 p œÑ œÑ Œª exp Œª œÑ precipitation depths Œ∂ are exponentially distributed with average Œ± 15 p Œ∂ Œ∂ 1 Œ± exp Œ∂ Œ± each precipitation event has a duration d 2 2 criteria for pond sizing the model allows the quantitative investigation of the interplay of the climatic conditions and the on farm pond size relative to the total arable land a tot or equivalently the fraction of cultivated area a c we use the model to identify the most suitable pond size and irrigation strategy under different climate scenarios soil types and irrigation strategies two alternative criteria were considered to define the most suitable fraction of cultivated land i e not occupied by the reservoir a c i the fraction a c maximizing the average yield ii the fraction a c ensuring a certain minimum yield is attained every year these criteria can be described as production maximizing and risk minimizing respectively while the first criterion is preferable under the production and profit points of view the latter criterion might be chosen by a risk averse farmer i e a provident farmer who prefers the certainty of achieving at least a set target yield y Àá with minimum probability p r Àá in some years a pond designed based on the risk minimization criterion however can lead to lower yields than one would achieve with a yield maximizing pond so that the average yield is lower under the risk minimizing criterion while the production maximizing criterion leads to the definition of a single a c a c hereafter the risk minimizing criterion leads to the identification of a range of values for a c all ensuring the desired minimum yield for given management choices and pedoclimatic conditions we refer to this range as the safe interval the choice of the desired minimum yield y Àá clearly depends on a farmer s production costs but also depends on personal preferences with respect to risk aversion and hence is somewhat arbitrary the same applies to the minimum probability p r Àá with which such minimum yield is achieved we thus consider different options 2 3 model parameterization while of general usability the model was calibrated for corn grown in the lower mississippi river basin the rationale of the parameter value selection is presented in detail in the next sections the parameters are summarized in tables 2 and 3 2 3 1 crop and soil parameters crops cultivated in the area are soybean corn rice and cotton kebede et al 2014 we focus here on corn zea mays because it has intermediate water requirements among the other crops the active rooting depth z r is set to 0 3 m the length of the main growing season t seas at 70 d which is the time for corn to develop from the early vegetative stage to the first reproductive stages the emergence date is set on april 25th doy 115 i e 10 days after the average sowing date in the region nass 1997 we assume that no supplemental irrigation is applied during the reproductive stages to maturity regarding the crop growth parameters g max corresponds to the maximum relative growth rate while Œº can be interpreted as the rate of carbon loss when respiration is dominant under extreme water stress the photosynthesis is halted hsiao 1973 we set g max 0 047 d 1 i e to a rate that leads to a crop biomass at silking of about 24 ton ha 1 under well watered conditions considering a harvest index hi 0 52 evans and fischer 1999 hay 1995 this corresponds to a maximum yield of 13 96 ton ha 1 the deterioration rate Œº was set to be a fraction of the maximum relative growth rate Œº 0 2 g max 0 0094 d 1 the value 0 2 was chosen considering that under well watered conditions plant respiration rate is generally around 10 20 of the plant photosynthetic rate and that the respiration rate generally decreases in conditions of water stress but can also increase in some species flexas et al 2006 soil in the lower mississippi river basin are highly variable in texture ranging from silt loam to clay see e g mostovoy and anantharaj 2008 livneh et al 2015 the model was calibrated for a silt loam setting the porosity at n 0 485 the pore distribution index at m 1 5 30 and the soil water at air entry at œà s 7 8 10 3 mpa clapp and hornberger 1978 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was set to k s 0 13 m d 1 at the lower end of the range measured in agricultural soils in the mississippi delta region by perkins et al 2011 the choice of the lower end is motivated by the consideration that soils in the region are often finer than those considered by perkins et al 2011 to explore the variability in soil textures in the region also a clay soil was considered with parameters n 0 482 m 1 11 4 œà s 4 10 3 mpa clapp and hornberger 1978 and k s 0 014 m d 1 rawls et al 1982 in the absence of site specific measurements the latter value is towards the lowest end of literature values cfr rawls et al 1982 clapp and hornberger 1978 because arable lands generally have two to three times lower hydraulic conductivity than natural ones jarvis et al 2013 the soil moisture thresholds corresponding to the incipient stomatal closure and plant wilting point were determined based on the soil water potential at air entry and the pore size distribution index as 16 s œà s œà s m s w œà s œà s w m based on observations for corn the corresponding soil water potential thresholds were set to œà s 0 2 mpa and œà s w 1 5 mpa cochard 2002 2 3 2 irrigation parameters in the demand based irrigation implemented in the model each irrigation application brings soil moisture from the intervention point s to the target level s by providing a water volume per unit cultivated area equal to nz r s s the range of feasible irrigation depths depends on the irrigation technology employed with shallower applications requiring more sophisticated and more expensive techniques vico and porporato 2011 here we consider a furrow irrigation i e the irrigation technique most commonly employed in the lower mississippi river basin kebede et al 2014 and set s s 0 2 in the results below we consider three intervention points s s s s 0 08 and s s 0 16 with the purpose of identifying the most productive irrigation strategy section 3 2 an intervention point at or above the point of incipient stomatal closure s corresponds to a stress avoidance while s s results in a deficit irrigation english and raja 1996 fereres and soriano 2007 in the latter case a certain level of water stress is considered acceptable as a way to reduce water demands for irrigation despite the potential detrimental effects on crop development 2 3 3 farm and pond parameters the total area of the farm is nominally assigned a unit value a tot 1 ha while this value is smaller than the average farm size in the region such a nominal value allows obtaining easy to interpret total farm yields expressed in mass over a tot and hence ton ha 1 larger farms would have proportionally larger average yields and standard deviations but the pattern presented below would remain unaltered regarding the pond its depth is typically not a decision variable in the lower mississippi river basin in the absence of natural topographic relief ponds are created by the construction of levees with standard cross sectional geometry around the full perimeter of a reservoir site the cost of construction is principally the cost of moving earth to form the levees and therefore a function of levee volume geometrically the volume of the levee and therefore levee costs increases with the square of the height while the volume of the reservoir increases linearly with levee height rodrigue 2019 while this leaves some room for treating depth as a design variable in practice the depth is standardized in the region hence a maximum water depth h max of 2 4 m is assumed in line with the typical depth in the region rodrigue 2019 conversely a range of pond sizes are considered from no pond fraction of cultivated area a c 1 to a pond covering 30 of the total arable land a c 0 7 2 3 4 climatic parameters the parameters of the precipitation regime Œ± and Œª were estimated on the basis of daily rainfall data from the lower mississippi river basin the climatic conditions are relatively uniform across the region e g dyer and mercer 2013 we chose the ncdc noaa meteorological station in yazoo city 5 nne ms usa 32 9027 n 90 3816 w elevation 32 6 m for which data are available over the period 1960 2017 focusing on the growing season of corn in the region april 15th july 15th we determined Œ± as the average precipitation amount over the days where an event was observed Œª was determined as the inverse of the average duration of periods between two subsequent events the parameters values were Œ± 0 015 m and Œª 0 26 d 1 equivalently to a mean interval between two subsequent precipitation events of 3 8 d similar values were obtained when considering a nearby meteorological station for the period 1942 2017 lambert 1 w ms usa 34 2044 n 90 2909 w elevation 47 2 m thus lending support to these estimates as representative of the region fewer precipitation data are available at the subdaily time scale thus making it difficult to obtain a robust estimate of the precipitation duration and its distribution previous analyses of precipitation in the southeastern usa show that summer precipitation events have average durations of the order of 2 h robinson and henderson 1992 and that even precipitations of durations longer than 3 h do not on average exceed 4 5 h in duration in mississippi brommer et al 2013 on these basis we selected a fixed precipitation duration d 2 hrs the maximum evapotranspiration rate averaged over the day et max t is assumed to increase during the growing season along with the increase in seasonal temperature and solar radiation conversely no fluctuations around et max t are considered as they are less significant than rainfall pulses for the soil water balance daly and porporato 2006 to reduce the need for meteorological data and facilitate the exploration of different climatic scenarios et max t was determined following the priestley taylor formula as priestley and taylor 1972 17 et max t Œ± pt s s s s Œ≥ q net g where the constant Œ± pt is set to 1 26 s s is the slope of the saturation water pressure curve a function of air temperature Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant q net is the total incoming net short and long wave radiation and g is the soil heat flux the net radiation is determined as the difference between the absorbed short wave radiation and the emitted long wave radiation q net q s q l q s is calculated as the function of latitude day of the year and temperature as the sum of the direct and diffuse radiation on a horizontal surface dingman 1994 with the transmissivity to direct radiation reduced to 80 of the clear sky value to account for the role of cloudiness only a fraction 1 Œ± v of the incoming short wave radiation is absorbed by the vegetation with the albedo Œ± v set to 0 22 a typical values for crops campbell and norman 1998 q l is determined based on the mean daily air temperature following allen et al 1998 assuming a relative humidity of air of 70 finally the soil heat flux is estimated as 10 of the short wave absorbed radiation a standard approach for dense canopies allen et al 1998 for each day during the growing season the minimum and maximum daily air temperatures were obtained by fitting a sinusoidal dependence on the day to the year to the temperatures measured by the meteorological station in yazoo city 5 nne ms usa and averaged to obtained the daily average temperature a comparison with pan evaporator data measured in the same station shows that the approach leads to et max comparable with the observed ones once the pan evaporator coefficient of 0 75 is considered supplementary information fig s2 the resulting values are also in line with those estimated for the same region based on the penman monteith equation anapalli et al 2019 yasarer et al 2017 the pond evaporation rate e was set equal to et max these precipitation and temperature regimes based on the data from yazoo city 5 nne were used in all the simulations below except when exploring different climate scenarios see next section 2 3 5 climate change scenarios to simulate different climate scenarios we varied the most climate sensitive parameters namely the seasonal pattern of air temperature and hence et max t and the rainfall parameters Œª and Œ± as we were interested in understanding the possible effects of global warming we selected two climate change scenarios especially suitable to represent the transition from the current climate toward warmer and more extreme ones the two resulting climate change scenarios intermediate and extreme differ for the extent of these changes their parameters are summarized in table 3 the predicted increase in evaporative demand with increasing temperature was captured by augmenting the observed temperatures in yazoo city 5 nne by 2 and 4 c for the intermediate and extreme scenarios respectively because the temperature dependence of et max is not linear this lead to an increase in et max with respect to the current climate between 5 1 and 4 2 for the intermediate climate and 10 3 and 8 5 for the extreme climate with the biggest increase occurring early in the growing season see supplementary information fig s2 c despite this change in temperature the length of the growing season was maintained unaltered thus leading to a conservative estimate of water demands for irrigation under global warming precipitations are predicted to become less frequent but more intense ipcc 2014 nikulin et al 2011 this is in line with the specific projections for the study area where precipitations are expected to become more variable in the future projection for the period 2041 2070 but with no significant change in the average total amount yasarer et al 2017 to simulate less frequent rainfall events we decreased the average precipitation frequency Œª to simulate on average larger precipitation events we decreased the value of Œ± we kept the product Œª Œ± constant i e assumed constant average cumulated seasonal precipitation given the high uncertainty in the future duration of precipitations the parameter d was not altered 2 3 6 initial conditions and numerical solution because outside of the growing season the evapotranspiration rate is likely low we assume that the pond is full at the beginning of each growing season h 0 h max and that the soil moisture is at the point of incipient stomatal closure s t 0 s the equations are solved via numerical integration via an explicit euler scheme with integration step of 0 005 d to best capture the highly non linear infiltration runoff process despite a sub daily time step the diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration and crop growth are not explicitly modelled rather et max g and Œº are to be interpreted as daily average rates different realizations of the precipitation forcing results in different trajectories of the key model variables the results below are based on the analyses of 3000 numerically simulated trajectories of the key variables they were obtained by generating 3000 precipitation series by extracting the precipitation amounts and the duration of the dry downs from their corresponding distributions eqs 14 and 15 the precipitation time series were then used to force eqs 1 5 10 12 below the results of the simulations are summarized via the average total yield its standard deviation and the likelihood of achieving a certain target yield for completeness we report also the average time at which the water in the pond first falls below the level necessary to perform an irrigation over the entire cultivated area the goal is to evaluate the joint effect of pond size climatic conditions soil type and irrigation strategy on farm productivity and yield stability 3 results 3 1 model dynamics fig 1 shows an example of how the system evolves over time soil moisture fig 1a increases quickly as a result of the unpredictable rainfall events and irrigation applications triggered by s reaching s and occurring provided there is enough water in the pond the irrigation forces soil moisture at or above s throughout the season unless the residual water in the pond is insufficient to perform an irrigation application the pond water level fig 1b quickly increases during precipitation events and declines during the dry down gradually because of evaporative losses and abruptly at each irrigation application no irrigation is applied if the remaining water is insufficient for an irrigation application over the whole cultivated area fig 1b far right in turn s affects plant biomass growth rate and hence the temporal evolution of b t over the entire growing season with reduced relative growth rate when s s fig 1c far right 3 2 role of irrigation strategy fig 2 a b show the average total farm yield y and its standard deviation s y respectively as a function of the fraction of cultivated area a c for different irrigation strategies under the current climate scenario stress avoidance irrigation s s solid line is contrasted to a mild s s 0 08 dashed lines and a severe s s 0 16 dotted lines deficit irrigation in all cases the difference s s was maintained constant i e it was assumed that the irrigation technique remained the same see section 2 3 2 for both stress avoidance and deficit irrigation there is an intermediate value of a c that maximizes the total average yield hereafter denoted as a c thin vertical lines in fig 2a its value depends on the irrigation strategy with increasingly large a c for decreasing s i e transitioning from stress avoidance irrigation to deficit irrigation in other words deficit irrigation smaller values of s needs smaller ponds to achieve the maximum attainable farm yield allowing a larger cultivated area higher values of a c nevertheless in spite of a larger cultivated area deficit irrigation leads to an average total farm yield lower than that of stress avoidance irrigation for all but the largest cultivated fractions indeed stress avoidance irrigation is the most productive irrigation strategy in the absence of water constraints i e for larger ponds because it allows an unrestricted growth rate throughout the growing season see eq 13 when water availability is limited by the pond storage capacity i e for a c a c stress avoidance irrigation cannot be performed over the entire season the average total yields decline to the point of becoming comparable to those obtained via deficit irrigation stress avoidance irrigation also minimizes yield variability for a c a c fig 2b by ensuring that no water stress negatively affects the crop when the pond is large enough to guarantee a stress avoidance irrigation for the entire growing season the yield standard deviation is 0 fig 2b solid line because no disturbance other than potential water stress is considered nevertheless when the water availability is limited by the pond storage capacity i e for a c a c the chosen irrigation strategy cannot be performed over the entire growing season and the crop must rely on the unpredictable precipitation for its water supply under these conditions stress avoidance irrigation can lead to a higher yield variability than deficit irrigation since it implies higher irrigation demands and a faster use of water early in the season and consequently a higher risk of running out of pond water before the end of the growing season this total yield yield stability trade off emerges even more clearly when considering risk minimization as a criterion for pond sizing for stress avoidance irrigation there is a safe interval fig 2 horizontal line but that range of pond sizes do not include that maximizing yields furthermore the implementation of deficit irrigation greatly reduces the width of the safe interval to the point that the safe interval no longer exists for the parameters used in fig 2 even the mild deficit irrigation leads to the disappearance of the safe interval the fraction of cultivated area corresponding to the highest average productivity a c is also the one that on average leads to insufficient water for irrigation in the pond for the first time towards the end of the growing season but not much earlier for the most productive a c the remaining water becomes insufficient for the next irrigation on average 10 20 days before the end of the season see fig 2c regardless of irrigation strategy curves above a c are not smooth because calculations are made assuming that no irrigation application occurs when the residual water in the pond becomes insufficient for a full irrigation application i e when h h min with h min a c 1 a c 1 nz r s s eq 2 as such a small decrease in cultivated area i e a small increase in pond size might not lead to appreciable effects on yield and its stability if the change in a c is insufficient to ensure one additional irrigation application the decrease in a c necessary to ensure an additional irrigation application decreases with decreasing a c because the pond depth for a single irrigation application is proportional to a c 1 a c 1 see eq 10 3 3 role of climatic conditions and soil type focusing on the most productive irrigation strategy on average i e stress avoidance irrigation fig 2a we investigated the effects of a shift in climatic conditions on productivity and its stability for different fractions of cultivated area a c fig 3 for completeness the different climate scenarios table 3 colors in fig 3 are explored for two soil types table 2 cf columns in fig 3 the curves exhibit the same behaviour under all the climatic scenarios with an intermediate value corresponding to the highest average yield vertical thin lines and a range of a c ensuring the desired minimum yield horizontal lines in all the climatic scenarios a c does not fall within the safe interval i e the production maximization and risk minimization criteria lead to divergent results climate change scenarios orange and red lines in fig 3 reduce the most productive fraction of cultivated area a c and the total average yield in the case of a c a c irrespective of soil type fig 3a c furthermore more extreme climates can result in a higher yield variability for fractions of cultivated areas above a c although not for extremely high a c fig 3b d because of these changes in average yield and its variability the climatic conditions affect also the safe interval its upper end is reduced as the climate becomes more extreme despite the unaltered average precipitation total this is due to the less uniform precipitation distribution and the higher evapotranspiration rate and hence faster soil water depletion assumed in the climate change scenarios table 3 finer soils slightly increase the most productive fraction of cultivated area a c and the width of the safe interval in particular under current climatic conditions cfr fig 3 a and c these shifts are the results of the lower infiltration capacity of finer soils and hence enhanced pond water recharge 3 4 role of farmer s preferences the definition of the safe interval is based on two subjective parameters the desired minimum yield y Àá and the minimum probability of achieving such yield p r Àá the results in fig 2 and 3 are based on a strong risk minimization criterion where a relatively low desired minimum yield equivalent to 80 of maximum attainable yield must be obtained in all years p r Àá 1 we relax this last requirement in fig 4 considering also cases in which the desired minimum yield is obtained with p r Àá 1 i e assuming a weak risk minimization criterion the safe interval widens when decreasing the desired minimum yields y Àá reduced in fig 4 and desired minimum probability levels p r Àá lightening gray shades in fig 4 the lower end of the safe interval is affected solely by the desired minimum yield conversely its upper end is the result of the interplay between both minimum yield and minimum probability of that yield lower y Àá and p r Àá increase the upper bound of the safe interval for p r Àá 1 i e for a weak risk minimization criterion the fraction of cultivated land that maximizes the average yield a c falls inside the safe interval i e it is possible to select a pond size that maximizes the production and minimizes the risks 4 discussion 4 1 implications of modelling assumptions the proposed model describes the coupled dynamics of soil moisture crop development and pond water storage table 1 based on few parameters with clear physical meaning table 2 and 3 because the model follows step by step the crop development during the growing season it is especially suitable to explore the dependence of crop yields on precipitation timing and the evolution of stored water availability this allows comparing the outcomes of climatic scenarios differing just in precipitation timing and intensity but not in average totals furthermore the model allows determining the most suitable size for the on farm pond for different farmer s risk coping attitude an aspect less often considered when sizing irrigation infrastructure and in general discussing water management solutions the model results rest on some assumptions first crop development can be subject to limitations other than water availability and damaging events other than dry spells can further reduce yields as such the yield estimates reported above are to be interpreted as potential yields second the results presented are obtained assuming a closed system i e that the on farm pond is recharged only by on farm runoff currently in the lower mississippi river basin ponds might rely on larger collection areas i e on off farm inflows omer et al 2018 a closed system represents the worst case scenario and a fully sustainable system indeed a larger water collection area can reduce the pond size needed because of the faster recharge during storms nevertheless the reduction in pond size will not be proportional to the collection area the pond needs to be of a size such that it can store sufficient water to cope with typical dry spells during which by definition no pond recharge occurs finally it is assumed that thanks to the winter precipitation at the beginning of the main growing season soil moisture is at the point of incipient stomatal closure s t 0 s and the pond is completely full h t 0 h max particularly dry winters and springs might reduce the initial soil and pond water content thus enhancing the need for irrigation and the likelihood of the pond emptying under prolonged dry spells in climates or locations when dry off seasons are the norm or when the off season recharge is uncertain due to a large interannual variability in precipitation totals on farm ponds might need to be sized to store the water necessary for more than one growing season the model could be adjusted to this case by considering different initial soil moistures and water depths in the pond these initial conditions could also be extracted from suitable probability distributions to mimic the role of large interannual variability to facilitate the exploration of precipitation scenarios a minimalist precipitation model is employed the current climate is parameterized with daily meteorological data in the region a comparison of the distribution of observed intervals between rainfall events and event depths with the assumed theoretical distributions eqs 14 and 15 lends support to this minimalist description of precipitation supplementary information fig s1 moreover model runs with observed precipitation lead to qualitatively similar results although it is not possible to run more than 67 simulations corresponding to the years for data are available so that the definition of the safe interval is more uncertain data at subdaily time scales have limited temporal coverage in the region thus not permitting a similar comparison including also the precipitation duration nevertheless a sensitivity analysis on the duration of precipitation events d showed that this parameter plays a secondary role when maintained within realistic values for the region robinson and henderson 1992 brommer et al 2013 hence its choice and the fact that the duration of precipitation events is assumed to be fixed do not remarkably affect our results and conclusions the model is parameterized for corn a crop common in the region with intermediate water demands between the other two common crops there i e soybean glycine max and cotton gossypium hirsutum kebede et al 2014 similar patterns as those presented above are obtained for other crop although the most suitable fractions of cultivated land for production maximization and risk minimization could change crops with higher water requirements like cotton could result in a faster depletion of water stored in the soil thus enhancing the irrigation requirements and potentially reducing the runoff during precipitation events as such more water demanding crops would result in a shift of the cultivated fraction corresponding to the highest average yields towards lower values a similar shift is to be expected under conditions leading to higher maximum evapotranspiration rates 4 2 comparison with existing on farm ponds in the mississippi river alluvial valley the recommended ratio of cultivated area to reservoir area is currently 13 1 to 16 1 meaning that every 13 16 ha of cropped area would require a 1 ha reservoir these ratios correspond to a c between 13 14 0 93 and 16 17 0 94 these empirical ratios are based on an average irrigation demand of around 0 3 m per growing season and a 2 4 m depth of a typical pond rodrigue 2019 thus based on this design a full reservoir could supply between two thirds if 13 1 and one half if 16 1 of the average irrigation demand for a growing season i e within season runoff must fully recharge the pond at least once the water supply provided by the pond size identified through our model is very similar to these recommendations under current climates and stress avoidance irrigation the most productive fraction of cultivated area is around 0 92 corresponding to a cultivated area to pond ratio of 11 5 1 the similarity in resulting pond sizes for maximum productivity lends support to our modelling approach and parameterization the fact that these values are lower than the recommended ones can be ascribed to the assumption of no off farm contribution to the pond recharge and the focus on the main growing season only yet the comparison with existing ponds also shows that for system that are efficient in capturing the superficial runoff and storing it in the on farm pond the need for off farm flows is rather small as such on farm pond systems can remain a feasible approach also should their use become widespread in an agricultural district moreover these results show that recommended on farm ponds match the most suitable pond size for production maximization but are smaller then those within the safe interval future climates are expected to require a reduction in a c and thus a shift towards cultivated to pond area ratios smaller than the currently recommended ratios another potential reason explaining differences between current recommendation and the model results is that ponds are generally not designed for single crops but rather for a combination of them as different crops may be cultivated over the land serviced by the pond in different years we note however that corn has an intermediate water demand between two other crops common in the region cotton and soybean and was chosen in the effort of capturing the average crop water use rice is also cultivated in the region but it is not the prevalent crop kebede et al 2014 4 3 implications for on farm pond sizing production maximization vs risk minimization regardless of climatic conditions and soil texture the average total yields y increase gradually with increasing fraction of cultivated area until the fraction leading to the maximum productivity a c for even larger a c average yields sharply decline and yield variability increases this asymmetric response suggests that when comparing two ponds that differ by the same amount from the one corresponding to the highest productivity one larger one smaller than a c the oversized pond is preferable to the undersized one an oversized pond implies a reduction of the cultivated area and consequently a loss in productivity but an undersized pond and hence a possible insufficient water availability leads to much sharper losses in terms of yields and increases in yield variability an oversized pond also corresponds to being further away from the safe interval different criteria for pond sizing lead to divergent solutions i e the fraction of cultivated land for production maximization does not fall within the range of cultivated land that minimizes the risk of not achieving the desirable minimum yield consequently a farmer has to choose between being prudent i e minimizing the risk of a low yield in certain years or maximizing the average crop if they choose to maximize the average crop they must expect that during some years the final crop will be lower than the desired minimum yield y Àá more in general a trade off emerges between average yield and yield stability two of the pillars of food security the production maximisation and risk minimization criteria can be reconciled only if a certain probability of not reaching the desirable minimum yield i e if p r Àá 1 is considered acceptable stress avoidance irrigation is the most productive strategy on average under most cultivated areas a result in line with brasil and medeiros 2018 furthermore the width of the safe interval is drastically reduced under deficit irrigation to the point that the safe interval no longer exist making this strategy unsuitable for more prevident farmers finally under climate change scenarios namely with higher evapotranspiration rates and with less frequent but more intense precipitation events the maximum average yields declines and requires a larger area devoted to the pond the safe interval becomes narrower fig 3 hence even just a change in rainfall pattern without a change in rainfall total accompanied by an increase in evapotranspiration rates will require a revision of the recommended cultivated to pond area ratios according to our results to maximize the average yield ratios will need to be of 8 1 1 to 10 5 1 depending on the soil type and extent of change in climatic conditions a sharp reduction with respect to the current practice of 13 1 to 16 1 similar patterns emerge when considering future rainfall scenarios involving also a decline in average total seasonal precipitation not shown 5 conclusions irrigation can stabilize yields but this positive effect often comes at the cost of overexploitation of groundwater resources where allowed by local regulations on farm water collection and storage in small ponds have the potential to mitigate the effects of dry spells on crop productivity in a more sustainable way allowing irrigation based on renewable water resources yet the sizing of the on farm pond is not trivial because of the cascading effects of the unpredictability of precipitation events currently ponds are mostly sized based on local empirical ratios which however could become obsolete under future more extreme climates and do not allow to consider the farmer s preferences when coping with uncertainty we developed a minimalist model capturing the coupled dynamics of plant available water on farm pond water storage and crop development and final yield requiring few physically based parameters the model was calibrated for the lower mississippi river basin a region where groundwater levels are plummeting as a result of water abstractions for irrigation nevertheless its applicability is general the model was used to identify the most suitable irrigation strategy and pond size according to two criteria production maximization and risk minimization thus taking into account the farmer s preferences and risk coping attitude different climatic scenarios soil textures irrigation strategies and farmer s preferences were considered results relative to current climates for production maximization are comparable with the practice in the region thus lending support to our approach the model helps in understanding how the effectiveness of a pond is affected by different factors such as climate soil texture and irrigation strategy when compared to deficit irrigation stress avoidance irrigation maximizes yields but increases its variability for small ponds moreover it can be difficult to reconcile the goal of maximizing average production with that minimizing the risk of low yields unless a certain level of risk is considered acceptable by the farmer finally even if not involving a decline in average precipitation totals future more extreme conditions are expected to lead in lower average maximum yields the need for larger ponds to maximize yields and a narrower set of pond sizes for risk minimization the model provides the foundation for analysing management trade offs under stochastic precipitation for a variety of increasingly complex risk mitigation strategies explicitly considering the farmer s preferences its simplicity allows easy applicability across systems also when lacking detailed information on the water capture and storage systems crop physiology and weather data credit authorship
