19015,poly aluminum chloride pac an inorganic coagulant being accumulated in waste activated sludge was at substantial levels are generally thought to inhibit was anaerobic fermentation however its effect on dark fermentative hydrogen accumulation has not been documented this work therefore aimed to explore its effect on hydrogen accumulation and to elucidate the mechanism of how pac affects hydrogen accumulation experimental results showed that with an increase of pac addition from 0 to 20 mg al per gram of total suspended solids tss the maximal hydrogen yield from alkaline fermentation ph 9 5 increased from 20 9 ml to 27 4 ml per gram volatile suspended solids vss under the standard condition further increase of pac to 30 mg al g tss didn t cause a significant increase of hydrogen yield p 0 05 the mechanism explorations revealed that although pac reduced the total short chain fatty acid scfa production this reduction was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type which did not contribute hydrogen production pac suppressed all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation to some extents but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production illumina miseq sequencing analysis revealed that pac did not affect the populations of scfa and hydrogen producers but the two hydrogen consumers acetoanaerobium and desulfobulbus were almost washed out by pac among the three types of al species present in the anaerobic fermentation systems ala monomeric species significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential while alb medium polymer species and alc species of sol or gel posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge treatment pac dark fermentation hydrogen production 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a byproduct of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its numerous amount and potentially environmental risk the treatment and disposal of was is becoming a big problem faced by wwtps nowadays an et al 2018 wang et al 2018c 2018d generally the cost of was treatment and disposal accounts for up to 60 of the total operating cost of a wwtp li et al 2018 yang et al 2019 at the same time was contains substantial organics such as proteins and polysaccharides which can be reused to compensate a partial cost of wwtps operation through fermenting or digesting was anaerobically to produce hydrogen short chain fatty acids or methane hu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018 hydrogen is known as a clean renewable energy source and widely considered the most promising alternative to fossil fuels because its product of oxidation with oxygen is only h2o and it has a high energy yield 142 35 kj g with its energy yield being 2 75 times greater than that of any hydrocarbons ginkel and sung 2001 therefore much attention has been recently attracted to obtain hydrogen production from was by which was is stabilized reduced and reused fossil fuels are saved and greenhouse gas emission is reduced liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018b hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation includes several stages such as disintegration of sludge particulates hydrolysis of solubilized organics acidification of hydrolyzed products with hydrogen generation as a metabolic intermediate hydrogen produced can be further consumed by several anaerobes including methanogens acetogens and sulfate reducers to produce methane acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide via methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes wang et al 2019a usually the hydrogen yield of anaerobic fermentation is rather low due to the low was disintegration hydrolysis efficiency and the rapid consumption of generated h2 massanet nicolau et al 2008 thus most of previous studies focused on improving hydrogen yield through increasing was disintegration hydrolysis and or reducing the activity of hydrogen consumers wang et al 2018b for example zhao et al observed that the maximal hydrogen yield of 26 9 ml g vss was obtained at constant ph 10 which was 47 8 higher than that at initial ph 10 with its final fermentation ph being at 7 3 zhao et al 2010 wang et al found that the presence of 254 mg l initial free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents and inhibited the activity of hydrogen consumers resulting in a 1 14 fold increase in hydrogen yield wang et al 2018b wang et al demonstrated that with an increase of nitrite from 0 to 250 mg l the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 8 5 to 15 0 ml g vss at ph 5 5 fermentation and 8 1 13 0 ml g vss at ph 6 fermentation wang et al 2018e apart from the major composition such as proteins and carbohydrates was also contains lots of other substances such as persistent organic pollutants heavy metals and flocculants either present in sewage or being added in wastewater treatment and was treatment processes an et al 2017 park et al 2006 xu et al 2017 yi et al 2017 previous investigations showed that these substances affected biogas production from anaerobic fermentation or digestion of was as well cho et al demonstrated that 20 and 0 5 mg l cd and zn both enhanced hydrogen production but further increase of cd and zn to 40 and 1 mg l caused decreases in hydrogen yield from 108 2 ml g cod to 82 3 and 104 5 ml g cod respectively cho and lee 2011 poly aluminum chloride pac which is made by partial hydrolysis of acid aluminum chloride solution using a specific reactor is an inorganic coagulant and generally consists of al monomers such as al3 al oh 2 and dimer al2 oh 2 4 trimer al3 oh 4 5 al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 7 12 and inert large polymer with molecular weight normally larger than 3000 da gao et al 2005 on the basis of the kinetic difference of reactions between ferron reagent 8 hydroxy 7 iodo 5 quinoline sulfonic acid with different hydrolyzed species the chemical species of hydrolyzed aluminum can be divided into three types monomeric species ala instantaneously reacted i e al monomers dimer and trimer medium polymer species alb reacted within 120 min i e al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 7 12 and species of sol or gel alc no reaction i e al polymer molecular weight normally larger than 3000 da hu et al 2006 due to the presence of these high charged poly nuclear aluminum hydrolysis products pac is superior than the traditional al based coagulants e g alcl3 and al2 so4 3 for particulate and or organic matter removal yan et al 2008b pac has been applied in water and wastewater treatment and was dewatering widely throughout the world since the 1980s jiang 2001 matsui et al 2003 mertens et al 2012 the widespread use of the pac inevitably led to its massive accumulation in was it was documented that al content in was 0 7 13 4 mg al g in seville spain solis et al 2002 3 4 mg al g in hong kong china guan et al 2005 and 0 7 26 8 mg al g in carolina in usa park et al 2006 in dewatered was however al concentration could achieve at 104 320 mg al g in usa park et al 2006 due to its large accumulation in sludge the influence of pac on was anaerobic fermentation process has attracted a large amount of concerns in the past several efforts were carried out to examine the potential impact of pac on short chain fatty acid scfa or methane yield from was anaerobic fermentation or digestion chen et al found that with the increase of pac addition from 0 to 40 mg al per gram of total suspended solids tss short chain fatty acid scfa yield decreased from 212 2 to 138 4 mg cod g volatile suspended solids vss chen et al 2018 lin et al reported that compared with the control 24 mg al l pac decreased scfa yield from sewage sludge by 35 0 from 347 5 to 220 8 mg cod g vss and meanwhile the specific hydrolysis rate constant for sludge fermentation decreased from 0 0321 to 0 017 d 1 lin et al 2017 kim and jung found that 46 mg al l pac caused a decrease in scfa production from synthetic substrate by more than 10 kim and chung 2015 chen et al observed that pac at 30 mg al g tss level suppressed the methanogenesis process by 93 8 chen et al 2018 all of these previous studies showed that the presence of pac in was had negative effects on the production of scfa or methane from anaerobic fermentation or digestion of was considering that sludge pac content was accumulated at substantial levels in many areas e g 26 8 mg al g tss in some wwtps of carolina in usa park et al 2006 this severe suppression largely diminished the value of the anaerobic digestion or fermentation despite the significant progresses performed in the past the effect of pac on dark fermentative hydrogen accumulation from was has not been documented before the purpose of this work was therefore to deeply understand how pac affects hydrogen accumulation from was dark fermentation firstly the effect of pac at different levels ranging from 0 to 30 mg al g tss on hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation was investigated then the mechanisms of how pac affects hydrogen production were explored finally the contributions of different aluminum species i e ala alb and alc to hydrogen production were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sources of was and pac to minimize the background of pac in sludge the was used in this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtps in changsha china where pac based wastewater pretreatment was not implemented before use the raw sludge was filtered by stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and concentrated by setting at 4 c for 24 h the main characteristics of the concentrated was are as follows ph 6 8 0 1 tss 18 0 0 3 g l vss 11 9 0 2 g l soluble chemical oxygen demand cod 105 2 3 2 mg l total cod 14 4 0 3 g l total proteins 8 0 0 3 g cod l total carbohydrates 1 3 0 1 g cod l pac used in this study was purchased from chemical industry park jiangsu china and it contains 30 of al2o3 2 2 batch experiment for hydrogen production from sludge anaerobic fermentation in the presence of pac at different levels in this experiment five serum bottles were conducted as anaerobic fermenters each of them was first fed with 250 ml of concentrated sludge and then different volumes of pac solution 0 1 mol al l were added into those bottles resulting in the sludge pac level of 0 5 10 20 or 30 mg al g tss it should be emphasized that these preselected set point data did not include the al background value in raw sludge the mixture volume of each bottle was added to 300 ml with deionized water before being mixed at a speed of 250 rpm for 2 min oxygen in all the bottles was removed from the headspace by sparging nitrogen gas for 5 min after that all the bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 37 1 c since alkaline condition was reported to be beneficial to hydrogen production and benefited to identify the potential contributions of different al species to hydrogen production wang et al 2019b yan et al 2008b the ph value in all the bottles was controlled at 9 5 1 by adding 4m hcl or 4m naoh during the whole fermentation period it should be noted that no extra inoculum was added into these fermentation reactors and therefore was used for both substrate and inoculum in this study 2 3 long term operation of semi continuous fermenters for the analysis of the microbial community in order to further understand the influence of pac on dark fermentation two long term semi continuous fermenters were carried out for microbial analyses the two fermenters were replicate with a working volume of 1 l each and placed in a temperature controlled shaker 37 1 c 120 rpm one fermenter was fed with 700 ml was without pac addition and set as the control the other fermenter was fed with 700 ml was containing 30 mg al g tss pac and set as the experimental reactor the other fermentation conditions such as fermentation ph temperature and rpm were the same as described in section 2 2 according to the results obtained from section 2 2 the sludge retention time in the two reactors were controlled at 7 d as a result 100 ml of fermentation mixture was removed from each reactor every day and replaced by the same amount of raw was either with or without pac addition both the reactors were sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen before they were re capped and re sealed hydrogen yield reached a stable level after approximately 50 d operation and then the assay of the microbial community was performed using illumina miseq sequencing 2 4 evaluating the effects of pac on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis hydrogenotrophic methonogenesis and sulfate reducing processes sludge dark fermentation generally contains several processes such as solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes which affect hydrogen accumulation significantly the rate of sludge solubilization the major rate limiting process in sludge dark fermentation is often assessed by measuring the concentrations of organics e g proteins and carbohydrates released in fermentation liquor xu et al 2017 and the data can be measured in the batch tests performed in section 2 2 the rates of other processes however are generally evaluated by batch tests using model substrates in the literature wang et al 2018a in the following set of batch tests therefore 20 replicate reactors with a working volume of 1 0 l each were performed these reactors were divided into four tests test ⅰ test ⅱ test ⅲ and test ⅳ with five in each all the tests lasted for 3 d during which the variation of the added substrate in each fermenter was determined the volumetric degradation rates of the added substrates were measured through linear regression of the corresponding concentration profile the vss concentration in each fermenter was measured at the end of the test the biomass specific degradation rate of the added substrate in each fermenter was then calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rate by the vss concentration the effect of pac on these bioprocesses could be indicated by comparing the specific degradation rates of the substrates among the fermenters with different pac additions test ⅰ this test was used to evaluate the impact of pac on hydrolysis process in this test each reactor received 540 ml synthetic wastewater and 60 ml fermented sludge mixture as inocula the inocula were withdrawn from the experimental reactor operated in section 2 3 the synthetic wastewater contains 1 23 g dextran average molecular weight 20 000 a model polysaccharide compound l among these reactors one was set as the control without addition of any chemical the other four were fed with pac at different levels with their levels being equal to the 5 10 20 and 30 mg al g tss reactors performed in section 2 2 the operational conditions were the same as those described in section 2 2 test ⅱ the test was used to assess the impact of pac on acidogenesis process the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as described in test i except that the fermentation substrate dextran in synthetic wastewater was replaced by glucose a model monosaccharide compound test ⅲ this test was utilized to evaluate the impact of pac on acetogenesis process the operational procedure of this experiment was conducted the same as that depicted in test ⅰ except that the fermentation substrate in synthetic wastewater was replaced by 5 g l n butyric test ⅳ this test was utilized to evaluate the impact of pac on hydrogen consumption process each reactor first received 540 ml synthetic medium containing 1 g l so4 2 and 60 ml fermented sludge mixture as inocula except for one reactor i e the control without addition of any chemical different volumes of pac solution were added into the other four reactors leading to the al content in the four reactors equal to the 5 10 20 and 30 mg al g tss reactors performed in section 2 2 all these reactors were then flushed with a combined gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to guarantee that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas finally all the reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at stirring speed of 120 rpm 2 5 identifying the contributions of different al species to the enhancement of hydrogen production as introduced above the chemical species of hydrolyzed aluminum can be divided into three types ala i e al monomers dimer and trimer alb i e al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 12 and alc i e al polymermolecular weight normally larger than 3000 da these three species of al might have different contributions to sludge fermentation thus their potential contributions to the enhancement of hydrogen production required to be identified in this test pac with different species distributions were either purchased from commercially available products or prepared using laboratory alkalinity titration method at 60 c briefly a calculated amount of 0 5 mol l alcl3 6h2o solution was first transferred into a 300 ml jar under rapid stirring and then the solution was titrated slowly with 0 5 mol l naoh using a peristaltic pump the amount of naoh added varied with the target oh al molar ratio simplified as b values pac10 and pac25 oh al molar ratio with 1 0 and 2 5 respectively the final concentrations of all the pac solutions are 0 1 mol al l the speciation of the different pacs solutions at ph 9 5 which was determined by the ferron method is shown in table 1 table s1 presents the relevant data under ph uncontrolled condition to assess the contributions of these different al species to hydrogen production in dark fermentation the synthetic wastewater containing bsa 5 32 g l and dextran 1 23 g l was used the operation and al concentration in this test were the same as described in test i 2 6 model based analysis hydrogen production was simulated by the modified gompertz equation eq 1 lay et al 1999 and kinetic parameters hm maximum hydrogen yield potential

t 1 the correlation between hydrogen production and different al species was modeled based on the experimental data using matlab the matlab mathworks inc natick ma function lsqcurvefit was used to find the parameter values that resulted in the best fit between the models used and the experiment data 2 7 analytical methods cod tss vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 soluble proteins and carbohydrates were determined by the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard and the anthrone sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard respectively herbert et al 1971 lowry et al 1951 the cod conversion coefficients are 1 5 g cod g proteins and 1 06 g cod g carbohydrates wang et al 2018a the sulfate detection was based on bacro4 so2 4 precipitate using spectrophotometer analysis hydrogen sulfide was measured by methylene blue spectrophotometric method according to the method reported previously su and zhao 2013 the composition in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector according to the method documented in the literature wang et al 2018a the concentration of scfas measured with agilent 6890n gc equipped with flame ionization detector and the detailed method was provided in supporting information the total scfas were calculated as the sum of the measured acetic propionic n butyric iso butyric n valeric and iso valeric acid xu et al 2018 illumina miseq sequencing analysis was used to evaluate the diversity of the microbial community in the two long term semi continuous fermenters during stable operation the fermentation samples were withdrawn from the two fermenters and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm then the total genomic dna was extracted from the samples using the fast dna kit mobio laboratories according to the operating manual the quantity and purity of dna were analyzed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de usa the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat were used to target the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s dna genes the dna samples were analyzed for illumina miseq sequencing illumina miseq pf300 platform the measurement of ala alb and alc was conducted according to the ferron method documented in the literature wang et al 2004 briefly the ferron solution was obtained by mixing reagent a 0 2 ferron b 20 w w ch3coona and c 1 9 v v hcl according to a ratio of 2 5 2 1 during speciation experiments 5 50 ml of the mixed reagent was transferred into 25 ml graduated glass tube and then a certain amount of the sample was added into the glass tube and quickly diluted to 25 ml by distilled water after mixing the sample was quickly added to a 1 cm glass cuvette the timed absorbance measurements at 366 nm using a shimadzu uv 2800 spectrophotometer were carried out after 1 min and 120 min it was operationally divided that the first 1min absorbance was thought as ala and 1 min 120 min absorbance was supposed as alb alc was obtained by al total minus ala and alb wang et al 2004 2 8 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogen production in the presence of pac at different levels fig 1 a shows the cumulative curve of hydrogen production from was dark fermentation in the presence of pac at different levels under alkaline condition ph 9 5 in the initial 6 d hydrogen production from was without pac addition increased gradually and no significant increase was found after that time p 0 05 see table s2 for statistical analysis the maximal hydrogen yield and optimal fermentation time were respectively 20 9 ml g vss and 6 d for was without pac addition which were comparable to the data reported previously wang et al 2018b similar trend of hydrogen production was also observed for other was with pac addition fig 1a and table s2 all of the previous investigations demonstrated that the presence of pac in was had negative effects on scfa or methane production chen et al 2018 kim and chung 2015 lin et al 2017 in this work however it was found that the presence of pac enhanced rather than reduced hydrogen yield from was dark fermentation fig 1a with an increase of pac content from 0 to 20 mg al g tss the maximal hydrogen yield significantly increased from 20 9 to 27 4 ml g vss p 0 05 see table s3 further increase of pac content to 30 mg al g tss caused a slight increase in hydrogen production but it should be noted that this increase was considered statistically insignificant p 0 05 see table s4 this hydrogen yield i e 27 4 ml g vss at 20 mg al g tss was comparable with that obtained from was alkaline fermentation at constant ph 10 26 9 ml g vss and was higher than that obtained from was acidic fermentation for example wang et al 2018d demonstrated that the maximal hydrogen yield of 8 5 ml g vss was achieved from anaerobic fermentation at ph 5 5 and this value increased to 15 ml g vss when 250 mg l nitrite was added in the fermenter massanet nicolau et al 2008 found that when sewage sludge and inoculum sludge with a ratio of 9 1 was respectively pretreated at 70 c for 60 min and 110 c for 20 min the maximal hydrogen yield of 18 14 ml g dried sludge was achieved from acidic ph 5 5 fermentation although the maximal hydrogen production rate determined in this work was lower than that reported by massanet nicolau et al 2008 0 33 vs 2 21 ml g vss h table s5 it should be emphasized that no extra inoculum was used in our work whereas 10 of inoculum and 75 unit l cellulase were employed by massanet nicolau et al 2008 the hydrogen production rate determined in this work was comparable to that determined in other studies without inoculum addition table s5 to further understand the impact of pac on dark fermentation the modified gompertz equation was employed to fit the experimental data obtained fig 1a three kinetic parameters i e maximum hydrogen yield potential hm hydrogen production rate rm and lag phase time λ were determined fig 1a and table 2 it can be seen that pac prolonged lag phase time λ slightly however with the increase of pac addition maximum hydrogen yield potential hm and hydrogen production rate rm increased significantly p 0 05 see table s6 indicating that the addition of pac enhanced not only biochemical hydrogen potential but also hydrogen production rate further investigation showed that the maximum hydrogen yield potential increased exponentially with pac addition increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss fig 1b all the results showed that the presence of pac at pertinent levels enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen yield in the following text the mechanism of how pac enhances hydrogen yield was explored 3 2 mechanism of how pac enhances hydrogen yield several processes i e sludge disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis involved in was dark fermentation are closely relevant to hydrogen production sludge disintegration and hydrolysis provide substrates for hydrogen producers while hydrogen is produced directly in the processes of acidogenesis and acetogenesis however it was previously reported that the presence of pac restrained sludge disintegration hydrolysis and acidogenesis probably due to its physical enmeshment chen et al 2018 and this was also confirmed by the data obtained in this work fig s1 and table 3 besides it was found that the specific degradation rate of butyrate decreased with the addition of pac table 3 suggesting that pac suppressed acetogenesis as well all these evidences indicated that the presence of pac might affect negatively hydrogen production thus one might want to know why the enhanced hydrogen yield was measured in the pac added fermenters as expected the presence of pac decreased total scfa yield the higher the pac addition the lower the total scfa yields fig 2 a however hydrogen production is closely relevant to the fraction of individual scfa i e fermentation type rather than total scfa for example when 1 mol butyric acid or acetic acid is produced from glucose fermentation 1 mol or 2 mol hydrogen will be generated eqs 2 and 3 whereas no hydrogen is produced when the fermentation type becomes propionic acid one eq 4 2 c6h12o6 2h2o ch3ch2ch2coo 2hco 3 3h 2h2 3 c6h12o6 4h2o 2ch3coo 2hco 3 4h 4h2 4 1 5c6h12o6 2ch3ch2coo 4h hco 3 fig 2b shows the distribution of individual scfa in the presence of different pac addition there were no significant differences in the concentrations of n butyric acid isobutyric acid n valeric acid and isovaleric acid among the fermenters p 0 05 see table s7 with an increase of pac addition from 0 to 30 mg al g tss propionic acid and acidic acid decreased from 167 2 to 300 6 to 54 7 and 231 6 mg cod l respectively further calculation exhibited that the percentage of propionic acid to total scfa decreased from 26 2 to 11 7 with pac increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss in comparison the corresponding percentage of butyric acid to total scfa increased from 21 5 to 28 8 no significant variation was found in the percentage of acetic acid to total scfa among the fermenters p 0 05 see table s8 cod mass balance analysis showed that with an increase of pac addition from 0 to 30 mg al g tss the percentages of vss and h2 increased from 75 32 1 20 and 0 46 0 02 to 83 69 3 08 and 0 61 0 02 respectively while the percentage of total scfa and propionic acid decreased from 7 40 0 15 and 1 94 0 02 to 5 46 0 14 and 0 64 0 02 respectively table s9 these facts showed that although total scfa yield was inhibited by pac this inhibition was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type which did not contribute hydrogen production this suggested that hydrogen production was not affected largely by pac though the acidogenesis was inhibited as an intermediate of dark fermentation hydrogen produced can be readily bio converted to methane hydrogen sulfide or acetate by hydrogen consumers such as methanogens sulfate reducers and acetogens which also affects hydrogen yield therefore we compared the inhibition of pac to hydrogen consumption processes with that to hydrogen production processes table 3 and please see fig s2 for calculation details it can be seen that the specific degradation rates of dextran glucose and butyrate in the blank were 337 6 17 0 337 8 11 9 and 60 0 2 0 mg g vss d respectively these values could be considered the original activities of microbes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis respectively in the fermenter with 30 mg al g tss pac addition the specific degradation rates of dextran glucose and butyrate decreased to 146 9 4 5 192 9 7 9 and 34 3 1 1 mg g vss d respectively this indicated that 30 mg al g tss pac addition decreased the relative activity expressed as of the original of hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis microbes by 56 5 42 9 and 42 9 respectively however the degradation rate of hydrogen decreased from 4 8 0 2 to 0 4 0 1 mg g vss d when pac concentration increased from 0 to 30 mg al g tss suggesting that 30 mg al g tss pac addition decreased the relative activity of hydrogen consumers by 92 6 similar observations were also made at other pac dosages the facts revealed that although pac inhibited all the microbial processes to some extents its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production which is one major reason for pac enhancing hydrogen yield hydrogen produced in fermentation process could be mainly consumed by homoacetogenesis sulfate reducing or hydrogenotrophic methonogenesis process it can be further seen from table 3 that the specific degradation rate of sulfate in the absence of pac was 22 1 1 3 mg g vss d whereas the corresponding value in the presence of 5 10 20 and 30 mg al g tss of pac addition was respectively 19 1 0 8 14 6 1 1 12 6 0 3 and 6 8 0 5 mg g vss d indicating that the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria decreased by 13 4 33 8 43 0 and 69 4 respectively this deduction could be further supported by cod mass balance analysis the percentage of h2s decreased from 0 010 0 001 to 0 002 0 001 with pac content increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss table s9 it is known that hydrogen and carbon dioxide could be bio converted into methane and acetate through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis respectively as acetate produced by homoacetogenesis could be also bio converted into methane through acetotrophic methanogenesis we failed to differentiate the accurate inhibition of pac to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis at this stage through the intervention of exogenous co2 and h2 into anaerobic digestion liu et al 2016 found that the increased h2 partial pressure was accompanied with the change of h2 consumption pathway the determined kinetic parameters revealed that homoacetogenesis contributed only 2 5 of the h2 consumption indicating that hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenesis could be negligible in ordinary anaerobic processes liu et al 2016 however further efforts are required to be performed in the future the results above demonstrated clearly that the severe inhibition of pac to hydrogen consumption was one major reason for the enhanced hydrogen yield thus the question as to why pac severely suppressed the process required to be further discussed hydrogen consumption is highly dependent on the activities of several enzymes according to the report the key enzymes involved in hydrogen consumption are codh carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acs acetyl coa synthase and aps reductase adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase with all of them being iron sulfur proteins with fe as a key part ragsdale and pierce 2008 wang et al 2018b codh is one homodimeric enzyme that contains five metal clusters including two c clusters two b clusters and a bridging d cluster as diagrammed the b cluster and the d cluster are typical 4fe 4s 2 1 clusters that bridge the two subunits the c cluster is a 3fe 4s cluster that is bridged to a binuclear nife site in which the iron in the binuclear cluster is bridged to a his ligand ragsdale and pierce 2008 acs consists of a 4fe 4s cluster that is bridged via a cysteine residue to a ni site aps reductase also contains a 4fe 4s cluster that executes electron transport and redox catalysis properties fig 3 zheng et al 2009 when pac is present in fermentation systems substantial al is inevitably released as al and fe share numerous common physicochemical features al can readily substitute for fe especially in environments where the former is easily accessible the substitution of fe by al leads to the generation of an oxidative environment on one hand the free fe can react in the biological milieu via the fenton reaction to create a variety of reactive oxygen species that can indeed initiate numerous cellular dysfunctions on the other hand the exposure to al results in the loss of the fe s cluster integrity lemire et al 2010 as a result al is often observed to cause a dysfunctional fe homeostasis and impede fe based proteins enzymes to function in an effective manner fig 3 morgan and redgrave 1998 perez et al 1999 it is known that codh and acs are key enzymes responsible for hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenesis ragsdale and pierce 2008 while aps reductase is a key enzyme involved in the pathways of sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation in the biological sulfur cycle zheng et al 2009 it can be understood why the presence of pac suppressed severely the hydrogen consumption process 3 3 identifying the effect of different al species on hydrogen production as mentioned above the chemical species of hydrolyzed pac can be divided into three types ala instantaneously reacted i e al momomers dimer and trimer alb reacted within 120min i e al13 alo4a12 oh 24 h2o 7 12 and alc no reaction i e al polymer molecular weight normally larger than 3000 da these different species of al might have different effect on sludge dark fermentation thus their respective impacts on hydrogen yield were also identified in this work the three types of al species are generally co existed in solutions and solution ph has a significant effect on the species transformation depending mainly on oh al ratio denoted as b value yan et al 2007 the pac at low b ratios showed significant changes of species under different ph conditions while pac at high b ratios exhibited efficient speciation stability and tended to maintain the original speciation distribution yan et al 2007 in this work therefore to identify the effect of the different al species on sludge dark fermentation adding different types of al based chemicals to the same synthetic wastewater was performed under alkaline condition i e ph 9 5 as shown in table 1 the hydrogen yield from these fermenters at different fermentation times was presented in table s10 supporting information hydrogen yield in the control without any al chemical addition was low e g 64 2 ml at 96 h table s10 with alcl3 addition cumulative hydrogen yield at 96 h increased gradually from 64 2 ml 0 mg al g tss to 201 0 ml 40 mg al g tss while the corresponding value increased from 64 2 ml to 199 4 ml with the pac10 addition increased from 0 to 40 mg al g tss table s10 although hydrogen yield increased with the increase of pac25 concentration from 0 to 20 mg al g tss 153 9 ml further increase pac25 content to 40 mg al g tss caused a decrease of hydrogen yield to 117 0 ml similar observations were also made on other fermentation days table s10 to further understand the impact of al species on dark fermentation the modified gompertz equation was employed to fit the experimental data presented in table s10 fig s3 and the determined kinetic parameters i e hm rm and λ were shown in table s11 it can be seen that the correlation between hm and alb or alc was not strong figss 4a 2 and 4 a 3 while hm increased linearly with the increase of ala content figss 4a 1 r2 0 7539 suggesting that ala significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential however no obvious correlation was observed between ala and rm or λ figss 4b 1 and 4c 1 in comparison a good correlation curve was observed between rm and alb or alc figss 4b 2 and 4b 3 additionally with an increase of either alb or alc λ increased logarithmically figss 4c 2 and 4c 3 these suggested that both alb and alc posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time it is reported that ala shows a strong ability to react or complex with some unsatisfied coordinate bonds of organic matter to form insoluble al natural organic matters whereas alb and alc are the main contributors of flocculation yan et al 2007 alb could destabilize particles efficiently to form aggregates which not only shows high effectiveness in neutralizing the negative charge of colloids and natural organic matters but can also act as nuclear to form flocs with soluble natural organic matters to produce colloids and precipitate efficiently the molecular weight of alc is always large it can precipitate easily in coagulation when it adsorbs particles and natural organic matters even small dissolved organic matters yan et al 2008a thus the presence of ala might react with the organics such as codh acs and aps reductase which thereby affected the maximal hydrogen production potential the presences of alb and alc might impede accessibility of microorganisms to the substrates which thereby affected the hydrogen production rate and the lag time 3 4 effect of pac on microbial community in the two long term semi continuous reactors to understand the effect of pac on anaerobic microbes the microbial community in the two long term semi continuous reactors fed with was with or without pac addition i e 0 or 30 mg g pac was analyzed using the illumina sequencing the number of illumina hiseq sequencing was 29286 in the control and 25271 in the experimental reactor while the number of operational taxonomic units was 385 in the former and 443 in the later with 325 shared by the two reactors see venn analysis for details fig s4 the alpha diversity analyses showed that although the coverage index was similar in the two reactor the simpson index in the control was greater than that in the experimental reactor fig s5 indicating that the presence of pac reduced the microbial diversity but did not change largely the microbial structure firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria actinobacteria were the four main phyla accounting for 90 in the two fermentation reactors fig 5 many anaerobes in these phyla were demonstrated to have capability of degrading organics such as proteins and carbohydrates for the production of scfas and hydrogen wang et al 2017 the addition of pac caused substantial changes in the abundances of several microorganisms in these phyla for example compared with the control the abundances of microbes affiliated to firmicutes in the experimental reactor decreased by 6 63 the abundances of microbes of proteobacteria and actinobacteria increased from 11 02 to 10 67 in the control to 17 72 and 14 97 in the experimental reactor respectively the evolutionary tree of top 30 genera in the two fermenters revealed that the two reactors contained various anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis e g proteocatella rhodobacter acidogenesis e g gottschalkia proteiniborus acetogenesis e g fusibacter and homoacetogenic bacteria e g acetoanaerobium fig s6 although the microbial structure was not affected largely by the presence of pac the populations of some key anaerobes were affected for example the presence of pac increased the abundances of several hydrogen producers such as clostridium sensu stricto 13 clostridium sensu stricto 16 unclassified f peptostreptococcaceae alkaliphilus tissierella clostridium sensu stricto 1 proteiniborus and sedimentibacter additionally the populations of hydrogen consumers e g acetoanaerobium reduced in the experimental fermenter this could reveal what happens in was fermentation systems after pac addition and explain why pac promotes hydrogen accumulation from the aspect of microbial community fig 6 further presents the genus level distributions of the bacterial quantity in the two long term fermenters four hydrolytic bacteria such as proteocatella and rhodobacter were detected in the two fermenters and their abundances decreased from 11 1 in the control to 4 1 in the experimental reactor this suggests that the presence of 30 mg al g tss pac reduced the amounts of hydrolytic microorganisms which was in accordance with the degradation data of dextran as shown in table 3 fifteen genera of microbes which were responsible for the production of scfas and hydrogen were detected in the two reactors for example the abundances of clostridium sensu stricto 16 and proteiniborus which were documented to be hydrogen producers niu et al 2008 were respectively 5 3 and 1 2 higher in the experimental reactor than those in the control 7 8 vs 2 3 in clostridium sensu stricto 16 and 1 3 vs 0 1 in proteiniborus the population of proteiniclasticum another scfa and hydrogen producer with acetate propionate and iso butyate as its major fermentation products zhang et al 2010 decreased from 14 7 the control to 8 5 the experimental reactor further calculation showed that the total abundance of these fifteen genera was 47 4 in the control and 48 7 in the experimental reactor suggesting that the addition of pac did not largely affect the total population of scfa and hydrogen producers two types of hydrogen consumers i e homoacetogenic bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria were found to be present in the two reactors the abundance of acetoanaerobium which is an anaerobic bacterium that produces acetate from h2 and co2 sleat et al 1985 was detected to be 11 0 in the control and only 0 01 in the experimental reactor the abundance of desulfobulbus a typical sulfate reducing bacteria using hydrogen as electric donors wang et al 2018e was 1 7 in the control and 0 0001 in the experimental reactor these results indicated that the presence of pac almost washed out the hydrogen consumers which was the major reason for the enhanced hydrogen accumulation 3 5 overall understanding and implication due to its wide use pac has been substantially accumulated in was and its impact has been already enforced to the full scale was anaerobic fermentation or digestion systems to date all the previous studies demonstrated that pac negatively affected the process of was anaerobic digestion or fermentation this work however revealed for the first time that the existence of pac at pertinent levels promoted hydrogen accumulation from dark fermentation of was which was indeed existed in the real sludge fermentation systems but unrecognized before this was experimentally demonstrated through the use of chemical analysis on a series of batch tests using either real sludge or model substrates as fermentation substrates and microbial analysis on the long term semi continuous fermenters according to the analyses it was found that although pac reduced the total scfa production this reduction was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type which did not contribute hydrogen production pac suppressed all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation to some extents but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production the microbial community analysis revealed that pac did not affect the populations of scfa and hydrogen producers but the two hydrogen consumers acetoanaerobium and desulfobulbus were almost washed out by pac completely among the three types of al species present in the anaerobic fermentation systems ala significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential while alb and alc posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time to the best of our knowledge all the findings have not documented before thus this work also advanced the understanding of the impact of pac on dark fermentation significantly moreover the findings obtained in this work might also have of significance implications for future management of was treatment especially in the situations with pac being highly accumulated in was with the increasing demand for energy worldwide energy recovery from wwtps attracts growing attention park et al 2006 the carbon in was is usually recovered through methane by the anaerobic digestion process wang et al 2018a it was found however that pac at 30 mg al g tss level suppressed the methanogenesis process severely suppressed by 93 8 chen et al 2018 this severe suppression largely diminished the value of the anaerobic digestion especially in the wwtps with pac being substantially accumulated in was in comparison this work demonstrated that the presence of pac at this level enhanced rather than reduced hydrogen accumulation compared with methane hydrogen is a more valuable product due to its higher energy yield and lower carbon footprint in addition apart from hydrogen substantial amounts of another valuable fermentation product scfa could be also achieved at the same time fig 2 thus it seems that dark fermentation of was to produce hydrogen and scfa might be a more feasible way in comparison to anaerobic digestion to produce methane in the areas where sludge pac level are at high levels it should be noted that although alkaline fermentation resulted in higher hydrogen yields than acidic fermentation cai et al 2004 more chemicals e g naoh are estimated to be consumed as well therefore it is unknown which one is better for real word situations and a comprehensive technic economic analysis between alkaline and acidic fermentation should be made in the future 4 conclusion this study assessed the effect of pac on hydrogen accumulation from the anaerobic fermentation of was and explored the underlying mechanisms of how pac affects hydrogen production experimental results showed that the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 20 9 to 28 3 ml g vss with pac content increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss the mechanism explorations revealed that pac reduced propionic acid fermentation which did not contribute hydrogen production besides all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation was suppressed by pac but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production illumina miseq sequencing analysis revealed that pac did not affect the populations of hydrogen producers but the two hydrogen consumers were washed out further investigation revealed that ala affected maximal hydrogen production potential while alb and alc affected hydrogen production rate and

19015,poly aluminum chloride pac an inorganic coagulant being accumulated in waste activated sludge was at substantial levels are generally thought to inhibit was anaerobic fermentation however its effect on dark fermentative hydrogen accumulation has not been documented this work therefore aimed to explore its effect on hydrogen accumulation and to elucidate the mechanism of how pac affects hydrogen accumulation experimental results showed that with an increase of pac addition from 0 to 20 mg al per gram of total suspended solids tss the maximal hydrogen yield from alkaline fermentation ph 9 5 increased from 20 9 ml to 27 4 ml per gram volatile suspended solids vss under the standard condition further increase of pac to 30 mg al g tss didn t cause a significant increase of hydrogen yield p 0 05 the mechanism explorations revealed that although pac reduced the total short chain fatty acid scfa production this reduction was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type which did not contribute hydrogen production pac suppressed all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation to some extents but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production illumina miseq sequencing analysis revealed that pac did not affect the populations of scfa and hydrogen producers but the two hydrogen consumers acetoanaerobium and desulfobulbus were almost washed out by pac among the three types of al species present in the anaerobic fermentation systems ala monomeric species significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential while alb medium polymer species and alc species of sol or gel posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge treatment pac dark fermentation hydrogen production 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a byproduct of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its numerous amount and potentially environmental risk the treatment and disposal of was is becoming a big problem faced by wwtps nowadays an et al 2018 wang et al 2018c 2018d generally the cost of was treatment and disposal accounts for up to 60 of the total operating cost of a wwtp li et al 2018 yang et al 2019 at the same time was contains substantial organics such as proteins and polysaccharides which can be reused to compensate a partial cost of wwtps operation through fermenting or digesting was anaerobically to produce hydrogen short chain fatty acids or methane hu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018 hydrogen is known as a clean renewable energy source and widely considered the most promising alternative to fossil fuels because its product of oxidation with oxygen is only h2o and it has a high energy yield 142 35 kj g with its energy yield being 2 75 times greater than that of any hydrocarbons ginkel and sung 2001 therefore much attention has been recently attracted to obtain hydrogen production from was by which was is stabilized reduced and reused fossil fuels are saved and greenhouse gas emission is reduced liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018b hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation includes several stages such as disintegration of sludge particulates hydrolysis of solubilized organics acidification of hydrolyzed products with hydrogen generation as a metabolic intermediate hydrogen produced can be further consumed by several anaerobes including methanogens acetogens and sulfate reducers to produce methane acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide via methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes wang et al 2019a usually the hydrogen yield of anaerobic fermentation is rather low due to the low was disintegration hydrolysis efficiency and the rapid consumption of generated h2 massanet nicolau et al 2008 thus most of previous studies focused on improving hydrogen yield through increasing was disintegration hydrolysis and or reducing the activity of hydrogen consumers wang et al 2018b for example zhao et al observed that the maximal hydrogen yield of 26 9 ml g vss was obtained at constant ph 10 which was 47 8 higher than that at initial ph 10 with its final fermentation ph being at 7 3 zhao et al 2010 wang et al found that the presence of 254 mg l initial free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents and inhibited the activity of hydrogen consumers resulting in a 1 14 fold increase in hydrogen yield wang et al 2018b wang et al demonstrated that with an increase of nitrite from 0 to 250 mg l the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 8 5 to 15 0 ml g vss at ph 5 5 fermentation and 8 1 13 0 ml g vss at ph 6 fermentation wang et al 2018e apart from the major composition such as proteins and carbohydrates was also contains lots of other substances such as persistent organic pollutants heavy metals and flocculants either present in sewage or being added in wastewater treatment and was treatment processes an et al 2017 park et al 2006 xu et al 2017 yi et al 2017 previous investigations showed that these substances affected biogas production from anaerobic fermentation or digestion of was as well cho et al demonstrated that 20 and 0 5 mg l cd and zn both enhanced hydrogen production but further increase of cd and zn to 40 and 1 mg l caused decreases in hydrogen yield from 108 2 ml g cod to 82 3 and 104 5 ml g cod respectively cho and lee 2011 poly aluminum chloride pac which is made by partial hydrolysis of acid aluminum chloride solution using a specific reactor is an inorganic coagulant and generally consists of al monomers such as al3 al oh 2 and dimer al2 oh 2 4 trimer al3 oh 4 5 al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 7 12 and inert large polymer with molecular weight normally larger than 3000 da gao et al 2005 on the basis of the kinetic difference of reactions between ferron reagent 8 hydroxy 7 iodo 5 quinoline sulfonic acid with different hydrolyzed species the chemical species of hydrolyzed aluminum can be divided into three types monomeric species ala instantaneously reacted i e al monomers dimer and trimer medium polymer species alb reacted within 120 min i e al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 7 12 and species of sol or gel alc no reaction i e al polymer molecular weight normally larger than 3000 da hu et al 2006 due to the presence of these high charged poly nuclear aluminum hydrolysis products pac is superior than the traditional al based coagulants e g alcl3 and al2 so4 3 for particulate and or organic matter removal yan et al 2008b pac has been applied in water and wastewater treatment and was dewatering widely throughout the world since the 1980s jiang 2001 matsui et al 2003 mertens et al 2012 the widespread use of the pac inevitably led to its massive accumulation in was it was documented that al content in was 0 7 13 4 mg al g in seville spain solis et al 2002 3 4 mg al g in hong kong china guan et al 2005 and 0 7 26 8 mg al g in carolina in usa park et al 2006 in dewatered was however al concentration could achieve at 104 320 mg al g in usa park et al 2006 due to its large accumulation in sludge the influence of pac on was anaerobic fermentation process has attracted a large amount of concerns in the past several efforts were carried out to examine the potential impact of pac on short chain fatty acid scfa or methane yield from was anaerobic fermentation or digestion chen et al found that with the increase of pac addition from 0 to 40 mg al per gram of total suspended solids tss short chain fatty acid scfa yield decreased from 212 2 to 138 4 mg cod g volatile suspended solids vss chen et al 2018 lin et al reported that compared with the control 24 mg al l pac decreased scfa yield from sewage sludge by 35 0 from 347 5 to 220 8 mg cod g vss and meanwhile the specific hydrolysis rate constant for sludge fermentation decreased from 0 0321 to 0 017 d 1 lin et al 2017 kim and jung found that 46 mg al l pac caused a decrease in scfa production from synthetic substrate by more than 10 kim and chung 2015 chen et al observed that pac at 30 mg al g tss level suppressed the methanogenesis process by 93 8 chen et al 2018 all of these previous studies showed that the presence of pac in was had negative effects on the production of scfa or methane from anaerobic fermentation or digestion of was considering that sludge pac content was accumulated at substantial levels in many areas e g 26 8 mg al g tss in some wwtps of carolina in usa park et al 2006 this severe suppression largely diminished the value of the anaerobic digestion or fermentation despite the significant progresses performed in the past the effect of pac on dark fermentative hydrogen accumulation from was has not been documented before the purpose of this work was therefore to deeply understand how pac affects hydrogen accumulation from was dark fermentation firstly the effect of pac at different levels ranging from 0 to 30 mg al g tss on hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation was investigated then the mechanisms of how pac affects hydrogen production were explored finally the contributions of different aluminum species i e ala alb and alc to hydrogen production were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sources of was and pac to minimize the background of pac in sludge the was used in this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtps in changsha china where pac based wastewater pretreatment was not implemented before use the raw sludge was filtered by stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and concentrated by setting at 4 c for 24 h the main characteristics of the concentrated was are as follows ph 6 8 0 1 tss 18 0 0 3 g l vss 11 9 0 2 g l soluble chemical oxygen demand cod 105 2 3 2 mg l total cod 14 4 0 3 g l total proteins 8 0 0 3 g cod l total carbohydrates 1 3 0 1 g cod l pac used in this study was purchased from chemical industry park jiangsu china and it contains 30 of al2o3 2 2 batch experiment for hydrogen production from sludge anaerobic fermentation in the presence of pac at different levels in this experiment five serum bottles were conducted as anaerobic fermenters each of them was first fed with 250 ml of concentrated sludge and then different volumes of pac solution 0 1 mol al l were added into those bottles resulting in the sludge pac level of 0 5 10 20 or 30 mg al g tss it should be emphasized that these preselected set point data did not include the al background value in raw sludge the mixture volume of each bottle was added to 300 ml with deionized water before being mixed at a speed of 250 rpm for 2 min oxygen in all the bottles was removed from the headspace by sparging nitrogen gas for 5 min after that all the bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 37 1 c since alkaline condition was reported to be beneficial to hydrogen production and benefited to identify the potential contributions of different al species to hydrogen production wang et al 2019b yan et al 2008b the ph value in all the bottles was controlled at 9 5 1 by adding 4m hcl or 4m naoh during the whole fermentation period it should be noted that no extra inoculum was added into these fermentation reactors and therefore was used for both substrate and inoculum in this study 2 3 long term operation of semi continuous fermenters for the analysis of the microbial community in order to further understand the influence of pac on dark fermentation two long term semi continuous fermenters were carried out for microbial analyses the two fermenters were replicate with a working volume of 1 l each and placed in a temperature controlled shaker 37 1 c 120 rpm one fermenter was fed with 700 ml was without pac addition and set as the control the other fermenter was fed with 700 ml was containing 30 mg al g tss pac and set as the experimental reactor the other fermentation conditions such as fermentation ph temperature and rpm were the same as described in section 2 2 according to the results obtained from section 2 2 the sludge retention time in the two reactors were controlled at 7 d as a result 100 ml of fermentation mixture was removed from each reactor every day and replaced by the same amount of raw was either with or without pac addition both the reactors were sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen before they were re capped and re sealed hydrogen yield reached a stable level after approximately 50 d operation and then the assay of the microbial community was performed using illumina miseq sequencing 2 4 evaluating the effects of pac on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis hydrogenotrophic methonogenesis and sulfate reducing processes sludge dark fermentation generally contains several processes such as solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes which affect hydrogen accumulation significantly the rate of sludge solubilization the major rate limiting process in sludge dark fermentation is often assessed by measuring the concentrations of organics e g proteins and carbohydrates released in fermentation liquor xu et al 2017 and the data can be measured in the batch tests performed in section 2 2 the rates of other processes however are generally evaluated by batch tests using model substrates in the literature wang et al 2018a in the following set of batch tests therefore 20 replicate reactors with a working volume of 1 0 l each were performed these reactors were divided into four tests test ⅰ test ⅱ test ⅲ and test ⅳ with five in each all the tests lasted for 3 d during which the variation of the added substrate in each fermenter was determined the volumetric degradation rates of the added substrates were measured through linear regression of the corresponding concentration profile the vss concentration in each fermenter was measured at the end of the test the biomass specific degradation rate of the added substrate in each fermenter was then calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rate by the vss concentration the effect of pac on these bioprocesses could be indicated by comparing the specific degradation rates of the substrates among the fermenters with different pac additions test ⅰ this test was used to evaluate the impact of pac on hydrolysis process in this test each reactor received 540 ml synthetic wastewater and 60 ml fermented sludge mixture as inocula the inocula were withdrawn from the experimental reactor operated in section 2 3 the synthetic wastewater contains 1 23 g dextran average molecular weight 20 000 a model polysaccharide compound l among these reactors one was set as the control without addition of any chemical the other four were fed with pac at different levels with their levels being equal to the 5 10 20 and 30 mg al g tss reactors performed in section 2 2 the operational conditions were the same as those described in section 2 2 test ⅱ the test was used to assess the impact of pac on acidogenesis process the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as described in test i except that the fermentation substrate dextran in synthetic wastewater was replaced by glucose a model monosaccharide compound test ⅲ this test was utilized to evaluate the impact of pac on acetogenesis process the operational procedure of this experiment was conducted the same as that depicted in test ⅰ except that the fermentation substrate in synthetic wastewater was replaced by 5 g l n butyric test ⅳ this test was utilized to evaluate the impact of pac on hydrogen consumption process each reactor first received 540 ml synthetic medium containing 1 g l so4 2 and 60 ml fermented sludge mixture as inocula except for one reactor i e the control without addition of any chemical different volumes of pac solution were added into the other four reactors leading to the al content in the four reactors equal to the 5 10 20 and 30 mg al g tss reactors performed in section 2 2 all these reactors were then flushed with a combined gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to guarantee that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas finally all the reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at stirring speed of 120 rpm 2 5 identifying the contributions of different al species to the enhancement of hydrogen production as introduced above the chemical species of hydrolyzed aluminum can be divided into three types ala i e al monomers dimer and trimer alb i e al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 12 and alc i e al polymermolecular weight normally larger than 3000 da these three species of al might have different contributions to sludge fermentation thus their potential contributions to the enhancement of hydrogen production required to be identified in this test pac with different species distributions were either purchased from commercially available products or prepared using laboratory alkalinity titration method at 60 c briefly a calculated amount of 0 5 mol l alcl3 6h2o solution was first transferred into a 300 ml jar under rapid stirring and then the solution was titrated slowly with 0 5 mol l naoh using a peristaltic pump the amount of naoh added varied with the target oh al molar ratio simplified as b values pac10 and pac25 oh al molar ratio with 1 0 and 2 5 respectively the final concentrations of all the pac solutions are 0 1 mol al l the speciation of the different pacs solutions at ph 9 5 which was determined by the ferron method is shown in table 1 table s1 presents the relevant data under ph uncontrolled condition to assess the contributions of these different al species to hydrogen production in dark fermentation the synthetic wastewater containing bsa 5 32 g l and dextran 1 23 g l was used the operation and al concentration in this test were the same as described in test i 2 6 model based analysis hydrogen production was simulated by the modified gompertz equation eq 1 lay et al 1999 and kinetic parameters hm maximum hydrogen yield potential

soluble proteins and carbohydrates were determined by the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard and the anthrone sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard respectively herbert et al 1971 lowry et al 1951 the cod conversion coefficients are 1 5 g cod g proteins and 1 06 g cod g carbohydrates wang et al 2018a the sulfate detection was based on bacro4 so2 4 precipitate using spectrophotometer analysis hydrogen sulfide was measured by methylene blue spectrophotometric method according to the method reported previously su and zhao 2013 the composition in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector according to the method documented in the literature wang et al 2018a the concentration of scfas measured with agilent 6890n gc equipped with flame ionization detector and the detailed method was provided in supporting information the total scfas were calculated as the sum of the measured acetic propionic n butyric iso butyric n valeric and iso valeric acid xu et al 2018 illumina miseq sequencing analysis was used to evaluate the diversity of the microbial community in the two long term semi continuous fermenters during stable operation the fermentation samples were withdrawn from the two fermenters and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm then the total genomic dna was extracted from the samples using the fast dna kit mobio laboratories according to the operating manual the quantity and purity of dna were analyzed with a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de usa the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat were used to target the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s dna genes the dna samples were analyzed for illumina miseq sequencing illumina miseq pf300 platform the measurement of ala alb and alc was conducted according to the ferron method documented in the literature wang et al 2004 briefly the ferron solution was obtained by mixing reagent a 0 2 ferron b 20 w w ch3coona and c 1 9 v v hcl according to a ratio of 2 5 2 1 during speciation experiments 5 50 ml of the mixed reagent was transferred into 25 ml graduated glass tube and then a certain amount of the sample was added into the glass tube and quickly diluted to 25 ml by distilled water after mixing the sample was quickly added to a 1 cm glass cuvette the timed absorbance measurements at 366 nm using a shimadzu uv 2800 spectrophotometer were carried out after 1 min and 120 min it was operationally divided that the first 1min absorbance was thought as ala and 1 min 120 min absorbance was supposed as alb alc was obtained by al total minus ala and alb wang et al 2004 2 8 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogen production in the presence of pac at different levels fig 1 a shows the cumulative curve of hydrogen production from was dark fermentation in the presence of pac at different levels under alkaline condition ph 9 5 in the initial 6 d hydrogen production from was without pac addition increased gradually and no significant increase was found after that time p 0 05 see table s2 for statistical analysis the maximal hydrogen yield and optimal fermentation time were respectively 20 9 ml g vss and 6 d for was without pac addition which were comparable to the data reported previously wang et al 2018b similar trend of hydrogen production was also observed for other was with pac addition fig 1a and table s2 all of the previous investigations demonstrated that the presence of pac in was had negative effects on scfa or methane production chen et al 2018 kim and chung 2015 lin et al 2017 in this work however it was found that the presence of pac enhanced rather than reduced hydrogen yield from was dark fermentation fig 1a with an increase of pac content from 0 to 20 mg al g tss the maximal hydrogen yield significantly increased from 20 9 to 27 4 ml g vss p 0 05 see table s3 further increase of pac content to 30 mg al g tss caused a slight increase in hydrogen production but it should be noted that this increase was considered statistically insignificant p 0 05 see table s4 this hydrogen yield i e 27 4 ml g vss at 20 mg al g tss was comparable with that obtained from was alkaline fermentation at constant ph 10 26 9 ml g vss and was higher than that obtained from was acidic fermentation for example wang et al 2018d demonstrated that the maximal hydrogen yield of 8 5 ml g vss was achieved from anaerobic fermentation at ph 5 5 and this value increased to 15 ml g vss when 250 mg l nitrite was added in the fermenter massanet nicolau et al 2008 found that when sewage sludge and inoculum sludge with a ratio of 9 1 was respectively pretreated at 70 c for 60 min and 110 c for 20 min the maximal hydrogen yield of 18 14 ml g dried sludge was achieved from acidic ph 5 5 fermentation although the maximal hydrogen production rate determined in this work was lower than that reported by massanet nicolau et al 2008 0 33 vs 2 21 ml g vss h table s5 it should be emphasized that no extra inoculum was used in our work whereas 10 of inoculum and 75 unit l cellulase were employed by massanet nicolau et al 2008 the hydrogen production rate determined in this work was comparable to that determined in other studies without inoculum addition table s5 to further understand the impact of pac on dark fermentation the modified gompertz equation was employed to fit the experimental data obtained fig 1a three kinetic parameters i e maximum hydrogen yield potential hm hydrogen production rate rm and lag phase time λ were determined fig 1a and table 2 it can be seen that pac prolonged lag phase time λ slightly however with the increase of pac addition maximum hydrogen yield potential hm and hydrogen production rate rm increased significantly p 0 05 see table s6 indicating that the addition of pac enhanced not only biochemical hydrogen potential but also hydrogen production rate further investigation showed that the maximum hydrogen yield potential increased exponentially with pac addition increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss fig 1b all the results showed that the presence of pac at pertinent levels enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen yield in the following text the mechanism of how pac enhances hydrogen yield was explored 3 2 mechanism of how pac enhances hydrogen yield several processes i e sludge disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis involved in was dark fermentation are closely relevant to hydrogen production sludge disintegration and hydrolysis provide substrates for hydrogen producers while hydrogen is produced directly in the processes of acidogenesis and acetogenesis however it was previously reported that the presence of pac restrained sludge disintegration hydrolysis and acidogenesis probably due to its physical enmeshment chen et al 2018 and this was also confirmed by the data obtained in this work fig s1 and table 3 besides it was found that the specific degradation rate of butyrate decreased with the addition of pac table 3 suggesting that pac suppressed acetogenesis as well all these evidences indicated that the presence of pac might affect negatively hydrogen production thus one might want to know why the enhanced hydrogen yield was measured in the pac added fermenters as expected the presence of pac decreased total scfa yield the higher the pac addition the lower the total scfa yields fig 2 a however hydrogen production is closely relevant to the fraction of individual scfa i e fermentation type rather than total scfa for example when 1 mol butyric acid or acetic acid is produced from glucose fermentation 1 mol or 2 mol hydrogen will be generated eqs 2 and 3 whereas no hydrogen is produced when the fermentation type becomes propionic acid one eq 4 2 c6h12o6 2h2o ch3ch2ch2coo 2hco 3 3h 2h2 3 c6h12o6 4h2o 2ch3coo 2hco 3 4h 4h2 4 1 5c6h12o6 2ch3ch2coo 4h hco 3 fig 2b shows the distribution of individual scfa in the presence of different pac addition there were no significant differences in the concentrations of n butyric acid isobutyric acid n valeric acid and isovaleric acid among the fermenters p 0 05 see table s7 with an increase of pac addition from 0 to 30 mg al g tss propionic acid and acidic acid decreased from 167 2 to 300 6 to 54 7 and 231 6 mg cod l respectively further calculation exhibited that the percentage of propionic acid to total scfa decreased from 26 2 to 11 7 with pac increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss in comparison the corresponding percentage of butyric acid to total scfa increased from 21 5 to 28 8 no significant variation was found in the percentage of acetic acid to total scfa among the fermenters p 0 05 see table s8 cod mass balance analysis showed that with an increase of pac addition from 0 to 30 mg al g tss the percentages of vss and h2 increased from 75 32 1 20 and 0 46 0 02 to 83 69 3 08 and 0 61 0 02 respectively while the percentage of total scfa and propionic acid decreased from 7 40 0 15 and 1 94 0 02 to 5 46 0 14 and 0 64 0 02 respectively table s9 these facts showed that although total scfa yield was inhibited by pac this inhibition was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type which did not contribute hydrogen production this suggested that hydrogen production was not affected largely by pac though the acidogenesis was inhibited as an intermediate of dark fermentation hydrogen produced can be readily bio converted to methane hydrogen sulfide or acetate by hydrogen consumers such as methanogens sulfate reducers and acetogens which also affects hydrogen yield therefore we compared the inhibition of pac to hydrogen consumption processes with that to hydrogen production processes table 3 and please see fig s2 for calculation details it can be seen that the specific degradation rates of dextran glucose and butyrate in the blank were 337 6 17 0 337 8 11 9 and 60 0 2 0 mg g vss d respectively these values could be considered the original activities of microbes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis respectively in the fermenter with 30 mg al g tss pac addition the specific degradation rates of dextran glucose and butyrate decreased to 146 9 4 5 192 9 7 9 and 34 3 1 1 mg g vss d respectively this indicated that 30 mg al g tss pac addition decreased the relative activity expressed as of the original of hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis microbes by 56 5 42 9 and 42 9 respectively however the degradation rate of hydrogen decreased from 4 8 0 2 to 0 4 0 1 mg g vss d when pac concentration increased from 0 to 30 mg al g tss suggesting that 30 mg al g tss pac addition decreased the relative activity of hydrogen consumers by 92 6 similar observations were also made at other pac dosages the facts revealed that although pac inhibited all the microbial processes to some extents its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production which is one major reason for pac enhancing hydrogen yield hydrogen produced in fermentation process could be mainly consumed by homoacetogenesis sulfate reducing or hydrogenotrophic methonogenesis process it can be further seen from table 3 that the specific degradation rate of sulfate in the absence of pac was 22 1 1 3 mg g vss d whereas the corresponding value in the presence of 5 10 20 and 30 mg al g tss of pac addition was respectively 19 1 0 8 14 6 1 1 12 6 0 3 and 6 8 0 5 mg g vss d indicating that the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria decreased by 13 4 33 8 43 0 and 69 4 respectively this deduction could be further supported by cod mass balance analysis the percentage of h2s decreased from 0 010 0 001 to 0 002 0 001 with pac content increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss table s9 it is known that hydrogen and carbon dioxide could be bio converted into methane and acetate through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis respectively as acetate produced by homoacetogenesis could be also bio converted into methane through acetotrophic methanogenesis we failed to differentiate the accurate inhibition of pac to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis at this stage through the intervention of exogenous co2 and h2 into anaerobic digestion liu et al 2016 found that the increased h2 partial pressure was accompanied with the change of h2 consumption pathway the determined kinetic parameters revealed that homoacetogenesis contributed only 2 5 of the h2 consumption indicating that hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenesis could be negligible in ordinary anaerobic processes liu et al 2016 however further efforts are required to be performed in the future the results above demonstrated clearly that the severe inhibition of pac to hydrogen consumption was one major reason for the enhanced hydrogen yield thus the question as to why pac severely suppressed the process required to be further discussed hydrogen consumption is highly dependent on the activities of several enzymes according to the report the key enzymes involved in hydrogen consumption are codh carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acs acetyl coa synthase and aps reductase adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase with all of them being iron sulfur proteins with fe as a key part ragsdale and pierce 2008 wang et al 2018b codh is one homodimeric enzyme that contains five metal clusters including two c clusters two b clusters and a bridging d cluster as diagrammed the b cluster and the d cluster are typical 4fe 4s 2 1 clusters that bridge the two subunits the c cluster is a 3fe 4s cluster that is bridged to a binuclear nife site in which the iron in the binuclear cluster is bridged to a his ligand ragsdale and pierce 2008 acs consists of a 4fe 4s cluster that is bridged via a cysteine residue to a ni site aps reductase also contains a 4fe 4s cluster that executes electron transport and redox catalysis properties fig 3 zheng et al 2009 when pac is present in fermentation systems substantial al is inevitably released as al and fe share numerous common physicochemical features al can readily substitute for fe especially in environments where the former is easily accessible the substitution of fe by al leads to the generation of an oxidative environment on one hand the free fe can react in the biological milieu via the fenton reaction to create a variety of reactive oxygen species that can indeed initiate numerous cellular dysfunctions on the other hand the exposure to al results in the loss of the fe s cluster integrity lemire et al 2010 as a result al is often observed to cause a dysfunctional fe homeostasis and impede fe based proteins enzymes to function in an effective manner fig 3 morgan and redgrave 1998 perez et al 1999 it is known that codh and acs are key enzymes responsible for hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenesis ragsdale and pierce 2008 while aps reductase is a key enzyme involved in the pathways of sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation in the biological sulfur cycle zheng et al 2009 it can be understood why the presence of pac suppressed severely the hydrogen consumption process 3 3 identifying the effect of different al species on hydrogen production as mentioned above the chemical species of hydrolyzed pac can be divided into three types ala instantaneously reacted i e al momomers dimer and trimer alb reacted within 120min i e al13 alo4a12 oh 24 h2o 7 12 and alc no reaction i e al polymer molecular weight normally larger than 3000 da these different species of al might have different effect on sludge dark fermentation thus their respective impacts on hydrogen yield were also identified in this work the three types of al species are generally co existed in solutions and solution ph has a significant effect on the species transformation depending mainly on oh al ratio denoted as b value yan et al 2007 the pac at low b ratios showed significant changes of species under different ph conditions while pac at high b ratios exhibited efficient speciation stability and tended to maintain the original speciation distribution yan et al 2007 in this work therefore to identify the effect of the different al species on sludge dark fermentation adding different types of al based chemicals to the same synthetic wastewater was performed under alkaline condition i e ph 9 5 as shown in table 1 the hydrogen yield from these fermenters at different fermentation times was presented in table s10 supporting information hydrogen yield in the control without any al chemical addition was low e g 64 2 ml at 96 h table s10 with alcl3 addition cumulative hydrogen yield at 96 h increased gradually from 64 2 ml 0 mg al g tss to 201 0 ml 40 mg al g tss while the corresponding value increased from 64 2 ml to 199 4 ml with the pac10 addition increased from 0 to 40 mg al g tss table s10 although hydrogen yield increased with the increase of pac25 concentration from 0 to 20 mg al g tss 153 9 ml further increase pac25 content to 40 mg al g tss caused a decrease of hydrogen yield to 117 0 ml similar observations were also made on other fermentation days table s10 to further understand the impact of al species on dark fermentation the modified gompertz equation was employed to fit the experimental data presented in table s10 fig s3 and the determined kinetic parameters i e hm rm and λ were shown in table s11 it can be seen that the correlation between hm and alb or alc was not strong figss 4a 2 and 4 a 3 while hm increased linearly with the increase of ala content figss 4a 1 r2 0 7539 suggesting that ala significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential however no obvious correlation was observed between ala and rm or λ figss 4b 1 and 4c 1 in comparison a good correlation curve was observed between rm and alb or alc figss 4b 2 and 4b 3 additionally with an increase of either alb or alc λ increased logarithmically figss 4c 2 and 4c 3 these suggested that both alb and alc posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time it is reported that ala shows a strong ability to react or complex with some unsatisfied coordinate bonds of organic matter to form insoluble al natural organic matters whereas alb and alc are the main contributors of flocculation yan et al 2007 alb could destabilize particles efficiently to form aggregates which not only shows high effectiveness in neutralizing the negative charge of colloids and natural organic matters but can also act as nuclear to form flocs with soluble natural organic matters to produce colloids and precipitate efficiently the molecular weight of alc is always large it can precipitate easily in coagulation when it adsorbs particles and natural organic matters even small dissolved organic matters yan et al 2008a thus the presence of ala might react with the organics such as codh acs and aps reductase which thereby affected the maximal hydrogen production potential the presences of alb and alc might impede accessibility of microorganisms to the substrates which thereby affected the hydrogen production rate and the lag time 3 4 effect of pac on microbial community in the two long term semi continuous reactors to understand the effect of pac on anaerobic microbes the microbial community in the two long term semi continuous reactors fed with was with or without pac addition i e 0 or 30 mg g pac was analyzed using the illumina sequencing the number of illumina hiseq sequencing was 29286 in the control and 25271 in the experimental reactor while the number of operational taxonomic units was 385 in the former and 443 in the later with 325 shared by the two reactors see venn analysis for details fig s4 the alpha diversity analyses showed that although the coverage index was similar in the two reactor the simpson index in the control was greater than that in the experimental reactor fig s5 indicating that the presence of pac reduced the microbial diversity but did not change largely the microbial structure firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria actinobacteria were the four main phyla accounting for 90 in the two fermentation reactors fig 5 many anaerobes in these phyla were demonstrated to have capability of degrading organics such as proteins and carbohydrates for the production of scfas and hydrogen wang et al 2017 the addition of pac caused substantial changes in the abundances of several microorganisms in these phyla for example compared with the control the abundances of microbes affiliated to firmicutes in the experimental reactor decreased by 6 63 the abundances of microbes of proteobacteria and actinobacteria increased from 11 02 to 10 67 in the control to 17 72 and 14 97 in the experimental reactor respectively the evolutionary tree of top 30 genera in the two fermenters revealed that the two reactors contained various anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis e g proteocatella rhodobacter acidogenesis e g gottschalkia proteiniborus acetogenesis e g fusibacter and homoacetogenic bacteria e g acetoanaerobium fig s6 although the microbial structure was not affected largely by the presence of pac the populations of some key anaerobes were affected for example the presence of pac increased the abundances of several hydrogen producers such as clostridium sensu stricto 13 clostridium sensu stricto 16 unclassified f peptostreptococcaceae alkaliphilus tissierella clostridium sensu stricto 1 proteiniborus and sedimentibacter additionally the populations of hydrogen consumers e g acetoanaerobium reduced in the experimental fermenter this could reveal what happens in was fermentation systems after pac addition and explain why pac promotes hydrogen accumulation from the aspect of microbial community fig 6 further presents the genus level distributions of the bacterial quantity in the two long term fermenters four hydrolytic bacteria such as proteocatella and rhodobacter were detected in the two fermenters and their abundances decreased from 11 1 in the control to 4 1 in the experimental reactor this suggests that the presence of 30 mg al g tss pac reduced the amounts of hydrolytic microorganisms which was in accordance with the degradation data of dextran as shown in table 3 fifteen genera of microbes which were responsible for the production of scfas and hydrogen were detected in the two reactors for example the abundances of clostridium sensu stricto 16 and proteiniborus which were documented to be hydrogen producers niu et al 2008 were respectively 5 3 and 1 2 higher in the experimental reactor than those in the control 7 8 vs 2 3 in clostridium sensu stricto 16 and 1 3 vs 0 1 in proteiniborus the population of proteiniclasticum another scfa and hydrogen producer with acetate propionate and iso butyate as its major fermentation products zhang et al 2010 decreased from 14 7 the control to 8 5 the experimental reactor further calculation showed that the total abundance of these fifteen genera was 47 4 in the control and 48 7 in the experimental reactor suggesting that the addition of pac did not largely affect the total population of scfa and hydrogen producers two types of hydrogen consumers i e homoacetogenic bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria were found to be present in the two reactors the abundance of acetoanaerobium which is an anaerobic bacterium that produces acetate from h2 and co2 sleat et al 1985 was detected to be 11 0 in the control and only 0 01 in the experimental reactor the abundance of desulfobulbus a typical sulfate reducing bacteria using hydrogen as electric donors wang et al 2018e was 1 7 in the control and 0 0001 in the experimental reactor these results indicated that the presence of pac almost washed out the hydrogen consumers which was the major reason for the enhanced hydrogen accumulation 3 5 overall understanding and implication due to its wide use pac has been substantially accumulated in was and its impact has been already enforced to the full scale was anaerobic fermentation or digestion systems to date all the previous studies demonstrated that pac negatively affected the process of was anaerobic digestion or fermentation this work however revealed for the first time that the existence of pac at pertinent levels promoted hydrogen accumulation from dark fermentation of was which was indeed existed in the real sludge fermentation systems but unrecognized before this was experimentally demonstrated through the use of chemical analysis on a series of batch tests using either real sludge or model substrates as fermentation substrates and microbial analysis on the long term semi continuous fermenters according to the analyses it was found that although pac reduced the total scfa production this reduction was mainly enforced to propionic acid fermentation type which did not contribute hydrogen production pac suppressed all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation to some extents but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production the microbial community analysis revealed that pac did not affect the populations of scfa and hydrogen producers but the two hydrogen consumers acetoanaerobium and desulfobulbus were almost washed out by pac completely among the three types of al species present in the anaerobic fermentation systems ala significantly affected the maximal hydrogen production potential while alb and alc posed impacts on hydrogen production rate and the lag time to the best of our knowledge all the findings have not documented before thus this work also advanced the understanding of the impact of pac on dark fermentation significantly moreover the findings obtained in this work might also have of significance implications for future management of was treatment especially in the situations with pac being highly accumulated in was with the increasing demand for energy worldwide energy recovery from wwtps attracts growing attention park et al 2006 the carbon in was is usually recovered through methane by the anaerobic digestion process wang et al 2018a it was found however that pac at 30 mg al g tss level suppressed the methanogenesis process severely suppressed by 93 8 chen et al 2018 this severe suppression largely diminished the value of the anaerobic digestion especially in the wwtps with pac being substantially accumulated in was in comparison this work demonstrated that the presence of pac at this level enhanced rather than reduced hydrogen accumulation compared with methane hydrogen is a more valuable product due to its higher energy yield and lower carbon footprint in addition apart from hydrogen substantial amounts of another valuable fermentation product scfa could be also achieved at the same time fig 2 thus it seems that dark fermentation of was to produce hydrogen and scfa might be a more feasible way in comparison to anaerobic digestion to produce methane in the areas where sludge pac level are at high levels it should be noted that although alkaline fermentation resulted in higher hydrogen yields than acidic fermentation cai et al 2004 more chemicals e g naoh are estimated to be consumed as well therefore it is unknown which one is better for real word situations and a comprehensive technic economic analysis between alkaline and acidic fermentation should be made in the future 4 conclusion this study assessed the effect of pac on hydrogen accumulation from the anaerobic fermentation of was and explored the underlying mechanisms of how pac affects hydrogen production experimental results showed that the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 20 9 to 28 3 ml g vss with pac content increasing from 0 to 30 mg al g tss the mechanism explorations revealed that pac reduced propionic acid fermentation which did not contribute hydrogen production besides all the microbial processes relevant to anaerobic fermentation was suppressed by pac but its inhibition to hydrogen consumption was much severer than that to hydrogen production illumina miseq sequencing analysis revealed that pac did not affect the populations of hydrogen producers but the two hydrogen consumers were washed out further investigation revealed that ala affected maximal hydrogen production potential while alb and alc affected hydrogen production rate and

performance 3 1 1 hydroxide precipitation precipitation method is the most common way to remove metal ions from wastewater sajid et al 2018 wen et al 2018 fig 1 shows the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia nitrogen after being treated by naoh ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased slightly and manganese removal efficiency increased obviously as the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 10 5 at the ph of 10 0 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was 20 27 and the removal efficiency of manganese reached to 99 32 emmrl contains a great deal of mn2 mg2 and ca2 the

equilibrium constants k indicate that the selectivity for mn2 is thermodynamically more favorable with ca2 than mg2 zhang and cheng 2007 zhang et al suggested that manganese cannot be reduced to a very low level 5 mg l 1 only by hydroxide precipitation method zhang et al 2010 also hydroxide precipitations are generally difficult to dewater for its amorphous particle structure 3 1 2 sulfide precipitation sulfide precipitation is an important method in hydrometallurgical treatment of industrial effluents in which na2s is often used to precipitate heavy metals in wastewater gharabaghi et al 2012 the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia nitrogen using sulfide precipitation method are shown in fig 2 at a given ph manganese removal efficiency increased gradually as sulfide dose increased but not significantly fig 2a when s to mn molar ratio is constant the removal efficiency of manganese increased as ph increased the removal efficiency of manganese reached 99 99 when solution ph is 10 0 and molar ratio of s to mn is 0 9 1 a s shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen increased from 23 9 to 28 5 as the ph increased from 8 5 to 9 5 when the molar ratio of s to mn was 0 9 1 similarly the concentration of ammonia nitrogen rapidly decreased to 497 82 mg l 1 when the ph value was 10 5 because of the evaporation of ammonia 3 1 3 carbonate precipitation carbonate precipitation method is an important effective and practical method for manganese removal cai et al 2010 na2co3 has often been used to provide carbonate ions to precipitate high concentration manganese in industrial effluents the selectivity of manganese carbonate is more favorable with mg2 than ca2 it is indicated in reactions 6 and reactions 7 6 mgco3 mn2 mnco3 mg2 logk 5 48 7 caco3 mn2 mnco3 ca2 logk 2 35 the removal efficiencies of manganese and ammonia nitrogen are shown in fig 3 in fig 3a the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased slightly as the increase of ph and molar ratio of c to mn when the ph ranged from 8 0 to 10 0 and the molar ratio of c to mn change from 0 9 1 to 1 2 1 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was always less than 28 0 at a given ph the manganese removal efficiency increased gradually as the dose of carbonate increased meanwhile manganese removal efficiency increased as ph value increased at a given molar ratio of c to mn fig 3b fig 3c shows that the removal efficiency of manganese increased from 91 55 to 99 98 as the ph increased from 8 5 to 10 5 when the molar ratio of c to mn is 1 1 1 and the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was less than 28 1 at the ph of 9 5 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen and manganese was 17 0 and 97 4 respectively however when ph was greater than 10 0 ammonia nitrogen can easily form ammonia gas escape from emmrl therefore the optimum ph value was 9 5 in this study 3 2 visual minteq model results in this work 99 0 manganese in emmrl can be removed when using naoh na2s and na2co3 as precipitate agents but the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was less than 40 0 and mainly removed in the form of ammonia gas emmrl includes a certain amount of magnesium which can benefit ammonia nitrogen removal by struvite thermodynamic equilibrium model visual minteq was used to optimize manganese and magnesium removal efficiency from emmrl by adding naoh na2s and na2co3 solutions at different molar ratio and ph value visual minteq is a chemical equilibrium model for calculation of metal speciation solubility equilibria equilibrium of solved and dissolved chemicals in aqueous system gustafsson 2008 buchanan et al revealed that the interaction between ph and nh4 mg2 and po4 3 celen et al 2007 wu and zhou optimized the dosage of alkaline by using visual minteq wu and zhou 2012 table 2 shows the calculated and experimental results under different operational conditions when the ph change from 9 0 to 9 5 the manganese removal efficiency increased from 57 8 to 91 02 in the calculated results and in the experiment results the removal efficiency increased from 48 21 to 89 75 when the molar ratio of s to mn was 0 9 1 and 1 1 the manganese removal efficiency calculated by model was 99 97 and 99 99 respectively and the experimental results was 99 98 and 99 99 the manganese removal efficiency was 99 55 and 99 98 by model prediction when the molar ratio of c to mn was 1 1 and 1 1 1 and the experimental results was 99 81 99 98 the above results showed that the experimental data were in consistent with the calculated outcomes thus the established model was feasible to predict the removal efficiency of magnesium when using different precipitation agents in this study manganese and ammonia nitrogen were fractional removed from emmrl magnesium was crucial to struvite formation and contributed to ammonia nitrogen removal when naoh was used to remove manganese 59 57 magnesium in the emmrl formed co precipitations with manganese hydroxide which hindered the formation of struvite using na2s as precipitation agent 57 11 magnesium formed co precipitation with mns h2o or mnoh sh which was also not avail to form struvite the removal efficiency of magnesium was 2 39 when using sodium carbonate as the precipitation agent at the ph of 9 5 which makes for struvite precipitation for ammonia nitrogen removal therefore na2co3 was chosen to be the optimal precipitant agent for manganese removal from emmrl 3 3 ammonia nitrogen fractional removal performance the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia nitrogen after struvite precipitation are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a at a given ph ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased gradually as phosphate dose increased at a given molar ratio of p to n the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased as ph value increased in fig 4b the removal efficiency of manganese is greater than 99 9 when solution ph is greater than 8 0 at different molar ratio of p to n fig 4c shows that the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen increased from 77 3 to 97 4 as solution ph increased from 7 0 to 9 5 when molar ratio of p to n was 1 1 1 the removal efficiency of ammonia decreased when ph was greater than 10 0 therefore the optimum ph value is 9 5 in this study 3 4 precipitation characteristics the phase compositions of different precipitates are shown in fig 5 in fig 5a the main phases of the precipitates are pyrochroite groutite brucite and manganese oxide hydrate at ph 9 5 and in the visual minteq model the main phases of manganese are mn2 13 15 mn2 oh 3 3 83 66 and mn nh3 2 2 48 magnesium is mainly existed as mg2 99 28 thus manganese is mainly removed in the form of manganese oxide hydrate and magnesium is removed in the form of brucite using naoh as the precipitation agent mn2 0 06 mn hs 99 93 and mn nh3 2 0 01 are the main phase of manganese as well as mg2 99 31 and mgoh 0 57 are the main phase of magnesium using na2s as the precipitation agent at ph 9 5 thus manganese was removed in the form of mns h2o or mnoh sh and magnesium was removed in brucite fig 5b mn2 51 63 mn2 oh 3 35 02 and mnco3aq 1 27 are the main phases of manganese when na2co3 was used to be the precipitate agent thus the main phase of the precipitates is rhodochrosite fig 5c massoni et al 2015 and manganese was removed in the form of mnco3 fig 5d shows that the main phase of the precipitate is struvite the results indicated that ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed in the form of struvite sem micrographs of the precipitates using naoh na2s na2co3 and phosphate as precipitation agents are shown in fig 6 the morphology of the precipitate sample using naoh as precipitate agent was a thin sheet and disorderly deposits fig 6a the precipitates produced by adding na2s were unequal particle size and uneven surfaces fig 6b the precipitates were even spherical particles 4 μm 5 μm when na2co3 was used as precipitation agent fig 6c which was confirmed by edx analysis and can be further confirmed by xrd morphologies of the precipitates after being treated by phosphate analyzed by sem are shown in fig 6d typical shape of struvite crystal was needle or plate like elongated in the longitudinal axis of the crystalline products with diameters between 10 and 30 μm the edx analysis confirmed that the crystals were struvite some of the floral structures remain intact but were mixed with fractured crystals of irregular sizes and cracks and fractures were also observed on the crystal surfaces such surface defects could be attributed to the stress induced by incorporation of foreign ions such as mn2 al3 and ca2 to the crystal lattice or adsorption of these ions onto the crystal surface lou et al 2018 in fig 7 the xps spectra of the different precipitates are presented the measured elements in these samples are oxygen o 1s manganese mn 2p nitrogen n 1s and carbon c 1s in the binding energy from 0 ev to 1300 ev zhu et al 2017 the c1s peak was used for calibration the o1s curves can be resolved into two peaks by deconvolution the peaks at 529 5 529 9 ev can be ascribed to lattice oxygen olat and the shoulder peaks at 531 2 531 5 ev can be assigned to the active surface adsorbed oxygen oads du et al 2012 the active oads contents oads olat oads on the surface of the different precipitates are shown in table 3 the oads content accounted for 93 41 using naoh as precipitate agent the oads content reduced to 91 29 in na2s process the oads content value was 99 99 and 100 00 respectively using carbonate and struvite precipitation methods as shown in fig 7b the principal peaks at 400 8 ev can be identified as nh4 using na2s as precipitation liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 the principal peaks at 401 5 ev can be identified as struvite precipitation no peak was founded when naoh and na2co3 were used as precipitate agents the results showed that ammonia gas was mainly generated by using naoh and na2co3 and ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed via adsorption in the process of na2s precipitation as well as ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed in the form of struvite when phosphate was used to be precipitate agents the mn2p binding energy of the precipitate samples is displayed in fig 7c three different valences of manganese stuck to the precipitates surface the principal peaks at 640 1 641 4 and 642 5 653 8 ev can be identified as mn2 mn3 and mn4 respectively lee and bai 2018 wang et al 2012 the low valence manganese mn2 3 contents mn2 3 mn2 mn3 mn4 on the surface of different precipitate are listed in table 3 in which mn2 3 content maintain in 33 33 when using naoh na2s and na2co3 as the precipitate agent no obvious binding energy of the mn 2p was found in the precipitate samples when using phosphate as precipitate agents the results showed that almost no manganese existed in the struvite phase transitions of the precipitates were analyzed via ft ir in fig 8 a broad peak is observed between 3600 cm 1 and 2500 cm 1 which could be attributed to the overlapping of various oh stretching vibrations sinha et al 2014 as shown in fig 8a b the h o h deformation of water is observed at 1680 cm 1 a peak is observed near 555 cm 1 which could be attributed to mn o stretching vibrations the result showed that manganese was removed in the form of manganese oxides the ft ir spectra of mnco3 are shown in fig 8d vardhan et al 2018 phase transition of the precipitates in fig 8c was similar to fig 8d which further indicated that using na2co3 can mainly obtain mnco3 in fig 8e the various vibrational bands of po4 3 and p o p units are observed at 1100 cm 1 1010 cm 1 and 574 cm 1 the bands for h n h deformation modes of nh4 can be seen at 1440 cm 1 ammonium water hydrogen bonding can be observed at 895 cm 1 and water water hydrogen bonding is observed at 760 cm 1 this result indicated that ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed by struvite and the results can be further confirmed by xrd fig 5 and sem eds fig 6 3 5 manganese and ammonia nitrogen fractional removal mechanisms according to xrd ft ir sem eds and xps analysis and combining with the removal efficiency of nh4 and mn2 the schematic of the experiment is shown in fig 9 the reaction equations of different precipitation methods are as follows 1 hydroxide precipitation 2oh mg2 fe2 ca2 mg fe ca oh 2 2naoh mn2

analyzed in an economic viewpoint for different precipitation methods can realize industrialization application the processing cost was estimated by using industrial chemical reagent according to chemical reagent dosage in laboratory in this assessment the costs of the chemicals used in the process possible technology evaluation cost and the commercial price of the recovered mnco3 and struvite were considered the commercial prices of the chemicals according to alibaba in the calculations are given in table 4 using hydroxide sulfide and carbonate in precipitation methods the total costs were 1 920 m 3 1 508 m 3 and 1 828 m 3 respectively obviously the cost was higher using naoh and na2co3 than using na2s kularatne et al 2009 meanwhile sulfide precipitation method was not widely used because of its toxicity and corrosiveness when applied excessively and the dosage of sulfide was difficult to be controlled lewis 2010 the moisture of precipitation obtained by naoh methods was high and it is low resource utilization moreover when using naoh and na2s the removal efficiency of mg2 is higher than using na2co3 therefore na2co3 was chosen to remove ammonia nitrogen agent from emmrl in this study na2co3 was used to remove mn2 and then phosphate was used to remove nh4 from emmrl and the total cost was 7 456 m 3 possible technology evaluation costs amount to 1 860 m 3 mainly consist of filtration process 0 15 m 3 labor cost 0 52 m 3 energy charge 0 86 m 3 and facilities maintenance 0 33 m 3 therefore the total cost of emmrl treatment was 9 316 m 3 the purity of manganese obtained in mnco3 was 45 87 the content of magnesium is greater than 30 ppm according to hg t4203 201 therefore mnco3 was belongs to industrial grade which the commercial price was 1 147 kg 1 according to alibaba at least the purity of struvite in this study was 96 0 even it contained ca2 k and mn2 the struvite still can meet farm level grade and the price was 316 0 t at least according to alibaba the obtained industrial grade mnco3 and farm level grade struvite can be sold for 1 147 kg 1 and 0 359 kg 1 at least respectively as well as the total recovery price was higher 7 500 m 3 in addition if industrial chemical treating agent were replaced with waste phosphoric acid and co2 the costs would be much lower shu et al 2016b huang et al 2014 thus the costs of precipitation method could be further reduced in future experiments 4 conclusions in this study a comparative investigation of hydroxide precipitation sulfide precipitation carbonate precipitation and the struvite formation process for removal of manganese and ammonia nitrogen from emmrl was investigated visual minteq was applied to simulate the chemical reactions and optimize chemical dosages in the manganese removal and the experimental results corresponded well with the model outputs in terms of manganese removal efficiency the results showed carbonate precipitation method has advantages over the other two methods for removal of manganese and ammonia nitrogen when c mn molar ratio was 1 1 1 at ph 9 5 the removal efficiency of manganese was 99 9 and manganese was removed in the form of mnco3 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was 97 4 when molar ratio of p to n was 1 1 1 at ph 9 5 and ammonia nitrogen was removed in the form of struvite economic evaluation reveals that the treatment

performance 3 1 1 hydroxide precipitation precipitation method is the most common way to remove metal ions from wastewater sajid et al 2018 wen et al 2018 fig 1 shows the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia nitrogen after being treated by naoh ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased slightly and manganese removal efficiency increased obviously as the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 10 5 at the ph of 10 0 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was 20 27 and the removal efficiency of manganese reached to 99 32 emmrl contains a great deal of mn2 mg2 and ca2 the selectivity of mn2 on mg2 and ca2 can be expressed by reactions 4 and 5 according to the stability constants 4 mg oh 2 mn2 mn oh 2 mg2 logk 1 44 5 ca oh 2 mn2 mn oh 2 ca2 logk 7 36 the values of the equilibrium constants k indicate that the selectivity for mn2 is thermodynamically more favorable with ca2 than mg2 zhang and cheng 2007 zhang et al suggested that manganese cannot be reduced to a very low level 5 mg l 1 only by hydroxide precipitation method zhang et al 2010 also hydroxide precipitations are generally difficult to dewater for its amorphous particle structure 3 1 2 sulfide precipitation sulfide precipitation is an important method in hydrometallurgical treatment of industrial effluents in which na2s is often used to precipitate heavy metals in wastewater gharabaghi et al 2012 the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia nitrogen using sulfide precipitation method are shown in fig 2 at a given ph manganese removal efficiency increased gradually as sulfide dose increased but not significantly fig 2a when s to mn molar ratio is constant the removal efficiency of manganese increased as ph increased the removal efficiency of manganese reached 99 99 when solution ph is 10 0 and molar ratio of s to mn is 0 9 1 a s shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen increased from 23 9 to 28 5 as the ph increased from 8 5 to 9 5 when the molar ratio of s to mn was 0 9 1 similarly the concentration of ammonia nitrogen rapidly decreased to 497 82 mg l 1 when the ph value was 10 5 because of the evaporation of ammonia 3 1 3 carbonate precipitation carbonate precipitation method is an important effective and practical method for manganese removal cai et al 2010 na2co3 has often been used to provide carbonate ions to precipitate high concentration manganese in industrial effluents the selectivity of manganese carbonate is more favorable with mg2 than ca2 it is indicated in reactions 6 and reactions 7 6 mgco3 mn2 mnco3 mg2 logk 5 48 7 caco3 mn2 mnco3 ca2 logk 2 35 the removal efficiencies of manganese and ammonia nitrogen are shown in fig 3 in fig 3a the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased slightly as the increase of ph and molar ratio of c to mn when the ph ranged from 8 0 to 10 0 and the molar ratio of c to mn change from 0 9 1 to 1 2 1 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was always less than 28 0 at a given ph the manganese removal efficiency increased gradually as the dose of carbonate increased meanwhile manganese removal efficiency increased as ph value increased at a given molar ratio of c to mn fig 3b fig 3c shows that the removal efficiency of manganese increased from 91 55 to 99 98 as the ph increased from 8 5 to 10 5 when the molar ratio of c to mn is 1 1 1 and the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was less than 28 1 at the ph of 9 5 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen and manganese was 17 0 and 97 4 respectively however when ph was greater than 10 0 ammonia nitrogen can easily form ammonia gas escape from emmrl therefore the optimum ph value was 9 5 in this study 3 2 visual minteq model results in this work 99 0 manganese in emmrl can be removed when using naoh na2s and na2co3 as precipitate agents but the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was less than 40 0 and mainly removed in the form of ammonia gas emmrl includes a certain amount of magnesium which can benefit ammonia nitrogen removal by struvite thermodynamic equilibrium model visual minteq was used to optimize manganese and magnesium removal efficiency from emmrl by adding naoh na2s and na2co3 solutions at different molar ratio and ph value visual minteq is a chemical equilibrium model for calculation of metal speciation solubility equilibria equilibrium of solved and dissolved chemicals in aqueous system gustafsson 2008 buchanan et al revealed that the interaction between ph and nh4 mg2 and po4 3 celen et al 2007 wu and zhou optimized the dosage of alkaline by using visual minteq wu and zhou 2012 table 2 shows the calculated and experimental results under different operational conditions when the ph change from 9 0 to 9 5 the manganese removal efficiency increased from 57 8 to 91 02 in the calculated results and in the experiment results the removal efficiency increased from 48 21 to 89 75 when the molar ratio of s to mn was 0 9 1 and 1 1 the manganese removal efficiency calculated by model was 99 97 and 99 99 respectively and the experimental results was 99 98 and 99 99 the manganese removal efficiency was 99 55 and 99 98 by model prediction when the molar ratio of c to mn was 1 1 and 1 1 1 and the experimental results was 99 81 99 98 the above results showed that the experimental data were in consistent with the calculated outcomes thus the established model was feasible to predict the removal efficiency of magnesium when using different precipitation agents in this study manganese and ammonia nitrogen were fractional removed from emmrl magnesium was crucial to struvite formation and contributed to ammonia nitrogen removal when naoh was used to remove manganese 59 57 magnesium in the emmrl formed co precipitations with manganese hydroxide which hindered the formation of struvite using na2s as precipitation agent 57 11 magnesium formed co precipitation with mns h2o or mnoh sh which was also not avail to form struvite the removal efficiency of magnesium was 2 39 when using sodium carbonate as the precipitation agent at the ph of 9 5 which makes for struvite precipitation for ammonia nitrogen removal therefore na2co3 was chosen to be the optimal precipitant agent for manganese removal from emmrl 3 3 ammonia nitrogen fractional removal performance the removal efficiency of manganese and ammonia nitrogen after struvite precipitation are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a at a given ph ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased gradually as phosphate dose increased at a given molar ratio of p to n the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency increased as ph value increased in fig 4b the removal efficiency of manganese is greater than 99 9 when solution ph is greater than 8 0 at different molar ratio of p to n fig 4c shows that the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen increased from 77 3 to 97 4 as solution ph increased from 7 0 to 9 5 when molar ratio of p to n was 1 1 1 the removal efficiency of ammonia decreased when ph was greater than 10 0 therefore the optimum ph value is 9 5 in this study 3 4 precipitation characteristics the phase compositions of different precipitates are shown in fig 5 in fig 5a the main phases of the precipitates are pyrochroite groutite brucite and manganese oxide hydrate at ph 9 5 and in the visual minteq model the main phases of manganese are mn2 13 15 mn2 oh 3 3 83 66 and mn nh3 2 2 48 magnesium is mainly existed as mg2 99 28 thus manganese is mainly removed in the form of manganese oxide hydrate and magnesium is removed in the form of brucite using naoh as the precipitation agent mn2 0 06 mn hs 99 93 and mn nh3 2 0 01 are the main phase of manganese as well as mg2 99 31 and mgoh 0 57 are the main phase of magnesium using na2s as the precipitation agent at ph 9 5 thus manganese was removed in the form of mns h2o or mnoh sh and magnesium was removed in brucite fig 5b mn2 51 63 mn2 oh 3 35 02 and mnco3aq 1 27 are the main phases of manganese when na2co3 was used to be the precipitate agent thus the main phase of the precipitates is rhodochrosite fig 5c massoni et al 2015 and manganese was removed in the form of mnco3 fig 5d shows that the main phase of the precipitate is struvite the results indicated that ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed in the form of struvite sem micrographs of the precipitates using naoh na2s na2co3 and phosphate as precipitation agents are shown in fig 6 the morphology of the precipitate sample using naoh as precipitate agent was a thin sheet and disorderly deposits fig 6a the precipitates produced by adding na2s were unequal particle size and uneven surfaces fig 6b the precipitates were even spherical particles 4 μm 5 μm when na2co3 was used as precipitation agent fig 6c which was confirmed by edx analysis and can be further confirmed by xrd morphologies of the precipitates after being treated by phosphate analyzed by sem are shown in fig 6d typical shape of struvite crystal was needle or plate like elongated in the longitudinal axis of the crystalline products with diameters between 10 and 30 μm the edx analysis confirmed that the crystals were struvite some of the floral structures remain intact but were mixed with fractured crystals of irregular sizes and cracks and fractures were also observed on the crystal surfaces such surface defects could be attributed to the stress induced by incorporation of foreign ions such as mn2 al3 and ca2 to the crystal lattice or adsorption of these ions onto the crystal surface lou et al 2018 in fig 7 the xps spectra of the different precipitates are presented the measured elements in these samples are oxygen o 1s manganese mn 2p nitrogen n 1s and carbon c 1s in the binding energy from 0 ev to 1300 ev zhu et al 2017 the c1s peak was used for calibration the o1s curves can be resolved into two peaks by deconvolution the peaks at 529 5 529 9 ev can be ascribed to lattice oxygen olat and the shoulder peaks at 531 2 531 5 ev can be assigned to the active surface adsorbed oxygen oads du et al 2012 the active oads contents oads olat oads on the surface of the different precipitates are shown in table 3 the oads content accounted for 93 41 using naoh as precipitate agent the oads content reduced to 91 29 in na2s process the oads content value was 99 99 and 100 00 respectively using carbonate and struvite precipitation methods as shown in fig 7b the principal peaks at 400 8 ev can be identified as nh4 using na2s as precipitation liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 the principal peaks at 401 5 ev can be identified as struvite precipitation no peak was founded when naoh and na2co3 were used as precipitate agents the results showed that ammonia gas was mainly generated by using naoh and na2co3 and ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed via adsorption in the process of na2s precipitation as well as ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed in the form of struvite when phosphate was used to be precipitate agents the mn2p binding energy of the precipitate samples is displayed in fig 7c three different valences of manganese stuck to the precipitates surface the principal peaks at 640 1 641 4 and 642 5 653 8 ev can be identified as mn2 mn3 and mn4 respectively lee and bai 2018 wang et al 2012 the low valence manganese mn2 3 contents mn2 3 mn2 mn3 mn4 on the surface of different precipitate are listed in table 3 in which mn2 3 content maintain in 33 33 when using naoh na2s and na2co3 as the precipitate agent no obvious binding energy of the mn 2p was found in the precipitate samples when using phosphate as precipitate agents the results showed that almost no manganese existed in the struvite phase transitions of the precipitates were analyzed via ft ir in fig 8 a broad peak is observed between 3600 cm 1 and 2500 cm 1 which could be attributed to the overlapping of various oh stretching vibrations sinha et al 2014 as shown in fig 8a b the h o h deformation of water is observed at 1680 cm 1 a peak is observed near 555 cm 1 which could be attributed to mn o stretching vibrations the result showed that manganese was removed in the form of manganese oxides the ft ir spectra of mnco3 are shown in fig 8d vardhan et al 2018 phase transition of the precipitates in fig 8c was similar to fig 8d which further indicated that using na2co3 can mainly obtain mnco3 in fig 8e the various vibrational bands of po4 3 and p o p units are observed at 1100 cm 1 1010 cm 1 and 574 cm 1 the bands for h n h deformation modes of nh4 can be seen at 1440 cm 1 ammonium water hydrogen bonding can be observed at 895 cm 1 and water water hydrogen bonding is observed at 760 cm 1 this result indicated that ammonia nitrogen was mainly removed by struvite and the results can be further confirmed by xrd fig 5 and sem eds fig 6 3 5 manganese and ammonia nitrogen fractional removal mechanisms according to xrd ft ir sem eds and xps analysis and combining with the removal efficiency of nh4 and mn2 the schematic of the experiment is shown in fig 9 the reaction equations of different precipitation methods are as follows 1 hydroxide precipitation 2oh mg2 fe2 ca2 mg fe ca oh 2 2naoh mn2

analyzed in an economic viewpoint for different precipitation methods can realize industrialization application the processing cost was estimated by using industrial chemical reagent according to chemical reagent dosage in laboratory in this assessment the costs of the chemicals used in the process possible technology evaluation cost and the commercial price of the recovered mnco3 and struvite were considered the commercial prices of the chemicals according to alibaba in the calculations are given in table 4 using hydroxide sulfide and carbonate in precipitation methods the total costs were 1 920 m 3 1 508 m 3 and 1 828 m 3 respectively obviously the cost was higher using naoh and na2co3 than using na2s kularatne et al 2009 meanwhile sulfide precipitation method was not widely used because of its toxicity and corrosiveness when applied excessively and the dosage of sulfide was difficult to be controlled lewis 2010 the moisture of precipitation obtained by naoh methods was high and it is low resource utilization moreover when using naoh and na2s the removal efficiency of mg2 is higher than using na2co3 therefore na2co3 was chosen to remove ammonia nitrogen agent from emmrl in this study na2co3 was used to remove mn2 and then phosphate was used to remove nh4 from emmrl and the total cost was 7 456 m 3 possible technology evaluation costs amount to 1 860 m 3 mainly consist of filtration process 0 15 m 3 labor cost 0 52 m 3 energy charge 0 86 m 3 and facilities maintenance 0 33 m 3 therefore the total cost of emmrl treatment was 9 316 m 3 the purity of manganese obtained in mnco3 was 45 87 the content of magnesium is greater than 30 ppm according to hg t4203 201 therefore mnco3 was belongs to industrial grade which the commercial price was 1 147 kg 1 according to alibaba at least the purity of struvite in this study was 96 0 even it contained ca2 k and mn2 the struvite still can meet farm level grade and the price was 316 0 t at least according to alibaba the obtained industrial grade mnco3 and farm level grade struvite can be sold for 1 147 kg 1 and 0 359 kg 1 at least respectively as well as the total recovery price was higher 7 500 m 3 in addition if industrial chemical treating agent were replaced with waste phosphoric acid and co2 the costs would be much lower shu et al 2016b huang et al 2014 thus the costs of precipitation method could be further reduced in future experiments 4 conclusions in this study a comparative investigation of hydroxide precipitation sulfide precipitation carbonate precipitation and the struvite formation process for removal of manganese and ammonia nitrogen from emmrl was investigated visual minteq was applied to simulate the chemical reactions and optimize chemical dosages in the manganese removal and the experimental results corresponded well with the model outputs in terms of manganese removal efficiency the results showed carbonate precipitation method has advantages over the other two methods for removal of manganese and ammonia nitrogen when c mn molar ratio was 1 1 1 at ph 9 5 the removal efficiency of manganese was 99 9 and manganese was removed in the form of mnco3 the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen was 97 4 when molar ratio of p to n was 1 1 1 at ph 9 5 and ammonia nitrogen was removed in the form of struvite economic evaluation reveals that the treatment cost was 9 316 m 3 when na2co3 and phosphate was used to fractional removal manganese and ammonia nitrogen from emmrl acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of

19017,the delivery of water services to the poor is lagging yet local causes and manifestations of this are not well understood better data is needed to identify inequalities where they occur explore underlying reasons and develop strategies to achieve more equitable access a focus on the local scale is important because this is where water services are delivered and inequalities in access can be best observed this paper presents a mixed methods study of poor households access to piped water in rural viet nam providing insight into local dynamics of the water poverty nexus findings pointed to lower rates of piped water access for poor households across areas served by government private and community service providers connection fees were found to be the primary barrier to poor households accessing available piped services the study also found that where financial support is provided poor households can achieve comparable or even higher rates of access key implications of the study are the demonstrated value of and yet challenges associated with rigorous local level monitoring to ensure equitable quality service delivery keywords water services poverty piped water viet nam mixed methods 1 introduction global monitoring of access to water indicates persistently lower rates of access to improved sources for the poor compared with other groups a situation particularly evident in rural areas who unicef 2017 the need to focus efforts on ensuring water services reach the poorest and most marginalised has been recognised by the international community sustainable development goal sdg 6 calls for the achievement of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 in line with the agenda 2030 commitment to leave no one behind united nations 2015 this aligns with efforts to realise the human rights to water and sanitation for all without discrimination un special rapporteur 2014 to achieve universal equitable access to water services sharper focus is needed on inequalities in access between groups such as rich and poor rural and urban or potentially disadvantaged groups versus the general population disaggregated and higher resolution data is needed to identify inequalities where they occur explore underlying reasons and develop strategies for improving equality of access recent efforts by the who unicef joint monitoring program jmp have made advances in this area with country and global datasets now incorporating wealth quintile and sub national differences in access to services who unicef 2017 yet knowledge gaps remain particularly at local levels where inequalities translate into lived experiences and where ultimate responsibility for ensuring universal water services lies pati and neumeyer 2018 keatman et al 2017 there is a need for data that provides insight into the local dynamics of poverty and water access including identifying reasons for non uptake of available services and exploring outcomes associated with different models of service delivery research on private and social enterprise service delivery has found that programs might monitor the participation of poor households in program activities but there is a gap in data on actual outcomes for the poor gero et al 2014 such data will provide critical information towards development of strategies to address current inequities and work towards achievement of universal water access yet this data is notoriously difficult to collect with challenges compounded in developing country contexts where water services can often evolve ad hoc without coordinated planning grant et al 2016 resulting in challenges related to defining service area boundaries and identifying rates of connection seeking to address the data gap on local level water inequality this paper reports on a mixed methods study of poor households access to piped water in rural viet nam and illustrates how the methodological challenges in doing so can be overcome the objectives of the study were twofold i to determine the extent to which piped water services are reaching poor households and ii to identify explanatory reasons for non connection of poor households with reference to both of these objectives we also sought to compare the relative success or otherwise of different service provider types in reaching poor households looking across government private and community based models we first provide a brief overview of water and poverty dynamics in viet nam we then present materials and methods used including qualitative and statistical analysis components the methodology applied was tailored to facilitate rigorous analysis of the kind of fuzzy data typically available in developing country contexts and as such offers both an approach with potential for further application in comparable situations and insight into the particular challenges and limitations faced the results of the analysis are presented and discussed including relative rates of water access between poor and non poor households and reasons for non connection finally we consider how this research might inform efforts to better understand disadvantage as the world strives for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable water by 2030 2 water poverty in viet nam in 2018 the government of viet nam released its response to the sustainable development goals emphasising its commitment to achieving goal 6 of the sdgs with a focus on pricing and affordability government of viet nam 2017 this is important since at the national level in viet nam a quarter of the poorest wealth quintile in rural areas are without access to an improved water source compared with near universal access for the highest wealth quintiles fig 1 the figures are even more pronounced for piped water in particular access to piped water is an important measure given global research indicating that piped supplies are significantly less likely to be contaminated between source and household storage compared with non piped supplies shields et al 2015 and that water piped to premises results in a 75 reduction in diarrheal illness higher than any other water sanitation or hygiene intervention wolf et al 2018 only 5 of the poorest wealth quintile in rural viet nam have access to piped water compared with 47 of the wealthiest quintile possible reasons for lower poor household connection rates have been outlined in research focused on private enterprise water service delivery batzella and ljung 2014 grant et al 2016 these include the cost of connection particularly when fees are set on a cost recovery basis and the location of poor households in a context where service delivery evolves in a piecemeal and opportunistic fashion this study sought to contribute further evidence by analyzing rates of connection between poor and non poor households and comparing the relative success of different types of service providers across private government and community based models the need to consider the relative success of different service provider types in reaching poor households is critical given the current government of viet nam policy focus on increasing the role of private providers in service delivery in rural areas a national government policy circular 131 establishes incentives for private water service providers in the form of co financing land and tax exemptions grant et al 2016 willetts et al 2017 yet application of this policy by provincial governments has been partial and in some cases processes for enterprises to access the incentives is complex limiting their uptake willetts et al 2017 nonetheless there are an increasing number of private providers and their effectiveness in reaching the poor must be compared with other existing service provider types namely government or government owned enterprises and community managed systems 3 material and methods 3 1 research questions and overall approach the study addressed two research questions 1 to what extent are piped water services reaching poor households 2 in cases where disparities exist between rates of poor and non poor household connection why are poor households not connected to piped water supplies research question 1 rq1 was considered at two scales i commune village wide and ii water service areas within communes communes are a local administrative boundary in viet nam there can be one or more water service areas within a commune and water service areas can also cross commune boundaries though this was less common in case study locations looking at an entire commune we first investigated the location of poor households with reference to water service area boundaries for the study water service area was defined by water service providers during interviews as the area within reasonable geographic reach of a service provider s piped network within which households would typically have the option to connect secondly focusing within water service areas we investigated rates of connection of poor households and compared these with overall connection rates to answer research question 2 rq2 insights from literature on possible explanatory reasons for non connection were tested through interviews with service providers and poor households interviews also included more open ended discussion about the history of water service provision and any specific efforts made to reach poor households across both research questions analysis described further below involved comparison of service provider types government private community this assessed the relative success of different provider types in reaching poor households rq1 and considered explanatory reasons related to the different business models rq2 different business models represented in case study communes included state owned enterprises private enterprises ranging in size from medium large corporations to household businesses and various community based models including cooperatives and water user associations the study approach draws from a body of literature on mixed methodologies which asserts the value of methodological pluralism for addressing complexity onwuegbuzie and leech 2017 it followed a pragmatic approach to research prompting the selection of quantitative and qualitative methodologies best able to answer the research question s johnson and onwuegbuzie 2013 key steps in the research process are summarised in fig 2 including interviews data collection and analysis activities ethical approval for the study was secured through standard university of technology sydney institute for sustainable futures ethics procedures a detailed presentation of study location data collection and sampling as well as statistical and qualitative analysis processes is provided below 3 2 study area the study area included six communes across three provinces in viet nam s red river and mekong river deltas fig 3 case study communes were selected based on preliminary data received from the ministry of agriculture and rural development s institute for water resource economics and management iwem the national centre for rural water supply and sanitation ncerwass and relevant provincial centres for rural water supply and sanitation pcerwass preliminary data identified local poverty rates water access figures the number and types of water service providers operating in each commune and any available information concerning efforts that had been made to reach poor households in selecting case study communes we sought to include a mix of communes in the north and the south to cover areas with different geographies and socio economic characteristics communes in which both private enterprises and other types of service providers were operating to facilitate comparison and a mix of sites where service providers had made particular efforts to include poor households and sites where they had not in two of the selected case study communes the relevant private water providers had participated in a non government organisation output based aid oba program in which a subsidy was paid based on total household connections across poor and non poor households oba is a form of results based financing used in contexts when customers are not able to pay the full cost of access to services and where performance based subsidies complement or replace user fees nguyen et al 2014 this provided opportunity to explore the influence of this kind of program on poor household connection rates 3 3 data collection and sampling a team of field researchers comprising representatives from central institute for natural resources and environmental studies viet nam national university and the university of technology sydney undertook data collection with the assistance of local provincial centres for rural water supply and sanitation and commune people s committees all meetings and interviews were conducted in vietnamese with english translation for the non vietnamese research team members qualitative and quantitative data was collected through interviews with 1031 registered poor householders as well as water service providers n 17 local commune people s committees cpc n 6 and provincial authorities n 3 all poor households registered on official commune poverty lists were visited n 1031 and were the sample for the statistical analysis the official government of viet nam definition of poverty for rural areas was used which at the time of research was based on an income threshold of vnd 400 000 usd 17 50 person month 1 1 decision no 09 2011 qd ttg of january 30 2011 setting norms on poor households and households in danger of falling into poverty for the 2011 2015 period in each case study commune interviews with officials were conducted to understand the commune context and history total commune population and lists of registered poor households water service providers were interviewed to clarify the history and operation of their water system including any pro poor mechanisms in place define the boundaries of each water service area and determine the total number of connected households water service area boundaries were defined in discussion with water service providers taking account of approximated pipe locations and the geographic accessibility of different locations with reference to e g waterways and roads interviews with poor households were conducted to determine if registered poor households were connected to a piped water source reasons for non connection and their primary drinking water sources global positioning system gps coordinates were logged for each poor household visited gps coordinates were used to determine if visited households were located inside a water service area wsa fig 3 presents an example commune showing households visited as included or excluded from a wsa data for non poor households were calculated using information provided by commune officials and water service providers on the total number of households in the commune the number of households in each water service area and the number of connected households in each water service area numbers of non poor households were calculated as the difference between total household and poor household numbers based on detailed information about the location and connection status of each poor household 3 4 analytical approach 3 4 1 statistical analysis two separate analysis processes both using typical null hypothesis significance testing methods were undertaken reflecting the two scales of interest i commune level analysis testing the association between inclusion in a water service area and household poverty status and ii water service area analysis testing the association between household poverty and connection status for the second analysis a stratified chi squared χ2 test was used as differences in the operations of the water service providers were expected to confound results when analysing aggregated data across the commune for this reason the mantel haenszel procedure was used which is a useful method for obtaining estimates of association adjusted for the effect of confounding variables mantel and haenszel 1959 mosteller 1968 gastwirth 1984 this modification along with a full explanation of the statistical analysis process is described in detail in appendix a in addition to computed chi squared statistics relative risks were calculated as an appropriate and intuitive measure of the degree of association between two dichotomous variables ospina et al 2012 for the commune wide analysis these are a measure of magnitude of association which approximate how much more or less likely it is for non poor households to be within a water service area for the intra wsa analysis relative risks provide a measure of the size of association between poverty and connection status for each water service area in communes where relative risk across water service areas were homogenous a mantel haenszel risk ratio was also computed which is a weighted average of the varying water service providers risk ratios indicating the size of the association between poverty status and connection status across water service providers i e a common relative risk 3 4 2 qualitative analysis an embedded design approach involved parallel collation of qualitative and quantitative data qualitative data was collected during interviews with provincial and commune officials water service providers and householders semi structured interview questions related to the history of water service provision any mechanisms from government or water service provider for supporting poor households access reasons why poor households were not connected to available piped water services and differences in service delivery approaches across water service provider types open ended interview questions also created space for discussion of any additional issues related to water service delivery raised by interviewees topic areas guiding interviews are provided in appendix b qualitative data for each commune was collated and discussed by research team members during workshops in the field to identify patterns emerging themes and any potential inconsistencies findings were then synthesized and considered with reference to the statistical analysis which informed the development of case study reports for each commune qualitative findings relating to the experiences of water service providers and poor households were also contextualised with reference to separate but related research activities undertaken by the team which focused on regulatory arrangements for private water service provision water operator functionality and customer satisfaction described in willetts et al 2017 3 5 limitations defining poverty status with reference to an income threshold likely underestimates the number of disadvantaged households as those classified as near poor would fit within the international standard of poverty income of less than us1 per day further income based approaches to defining poverty have been critiqued as simplistic and failing to capture the complexity of poverty with its multiple potential aspects of deprivation as identified for example by the multidimensional poverty index however in the absence of a viable alternative to inform identification of poor households in case study communes the official definition was used as the best available measure during an earlier qualitative phase of the research an asset ownership review was conducted for households identified as poor on official lists the correlation between official poverty status and the lived experiences of households was found to be sound grant et al 2016 in addition to challenges defining poverty it is important to note that the study focused on poverty rather than other aspects of potential disadvantage such as gender or disability which also affect access to improved water supplies noga and wolbring 2012 leahy et al 2017 it would be beneficial for future research to consider multiple dimensions of potential disadvantage to determine how they intersect to shape access to piped water a further limitation relates to the quality of data collected specifically in relation to the total number of households in each commune and the number of households connected to piped water services by service providers while figures used were verified by a number of internal sources commune officials water service providers and district authorities there remained a minor degree of uncertainty around the total number of connected households further informal secondary connections such as from one household to a neighbouring family property were anecdotally quite common but difficult to account for the limitation in data quality was addressed through the selection of an analysis methodology appropriate for the available data these analysis adjustments form a valuable contribution to further research of this nature given that comprehensive and clear data is typically challenging to obtain in rural developing contexts nevertheless it should be acknowledged that randomised sampling across all households in a commune would yield more accurate and in depth analysis suitable for statistical modelling i e regression but would also be significantly more resource intensive similarly purposive sampling of communes limits the representativeness of the study across rural viet nam though was necessary given logistical practicalities and the aim to include a mix of government community and private piped systems 4 results and discussion this section presents and discusses six key findings from the analysis i in two of six communes water service area locations favoured non poor households with no significant difference found in the other four communes ii in most cases the probability of poor households being connected to piped water was lower than non poor households iii connection fees were the primary barrier to poor households accessing piped water iv no single type of service provider model across government community and private providers was found to be more successful in reaching poor households v where particular efforts were made to reach poor households connection rates were more equitable vi sustainability of service delivery was revealed to be a concern with implications for poor households access finally we reflect on implications from the research methods and findings for understanding how water access inequality plays out at local scales pointing to both the value and challenges of local level research and monitoring 4 1 in two of six communes water service area locations favoured non poor households in two communes a and e the research found that the probability of non poor households being located in a water service area were higher than for poor households with risk ratios of 2 7 and 5 7 table 1 in both communes households outside of the water service areas tended to be in more challenging locations for example in commune a fig 4 poor households outside the water service areas tended to be situated directly adjacent to the river and slightly away from other clusters of houses in one instance a poor household was in an informal location with their official address in a resettlement area across the commune the piped network went past this informal area but did not serve it in commune e the area not located within water service areas was in the northern tip of the commune fig 5 interviews with officials and water service providers identified constraints in extending piped networks to more challenging locations including the need to recoup investment costs from user connection fees discussed further below in section 4 3 in a third commune d the research found no significant difference in the location of poor and non poor households with reference to water service areas in the remaining three case study communes this research question was not relevant as piped networks were available across the commune such that no areas were classified as being outside a water service area defined as an area within which households had the option to connect 4 2 poor households had lower probability of connection to available piped water the research found evidence that within water service areas poor households had lower rates of connection to piped water services four of the six communes had at least one or more water service area in which the probability of poor households being connected to piped water were lower than non poor households this finding applied across seven of the ten water services areas in these four communes selected water services areas within these same communes showed different results with either no significant difference between poor and non poor connection rates in two service areas or in one commune a situation where the poor had greater probability of being connected to piped water discussed further below in section 4 4 table 2 summarises findings across all communes and water services areas presenting relative risks where these were relevant measures for comparing poor and non poor connection rates in commune a the probability of non poor households being connected was found to be 1 3 times higher than poor households this applied across all three water service areas in the commune which included one managed by a large construction company prompted to enter the water supply market due to government subsidies for capital works a household business and a cooperative none of the three service providers offered support to encourage poor households to connect the different ages and histories of the systems were reflected in different levels of service and customer satisfaction which may also have influenced poor households willingness to connect the older household business and cooperative systems suffered from intermittent service and low customer demand related to perceptions of low quality while the newer private service charged higher connection fees on a cost recovery basis seen as prohibitive for poor households of the two service providers operating in commune b the private enterprise supplied 22 of the 24 hamlets with the community managed scheme serving the remaining two in both water service areas the probability of non poor households connecting was found to be higher than poor households within the community managed water service area this can be explained by affordability constraints and the absence of support mechanisms for poor household connection due to lack of service provider funds and a stated belief that all households should be offered the same deal as non poor households findings for the private water service area were surprising given the reported by the service provider availability of two mechanisms to assist poor households to connect i households experiencing financial difficulty could pay their connection fee in instalments and ii poor households were exempt from the minimum contracted water use of 4 m3 month however household interviews revealed that these support mechanisms were not well known across the commune potentially explaining the lower overall connection rates for poor households in communes d and e two of the water service areas one in each commune indicated higher rates of connection for non poor households these included a private enterprise and a state owned enterprise the private enterprise reported to have offered support for poor households in the form of discounts and free advice however as was the case in commune b these were not found to be widely known by poor households the state owned enterprise offered free connection in response to a recent provincial policy decision which should in principle have facilitated higher rates of poor household connection but interviews identified significant delays in the fulfilment of connection requests of the remaining three service providers in these two communes two both in commune d had no significant difference in rates of connection between poor and non poor households and one a private enterprise service area in commune e showed higher rates of connection for poor households these are explored further below section 4 5 of the remaining two communes in one f there was insufficient data available to compare service areas and determine the relative rates of poor non poor connection because one of the water service areas crossed commune boundaries and the service provider was not able to identify numbers of connections within the case study commune further different interviewees gave different reports on overall connection rates in the commune in the other commune c the research found no significant difference between rates of poor and non poor connection though it is important to note factors that may have reduced demand for piped water across all poor and non poor households as evidenced by the overall low rate of access across the commune 40 specifically the quality of piped water and service reliability across both service areas was reported to be low by surveyed poor households there was a strongly expressed preference to use rainwater when available and a previous international non government organisation aid program had assisted households to install protected wells in light of these factors it is likely that both poor and non poor households did not prioritise connecting to piped systems particularly when connection fees were perceived to be high as discussed further below 4 3 connection fees were unaffordable for poor households across all case study communes and across government community and private enterprise water service areas poor households reported their reason for not accessing piped water when available as inability to afford the connection fee fig 6 this was a particularly clear finding in four communes a b c d with 68 100 of non connected households citing unaffordability of the connection fee as their primary reason for non connection across all water service areas this finding was consistent with a previous phase of the research which found connection fees to be reported as the principal barrier to piped water access grant et al 2016 as well as connection fees being unaffordable householder interviews revealed resentment towards service providers related to the cost of connection fees influenced by perceptions and mis perceptions about the costs involved in piped service delivery and its profitability for example one householder questioned how could they charge so much when they just pump water from the river and another asserted they are making a fortune and not helping us at all in considering the barrier posed by connection fees it is important to note that connection fees may be broadly interpreted by households as comprising all costs associated with accessing the piped system for example one householder in commune c reported that she had been connected but had not been able to afford to build a mandatory storage tank required to cope with intermittent and variable water pressure and so was cut off from the service allowing for differences in interpretation of what constitutes connection fees the range of fees across case study communes was wide from free connection a recent development due to a provincial policy directive in tien giang province to vnd 4 million usd 175 with a median fee of vnd 600 000 usd 26 representing 150 of the monthly income threshold used to define poor households in two communes e f unaffordability of the connection fee was also the most common reason for non connection but the finding was less stark as compared with other cited reasons in commune f while acknowledging limitations relating to the reliability of data in this commune 50 of non connected households cited unaffordability of connection fee as the primary barrier this may be due to the fact that poor households were offered free connection by private enterprises participating in an output based aid scheme or on occasion through the charity of service providers as reported during service provider interviews other notable reasons were that connection was not offered 33 which contradicts information from the water service providers that these households were within water service areas and that the tariff was unaffordable 28 in commune e 40 of non connected households cited unaffordability of the connection fee as their reason for not accessing the piped water service other reasons were cited by almost 30 of non connected households these included for example households that had applied for a connection but failed to receive the service 4 4 no particular service provider type was more successful at reaching poor households the research did not reveal strong differences between service provider types across private government and community models in terms of their success in reaching poor households points of difference were however evident in different business models namely connection fees and the degree of payment flexibility offered to customers private enterprises included in the study tended to charge higher connection fees compared with other types of service providers a finding which was supported by a wider survey of water service providers grant et al 2016 in some cases private enterprises reportedly sought to offset higher connection fees by offering flexible payment options including discounts exemptions and payment by instalment this was not similarly reported by government and community service providers however it is important to note that discounts offered by private enterprises included in the research may have been partly driven by their participation in a civil society output based aid program discussed further below and a consequent incentive to increase overall numbers of connections so further investigation would be required to determine the extent to which private enterprises more generally offer flexible payment options further differences between private enterprises may be more important in driving pro poor approaches than differences between private and government or community models motivations and business management practices differed substantially with interviews revealing strong pro social motives in some service providers while others were more focused on income generation water user association and community managed schemes tended not to provide targeted support for poor households reasons included the fact that the selected schemes typically relied on shared capital investment from participating households and support for the poor would require cross subsidisation in the form of additional investment from other member households further these schemes required often complex processes of collective decision making which may have served as a barrier to the provision of support mechanisms for the poor if consensus on their appropriateness could not be reached this was not a barrier for private enterprises who could decide autonomously to offer pro poor support overall in the absence of civil society programs or government policies driving a focus on the poor water service providers did not offer targeted support this indicates a need to be proactive in terms of policies requiring service providers to focus on reaching poor households such that existing gaps between poor and non poor access can be addressed in future water schemes given the clear finding that connection fees were the primary barrier for poor households strategies to either subsidise these fees and or facilitate flexible payment arrangements should be the focus of pro poor policy development 4 5 support mechanisms facilitated equitable connection rates the research identified one service area where the probability of poor households being connected to piped water was 1 7 times higher than for non poor households risk ratio 0 6 this service area in commune e was administered by a private enterprise operating since 1997 in addition to almost 20 years of operating experience in recent years the enterprise had participated in an output based aid oba program administered by the international non government organisation east meets west foundation east meets west foundation has applied an oba approach in viet nam since 2007 in relevant case study communes the oba approach was used to mobilise private finance by incentivising service providers to increase household connections private enterprises pre financed capital expenditure and received partial reimbursement on verification of household connections nguyen et al 2014 the partial reimbursement was provided for all household connections regardless of poverty status though east meets west actively encouraged a focus on poor households given that this water service area represents a reversal of the dominant finding that the poor are less likely to be connected to piped water services efforts were made to understand whether particular strategies were employed by this enterprise to target poor households and any other potential reasons for higher poor household connection rates no one reason was found to provide a definitive explanation and it is likely that a number of interrelated factors contributed to this enterprise s relative success in reaching the poor first the enterprise had been operating in this location for almost 20 years and hence had both extensive experience managing a water business and strong social ties within the community this contributed to both a pro poor outlook and sufficient security in business management to facilitate the provision of support mechanisms to poor households this financial security points to a fundamental link between the viability of a business delivering a water service and managing related assets which depends on many factors including government mandated connection fees and tariffs and the ability in financial terms to offer pro poor support second the owner of the private enterprise was buddhist and motivated by his religious beliefs provided case by case support to poor households this aligns with research identifying pro social motives as drivers of water entrepreneurship in viet nam and elsewhere with religion identified as one of a number of underlying factors along with empathy for the poor and related community roles or positions willetts et al 2016 third the enterprise offered a reasonably low connection fee of vnd 500 000 usd 22 which is likely related to participation in the oba program through which a payment was made for each connection achieved allowing the enterprise to pass on savings in connection fees to customers this external support while not mandating pro poor behaviour reduced the costs of connection for all households and created conditions that enabled targeting and greater participation of poor households it is also pertinent to consider the case of two water service areas in commune d where no significant difference was found between rates of poor and non poor access these water service areas represent situations where water service providers reached poor households at similar rates to the general population and in doing so did not contribute to further marginalisation of poor households as is the case in areas where the poor had lower rates of access one of these two service areas was operated by a private enterprise that had also participated in the east meets west oba program this case was very recent geographically contained a small island and only has 315 households in total the service provider reached almost all households in the service area the other a water user association system was an older scheme with high overall rates of connection across both poor and non poor households but concerns regarding sustainability low connection fees and tariffs while potentially creating favourable conditions for poor household connection were threatening the ongoing viability of the service with assets due for renewal and insufficient funds for capital maintenance 4 6 service sustainability was a concern with implications for poor households access a final finding relates to issues that emerged during semi structured interviews and which have relevance for decision making by poor households around connection to piped services in particular service providers and householders identified concerns relating to household use of multiple water sources water quality and water business viability across non connected poor households in all communes the research found a householder preference for rainwater fig 7 interviews with commune officials and service providers suggested that connected households poor and non poor also preferentially used rainwater when available for drinking and cooking based on an end use analysis of domestic water use in viet nam drinking and cooking could account for more than 20 of total water demand retamal et al 2011 reasons for preferring rainwater included better taste and perceived higher quality of rainwater compared with piped water in the north in particular where the dominant source of piped water was surface water concerns about increasing levels of agricultural and industrial pollution were expressed by both service providers and householders householders also described rainwater as more consistent and reliable compared with piped services which experienced interruptions and were sometimes muddy in appearance the use of multiple sources of water has been noted in other research in viet nam elliot et al 2011 and is a subject of current sector discussion elliot et al 2017 related to the preference for rainwater service providers reported reductions in demand particularly during the rainy season this meant demand for piped water was seasonal and that this seasonal variability in demand may have implications for managing viable water businesses water user association and other community managed schemes in particular were struggling to remain viable in the context of both low demand and low government mandated tariffs many schemes included in the research had reached an age where capital maintenance or upgrading was required yet revenue was reported to be insufficient to meet this need this reflects a common challenge globally in sustainability of rural water supplies fonseca et al 2011 in addition these schemes struggled to secure capital finance particularly in a policy context such as is the case in viet nam where the focus of support had shifted to increasing private sector involvement willetts et al 2017 finally some water service providers were focused on increasing customer demand for water as their strategy to increase revenue and remain viable in this context determining and monitoring sustainable extraction rates particularly in areas drawing from groundwater was a critical need and one that was not a focus at the time of this study 4 7 local level research and monitoring is both valuable and challenging reviewing the methods and findings of this study generated insights worth sharing to inform future research as well as local government monitoring initiatives first the process of data collection was challenging and resource intensive the study required significant effort cost and innovation in methods in response to a lack of reliable information and data related to this findings were nuanced between and within communes meaning translation into policy and investment recommendations needs careful consideration while the findings clearly show a gap in water service for poor households across the communes investigated this was not a universal picture and it was challenging to interpret the complexity given sometimes contradictory information across both qualitative and quantitative research components the dynamics around water provision and poverty are likely to be similarly complex in other locations making both understanding the situation and then developing strategies to reduce inequalities a substantial undertaking nevertheless the study generated valuable insights and sufficient clarity of findings to indicate that targeted support is required to avoid systematic exclusion of poor households from water services further the study proved the value of a mixed methods approach in addressing complex situations the statistical analysis provided evidence of inequalities in water access and indicated a need to consider poverty dimensions of both the location of water services and individual household connections when planning future investments qualitative findings ensured nuances and influencing factors were brought to light which are critical when translating research findings into policy directions more generally the research raises questions about how to manage local level monitoring to inform local level decision making around inclusive water service delivery further work is needed to consider i what scale and type of data is essential to facilitate poor inclusive service delivery ii who should be tasked with collecting and analysing it and iii the roles of different actors in translating data into decision making and regulation around water service planning and delivery these questions have implications for water service providers commune authorities commune people s committees and provincial authorities provincial people s committees and provincial centres for rural water supply and sanitation 5 conclusion reaching all with affordable reliable and safe water is central to realise the human right to water and fulfil the ambitions of the sustainable development goals achieving universal access requires improving our understanding of the local dynamics of water access in order to inform local government activities in planning regulating and sometimes delivering water services this study explored local experiences of piped water access for 1031 poor households in rural viet nam findings pointed to lower rates of piped water access for poor households across areas served by government private and community service providers with connection fees the primary barrier strategies for improving the affordability of connection fees should therefore be a focus for both service providers and local governments in planning more inclusive water service delivery the study also found cases where financial assistance for private enterprises enabled more equitable outcomes suggesting opportunity to support and incentivise poor inclusive service delivery across service provider types finally the research highlights both the value and complexity of rigorous local level water service monitoring further work is needed to strengthen local level monitoring such that governments can better understand and respond to inequalities in water service provision acknowledgements funding this work was supported by the australian department of foreign affairs through the australian

19017,the delivery of water services to the poor is lagging yet local causes and manifestations of this are not well understood better data is needed to identify inequalities where they occur explore underlying reasons and develop strategies to achieve more equitable access a focus on the local scale is important because this is where water services are delivered and inequalities in access can be best observed this paper presents a mixed methods study of poor households access to piped water in rural viet nam providing insight into local dynamics of the water poverty nexus findings pointed to lower rates of piped water access for poor households across areas served by government private and community service providers connection fees were found to be the primary barrier to poor households accessing available piped services the study also found that where financial support is provided poor households can achieve comparable or even higher rates of access key implications of the study are the demonstrated value of and yet challenges associated with rigorous local level monitoring to ensure equitable quality service delivery keywords water services poverty piped water viet nam mixed methods 1 introduction global monitoring of access to water indicates persistently lower rates of access to improved sources for the poor compared with other groups a situation particularly evident in rural areas who unicef 2017 the need to focus efforts on ensuring water services reach the poorest and most marginalised has been recognised by the international community sustainable development goal sdg 6 calls for the achievement of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 in line with the agenda 2030 commitment to leave no one behind united nations 2015 this aligns with efforts to realise the human rights to water and sanitation for all without discrimination un special rapporteur 2014 to achieve universal equitable access to water services sharper focus is needed on inequalities in access between groups such as rich and poor rural and urban or potentially disadvantaged groups versus the general population disaggregated and higher resolution data is needed to identify inequalities where they occur explore underlying reasons and develop strategies for improving equality of access recent efforts by the who unicef joint monitoring program jmp have made advances in this area with country and global datasets now incorporating wealth quintile and sub national differences in access to services who unicef 2017 yet knowledge gaps remain particularly at local levels where inequalities translate into lived experiences and where ultimate responsibility for ensuring universal water services lies pati and neumeyer 2018 keatman et al 2017 there is a need for data that provides insight into the local dynamics of poverty and water access including identifying reasons for non uptake of available services and exploring outcomes associated with different models of service delivery research on private and social enterprise service delivery has found that programs might monitor the participation of poor households in program activities but there is a gap in data on actual outcomes for the poor gero et al 2014 such data will provide critical information towards development of strategies to address current inequities and work towards achievement of universal water access yet this data is notoriously difficult to collect with challenges compounded in developing country contexts where water services can often evolve ad hoc without coordinated planning grant et al 2016 resulting in challenges related to defining service area boundaries and identifying rates of connection seeking to address the data gap on local level water inequality this paper reports on a mixed methods study of poor households access to piped water in rural viet nam and illustrates how the methodological challenges in doing so can be overcome the objectives of the study were twofold i to determine the extent to which piped water services are reaching poor households and ii to identify explanatory reasons for non connection of poor households with reference to both of these objectives we also sought to compare the relative success or otherwise of different service provider types in reaching poor households looking across government private and community based models we first provide a brief overview of water and poverty dynamics in viet nam we then present materials and methods used including qualitative and statistical analysis components the methodology applied was tailored to facilitate rigorous analysis of the kind of fuzzy data typically available in developing country contexts and as such offers both an approach with potential for further application in comparable situations and insight into the particular challenges and limitations faced the results of the analysis are presented and discussed including relative rates of water access between poor and non poor households and reasons for non connection finally we consider how this research might inform efforts to better understand disadvantage as the world strives for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable water by 2030 2 water poverty in viet nam in 2018 the government of viet nam released its response to the sustainable development goals emphasising its commitment to achieving goal 6 of the sdgs with a focus on pricing and affordability government of viet nam 2017 this is important since at the national level in viet nam a quarter of the poorest wealth quintile in rural areas are without access to an improved water source compared with near universal access for the highest wealth quintiles fig 1 the figures are even more pronounced for piped water in particular access to piped water is an important measure given global research indicating that piped supplies are significantly less likely to be contaminated between source and household storage compared with non piped supplies shields et al 2015 and that water piped to premises results in a 75 reduction in diarrheal illness higher than any other water sanitation or hygiene intervention wolf et al 2018 only 5 of the poorest wealth quintile in rural viet nam have access to piped water compared with 47 of the wealthiest quintile possible reasons for lower poor household connection rates have been outlined in research focused on private enterprise water service delivery batzella and ljung 2014 grant et al 2016 these include the cost of connection particularly when fees are set on a cost recovery basis and the location of poor households in a context where service delivery evolves in a piecemeal and opportunistic fashion this study sought to contribute further evidence by analyzing rates of connection between poor and non poor households and comparing the relative success of different types of service providers across private government and community based models the need to consider the relative success of different service provider types in reaching poor households is critical given the current government of viet nam policy focus on increasing the role of private providers in service delivery in rural areas a national government policy circular 131 establishes incentives for private water service providers in the form of co financing land and tax exemptions grant et al 2016 willetts et al 2017 yet application of this policy by provincial governments has been partial and in some cases processes for enterprises to access the incentives is complex limiting their uptake willetts et al 2017 nonetheless there are an increasing number of private providers and their effectiveness in reaching the poor must be compared with other existing service provider types namely government or government owned enterprises and community managed systems 3 material and methods 3 1 research questions and overall approach the study addressed two research questions 1 to what extent are piped water services reaching poor households 2 in cases where disparities exist between rates of poor and non poor household connection why are poor households not connected to piped water supplies research question 1 rq1 was considered at two scales i commune village wide and ii water service areas within communes communes are a local administrative boundary in viet nam there can be one or more water service areas within a commune and water service areas can also cross commune boundaries though this was less common in case study locations looking at an entire commune we first investigated the location of poor households with reference to water service area boundaries for the study water service area was defined by water service providers during interviews as the area within reasonable geographic reach of a service provider s piped network within which households would typically have the option to connect secondly focusing within water service areas we investigated rates of connection of poor households and compared these with overall connection rates to answer research question 2 rq2 insights from literature on possible explanatory reasons for non connection were tested through interviews with service providers and poor households interviews also included more open ended discussion about the history of water service provision and any specific efforts made to reach poor households across both research questions analysis described further below involved comparison of service provider types government private community this assessed the relative success of different provider types in reaching poor households rq1 and considered explanatory reasons related to the different business models rq2 different business models represented in case study communes included state owned enterprises private enterprises ranging in size from medium large corporations to household businesses and various community based models including cooperatives and water user associations the study approach draws from a body of literature on mixed methodologies which asserts the value of methodological pluralism for addressing complexity onwuegbuzie and leech 2017 it followed a pragmatic approach to research prompting the selection of quantitative and qualitative methodologies best able to answer the research question s johnson and onwuegbuzie 2013 key steps in the research process are summarised in fig 2 including interviews data collection and analysis activities ethical approval for the study was secured through standard university of technology sydney institute for sustainable futures ethics procedures a detailed presentation of study location data collection and sampling as well as statistical and qualitative analysis processes is provided below 3 2 study area the study area included six communes across three provinces in viet nam s red river and mekong river deltas fig 3 case study communes were selected based on preliminary data received from the ministry of agriculture and rural development s institute for water resource economics and management iwem the national centre for rural water supply and sanitation ncerwass and relevant provincial centres for rural water supply and sanitation pcerwass preliminary data identified local poverty rates water access figures the number and types of water service providers operating in each commune and any available information concerning efforts that had been made to reach poor households in selecting case study communes we sought to include a mix of communes in the north and the south to cover areas with different geographies and socio economic characteristics communes in which both private enterprises and other types of service providers were operating to facilitate comparison and a mix of sites where service providers had made particular efforts to include poor households and sites where they had not in two of the selected case study communes the relevant private water providers had participated in a non government organisation output based aid oba program in which a subsidy was paid based on total household connections across poor and non poor households oba is a form of results based financing used in contexts when customers are not able to pay the full cost of access to services and where performance based subsidies complement or replace user fees nguyen et al 2014 this provided opportunity to explore the influence of this kind of program on poor household connection rates 3 3 data collection and sampling a team of field researchers comprising representatives from central institute for natural resources and environmental studies viet nam national university and the university of technology sydney undertook data collection with the assistance of local provincial centres for rural water supply and sanitation and commune people s committees all meetings and interviews were conducted in vietnamese with english translation for the non vietnamese research team members qualitative and quantitative data was collected through interviews with 1031 registered poor householders as well as water service providers n 17 local commune people s committees cpc n 6 and provincial authorities n 3 all poor households registered on official commune poverty lists were visited n 1031 and were the sample for the statistical analysis the official government of viet nam definition of poverty for rural areas was used which at the time of research was based on an income threshold of vnd 400 000 usd 17 50 person month 1 1 decision no 09 2011 qd ttg of january 30 2011 setting norms on poor households and households in danger of falling into poverty for the 2011 2015 period in each case study commune interviews with officials were conducted to understand the commune context and history total commune population and lists of registered poor households water service providers were interviewed to clarify the history and operation of their water system including any pro poor mechanisms in place define the boundaries of each water service area and determine the total number of connected households water service area boundaries were defined in discussion with water service providers taking account of approximated pipe locations and the geographic accessibility of different locations with reference to e g waterways and roads interviews with poor households were conducted to determine if registered poor households were connected to a piped water source reasons for non connection and their primary drinking water sources global positioning system gps coordinates were logged for each poor household visited gps coordinates were used to determine if visited households were located inside a water service area wsa fig 3 presents an example commune showing households visited as included or excluded from a wsa data for non poor households were calculated using information provided by commune officials and water service providers on the total number of households in the commune the number of households in each water service area and the number of connected households in each water service area numbers of non poor households were calculated as the difference between total household and poor household numbers based on detailed information about the location and connection status of each poor household 3 4 analytical approach 3 4 1 statistical analysis two separate analysis processes both using typical null hypothesis significance testing methods were undertaken reflecting the two scales of interest i commune level analysis testing the association between inclusion in a water service area and household poverty status and ii water service area analysis testing the association between household poverty and connection status for the second analysis a stratified chi squared χ2 test was used as differences in the operations of the water service providers were expected to confound results when analysing aggregated data across the commune for this reason the mantel haenszel procedure was used which is a useful method for obtaining estimates of association adjusted for the effect of confounding variables mantel and haenszel 1959 mosteller 1968 gastwirth 1984 this modification along with a full explanation of the statistical analysis process is described in detail in appendix a in addition to computed chi squared statistics relative risks were calculated as an appropriate and intuitive measure of the degree of association between two dichotomous variables ospina et al 2012 for the commune wide analysis these are a measure of magnitude of association which approximate how much more or less likely it is for non poor households to be within a water service area for the intra wsa analysis relative risks provide a measure of the size of association between poverty and connection status for each water service area in communes where relative risk across water service areas were homogenous a mantel haenszel risk ratio was also computed which is a weighted average of the varying water service providers risk ratios indicating the size of the association between poverty status and connection status across water service providers i e a common relative risk 3 4 2 qualitative analysis an embedded design approach involved parallel collation of qualitative and quantitative data qualitative data was collected during interviews with provincial and commune officials water service providers and householders semi structured interview questions related to the history of water service provision any mechanisms from government or water service provider for supporting poor households access reasons why poor households were not connected to available piped water services and differences in service delivery approaches across water service provider types open ended interview questions also created space for discussion of any additional issues related to water service delivery raised by interviewees topic areas guiding interviews are provided in appendix b qualitative data for each commune was collated and discussed by research team members during workshops in the field to identify patterns emerging themes and any potential inconsistencies findings were then synthesized and considered with reference to the statistical analysis which informed the development of case study reports for each commune qualitative findings relating to the experiences of water service providers and poor households were also contextualised with reference to separate but related research activities undertaken by the team which focused on regulatory arrangements for private water service provision water operator functionality and customer satisfaction described in willetts et al 2017 3 5 limitations defining poverty status with reference to an income threshold likely underestimates the number of disadvantaged households as those classified as near poor would fit within the international standard of poverty income of less than us1 per day further income based approaches to defining poverty have been critiqued as simplistic and failing to capture the complexity of poverty with its multiple potential aspects of deprivation as identified for example by the multidimensional poverty index however in the absence of a viable alternative to inform identification of poor households in case study communes the official definition was used as the best available measure during an earlier qualitative phase of the research an asset ownership review was conducted for households identified as poor on official lists the correlation between official poverty status and the lived experiences of households was found to be sound grant et al 2016 in addition to challenges defining poverty it is important to note that the study focused on poverty rather than other aspects of potential disadvantage such as gender or disability which also affect access to improved water supplies noga and wolbring 2012 leahy et al 2017 it would be beneficial for future research to consider multiple dimensions of potential disadvantage to determine how they intersect to shape access to piped water a further limitation relates to the quality of data collected specifically in relation to the total number of households in each commune and the number of households connected to piped water services by service providers while figures used were verified by a number of internal sources commune officials water service providers and district authorities there remained a minor degree of uncertainty around the total number of connected households further informal secondary connections such as from one household to a neighbouring family property were anecdotally quite common but difficult to account for the limitation in data quality was addressed through the selection of an analysis methodology appropriate for the available data these analysis adjustments form a valuable contribution to further research of this nature given that comprehensive and clear data is typically challenging to obtain in rural developing contexts nevertheless it should be acknowledged that randomised sampling across all households in a commune would yield more accurate and in depth analysis suitable for statistical modelling i e regression but would also be significantly more resource intensive similarly purposive sampling of communes limits the representativeness of the study across rural viet nam though was necessary given logistical practicalities and the aim to include a mix of government community and private piped systems 4 results and discussion this section presents and discusses six key findings from the analysis i in two of six communes water service area locations favoured non poor households with no significant difference found in the other four communes ii in most cases the probability of poor households being connected to piped water was lower than non poor households iii connection fees were the primary barrier to poor households accessing piped water iv no single type of service provider model across government community and private providers was found to be more successful in reaching poor households v where particular efforts were made to reach poor households connection rates were more equitable vi sustainability of service delivery was revealed to be a concern with implications for poor households access finally we reflect on implications from the research methods and findings for understanding how water access inequality plays out at local scales pointing to both the value and challenges of local level research and monitoring 4 1 in two of six communes water service area locations favoured non poor households in two communes a and e the research found that the probability of non poor households being located in a water service area were higher than for poor households with risk ratios of 2 7 and 5 7 table 1 in both communes households outside of the water service areas tended to be in more challenging locations for example in commune a fig 4 poor households outside the water service areas tended to be situated directly adjacent to the river and slightly away from other clusters of houses in one instance a poor household was in an informal location with their official address in a resettlement area across the commune the piped network went past this informal area but did not serve it in commune e the area not located within water service areas was in the northern tip of the commune fig 5 interviews with officials and water service providers identified constraints in extending piped networks to more challenging locations including the need to recoup investment costs from user connection fees discussed further below in section 4 3 in a third commune d the research found no significant difference in the location of poor and non poor households with reference to water service areas in the remaining three case study communes this research question was not relevant as piped networks were available across the commune such that no areas were classified as being outside a water service area defined as an area within which households had the option to connect 4 2 poor households had lower probability of connection to available piped water the research found evidence that within water service areas poor households had lower rates of connection to piped water services four of the six communes had at least one or more water service area in which the probability of poor households being connected to piped water were lower than non poor households this finding applied across seven of the ten water services areas in these four communes selected water services areas within these same communes showed different results with either no significant difference between poor and non poor connection rates in two service areas or in one commune a situation where the poor had greater probability of being connected to piped water discussed further below in section 4 4 table 2 summarises findings across all communes and water services areas presenting relative risks where these were relevant measures for comparing poor and non poor connection rates in commune a the probability of non poor households being connected was found to be 1 3 times higher than poor households this applied across all three water service areas in the commune which included one managed by a large construction company prompted to enter the water supply market due to government subsidies for capital works a household business and a cooperative none of the three service providers offered support to encourage poor households to connect the different ages and histories of the systems were reflected in different levels of service and customer satisfaction which may also have influenced poor households willingness to connect the older household business and cooperative systems suffered from intermittent service and low customer demand related to perceptions of low quality while the newer private service charged higher connection fees on a cost recovery basis seen as prohibitive for poor households of the two service providers operating in commune b the private enterprise supplied 22 of the 24 hamlets with the community managed scheme serving the remaining two in both water service areas the probability of non poor households connecting was found to be higher than poor households within the community managed water service area this can be explained by affordability constraints and the absence of support mechanisms for poor household connection due to lack of service provider funds and a stated belief that all households should be offered the same deal as non poor households findings for the private water service area were surprising given the reported by the service provider availability of two mechanisms to assist poor households to connect i households experiencing financial difficulty could pay their connection fee in instalments and ii poor households were exempt from the minimum contracted water use of 4 m3 month however household interviews revealed that these support mechanisms were not well known across the commune potentially explaining the lower overall connection rates for poor households in communes d and e two of the water service areas one in each commune indicated higher rates of connection for non poor households these included a private enterprise and a state owned enterprise the private enterprise reported to have offered support for poor households in the form of discounts and free advice however as was the case in commune b these were not found to be widely known by poor households the state owned enterprise offered free connection in response to a recent provincial policy decision which should in principle have facilitated higher rates of poor household connection but interviews identified significant delays in the fulfilment of connection requests of the remaining three service providers in these two communes two both in commune d had no significant difference in rates of connection between poor and non poor households and one a private enterprise service area in commune e showed higher rates of connection for poor households these are explored further below section 4 5 of the remaining two communes in one f there was insufficient data available to compare service areas and determine the relative rates of poor non poor connection because one of the water service areas crossed commune boundaries and the service provider was not able to identify numbers of connections within the case study commune further different interviewees gave different reports on overall connection rates in the commune in the other commune c the research found no significant difference between rates of poor and non poor connection though it is important to note factors that may have reduced demand for piped water across all poor and non poor households as evidenced by the overall low rate of access across the commune 40 specifically the quality of piped water and service reliability across both service areas was reported to be low by surveyed poor households there was a strongly expressed preference to use rainwater when available and a previous international non government organisation aid program had assisted households to install protected wells in light of these factors it is likely that both poor and non poor households did not prioritise connecting to piped systems particularly when connection fees were perceived to be high as discussed further below 4 3 connection fees were unaffordable for poor households across all case study communes and across government community and private enterprise water service areas poor households reported their reason for not accessing piped water when available as inability to afford the connection fee fig 6 this was a particularly clear finding in four communes a b c d with 68 100 of non connected households citing unaffordability of the connection fee as their primary reason for non connection across all water service areas this finding was consistent with a previous phase of the research which found connection fees to be reported as the principal barrier to piped water access grant et al 2016 as well as connection fees being unaffordable householder interviews revealed resentment towards service providers related to the cost of connection fees influenced by perceptions and mis perceptions about the costs involved in piped service delivery and its profitability for example one householder questioned how could they charge so much when they just pump water from the river and another asserted they are making a fortune and not helping us at all in considering the barrier posed by connection fees it is important to note that connection fees may be broadly interpreted by households as comprising all costs associated with accessing the piped system for example one householder in commune c reported that she had been connected but had not been able to afford to build a mandatory storage tank required to cope with intermittent and variable water pressure and so was cut off from the service allowing for differences in interpretation of what constitutes connection fees the range of fees across case study communes was wide from free connection a recent development due to a provincial policy directive in tien giang province to vnd 4 million usd 175 with a median fee of vnd 600 000 usd 26 representing 150 of the monthly income threshold used to define poor households in two communes e f unaffordability of the connection fee was also the most common reason for non connection but the finding was less stark as compared with other cited reasons in commune f while acknowledging limitations relating to the reliability of data in this commune 50 of non connected households cited unaffordability of connection fee as the primary barrier this may be due to the fact that poor households were offered free connection by private enterprises participating in an output based aid scheme or on occasion through the charity of service providers as reported during service provider interviews other notable reasons were that connection was not offered 33 which contradicts information from the water service providers that these households were within water service areas and that the tariff was unaffordable 28 in commune e 40 of non connected households cited unaffordability of the connection fee as their reason for not accessing the piped water service other reasons were cited by almost 30 of non connected households these included for example households that had applied for a connection but failed to receive the service 4 4 no particular service provider type was more successful at reaching poor households the research did not reveal strong differences between service provider types across private government and community models in terms of their success in reaching poor households points of difference were however evident in different business models namely connection fees and the degree of payment flexibility offered to customers private enterprises included in the study tended to charge higher connection fees compared with other types of service providers a finding which was supported by a wider survey of water service providers grant et al 2016 in some cases private enterprises reportedly sought to offset higher connection fees by offering flexible payment options including discounts exemptions and payment by instalment this was not similarly reported by government and community service providers however it is important to note that discounts offered by private enterprises included in the research may have been partly driven by their participation in a civil society output based aid program discussed further below and a consequent incentive to increase overall numbers of connections so further investigation would be required to determine the extent to which private enterprises more generally offer flexible payment options further differences between private enterprises may be more important in driving pro poor approaches than differences between private and government or community models motivations and business management practices differed substantially with interviews revealing strong pro social motives in some service providers while others were more focused on income generation water user association and community managed schemes tended not to provide targeted support for poor households reasons included the fact that the selected schemes typically relied on shared capital investment from participating households and support for the poor would require cross subsidisation in the form of additional investment from other member households further these schemes required often complex processes of collective decision making which may have served as a barrier to the provision of support mechanisms for the poor if consensus on their appropriateness could not be reached this was not a barrier for private enterprises who could decide autonomously to offer pro poor support overall in the absence of civil society programs or government policies driving a focus on the poor water service providers did not offer targeted support this indicates a need to be proactive in terms of policies requiring service providers to focus on reaching poor households such that existing gaps between poor and non poor access can be addressed in future water schemes given the clear finding that connection fees were the primary barrier for poor households strategies to either subsidise these fees and or facilitate flexible payment arrangements should be the focus of pro poor policy development 4 5 support mechanisms facilitated equitable connection rates the research identified one service area where the probability of poor households being connected to piped water was 1 7 times higher than for non poor households risk ratio 0 6 this service area in commune e was administered by a private enterprise operating since 1997 in addition to almost 20 years of operating experience in recent years the enterprise had participated in an output based aid oba program administered by the international non government organisation east meets west foundation east meets west foundation has applied an oba approach in viet nam since 2007 in relevant case study communes the oba approach was used to mobilise private finance by incentivising service providers to increase household connections private enterprises pre financed capital expenditure and received partial reimbursement on verification of household connections nguyen et al 2014 the partial reimbursement was provided for all household connections regardless of poverty status though east meets west actively encouraged a focus on poor households given that this water service area represents a reversal of the dominant finding that the poor are less likely to be connected to piped water services efforts were made to understand whether particular strategies were employed by this enterprise to target poor households and any other potential reasons for higher poor household connection rates no one reason was found to provide a definitive explanation and it is likely that a number of interrelated factors contributed to this enterprise s relative success in reaching the poor first the enterprise had been operating in this location for almost 20 years and hence had both extensive experience managing a water business and strong social ties within the community this contributed to both a pro poor outlook and sufficient security in business management to facilitate the provision of support mechanisms to poor households this financial security points to a fundamental link between the viability of a business delivering a water service and managing related assets which depends on many factors including government mandated connection fees and tariffs and the ability in financial terms to offer pro poor support second the owner of the private enterprise was buddhist and motivated by his religious beliefs provided case by case support to poor households this aligns with research identifying pro social motives as drivers of water entrepreneurship in viet nam and elsewhere with religion identified as one of a number of underlying factors along with empathy for the poor and related community roles or positions willetts et al 2016 third the enterprise offered a reasonably low connection fee of vnd 500 000 usd 22 which is likely related to participation in the oba program through which a payment was made for each connection achieved allowing the enterprise to pass on savings in connection fees to customers this external support while not mandating pro poor behaviour reduced the costs of connection for all households and created conditions that enabled targeting and greater participation of poor households it is also pertinent to consider the case of two water service areas in commune d where no significant difference was found between rates of poor and non poor access these water service areas represent situations where water service providers reached poor households at similar rates to the general population and in doing so did not contribute to further marginalisation of poor households as is the case in areas where the poor had lower rates of access one of these two service areas was operated by a private enterprise that had also participated in the east meets west oba program this case was very recent geographically contained a small island and only has 315 households in total the service provider reached almost all households in the service area the other a water user association system was an older scheme with high overall rates of connection across both poor and non poor households but concerns regarding sustainability low connection fees and tariffs while potentially creating favourable conditions for poor household connection were threatening the ongoing viability of the service with assets due for renewal and insufficient funds for capital maintenance 4 6 service sustainability was a concern with implications for poor households access a final finding relates to issues that emerged during semi structured interviews and which have relevance for decision making by poor households around connection to piped services in particular service providers and householders identified concerns relating to household use of multiple water sources water quality and water business viability across non connected poor households in all communes the research found a householder preference for rainwater fig 7 interviews with commune officials and service providers suggested that connected households poor and non poor also preferentially used rainwater when available for drinking and cooking based on an end use analysis of domestic water use in viet nam drinking and cooking could account for more than 20 of total water demand retamal et al 2011 reasons for preferring rainwater included better taste and perceived higher quality of rainwater compared with piped water in the north in particular where the dominant source of piped water was surface water concerns about increasing levels of agricultural and industrial pollution were expressed by both service providers and householders householders also described rainwater as more consistent and reliable compared with piped services which experienced interruptions and were sometimes muddy in appearance the use of multiple sources of water has been noted in other research in viet nam elliot et al 2011 and is a subject of current sector discussion elliot et al 2017 related to the preference for rainwater service providers reported reductions in demand particularly during the rainy season this meant demand for piped water was seasonal and that this seasonal variability in demand may have implications for managing viable water businesses water user association and other community managed schemes in particular were struggling to remain viable in the context of both low demand and low government mandated tariffs many schemes included in the research had reached an age where capital maintenance or upgrading was required yet revenue was reported to be insufficient to meet this need this reflects a common challenge globally in sustainability of rural water supplies fonseca et al 2011 in addition these schemes struggled to secure capital finance particularly in a policy context such as is the case in viet nam where the focus of support had shifted to increasing private sector involvement willetts et al 2017 finally some water service providers were focused on increasing customer demand for water as their strategy to increase revenue and remain viable in this context determining and monitoring sustainable extraction rates particularly in areas drawing from groundwater was a critical need and one that was not a focus at the time of this study 4 7 local level research and monitoring is both valuable and challenging reviewing the methods and findings of this study generated insights worth sharing to inform future research as well as local government monitoring initiatives first the process of data collection was challenging and resource intensive the study required significant effort cost and innovation in methods in response to a lack of reliable information and data related to this findings were nuanced between and within communes meaning translation into policy and investment recommendations needs careful consideration while the findings clearly show a gap in water service for poor households across the communes investigated this was not a universal picture and it was challenging to interpret the complexity given sometimes contradictory information across both qualitative and quantitative research components the dynamics around water provision and poverty are likely to be similarly complex in other locations making both understanding the situation and then developing strategies to reduce inequalities a substantial undertaking nevertheless the study generated valuable insights and sufficient clarity of findings to indicate that targeted support is required to avoid systematic exclusion of poor households from water services further the study proved the value of a mixed methods approach in addressing complex situations the statistical analysis provided evidence of inequalities in water access and indicated a need to consider poverty dimensions of both the location of water services and individual household connections when planning future investments qualitative findings ensured nuances and influencing factors were brought to light which are critical when translating research findings into policy directions more generally the research raises questions about how to manage local level monitoring to inform local level decision making around inclusive water service delivery further work is needed to consider i what scale and type of data is essential to facilitate poor inclusive service delivery ii who should be tasked with collecting and analysing it and iii the roles of different actors in translating data into decision making and regulation around water service planning and delivery these questions have implications for water service providers commune authorities commune people s committees and provincial authorities provincial people s committees and provincial centres for rural water supply and sanitation 5 conclusion reaching all with affordable reliable and safe water is central to realise the human right to water and fulfil the ambitions of the sustainable development goals achieving universal access requires improving our understanding of the local dynamics of water access in order to inform local government activities in planning regulating and sometimes delivering water services this study explored local experiences of piped water access for 1031 poor households in rural viet nam findings pointed to lower rates of piped water access for poor households across areas served by government private and community service providers with connection fees the primary barrier strategies for improving the affordability of connection fees should therefore be a focus for both service providers and local governments in planning more inclusive water service delivery the study also found cases where financial assistance for private enterprises enabled more equitable outcomes suggesting opportunity to support and incentivise poor inclusive service delivery across service provider types finally the research highlights both the value and complexity of rigorous local level water service monitoring further work is needed to strengthen local level monitoring such that governments can

19018,advanced control of chemical disinfection processes is becoming increasingly important in view of balancing under treatment low pathogen inactivation and over treatment excessive consumption of disinfectant and disinfection byproducts formation thereby providing considerable environmental and economic benefits conventional control strategies such as flow pacing or residual trim ignore chemical demand decay inactivation kinetics and other factors governing disinfection performance in continuous flow reactors such as reactor hydraulics and process variability this study presents the development verification and pilot scale validation of a novel ct based real time disinfection control strategy derived from first principles and applied to peracetic acid disinfection of municipal secondary effluent wastewater validation experiments were carried out using a 3 m3 pilot contact basin of which the hydraulic performance was first characterized by means of tracer tests and then mathematically modeled using the well established theoretical framework of continuous stirred tank reactors in series the analytical model describing hydraulic performance was subsequently extended to take into account disinfectant demand decay and microbial inactivation kinetics the integrated model was successfully used to predict and control residual peracetic acid as well as microbial concentration in the pilot effluent validation studies conclusively supported that the novel ct based control strategy was superior in maintaining constant disinfection performance desired microbial counts and low residual disinfectant under variable flow and wastewater quality when compared with flow pacing the ct based control required two times less the amount of chemical for the same treatment objective 100 cfu 100 ml remarkably the ct based control strategy could be extended to other chemical disinfection processes such as chlorination and ozonation alone or in combination with

of the most important wastewater treatment processes as a matter of fact the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in surface waters as a result of insufficient interrupted or no disinfection may promote the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera typhoid and gastroenteritis fenwick 2006 richardson et al 2002 xiao et al 2018 for example from 2011 to 2012 90 waterborne disease outbreaks as a result of exposure to chemicals or infectious pathogens in recreational waters e g lakes and oceans were reported to the centers for disease control and prevention in the united states resulting in at least 1788 cases 95 hospitalizations and 1 death hlavsa et al 2015 unsafe surface waters pose major risk to ecosystems and human health in both developed and developing countries worldwide chemical e g chlorine peracetic acid and ozone as well as physical e g ultraviolet light and membrane filtration disinfection processes are currently used for wastewater disinfection gehr et al 2003 haas 2000 metcalf eddy et al 2003 rose and masago 2007 inactivation of microorganisms is a process where both the concentration of the disinfectant and the contact time are linked via the concept of exposure i e the product of concentration or intensity and the exposure time irrespective of the disinfection technology disinfection performance is primarily governed by the exposure to the disinfectant i e the target disinfectant dose which is the time dependent concentration of disinfectant integrated over time gujer and von gunten 2003 in mg min l 1 for chemical disinfection or the target ultraviolet uv dose mj cm 2 which is the integral of uv intensity during the exposure period for uv disinfection bolton and linden 2003 gates 1929 thus it should go without saying that if a constant dose of a disinfectant is dynamically maintained during the disinfection process then consistent disinfection performance will be met however especially in wastewater maintaining a constant dose is not trivial due to uncontrolled large variations in water quality and quantity as well as numerous side reactions between the disinfectant and water matrix for example when added to water chemical disinfectants undergo an initial rapid consumption i e instantaneous disinfectant demand followed by a slower decay haas and joffe 1994 haas and karra 1984 as a result dosing strategies not taking into account demand and or decay may result in insufficient disinfection performance and possible violations of regulatory limits while over dosing results in increased operational and environmental costs increased consumption of disinfectant and higher potential formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps not to mention violation of regulatory chemical residual and microbial limits korshin et al 2002 krasner et al 1989 richardson et al 2007 1998 therefore advanced control strategies derived from first principles of chemical disinfection not only have the potential to appropriately balance under treatment and over treatment but also will provide considerable environmental and economic benefits surprisingly the current practice of controlling chemical disinfection processes is empirical based and ignores both contact time and disinfection kinetics this is the case for example of flow pacing control with or without feed forward or feedback sensor based features which relies on maintaining a constant disinfectant residual concentration irrespective of the reactor hydraulics and average contact time in the basin kobylinski et al 2006 more specifically chlorine residual measurements were used to feedback auto control the concentration of chlorine and the required amount of quencher for dechlorination dieu et al 1995 oxidation reduction potential orp measurements have also been suggested to control the process taking advantage of the reactions between chlorine and nitrogen containing compounds kim and hensley 1997 yu 2004 however orp is not a good indicator of inactivation and disinfection efficiency since it is affected by a number of water constituents passively participating in a disinfection process recently a cascade control and a dead time compensation were applied to maintain a constant free chlorine residual at the outlet of a chemical contact basin ccb consisting of a probe at the inlet and outlet demir and woo 2014 flow pacing control strategies were also reported for the disinfection of wastewater by peracetic acid paa where influent water quality parameters e g chemical oxygen demand cod and color were used to drive a feed forward control block et al 2015 the integrated disinfection design framework iddf recommended the following aspects to be considered when designing and implementing a disinfection process i the kinetics of microbial disinfection and dbps formation ii disinfectant demand and decay and iii disinfection reactor hydraulics bellamy et al 1998 ducoste et al 2001 detailed hydrodynamic characteristics are ignored by iddf and the fluids in the reactor are considered as segregated i e the molecules of the fluid do not interact with each other danckwerts 1958 greene et al 2004 pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 zhang et al 2007 zwietering 1959 hence the iddf is limited to applications where no high and frequent variations of water quality and quantity are expected e g drinking water different ct based tables and inactivation models have been proposed for designing chemical disinfection processes in water and wastewater for example ct10 was introduced as a parameter defined as the product of the residual concentration of disinfectant at the outlet of the reactor and the retention time at which 10 of the water passes through the reactor t10 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2007 the main limitation of the ct10 approach is associated with the conservatism inherent in the selection of the contact time i e t10 used for ct calculations thus resulting in unnecessary overdosing of the chemical used in the process gujer and von gunten 2003 zhang et al 2007 for ccbs with multiple chambers the extended t10 method suggested to calculate the disinfection performance for each chamber using the disinfectant concentration at the outlet of each chamber the extended continuous stirred tank reactor cstr method assumes that each chamber of the disinfection reactor behaves as an ideal csrt completely mixed rakness et al 2005 this method can only be applied to conventional multi chamber contactors and its disinfection prediction ability depends on the hydraulic behavior of each chamber jeon et al 2011 a stochastic model for an ozonation reactor incorporating an n cstrs in series hydraulic model and an on line ozone decay estimation i e determined using an online sequencing batch reactor targeting a constant ozone dose has been reported gujer and von gunten 2003 neumann et al 2007a 2007b von gunten et al 1999 the instantaneous demand of ozone was neglected due to lack of a methodology to measure this rapid ozone consumption limiting its application to cases where disinfectant demand is relatively constant e g drinking water elovitz et al 2000 gujer and von gunten 2003 neumann et al 2007b moreover the stochastic nature of this approach limits its applicability in conventional industrial controllers due their limited computational power another method based on n cstrs hydraulic model has been suggested to predict chemical disinfection performance pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 however the kinetic parameters derived from batch conditions were used to control continuous flow disinfection experiments as a result the impact of mixing was not taken into account in the case of municipal wastewater treatment the quantity and quality of the water entering the disinfection process can vary dramatically and unpredictably over time due to a number factors including i diurnal flow variations ii wet weather events iii plant operations and v industrial discharge thus the dose of disinfectant has the potential to vary significantly during operation and disinfection performance cannot be maintained constant in the absence of intelligent dose control clearly it is imperative to develop operational and control strategies able to accurately predict and maintain the efficacy of a given wastewater disinfection process in this study an advanced dose control adc methodology for chemical disinfection of wastewater has been developed evaluated and demonstrated in pilot scale continuous flow real time experimental studies while the adc strategy is applicable to all chemical disinfection processes in this study the demonstration and evaluation of the control strategy was done using paa an alternative to chlorine which has received significant attention in recent years because of its disinfection efficacy and minimal aquatic toxicity antonelli et al 2006 falsanisi et al 2006 henao et al 2018 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 rossi et al 2007 the objectives of this study were to i develop hydraulic chemical reaction and microbial inactivation kinetic models for paa disinfection of wastewater in a continuous flow ccb ii evaluate the three models using data collected from a pilot scale continuous flow experimental setup iii implement the hydraulic and chemical models into an innovative adc algorithm and iv demonstrate and evaluate the control of the chemical disinfection process with the novel adc strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development 2 1 1 chemical reaction model after the instantaneous demand d in mg l 1 paa decay follows first

can be obtained by integrating the paa concentration over time eq 2 2 ict ideal c 1 k 1 e k t 2 1 2 microbial inactivation kinetic model santoro et al 2015 showed an initial rapid inactivation of dispersed free microbes followed by a tailing effect due to the slower inactivation of microbes aggregated with particles resulting in shielding microbes from the chemical disinfectant during paa batch inactivation studies considering this typical biphasic behavior of microbial inactivation in wastewater the inactivation kinetics can be described by a double exponential model i e the sum of two exponential terms each describing one of the two phases santoro et al 2015 an inactivation kinetic model parameter m describing tailing off m 1 or shoulder effects m 1 haas and joffe 1994 has been introduced to the first exponent of the double exponential model eq 3 shoulder effects at low ict were observed in batch paa ict dose response curves performed on secondary effluent wastewater sarathy

microbes in l mg 1 min 1 m and l mg 1 min 1 respectively 2 1 3 hydraulic model n cstrs the n continuous stirred tank reactors n cstrs model assumes that the hydraulic behavior of a reactor can be described by a number n of cstrs in series levenspiel 1999 the introduction of an effective volume factor f to the n cstrs model enables the consideration of possible dead volume of the reactor i e volume that is not replaced by other volumes fig 1 the residence time distribution rtd of n cstrs in series coupled with f is given by eq 4 4 e n n f v q n t f v q n 1 e n t f v q n 1 where en is the exit age distribution in s 1 v is the volume of the ccb in l and q is volumetric flow of wastewater in l s 1 the n and f model parameters are estimated by fitting of tracer test data the residual concentration of paa at the outlet of the ccb c2 can be calculated using a first order kinetic equation for the paa decay eq 1 coupled with the n cstrs hydraulic model levenspiel 1999 as shown in eq 5 5 c 2 c 1 1 k f v q n n eq 5 is particularly useful in disinfection control strategies in that it allows the rapid estimation at steady state of the residual chemical disinfectant at the reactor

been earlier defined eq 2 considering the use of the n cstrs model to describe the hydraulic behavior of an arbitrary flow reactor via its residence time distribution function en and the ct dose

disinfection kinetics of a mixed microbial population dispersed and particle associated bacteria is given by the sum of two pseudo first order inactivation models in the ct domain each describing the inactivation of a distinct microbial sub population it is important to emphasize that such first order kinetics are not with respect to time but with respect to disinfectant ct dose specifically ictm for dispersed organisms where m is a coefficient that accounts for shoulder effects in the dose dependent kinetics and ict for particle associated ones by variable substitution it is indeed possible to arrive to the analytical expression reported in eq 7 where the well established conversion equation for a reacting flow following a first order kinetic in n cstrs in series is extended to the ict domain and the total viable microbes at the reactor outlet is given by the summation of each individual viable counts associated with the two distinct microbial sub populations i e dispersed and particle associated at this point the importance for process control associated with eq 7 is immediately evident as a matter of fact eq 7 is an analytical expression where all the important factors governing chemical disinfection are explicitly captured namely reactor hydraulics disinfectant decay and inactivation kinetics it should also be emphasized that by replacing v q with time eq 7 introduces a new family of inactivation models under non ideal mixing disinfectant demand decay mixed microbial populations and non log linear inactivation kinetics with shoulder and tailing 2 2 pilot scale disinfection experiments 2 2 1 pilot ccb to evaluate the hydraulic chemical disinfectant and inactivation kinetic models a 3 m3 4 pass ccb was designed and equipped with a chemical dosing pump qdos30 watson marlow concord ontario canada paa analyzers installed at the inlet and outlet of the ccb hach cl17 hach loveland colorado usa and a programmable logic controller plc programmed with conventional flow pacing logic as well as the innovative ict dose pacing logic was used to control the chemical dosing pump fig 2 the ccb was located in a wastewater treatment plant greenway wastewater treatment centre london ontario canada employing conventional activated sludge secondary treatment this setup enabled the use of real time secondary effluent wastewater as the influent to the ccb the static mixer between the chemical dosing pump and sampling point 1 located at the inlet of the ccb allows the approximation of d which is equal to the difference between the known concentration of paa added c0 and the measured concentration of paa shortly after the static mixer c1 fig 2 2 2 2 chemicals a 208 l drum of 12 paa solution proxitane ww 12 microbiocide was supplied by

tests were conducted at wastewater flows of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 l s 2 2 4 model evaluation and process control experiments were conducted for over 100 h to evaluate the models under various water quantity and quality conditions to ensure various icts were tested that is varying extents of microbial inactivation flow pacing control was practiced i e a fixed concentration was continuously delivered by the chemical dosing pump for the evaluation of the models the chemical dosing pump rate the water flow and the paa analyzers measuring concentrations at the inlet c1 and outlet c2 of the

discussion 3 1 hydraulic model evaluation initially the model parameters of the hydraulic model eq 4 for the pilot scale ccb were estimated by performing tracer tests at water flows of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 l s corresponding to hrts and reynolds numbers re ranges of 20 51 min and 3182 7956 respectively values of index of modal retention time of 0 95 0 93 0 91 and 0 94 at flows of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 l s respectively were calculated indicating that the designed ccb behaved almost as an ideal reactor at the studied flows fig 3 a shows the comparison between the predicted n cstrs model and observed tracer tests importantly the tracer test data of all tested flows were fitted simultaneously by the model resulting in a single set of fitted parameters i e n 42 and f 0 985 the n cstrs model fitted well the experimental rtd data with an r2 of 0 98 fig s2 the good fit is supported by f test where it was shown that the variances of model predicted data and observed data are statistically equal at 95 confidence interval table s1 several hydraulic models including the n cstrs model have been investigated in characterizing the hydraulic behavior of ccbs gorzalski et al 2018 neumann et al 2007a 2007b pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 it is important to note that an ideal hydraulic model should be able to characterize the behavior of a generic ccb including those deviating from plug flow and poorly baffled configurations indeed this is one of the strengths of the hydraulic architecture proposed in this study as it relies on the full rtd as the input for process control rather than its 10th percentile only as in the ct10 approach this will allow the application of the control strategy to various hydraulic conditions to that effect the evaluation of the n cstrs hydraulic model was expanded by fitting the model to tracer test data reported in other published literature amini et al 2011 angeloudis et al 2014 teixeira and do nascimento siqueira 2008 fig 3b shows a good agreement between observed and predicted data for four different reactors of varying geometries and hydraulic behaviors the n cstrs hydraulic model fitted parameters n and f along with the schematics of the ccbs of different studies are presented in table 1 despite the different geometries of ccbs and hrts resulting in different tracer curves the hydraulic model fits well all the experimental data r2 0 96 fig 3b and table 1 figs s2 s6 the hydraulic model fitted parameters varied from 9 to 42 and 0 890 1 000 for n and f respectively table 1 this confirms the plug flow like conditions and limited axial dispersion achieved in all the disinfection contact basins used in the studies n 5 with very little dead zones f 0 890 the f tests performed for each fit showed that the variances of model predicted data and observed data are statistically equal at 95 confidence interval tables s1 s5 3 2 n cstrs chemical reaction model evaluation to evaluate the chemical reaction model eq 5 five 23 h experimental runs were carried out under various conditions fig 4 a shows the variation of c0 c1 and hrt over a total of 115 h of operation for the first 23 h run 1 c0 was relatively stable with only a slight decrement from 1 7 mg l to 1 5 mg l while c1 decreased gradually from 1 2 mg l to 0 3 mg l hrt increased from 20 to 40 min over the 23 h run during the run 2 hours 23 46 c0 c1 and hrt were constant at 1 7 mg l 0 7 mg l and 21 min respectively for run 3 hrt increased gradually from 25 to 51 min over the 23 h period of time hours 46 69 while c0 and c1 were not changed fig 4a hrt was maintained constant at 15 min for run 4 hours 69 92 and run 5 hours 92 115 c0 and c1 were 2 6 mg l and 1 9 mg l respectively for run 4 and 0 8 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively for run 5 fig 4a the variation of these parameters is important to evaluate the models under a wide range of operational and environmental conditions the inlet secondary effluent wastewater has been characterized in terms of tss cod and uvt throughout the experiments fig 4b the purpose of monitoring and reporting uvt is simply to provide another bulk water quality parameter that is affected by soluble and particulate inorganic and organic compounds for the first 12 h of run 1 tss cod and uvt were 12 mg l 20 mg l and 70 respectively from the 12th hour to the end of run 1 23rd hour tss and cod increased to 30 mg l and 45 mg l respectively while uvt decreased to 60 during the run 2 tss cod and uvt were constant at 15 mg l 25 mg l and 65 respectively interestingly a major snow melt event which caused a significant plant upset occurred during run 3 resulting in a very high tss up to 170 mg l and cod up to 190 mg l values fig 4b the high flow event was verified by the dramatic increase of the plant flow from 100 000 to 375 000 m3 d corresponding to a peaking factor pf of 3 75 fig s7 for run 4 tss cod and uvt were constant at 20 mg l 45 mg l and 65 respectively another high cod up to 110 mg l event occurred during run 5 tss also increased up to 35 mg l during the same run fig 4b the evaluation of the developed models under varied wastewater quality conditions is critical because the control strategy proposed herein has been developed specifically to respond to real time variations that take place during wastewater disinfection previously reported studies on the control of chemical disinfection focused on drinking water hence they were evaluated under relatively consistent and clean water quality conditions e g cod 5 mg l gujer and von gunten 2003 wang et al 2013 fig 5 shows the prediction of the residual concentration of paa c2 at the outlet of the ccb by the n cstrs chemical reaction model eq 5 the rate constant k was fitted for each run individually i e for 5 runs of 23 h each using excel solver with the aim to minimize the sum of square errors sse between experimental observed c2 and model predicted c2 the model predicted reasonably well r2 0 96 the c2 at a wide range of concentrations i e from 0 2 mg l to 2 0 mg l fig 5 and fig s8 the good fit was also supported by f tests table s6 it is noted that the variance of predicted c2 is in agreement with the c1 measured by the paa analyzer figs 4a and 5 the independent validation of the chemical reaction model has not been considered in published studies where the models were evaluated only in terms of predicting overall microbial inactivation pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 the ability of a model to predict the residual of the chemical disinfectant at the outlet of the reactor c2 has practical implications for wastewater disinfection applications where quenching of the residual disinfectant is required e g dechlorination the fitted parameter k of the n cstrs chemical reaction model for each 23 h run is given in table 2 the parameter was similar 0 010 min 1 for runs 1 3 and 4 for run 2 k was slightly higher 0 014 min 1 run 5 had the highest k of 0 023 min 1 table 2 the range of k determined during 5 batch experiments in secondary effluent wastewater of the same plant was from 0 006 to 0 020 min 1 table s7 which is in agreement with the k calculated in pilot scale tests table 2 3 3 n cstrs microbial inactivation model evaluation intel and outlet samples were collected hourly and analyzed for fc to evaluate the n cstrs microbial inactivation model eq 7 the ict was calculated by eq 6 using the previously determined parameters i e n and f from n cstrs hydraulic model and k from n cstrs chemical reaction model the average ict of every hour was used in eq 7 to fit the microbial inactivation data of each run individually the four parameters of the model β kd m and kp were fitted using excel solver to minimize the sse between the observed and predicted fc concentration at the outlet of ccb fig 6 shows a satisfactory agreement between the observed and the model predicted microbial inactivation data during the first run hours 0 23 ict was constant the inlet concentration of fc n0 increased rapidly from 5000 to 100 000 cfu 100 ml resulting in an increase of the outlet concentration of fc n2 similarly at a constant ict an increase of n0 resulted in an increase of n2 observed during run 5 hours 92 115 it was expected that an increase of n0 at a constant ict would result in an increase of the outlet fc concentration importantly the model n2 predicted was able to fit well the observed data in both cases fig 6 during run 2 hours 23 46 and run 4 hours 69 92 both n0 and ict were constant this resulted in a constant concentration of fc at the outlet the results of these 2 runs confirm that a constant disinfection performance can be achieved at a constant ict and n0 this is in agreement with the microbial inactivation kinetic model used in this study where the outlet concentration of fc is a function of ict and n0 eq 7 thus the model could predict this constant disinfection performance fig 6 during run 3 hours 46 69 the n0 was constant at high values between 50 000 and 234 000 cfu 100 ml interestingly the high n0 values are in agreement with the high tss and cod values due to the snow melt high influent flow plant upset event figs 4b and 6 despite the relatively constant value of n0 during run 3 the n2 observed was not constant because of the different ict significantly the n2 observed showed an ict dependency i e n2 observed was higher at lower ict fig 6 importantly the model n2 predicted could capture the variation of n2 observed due to the variation of ict at a constant n0 fig 6 the good prediction of the extent of disinfection by the model r2 0 82 was supported by an f test performed using all data obtained during the 115 h tests fig 7 and table s8 the f test showed that the variances of the n2 predicted and n2 observed are statistically equal at 95 confidence interval table s8 the fitted parameters of the n cstrs microbial inactivation model for each 23 h run are presented in table 3 the model calibration started from initial guesses of the model parameters these initial guesses were taken from batch inactivation kinetics in secondary effluent wastewater of the same plant table s9 the fraction of particle associated microbes β varied from 0 011 to 0 164 the highest value of β was observed during run 3 which is in agreement with the high tss value of the inlet secondary effluent wastewater fig 4b and table 3 the kd was similar for runs 1 4 a lower kd was observed for run 5 table 3 the m was always higher than 1 indicating shoulder effects the kp was not zero only during runs 2 and 3 indicating the resistance of particle associated microbes compared to free microbes it is worth noting that the chick watson microbial inactivation model used in other reported studies does not consider particle associated microbes relevant to wastewater hence the application of these control strategies is limited to drinking water disinfection where particles are negligible chick 1908 gujer and von gunten 2003 neumann et al 2007b pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 watson 1908 this is the first time that the double exponential model eq 3 which accounts for particle associated microbes has been incorporated into a hydraulic model resulting in a comprehensive integrated disinfection model eq 7 3 4 evaluation of ict dose based process control strategy the models developed herein were used in a novel strategy for controlling the disinfection process by maintaining constant ict dose during the process control experiments the flow ranged from 1 0 l s over night to 3 5 l s morning and evening peak flows simulating typical diurnal fluctuations in wastewater flow during a day hrts range from 14 to 51 min fig 8 a plc programmed with the ict dose pacing logic was used to control the paa dosing pump fig 2 the hydraulic parameters determined by tracer tests were used i e n 42 and f 0 985 the k has been calculated by eq 5 using the data obtained by the two online paa analyzers i e c1 and c2 the c1 has been calculated by eq 6 for an ict setpoint of 16 mg min l 1 the ict dose setpoint of 16 mg min l was selected based on batch disinfection test carried out on the same wastewater prior to the pilot trials more specifically an ict dose yielding a final fecal coliform concentration of 100 cfu 100 ml was selected in this study importantly the advanced ict dose control strategy continuously accounts for changing d and k of paa thereby varying c1 as needed to maintain the ict constant specifically an ict dose setpoint of 16 2 mg min l was maintained irrespective of the numerous changes imposed on flow fig 8a notably the constant ict dose resulted in consistent disinfection performance confirming that the inactivation of microbes was governed hence controlled by the ict dose figs 6 and 8 the small fluctuation in n2 observed was due to fluctuation in n0 fig 8a the disinfection performance was excellent at all time i e n2 observed 100 cfu 100 ml flow pacing experiments were also carried out at similar conditions for flow pacing a setpoint concentration of 1 mg l was used this choice was made in consideration of the anticipated paa demand 0 5 mg l for secondary wastewater effluent and the span of hrt of the pilot system 15 50 min the combinations of these two variables would guarantee nonzero microbial counts in the wastewater effluent as well as a representative residual concentration of disinfectant in contrast to ict dose pacing the ict dose varied during the day resulting in high ict dose at low flow i e longer hrts greater disinfectant decay and low ict dose at high flows i e shorter hrts lower disinfectant decay fig 8b this happened due to the fact that the concentration of paa at the injection point c0 was fixed to a setpoint concentration 1 mg l during flow pacing operation hence the contact time and disinfectant demand and decay were ignored this variation in ict dose was confirmed through the observation that concentration of viable fc at the outlet n2 observed was not consistent the fc counts increased with increasing flow since the ict dose was inadequate the reduction in the ict dose was an immediate indication of a poor disinfection performance i e n2 observed 100 cfu 100 ml fig 8b results show clearly the applicability of the proposed advanced ict dose control strategy to maintain consistent disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater by paa under various water quantity and quality conditions overcoming the limitations of conventional flow pacing control an estimation of the benefit associated with chemical savings was made using the pilot experimental data reported in fig 8 the chemical consumption by ict dose pacing was compared to flow pacing control and is reported in fig s9 significantly the cost comparison indicated that flow pacing required twice the amount of paa than the one required during ict dose pacing i e 2 0 and 1 0 kg paa 1000 m3 of treated wastewater respectively based on those results it can be concluded that the use of ict dose pacing could lead to considerable environmental and economic benefit both in terms of disinfection performance and chemical savings fig 8 and fig s9 it should be noted that the ict dose pacing strategy accounts for variability both in wastewater quality e g disinfectant demand and decay and quantity e g flow which is why a constant ict dose could be successfully maintained during disinfection operations fig 8 it also should be acknowledged that the ability of maintaining an ict setpoint to a desired value relies on the accurate estimation of demand and decay from on line paa analyzers as well as the accuracy of flowmeter information as in every control technology relying on real time data instrument maintenance is key for a successful implementation in the field for the case of on line paa measurements we observed that biofouling on the probe tubing could occur when paa residual is low 0 5 mg l and water temperature is high 25 c therefore weekly maintenance in the order of 1 h per analyzer is estimated in order to guarantee reliable paa measurements thereby enabling advanced disinfection control 4 conclusions an analytical chemical disinfection model resulting from the integration of reactor hydraulics chemical disinfectant demand decay and microbial inactivation kinetics was developed and shown to accurately predict paa inactivation in a contact basin a novel ct based dose control strategy for chemical disinfection of municipal wastewater was validated at pilot scale this control strategy applied to paa disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater was able to dynamically maintain ict dose in presence of representative variation in flow and water quality both the residual disinfectant and microbial counts could be well predicted by the dynamic paa disinfection model the advanced model based ict dose control strategy developed herein is general enough that could be adapted to other chemical disinfection acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the southern ontario water consortium sowc the natural sciences and engineering research council

19018,advanced control of chemical disinfection processes is becoming increasingly important in view of balancing under treatment low pathogen inactivation and over treatment excessive consumption of disinfectant and disinfection byproducts formation thereby providing considerable environmental and economic benefits conventional control strategies such as flow pacing or residual trim ignore chemical demand decay inactivation kinetics and other factors governing disinfection performance in continuous flow reactors such as reactor hydraulics and process variability this study presents the development verification and pilot scale validation of a novel ct based real time disinfection control strategy derived from first principles and applied to peracetic acid disinfection of municipal secondary effluent wastewater validation experiments were carried out using a 3 m3 pilot contact basin of which the hydraulic performance was first characterized by means of tracer tests and then mathematically modeled using the well established theoretical framework of continuous stirred tank reactors in series the analytical model describing hydraulic performance was subsequently extended to take into account disinfectant demand decay and microbial inactivation kinetics the integrated model was successfully used to predict and control residual peracetic acid as well as microbial concentration in the pilot effluent validation studies conclusively supported that the novel ct based control strategy was superior in maintaining constant disinfection performance desired microbial counts and low residual disinfectant under variable flow and wastewater quality when compared with flow pacing the ct based control required two times less the amount of chemical for the same treatment objective 100 cfu 100 ml remarkably the ct based control strategy could be extended to other chemical disinfection processes such as chlorination and ozonation alone or in combination with

of the most important wastewater treatment processes as a matter of fact the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in surface waters as a result of insufficient interrupted or no disinfection may promote the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera typhoid and gastroenteritis fenwick 2006 richardson et al 2002 xiao et al 2018 for example from 2011 to 2012 90 waterborne disease outbreaks as a result of exposure to chemicals or infectious pathogens in recreational waters e g lakes and oceans were reported to the centers for disease control and prevention in the united states resulting in at least 1788 cases 95 hospitalizations and 1 death hlavsa et al 2015 unsafe surface waters pose major risk to ecosystems and human health in both developed and developing countries worldwide chemical e g chlorine peracetic acid and ozone as well as physical e g ultraviolet light and membrane filtration disinfection processes are currently used for wastewater disinfection gehr et al 2003 haas 2000 metcalf eddy et al 2003 rose and masago 2007 inactivation of microorganisms is a process where both the concentration of the disinfectant and the contact time are linked via the concept of exposure i e the product of concentration or intensity and the exposure time irrespective of the disinfection technology disinfection performance is primarily governed by the exposure to the disinfectant i e the target disinfectant dose which is the time dependent concentration of disinfectant integrated over time gujer and von gunten 2003 in mg min l 1 for chemical disinfection or the target ultraviolet uv dose mj cm 2 which is the integral of uv intensity during the exposure period for uv disinfection bolton and linden 2003 gates 1929 thus it should go without saying that if a constant dose of a disinfectant is dynamically maintained during the disinfection process then consistent disinfection performance will be met however especially in wastewater maintaining a constant dose is not trivial due to uncontrolled large variations in water quality and quantity as well as numerous side reactions between the disinfectant and water matrix for example when added to water chemical disinfectants undergo an initial rapid consumption i e instantaneous disinfectant demand followed by a slower decay haas and joffe 1994 haas and karra 1984 as a result dosing strategies not taking into account demand and or decay may result in insufficient disinfection performance and possible violations of regulatory limits while over dosing results in increased operational and environmental costs increased consumption of disinfectant and higher potential formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts dbps not to mention violation of regulatory chemical residual and microbial limits korshin et al 2002 krasner et al 1989 richardson et al 2007 1998 therefore advanced control strategies derived from first principles of chemical disinfection not only have the potential to appropriately balance under treatment and over treatment but also will provide considerable environmental and economic benefits surprisingly the current practice of controlling chemical disinfection processes is empirical based and ignores both contact time and disinfection kinetics this is the case for example of flow pacing control with or without feed forward or feedback sensor based features which relies on maintaining a constant disinfectant residual concentration irrespective of the reactor hydraulics and average contact time in the basin kobylinski et al 2006 more specifically chlorine residual measurements were used to feedback auto control the concentration of chlorine and the required amount of quencher for dechlorination dieu et al 1995 oxidation reduction potential orp measurements have also been suggested to control the process taking advantage of the reactions between chlorine and nitrogen containing compounds kim and hensley 1997 yu 2004 however orp is not a good indicator of inactivation and disinfection efficiency since it is affected by a number of water constituents passively participating in a disinfection process recently a cascade control and a dead time compensation were applied to maintain a constant free chlorine residual at the outlet of a chemical contact basin ccb consisting of a probe at the inlet and outlet demir and woo 2014 flow pacing control strategies were also reported for the disinfection of wastewater by peracetic acid paa where influent water quality parameters e g chemical oxygen demand cod and color were used to drive a feed forward control block et al 2015 the integrated disinfection design framework iddf recommended the following aspects to be considered when designing and implementing a disinfection process i the kinetics of microbial disinfection and dbps formation ii disinfectant demand and decay and iii disinfection reactor hydraulics bellamy et al 1998 ducoste et al 2001 detailed hydrodynamic characteristics are ignored by iddf and the fluids in the reactor are considered as segregated i e the molecules of the fluid do not interact with each other danckwerts 1958 greene et al 2004 pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 zhang et al 2007 zwietering 1959 hence the iddf is limited to applications where no high and frequent variations of water quality and quantity are expected e g drinking water different ct based tables and inactivation models have been proposed for designing chemical disinfection processes in water and wastewater for example ct10 was introduced as a parameter defined as the product of the residual concentration of disinfectant at the outlet of the reactor and the retention time at which 10 of the water passes through the reactor t10 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2007 the main limitation of the ct10 approach is associated with the conservatism inherent in the selection of the contact time i e t10 used for ct calculations thus resulting in unnecessary overdosing of the chemical used in the process gujer and von gunten 2003 zhang et al 2007 for ccbs with multiple chambers the extended t10 method suggested to calculate the disinfection performance for each chamber using the disinfectant concentration at the outlet of each chamber the extended continuous stirred tank reactor cstr method assumes that each chamber of the disinfection reactor behaves as an ideal csrt completely mixed rakness et al 2005 this method can only be applied to conventional multi chamber contactors and its disinfection prediction ability depends on the hydraulic behavior of each chamber jeon et al 2011 a stochastic model for an ozonation reactor incorporating an n cstrs in series hydraulic model and an on line ozone decay estimation i e determined using an online sequencing batch reactor targeting a constant ozone dose has been reported gujer and von gunten 2003 neumann et al 2007a 2007b von gunten et al 1999 the instantaneous demand of ozone was neglected due to lack of a methodology to measure this rapid ozone consumption limiting its application to cases where disinfectant demand is relatively constant e g drinking water elovitz et al 2000 gujer and von gunten 2003 neumann et al 2007b moreover the stochastic nature of this approach limits its applicability in conventional industrial controllers due their limited computational power another method based on n cstrs hydraulic model has been suggested to predict chemical disinfection performance pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 however the kinetic parameters derived from batch conditions were used to control continuous flow disinfection experiments as a result the impact of mixing was not taken into account in the case of municipal wastewater treatment the quantity and quality of the water entering the disinfection process can vary dramatically and unpredictably over time due to a number factors including i diurnal flow variations ii wet weather events iii plant operations and v industrial discharge thus the dose of disinfectant has the potential to vary significantly during operation and disinfection performance cannot be maintained constant in the absence of intelligent dose control clearly it is imperative to develop operational and control strategies able to accurately predict and maintain the efficacy of a given wastewater disinfection process in this study an advanced dose control adc methodology for chemical disinfection of wastewater has been developed evaluated and demonstrated in pilot scale continuous flow real time experimental studies while the adc strategy is applicable to all chemical disinfection processes in this study the demonstration and evaluation of the control strategy was done using paa an alternative to chlorine which has received significant attention in recent years because of its disinfection efficacy and minimal aquatic toxicity antonelli et al 2006 falsanisi et al 2006 henao et al 2018 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 rossi et al 2007 the objectives of this study were to i develop hydraulic chemical reaction and microbial inactivation kinetic models for paa disinfection of wastewater in a continuous flow ccb ii evaluate the three models using data collected from a pilot scale continuous flow experimental setup iii implement the hydraulic and chemical models into an innovative adc algorithm and iv demonstrate and evaluate the control of the chemical disinfection process with the novel adc strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development 2 1 1 chemical reaction model after the instantaneous demand d in mg l 1 paa decay follows first

dispersed free microbes followed by a tailing effect due to the slower inactivation of microbes aggregated with particles resulting in shielding microbes from the chemical disinfectant during paa batch inactivation studies considering this typical biphasic behavior of microbial inactivation in wastewater the inactivation kinetics can be described by a double exponential model i e the sum of two exponential terms each describing one of the two phases santoro et al 2015 an inactivation kinetic model parameter m describing tailing off m 1 or shoulder effects m 1 haas and joffe 1994 has been introduced to the first exponent of the double exponential model eq 3 shoulder effects at low ict were observed in batch paa ict dose response curves performed on secondary effluent wastewater sarathy

microbes in l mg 1 min 1 m and l mg 1 min 1 respectively 2 1 3 hydraulic model n cstrs the n continuous stirred tank reactors n cstrs model assumes that the hydraulic behavior of a reactor can be described by a number n of cstrs in series levenspiel 1999 the introduction of an effective volume factor f to the n cstrs model enables the consideration of possible dead volume of the reactor i e volume that is not replaced by other volumes fig 1 the residence time distribution rtd of n cstrs in series coupled with f is given by eq 4 4 e n n f v q n t f v q n 1 e n t f v q n 1 where en is the exit age distribution in s 1 v is the volume of the ccb in l and q is volumetric flow of wastewater in l s 1 the n and f model parameters are estimated by fitting of tracer test data the residual concentration of paa at the outlet of the ccb c2 can be calculated using a first order kinetic equation for the paa decay eq 1 coupled with the n cstrs hydraulic model levenspiel 1999 as shown in eq 5 5 c 2 c 1 1 k f v q n n eq 5 is particularly useful in disinfection control strategies in that it allows the rapid estimation at steady state of the residual chemical disinfectant at the reactor outlet as a result the amount of quenching agent required to decompose the residual disinfectant could also be predicted and minimized the ict for an ideal plug flow reactor pfr or batch reactor has been earlier defined eq 2 considering the use of the n cstrs model to describe the hydraulic behavior of an arbitrary flow reactor via its residence time distribution function en and the ct dose

disinfection kinetics of a mixed microbial population dispersed and particle associated bacteria is given by the sum of two pseudo first order inactivation models in the ct domain each describing the inactivation of a distinct microbial sub population it is important to emphasize that such first order kinetics are not with respect to time but with respect to disinfectant ct dose specifically ictm for dispersed organisms where m is a coefficient that accounts for shoulder effects in the dose dependent kinetics and ict for particle associated ones by variable substitution it is indeed possible to arrive to the analytical expression reported in eq 7 where the well established conversion equation for a reacting flow following a first order kinetic in n cstrs in series is extended to the ict domain and the total viable microbes at the reactor outlet is given by the summation of each individual viable counts associated with the two distinct microbial sub populations i e dispersed and particle associated at this point the importance for process control associated with eq 7 is immediately evident as a matter of fact eq 7 is an analytical expression where all the important factors governing chemical disinfection are explicitly captured namely reactor hydraulics disinfectant decay and inactivation kinetics it should also be emphasized that by replacing v q with time eq 7 introduces a new family of inactivation models under non ideal mixing disinfectant demand decay mixed microbial populations and non log linear inactivation kinetics with shoulder and tailing 2 2 pilot scale disinfection experiments 2 2 1 pilot ccb to evaluate the hydraulic chemical disinfectant and inactivation kinetic models a 3 m3 4 pass ccb was designed and equipped with a chemical dosing pump qdos30 watson marlow concord ontario canada paa analyzers installed at the inlet and outlet of the ccb hach cl17 hach loveland colorado usa and a programmable logic controller plc programmed with conventional flow pacing logic as well as the innovative ict dose pacing logic was used to control the chemical dosing pump fig 2 the ccb was located in a wastewater treatment plant greenway wastewater treatment centre london ontario canada employing conventional activated sludge secondary treatment this setup enabled the use of real time secondary effluent wastewater as the influent to the ccb the static mixer between the chemical dosing pump and sampling point 1 located at the inlet of the ccb allows the approximation of d which is equal to the difference between the known concentration of paa added c0 and the measured concentration of paa shortly after the static mixer c1 fig 2 2 2 2 chemicals a 208 l drum of 12 paa solution proxitane ww 12 microbiocide was supplied by

studies the volume of the tracer used in the study was determined by preliminary dilution tests in secondary effluent wastewater fig s1 2 2 3 tracer tests a specific volume of dye 50 ml was injected upstream the ccb fig 2 after the mixing stage dye entered the ccb samples were collected over time at the outlet of ccb and analyzed for dye by measuring the absorbance of the sample at 556 nm tracer tests were conducted at wastewater flows of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 l s 2 2 4 model evaluation and process control experiments were conducted for over 100 h to evaluate the models under various water quantity and quality conditions to ensure various icts were tested that is varying extents of microbial inactivation flow pacing control was practiced i e a fixed concentration was continuously delivered by the chemical dosing pump for the evaluation of the models the chemical dosing pump rate the water flow and the paa analyzers measuring concentrations at the inlet c1 and outlet c2 of the ccb were recorded every minute samples were collected hourly at the inlet upstream of the paa dosing point and the outlet of the ccb during 24 h runs using auto samplers as950 portable sampler hach loveland colorado usa preloaded with sodium thiosulfate to quench residual paa the inlet n0 and outlet n2 samples were analyzed for fecal coliforms fc process control experiments were performed during a day to demonstrate constant disinfection performance by maintaining a constant ict dose the ict dose pacing control logic used in this study incorporates the aforementioned mathematical models the flow of the ccb influent was modulated in order to simulate typical diurnal fluctuations observed in a wastewater plant during a day this variation in flow resulted in hydraulic retention times hrts

discussion 3 1 hydraulic model evaluation initially the model parameters of the hydraulic model eq 4 for the pilot scale ccb were estimated by performing tracer tests at water flows of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 l s corresponding to hrts and reynolds numbers re ranges of 20 51 min and 3182 7956 respectively values of index of modal retention time of 0 95 0 93 0 91 and 0 94 at flows of 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 l s respectively were calculated indicating that the designed ccb behaved almost as an ideal reactor at the studied flows fig 3 a shows the comparison between the predicted n cstrs model and observed tracer tests importantly the tracer test data of all tested flows were fitted simultaneously by the model resulting in a single set of fitted parameters i e n 42 and f 0 985 the n cstrs model fitted well the experimental rtd data with an r2 of 0 98 fig s2 the good fit is supported by f test where it was shown that the variances of model predicted data and observed data are statistically equal at 95 confidence interval table s1 several hydraulic models including the n cstrs model have been investigated in characterizing the hydraulic behavior of ccbs gorzalski et al 2018 neumann et al 2007a 2007b pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 it is important to note that an ideal hydraulic model should be able to characterize the behavior of a generic ccb including those deviating from plug flow and poorly baffled configurations indeed this is one of the strengths of the hydraulic architecture proposed in this study as it relies on the full rtd as the input for process control rather than its 10th percentile only as in the ct10 approach this will allow the application of the control strategy to various hydraulic conditions to that effect the evaluation of the n cstrs hydraulic model was expanded by fitting the model to tracer test data reported in other published literature amini et al 2011 angeloudis et al 2014 teixeira and do nascimento siqueira 2008 fig 3b shows a good agreement between observed and predicted data for four different reactors of varying geometries and hydraulic behaviors the n cstrs hydraulic model fitted parameters n and f along with the schematics of the ccbs of different studies are presented in table 1 despite the different geometries of ccbs and hrts resulting in different tracer curves the hydraulic model fits well all the experimental data r2 0 96 fig 3b and table 1 figs s2 s6 the hydraulic model fitted parameters varied from 9 to 42 and 0 890 1 000 for n and f respectively table 1 this confirms the plug flow like conditions and limited axial dispersion achieved in all the disinfection contact basins used in the studies n 5 with very little dead zones f 0 890 the f tests performed for each fit showed that the variances of model predicted data and observed data are statistically equal at 95 confidence interval tables s1 s5 3 2 n cstrs chemical reaction model evaluation to evaluate the chemical reaction model eq 5 five 23 h experimental runs were carried out under various conditions fig 4 a shows the variation of c0 c1 and hrt over a total of 115 h of operation for the first 23 h run 1 c0 was relatively stable with only a slight decrement from 1 7 mg l to 1 5 mg l while c1 decreased gradually from 1 2 mg l to 0 3 mg l hrt increased from 20 to 40 min over the 23 h run during the run 2 hours 23 46 c0 c1 and hrt were constant at 1 7 mg l 0 7 mg l and 21 min respectively for run 3 hrt increased gradually from 25 to 51 min over the 23 h period of time hours 46 69 while c0 and c1 were not changed fig 4a hrt was maintained constant at 15 min for run 4 hours 69 92 and run 5 hours 92 115 c0 and c1 were 2 6 mg l and 1 9 mg l respectively for run 4 and 0 8 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively for run 5 fig 4a the variation of these parameters is important to evaluate the models under a wide range of operational and environmental conditions the inlet secondary effluent wastewater has been characterized in terms of tss cod and uvt throughout the experiments fig 4b the purpose of monitoring and reporting uvt is simply to provide another bulk water quality parameter that is affected by soluble and particulate inorganic and organic compounds for the first 12 h of run 1 tss cod and uvt were 12 mg l 20 mg l and 70 respectively from the 12th hour to the end of run 1 23rd hour tss and cod increased to 30 mg l and 45 mg l respectively while uvt decreased to 60 during the run 2 tss cod and uvt were constant at 15 mg l 25 mg l and 65 respectively interestingly a major snow melt event which caused a significant plant upset occurred during run 3 resulting in a very high tss up to 170 mg l and cod up to 190 mg l values fig 4b the high flow event was verified by the dramatic increase of the plant flow from 100 000 to 375 000 m3 d corresponding to a peaking factor pf of 3 75 fig s7 for run 4 tss cod and uvt were constant at 20 mg l 45 mg l and 65 respectively another high cod up to 110 mg l event occurred during run 5 tss also increased up to 35 mg l during the same run fig 4b the evaluation of the developed models under varied wastewater quality conditions is critical because the control strategy proposed herein has been developed specifically to respond to real time variations that take place during wastewater disinfection previously reported studies on the control of chemical disinfection focused on drinking water hence they were evaluated under relatively consistent and clean water quality conditions e g cod 5 mg l gujer and von gunten 2003 wang et al 2013 fig 5 shows the prediction of the residual concentration of paa c2 at the outlet of the ccb by the n cstrs chemical reaction model eq 5 the rate constant k was fitted for each run individually i e for 5 runs of 23 h each using excel solver with the aim to minimize the sum of square errors sse between experimental observed c2 and model predicted c2 the model predicted reasonably well r2 0 96 the c2 at a wide range of concentrations i e from 0 2 mg l to 2 0 mg l fig 5 and fig s8 the good fit was also supported by f tests table s6 it is noted that the variance of predicted c2 is in agreement with the c1 measured by the paa analyzer figs 4a and 5 the independent validation of the chemical reaction model has not been considered in published studies where the models were evaluated only in terms of predicting overall microbial inactivation pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 the ability of a model to predict the residual of the chemical disinfectant at the outlet of the reactor c2 has practical implications for wastewater disinfection applications where quenching of the residual disinfectant is required e g dechlorination the fitted parameter k of the n cstrs chemical reaction model for each 23 h run is given in table 2 the parameter was similar 0 010 min 1 for runs 1 3 and 4 for run 2 k was slightly higher 0 014 min 1 run 5 had the highest k of 0 023 min 1 table 2 the range of k determined during 5 batch experiments in secondary effluent wastewater of the same plant was from 0 006 to 0 020 min 1 table s7 which is in agreement with the k calculated in pilot scale tests table 2 3 3 n cstrs microbial inactivation model evaluation intel and outlet samples were collected hourly and analyzed for fc to evaluate the n cstrs microbial inactivation model eq 7 the ict was calculated by eq 6 using the previously determined parameters i e n and f from n cstrs hydraulic model and k from n cstrs chemical reaction model the average ict of every hour was used in eq 7 to fit the microbial inactivation data of each run individually the four parameters of the model β kd m and kp were fitted using excel solver to minimize the sse between the observed and predicted fc concentration at the outlet of ccb fig 6 shows a satisfactory agreement between the observed and the model predicted microbial inactivation data during the first run hours 0 23 ict was constant the inlet concentration of fc n0 increased rapidly from 5000 to 100 000 cfu 100 ml resulting in an increase of the outlet concentration of fc n2 similarly at a constant ict an increase of n0 resulted in an increase of n2 observed during run 5 hours 92 115 it was expected that an increase of n0 at a constant ict would result in an increase of the outlet fc concentration importantly the model n2 predicted was able to fit well the observed data in both cases fig 6 during run 2 hours 23 46 and run 4 hours 69 92 both n0 and ict were constant this resulted in a constant concentration of fc at the outlet the results of these 2 runs confirm that a constant disinfection performance can be achieved at a constant ict and n0 this is in agreement with the microbial inactivation kinetic model used in this study where the outlet concentration of fc is a function of ict and n0 eq 7 thus the model could predict this constant disinfection performance fig 6 during run 3 hours 46 69 the n0 was constant at high values between 50 000 and 234 000 cfu 100 ml interestingly the high n0 values are in agreement with the high tss and cod values due to the snow melt high influent flow plant upset event figs 4b and 6 despite the relatively constant value of n0 during run 3 the n2 observed was not constant because of the different ict significantly the n2 observed showed an ict dependency i e n2 observed was higher at lower ict fig 6 importantly the model n2 predicted could capture the variation of n2 observed due to the variation of ict at a constant n0 fig 6 the good prediction of the extent of disinfection by the model r2 0 82 was supported by an f test performed using all data obtained during the 115 h tests fig 7 and table s8 the f test showed that the variances of the n2 predicted and n2 observed are statistically equal at 95 confidence interval table s8 the fitted parameters of the n cstrs microbial inactivation model for each 23 h run are presented in table 3 the model calibration started from initial guesses of the model parameters these initial guesses were taken from batch inactivation kinetics in secondary effluent wastewater of the same plant table s9 the fraction of particle associated microbes β varied from 0 011 to 0 164 the highest value of β was observed during run 3 which is in agreement with the high tss value of the inlet secondary effluent wastewater fig 4b and table 3 the kd was similar for runs 1 4 a lower kd was observed for run 5 table 3 the m was always higher than 1 indicating shoulder effects the kp was not zero only during runs 2 and 3 indicating the resistance of particle associated microbes compared to free microbes it is worth noting that the chick watson microbial inactivation model used in other reported studies does not consider particle associated microbes relevant to wastewater hence the application of these control strategies is limited to drinking water disinfection where particles are negligible chick 1908 gujer and von gunten 2003 neumann et al 2007b pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 watson 1908 this is the first time that the double exponential model eq 3 which accounts for particle associated microbes has been incorporated into a hydraulic model resulting in a comprehensive integrated disinfection model eq 7 3 4 evaluation of ict dose based process control strategy the models developed herein were used in a novel strategy for controlling the disinfection process by maintaining constant ict dose during the process control experiments the flow ranged from 1 0 l s over night to 3 5 l s morning and evening peak flows simulating typical diurnal fluctuations in wastewater flow during a day hrts range from 14 to 51 min fig 8 a plc programmed with the ict dose pacing logic was used to control the paa dosing pump fig 2 the hydraulic parameters determined by tracer tests were used i e n 42 and f 0 985 the k has been calculated by eq 5 using the data obtained by the two online paa analyzers i e c1 and c2 the c1 has been calculated by eq 6 for an ict setpoint of 16 mg min l 1 the ict dose setpoint of 16 mg min l was selected based on batch disinfection test carried out on the same wastewater prior to the pilot trials more specifically an ict dose yielding a final fecal coliform concentration of 100 cfu 100 ml was selected in this study importantly the advanced ict dose control strategy continuously accounts for changing d and k of paa thereby varying c1 as needed to maintain the ict constant specifically an ict dose setpoint of 16 2 mg min l was maintained irrespective of the numerous changes imposed on flow fig 8a notably the constant ict dose resulted in consistent disinfection performance confirming that the inactivation of microbes was governed hence controlled by the ict dose figs 6 and 8 the small fluctuation in n2 observed was due to fluctuation in n0 fig 8a the disinfection performance was excellent at all time i e n2 observed 100 cfu 100 ml flow pacing experiments were also carried out at similar conditions for flow pacing a setpoint concentration of 1 mg l was used this choice was made in consideration of the anticipated paa demand 0 5 mg l for secondary wastewater effluent and the span of hrt of the pilot system 15 50 min the combinations of these two variables would guarantee nonzero microbial counts in the wastewater effluent as well as a representative residual concentration of disinfectant in contrast to ict dose pacing the ict dose varied during the day resulting in high ict dose at low flow i e longer hrts greater disinfectant decay and low ict dose at high flows i e shorter hrts lower disinfectant decay fig 8b this happened due to the fact that the concentration of paa at the injection point c0 was fixed to a setpoint concentration 1 mg l during flow pacing operation hence the contact time and disinfectant demand and decay were ignored this variation in ict dose was confirmed through the observation that concentration of viable fc at the outlet n2 observed was not consistent the fc counts increased with increasing flow since the ict dose was inadequate the reduction in the ict dose was an immediate indication of a poor disinfection performance i e n2 observed 100 cfu 100 ml fig 8b results show clearly the applicability of the proposed advanced ict dose control strategy to maintain consistent disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater by paa under various water quantity and quality conditions overcoming the limitations of conventional flow pacing control an estimation of the benefit associated with chemical savings was made using the pilot experimental data reported in fig 8 the chemical consumption by ict dose pacing was compared to flow pacing control and is reported in fig s9 significantly the cost comparison indicated that flow pacing required twice the amount of paa than the one required during ict dose pacing i e 2 0 and 1 0 kg paa 1000 m3 of treated wastewater respectively based on those results it can be concluded that the use of ict dose pacing could lead to considerable environmental and economic benefit both in terms of disinfection performance and chemical savings fig 8 and fig s9 it should be noted that the ict dose pacing strategy accounts for variability both in wastewater quality e g disinfectant demand and decay and quantity e g flow which is why a constant ict dose could be successfully maintained during disinfection operations fig 8 it also should be acknowledged that the ability of maintaining an ict setpoint to a desired value relies on the accurate estimation of demand and decay from on line paa analyzers as well as the accuracy of flowmeter information as in every control technology relying on real time data instrument maintenance is key for a successful implementation in the field for the case of on line paa measurements we observed that biofouling on the probe tubing could occur when paa residual is low 0 5 mg l and water temperature is high 25 c therefore weekly maintenance in the order of 1 h per analyzer is estimated in order to guarantee reliable paa measurements thereby enabling advanced disinfection control 4 conclusions an analytical chemical disinfection model resulting from the integration of reactor hydraulics chemical disinfectant demand decay and microbial inactivation kinetics was developed and shown to accurately predict paa inactivation in a contact basin a novel ct based dose control strategy for chemical disinfection of municipal wastewater was validated at pilot scale this control strategy applied to paa disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater was able to dynamically maintain ict dose in presence of representative variation in flow and water quality both the residual disinfectant and microbial counts could be well predicted by the dynamic paa disinfection model the advanced model based ict dose control strategy developed herein is general enough that could be adapted to other chemical disinfection acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the southern ontario water consortium sowc the natural sciences and engineering research council

was applied to evaluate densities of key viral pathogens in raw sewage eftim et al 2017 briefly a two stage bootstrap analysis was applied to datasets for each coliphage type efron and tibshirani 1994 hastie et al 2001 in stage 1 the dataset was first separated into subsets based on geographic region and season samples sizes equal to the original region or season specific subsets were drawn with replacement and with equal weight for 10 000 iterations resulting in a distribution of estimated means standard deviations and 95 confidence intervals the objective of this stage was to understand variation in the distribution of coliphage densities associated with geographic region and season table 2 in stage 2 a stratified bootstrap approach incorporated variation contributed by each subset geographic region and season unlike in stage 1 the number of samples randomly selected from each subset were allowed to vary and were proportional to the subset sample size thus the approach accounts for the large variability in the number of coliphage samples taken under different seasons and across geographic regions for the stage 2 analysis the sampling step was repeated for 100 500 1 000 and 3000 iterations the samples were pooled and the means standard deviations and their 95 confidence intervals were estimated the means of the bootstrapped distributions were compared to each other using the kolmogorov smirnov test lehmann and d abrera 2006 2 2 2 coliphage distributions in ambient waters to develop distributions of coliphage densities in ambient waters an approach that accounts for a potentially large number of values below the detection limit often called left censored data was employed several approaches can be used to develop descriptive statistics with censored data in the environmental field including substitution maximum likelihood nonparametric methods and semi parametric methods typically the amount of available uncensored data determines the best suited approach helsel 2005 first using boxplots and summary statistics the variability in the detected data only was evaluated next two statistical approaches to estimate the distribution that best fit the data accounting for the nondetects 1 a non parametric kaplan meier method which requires no assumption about a particular distributional shape and 2 the maximum likelihood approach which assumes the distribution normal lognormal or other form will closely fit the shape of the observed data was used when censoring does not occur the two approaches provide identical results we compared the best fit under three separate approaches when using the detected data only the kaplan meier approach and the maximum likelihood approach the ambient data distributions were also graphically compared using the cumulative distribution functions of the empirical distribution function and the best fit theoretical distribution delignette muller and dutang 2015 we compared the distributions using the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test 3 results fig 1 illustrates the overall literature search strategy and number of titles retrieved a total of 459 titles remained after duplicates from the two databases were removed literature search 1 was conducted in july 2014 and it was updated with literature searches 2 and 3 which were conducted in september 2015 and january 2017 respectively after a full text review 104 references passed study scope inclusion criteria for raw wastewater and 122 references passed study scope inclusion criteria for ambient water of the studies that passed scope 79 passed study quality inclusion criteria for raw wastewater and 94 passed study quality inclusion criteria for ambient water individual data points were obtained for 17 studies for raw wastewater table 1 and for 21 studies for ambient water table 2 together these studies provided a total of 2124 individual data points table 1 coliphage in raw wastewater n 333 somatic and n 397 msc table 2 coliphage in ambient water n 391 somatic and n 1011 msc in raw wastewater only one data point was reported below lod which was substituted with the lod reported in the publication table 1 blanch et al 2006 however in ambient waters 5 of the sc and 49 of the msc data were below the lod table 2 the literature searches yielded references with quantitative data representing six geographic regions including 20 countries for both raw wastewater and ambient see tables 1 and 2 3 1 descriptive statistics table 3 presents the summary statistics of the observed coliphage densities in raw wastewaters for msc and sc in raw wastewater the observed densities ranged from 1 7 to 8 34 and from 2 0 to 7 98 log10 pfu l respectively data not shown approximately 82 of all samples were collected in north america and europe with the remaining 18 from china japan singapore and south africa table 3 the season and geographic region specific observed msc and sc densities in raw wastewater were not normally distributed k s test p values 0 001 except for msc densities in asia sc densities in north america and africa and sc in the fall observed sc densities were higher in fall winter and spring compared to summer kruskal wallis test p value 0 006 and observed msc densities were higher in winter and fall compared to spring and summer kruskal wallis test p value 0 001 fig 2 b however it should be noted that seasonal information was unavailable for approximately 32 of the data the observed median densities of sc in raw wastewater were consistently significantly higher compared to median densities of msc a phenomenon independent of geographic region fig 2a and season fig 2b the exception was in north america where the median density of msc was significantly higher than median for sc mann whitney test p value 0 002 table 4 presents the summary statistics of the observed coliphage densities in ambient waters the observed densities for the msc and sc in ambient waters ranged from 0 52 to 6 85 and from 0 95 to 6 96 log10 pfu l respectively data not shown approximately 60 of all ambient samples were collected in north america and europe with the remaining 40 from south america asia and oceania table 4 the shapiro wilk tests for normality revealed that the season and geographic region specific observed msc and sc ambient densities were normally distributed shapiro wilk test p values 0 001 except for sc in asia both msc and sc in oceania msc in spring and fall and sc in fall and winter the sc ambient densities were significantly different across the geographic regions kruskal wallis test p

kruskal wallis tests p value 0 05 the lowest observed mean msc ambient densities were in oceania and the highest were observed in asia table 4 in terms of seasonality observed mean sc ambient densities were higher in spring and summer compared to fall and winter fig 2d summer vs winter t test p value 0 001 additionally the observed median ambient densities of sc were consistently significantly higher compared to median ambient densities of msc in europe oceania spring and summer p values for msc versus sc comparisons mann whitney test 0 001 although the same trend is present in north america and in the fall the difference is not significant mann whitney test p values 0 05 for asia and in the winter the median ambient densities of sc are lower than for msc but not significantly so 3 2 distributions of coliphage densities in raw wastewater next a two stage bootstrap analysis was conducted to further understand variation in the distribution of coliphage densities associated with geographic region and season table 5 presents the results of the stage 1 bootstrap analysis for msc there is a significant difference in the mean density distribution between europe and north america and asia fig 3 left panel dunn s test p values 0 01 and for somatic there is a significant difference in the mean density distributions between all geographic locations dunn s test p value 0 01 fig 3 right panel consistently across geographic regions and across seasons the mean sc densities are higher than the mean msc densities t test p values 0 001 the only exception is in north america where the sc mean density is statistically significantly lower than the mean density of msc 5 2 log10 pfu l versus 5 9 log10 pfu l t test p value 0 001 table 5 a seasonal difference in mean coliphage density in raw wastewater was also observed with the greatest differences between spring and summer for both msc and sc dunn s test p values 0 01 with a winter peak for both coliphage types table 5 and fig 4 the season specific bootstrapped distributions obtained in stage 1 are all significantly different from each other for both msc and sc kruskal wallis test p value 0 001 for comparisons among seasons see fig 4 however application of the stage 2 bootstrap analysis table 5 which accounts for the number of samples taken from each geographic region and season sample subset resulted in no statistically significant difference between the seasonal and geographic region distributional estimates created for msc means 5 8 and 5 9 log10 pfu l respectively t test p values 0 001 and sc means 6 0 and 6 5 log10 pfu l respectively t test p values 0 001 for the stage 2 bootstrap analysis a sensitivity analysis additionally evaluated the impact of the number of sampling iterations on the bootstrapped coliphage density distributions for 100 500 1 000 and 3000 iterations and indicated the number of iterations did not affect results figs s1 and s2 in supplemental file the results for 3000 iterations in this analysis are presented fig 5 table 5 3 3 distributions of coliphage densities in ambient waters table 6 compares the estimated means and standard deviations of the distributions of coliphage in ambient waters using 1 the detected data only i e excluding the nondetects 2 the kaplan meier non parametric method and 3 the maximum likelihood approach with the assumption of normality on the entire dataset the results illustrate the three methods are comparable when the number of nondetects in the dataset is small 5 which is the case for sc however for the msc dataset 49 of the samples are nondetects the mean of the distribution of msc in ambient waters estimated when excluding the nondetects is significantly higher than the means estimated including nondetects 2 2 versus 1 6 and 1 4 log10 pfu l t test p values 0 001 table 6 the kaplan meier and the maximum likelihood approaches yield similar results for msc and for sc the best fit parameters for the distributions of both msc and sc in ambient waters are provided in table 6 for sc the kaplan meier and mle distribution are not statistically different k s test p value 0 05 while the empirical distribution based on the detected data under predicts slightly k s test p value 0 014 for msc the empirical distribution cdf cumulative distribution function lies under the kaplan meier and the mle distributions additionally the theoretical and empirical probability distribution curves of the data are visually discordant due to the large percent of nondetects of msc in ambient waters fig s3 4 discussion this work summarizes coliphage density data in raw wastewater and in ambient waters distributions of indicators and pathogens based on a critical review of the literature add value to risk assessments soller et al 2015 2018 and a greater understanding water and wastewater treatment needs mcminn et al 2017 pouillot et al 2015 olivieri et al 2016 we applied a systematic literature search approach in identifying relevant literature the study selection process is reproducible and can be modified to incorporate additional data as they become available developing distributions of pathogen densities in various environmental matrices can be challenging with respect to data availability and the amount of data below the detection limits davies et al 2003 till et al 2008 didonato et al 2009 in addition data are heterogeneous with respect to geographical region and sampling season and not all authors report a sampling date or season in this work computational approaches tailored to the type and amount of data available are presented distributions were developed using a meta analysis approach combining heterogeneous data from all the available studies which provides more comprehensive information than individual study based distributions eftim et al 2017 when few data points were below the lod the two step bootstrap analysis produced a distribution mean and standard deviation the bootstrap analysis is useful because it 1 is non parametric 2 does not assume a shape for the underlying statistical distribution and 3 allows for the evaluation of and the accounting for subsets of data of various sizes sampled at different geographic regions and over different seasons seasonal and geographic region influences might be especially important for certain pathogens grassley and fraser 2006 gerba et al 2017 cherrie et al 2018 such as norovirus which is found in higher densities in the winter and spring eftim et al 2017 for left censored data the kaplan meier or maximum likelihood approaches can be useful for limiting uncertainties in distribution estimates helsel 2005 lim et al 2015 used a similarly left censored data maximum likelihood regression technique to estimate parameters that characterize the viral distributions for norovirus and adenovirus in surface waters our analysis shows that accounting for nondetects is important especially when approximately half of the dataset includes non detects 49 instead of applying a commonly used strategy of substituting nondetects with preset values i e half the limit of detection which has been shown to yield biased distributional parameter estimates helsel 2005 we employed multiple statistical methods for left censored data our results indicate that excluding the nondetects yields distributions with very different means compared with when including nondetects especially for msc table 6 further because the kaplan meier and maximum likelihood results are very similar for msc a goodness of fit of the log normal shape of the distribution to the data is suggested the log normal assumption is consistent with the finding that most microbial data in the environment are log normally distributed esmen and hammad 1977 wymer and wade 2007 however in situations where the shape of the distribution is not known or cannot be determined based on the detected data only e g when the sample size is small the nonparametric kaplan meier method may be an appropriate way to estimate distributional parameters helsel 2005 our study results illustrate that observed sc densities significantly outnumber msc densities in both raw wastewater and in ambient waters tables 3 and 4 which is consistent with the literature moce llivina et al 2005 didonato et al 2009 mcminn et al 2017 additionally in ambient waters sc are detected in a higher percentage of samples as compared to msc table 6 the estimated distributions of our two stage bootstrap analysis also result in distributions with a higher density of sc than msc in raw wastewater overall means 6 0 and 5 8 log10 pfu l respectively table 5 but the difference between the two coliphage types is not significant when the analysis accounts for geographic region or season table 5 these bootstrapped estimates for msc and sc in raw wastewater are similar to meta analysis estimates previously reported in the literature mcminn et al 2017 reported observed mean densities of msc and sc in raw wastewaters 5 2 and 5 3 log10 pfu l respectively additionally in an earlier meta analysis pouillot et al 2015 reported a conditional posterior distribution of msc in raw wastewater with a mean of 6 2 log10 pfu l while results are overall similar several reasons for the differences in our study include different study inclusion criteria different numerical evaluation approaches and due to the timing of our analysis inclusion of data from several newly published studies e g bailey et al 2017 montazeri et al 2015 a seasonal difference in observed mean coliphage densities was observed in raw wastewater and in ambient waters for raw wastewater there was a winter peak for both coliphage types in the bootstrap analysis this seasonal variability in msc and sc is similar to what was observed for norovirus in raw wastewater which had significantly higher peaks in winter and spring compared to summer and fall eftim et al 2017 the winter peak in msc is also consistent with pouillot et al 2015 where authors noted a significant increase in predicted mean densities of msc between february to june i e winter and spring as compared to their twelve month mean density estimate 5 conclusions the systematic literature search and a two stage bootstrap analysis provide robust methods for developing distributions for indicator and pathogen densities additionally the kaplan meier or maximum likelihood approaches can be useful for limiting uncertainties in distributional estimates when datasets contain nondetects the resulting distributions of msc and sc in raw wastewater and ambient waters will be useful in the future for a wide range of risk assessment applications in diverse geographic regions

data sources and literature search a systematic literature search of the peer reviewed literature for articles reporting coliphage densities in raw wastewater and ambient water in pubmed http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed and web of science was performed the search included the keywords somatic coliphage or f specific or male specific coliphage or male specific bacteriophage or frna or somcph or male coliphage and water or influent or effluent or ambient or sewage or wastewater the literature search was limited to peer reviewed publications written in english between 1990 and january 2017 study inclusion criteria were applied to each publication which comprised scope step 1 study quality step 2 and data availability step 3 for step 1 two independent screeners first evaluated the titles and abstracts of retrieved articles to assess whether the paper would likely include coliphage density data in ambient water raw wastewater or wastewater treatment effluent two reviewers then reviewed the full text for papers whose abstracts passed the first screening step to confirm that the paper contained quantitative density data for coliphage in ambient water and raw wastewater papers with only presence absence data and papers reporting on animal manure wastewater facilities were excluded the step 2 study quality screen included an evaluation of the assay type and clarity coliphage

freshwater geographic region sample size and seasonal information or sampling dates after a publication passed both the scope and quality criteria it was evaluated for data availability step 3 for this screening step a requirement was for publications to include individual data points not summary measures i e means or medians in some cases individual data points were available in a table or were digitized from figures using getdata graph digitizer version 2 25 http www getdata graph digitizer com and webplotdigitizer version 3 12 http arohatgi info webplotdigitizer app data from study authors was requested when raw data were not available in the manuscript figures or supplemental materials if the author sent data and those data aligned with the published information those datasets

published multiple papers using the same dataset only one publication was used to represent the dataset 2 2 statistical approaches coliphage samples were collected under a variety of conditions and enumerated using different analytical methods in the studies selected several studies quantified both msc and sc from the same sample in such cases a sample provided two individual data points for our

unequal variances log means of coliphage were compared across region or season using anova when the anova test rejects the null hypothesis of no differences we used tukey s post hoc honest

was applied to evaluate densities of key viral pathogens in raw sewage eftim et al 2017 briefly a two stage bootstrap analysis was applied to datasets for each coliphage type efron and tibshirani 1994 hastie et al 2001 in stage 1 the dataset was first separated into subsets based on geographic region and season samples sizes equal to the original region or season specific subsets were drawn with replacement and with equal weight for 10 000 iterations resulting in a distribution of estimated means standard deviations and 95 confidence intervals the objective of this stage was to understand variation in the distribution of coliphage densities associated with geographic region and season table 2 in stage 2 a stratified bootstrap approach incorporated variation contributed by each subset geographic region and season unlike in stage 1 the number of samples randomly selected from each subset were allowed to vary and were proportional to the subset sample size thus the approach accounts for the large variability in the number of coliphage samples taken under different seasons and across geographic regions for the stage 2 analysis the sampling step was repeated for 100 500 1 000 and 3000 iterations the samples were pooled and the means standard deviations and their 95 confidence intervals were estimated the means of the bootstrapped distributions were compared to each other using the kolmogorov smirnov test lehmann and d abrera 2006 2 2 2 coliphage distributions in ambient waters to develop distributions of coliphage densities in ambient waters an approach that accounts for a potentially large number of values below the detection limit often called left censored data was employed several approaches can be used to develop descriptive statistics with censored data in the environmental field including substitution maximum likelihood nonparametric methods and semi parametric methods typically the amount of available uncensored data determines the best suited approach helsel 2005 first using boxplots and summary statistics the variability in the detected data only was evaluated next two statistical approaches to estimate the distribution that best fit the data accounting for the nondetects 1 a non parametric kaplan meier method which requires no assumption about a particular distributional shape and 2 the maximum likelihood approach which assumes the distribution normal lognormal or other form will closely fit the shape of the observed data was used when censoring does not occur the two approaches provide identical results we compared the best fit under three separate approaches when using the detected data only the kaplan meier approach and the maximum likelihood approach the ambient data distributions were also graphically compared using the cumulative distribution functions of the empirical distribution function and the best fit theoretical distribution delignette muller and dutang 2015 we compared the distributions using the two sample

associated with geographic region and season table 5 presents the results of the stage 1 bootstrap analysis for msc there is a significant difference in the mean density distribution between europe and north america and asia fig 3 left panel dunn s test p values 0 01 and for somatic there is a significant difference in the mean density distributions between all geographic locations dunn s test p value 0 01 fig 3 right panel consistently across geographic regions and across seasons the mean sc densities are higher than the mean msc densities t test p values 0 001 the only exception is in north america where the sc mean density is statistically significantly lower than the mean density of msc 5 2 log10 pfu l versus 5 9 log10 pfu l t test p value 0 001 table 5 a seasonal difference in mean coliphage density in raw wastewater was also observed with the greatest differences between spring and summer for both msc and sc dunn s test p values 0 01 with a winter peak for both coliphage types table 5 and fig 4 the season specific bootstrapped distributions obtained in stage 1 are all significantly different from each other for both msc and sc kruskal wallis test p value 0 001 for comparisons among seasons see fig 4 however application of the stage 2 bootstrap analysis table 5 which accounts for the number of samples taken from each geographic region and season sample subset resulted in no statistically significant difference between the seasonal and geographic region distributional estimates created for msc means 5 8 and 5 9 log10 pfu l respectively t test p values 0 001 and sc means 6 0 and 6 5 log10 pfu l respectively t test p values 0 001 for the stage 2 bootstrap analysis a sensitivity analysis additionally evaluated the impact of the number of sampling iterations on the bootstrapped coliphage density distributions for 100 500 1 000 and 3000 iterations and indicated the number of iterations did not affect results figs s1 and s2 in supplemental file the results for 3000 iterations in this analysis are presented fig 5 table 5 3 3 distributions of coliphage densities in ambient waters table 6 compares the estimated means and standard deviations of the distributions of coliphage in ambient waters using 1 the detected data only i e excluding the nondetects 2 the kaplan meier non parametric method and 3 the maximum likelihood approach with the assumption of normality on the entire dataset the results illustrate the three methods are comparable when the number of nondetects in the dataset is small 5 which is the case for sc however for the msc dataset 49 of the samples are nondetects the mean of the distribution of msc in ambient waters estimated when excluding the nondetects is significantly higher than the means estimated including nondetects 2 2 versus 1 6 and 1 4 log10 pfu l t test p values 0 001 table 6 the kaplan meier and the maximum likelihood approaches yield similar results for msc and for sc the best fit parameters for the distributions of both msc and sc in ambient waters are provided in table 6 for sc the kaplan meier and mle distribution are not statistically different k s test p value 0 05 while the empirical distribution based on the detected data under predicts slightly k s test p value 0 014 for msc the empirical distribution cdf cumulative distribution function lies under the kaplan meier and the mle distributions additionally the theoretical and empirical probability distribution curves of the data are visually discordant due to the large percent of nondetects of msc in ambient waters fig s3 4 discussion this work summarizes coliphage density data in raw wastewater and in ambient waters distributions of indicators and pathogens based on a critical review of the literature add value to risk assessments soller et al 2015 2018 and a greater understanding water and wastewater treatment needs mcminn et al 2017 pouillot et al 2015 olivieri et al 2016 we applied a systematic literature search approach in identifying relevant literature the study selection process is reproducible and can be modified to incorporate additional data as they become available developing distributions of pathogen densities in various environmental matrices can be challenging with respect to data availability and the amount of data below the detection limits davies et al 2003 till et al 2008 didonato et al 2009 in addition data are heterogeneous with respect to geographical region and sampling season and not all authors report a sampling date or season in this work computational approaches tailored to the type and amount of data available are presented distributions were developed using a meta analysis approach combining heterogeneous data from all the available studies which provides more comprehensive information than individual study based distributions eftim et al 2017 when few data points were below the lod the two step bootstrap analysis produced a distribution mean and standard deviation the bootstrap analysis is useful because it 1 is non parametric 2 does not assume a shape for the underlying statistical distribution and 3 allows for the evaluation of and the accounting for subsets of data of various sizes sampled at different geographic regions and over different seasons seasonal and geographic region influences might be especially important for certain pathogens grassley and fraser 2006 gerba et al 2017 cherrie et al 2018 such as norovirus which is found in higher densities in the winter and spring eftim et al 2017 for left censored data the kaplan meier or maximum likelihood approaches can be useful for limiting uncertainties in distribution estimates helsel 2005 lim et al 2015 used a similarly left censored data maximum likelihood regression technique to estimate parameters that characterize the viral distributions for norovirus and adenovirus in surface waters our analysis shows that accounting for nondetects is important especially when approximately half of the dataset includes non detects 49 instead of applying a commonly used strategy of substituting nondetects with preset values i e half the limit of detection which has been shown to yield biased distributional parameter estimates helsel 2005 we employed multiple statistical methods for left censored data our results indicate that excluding the nondetects yields distributions with very different means compared with when including nondetects especially for msc table 6 further because the kaplan meier and maximum likelihood results are very similar for msc a goodness of fit of the log normal shape of the distribution to the data is suggested the log normal assumption is consistent with the finding that most microbial data in the environment are log normally distributed esmen and hammad 1977 wymer and wade 2007 however in situations where the shape of the distribution is not known or cannot be determined based on the detected data only e g when the sample size is small the nonparametric kaplan meier method may be an appropriate way to estimate distributional parameters helsel 2005 our study results illustrate that observed sc densities significantly outnumber msc densities in both raw wastewater and in ambient waters tables 3 and 4 which is consistent with the literature moce llivina et al 2005 didonato et al 2009 mcminn et al 2017 additionally in ambient waters sc are detected in a higher percentage of samples as compared to msc table 6 the estimated distributions of our two stage bootstrap analysis also result in distributions with a higher density of sc than msc in raw wastewater overall means 6 0 and 5 8 log10 pfu l respectively table 5 but the difference between the two coliphage types is not significant when the analysis accounts for geographic region or season table 5 these bootstrapped estimates for msc and sc in raw wastewater are similar to meta analysis estimates previously reported in the literature mcminn et al 2017 reported observed mean densities of msc and sc in raw wastewaters 5 2 and 5 3 log10 pfu l respectively additionally in an earlier meta analysis pouillot et al 2015 reported a conditional posterior distribution of msc in raw wastewater with a mean of 6 2 log10 pfu l while results are overall similar several reasons for the differences in our study include different study inclusion criteria different numerical evaluation approaches and due to the timing of our analysis inclusion of data from several newly published studies e g bailey et al 2017 montazeri et al 2015 a seasonal difference in observed mean coliphage densities was observed in raw wastewater and in ambient waters for raw wastewater there was a winter peak for both coliphage types in the bootstrap analysis this seasonal variability in msc and sc is similar to what was observed for norovirus in raw wastewater which had significantly higher peaks in winter and spring compared to summer and fall eftim et al 2017 the winter peak in msc is also consistent with pouillot et al 2015 where authors noted a significant increase in predicted mean densities of msc between february to june i e winter and spring as compared to their twelve month mean density estimate 5 conclusions the systematic literature search and a two stage bootstrap analysis provide robust methods for developing distributions for indicator and pathogen densities additionally the kaplan meier or maximum likelihood approaches can be useful for limiting uncertainties in distributional estimates when datasets contain nondetects the resulting distributions of msc and sc in raw wastewater and ambient waters will be useful in the future for a wide range of risk assessment applications in diverse geographic regions
