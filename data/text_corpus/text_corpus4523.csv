between two vessels but failed to obtain the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering this paper proposed a model which was able to assess the collision risk not only between any two vessels

2007 has underwent a continuous increase in demand over past decades with the development of the global economy chai et al 2017 the increasing maritime transportation can lead to the augment of maritime traffic density and maritime traffic complexity thereby increasing occurrence rate of maritime accidents especially collision accidents as countermeasures collision risk monitoring is usually carried out by maritime surveillance operators zhen et al 2017 despite the improvement in the technologies of collision risk monitoring such as automatic identification system ais and electronic chart display and information system ecdis there are still some limitations in this field faced with relative high traffic density or complexity surveillance operators perform the monitoring with subjectivity and randomness in most cases having little idea of the global collision risk in addition they may undertake relative more cognitive pressure from high traffic density or complexity wen et al 2015 and it will result in lower monitoring efficiency and impact the navigational safety to reduce the occurrence rate of collision accidents many studies highlighting the collision risk quantification have been carried out these studies facilitated the development of automatic collision avoidance and collision risk monitoring despite the great progress was made in this field most of the studies attached more importance to the collision risk between two vessels but failed to obtain the global risk of multi vessel collision during the encountering of multiple vessels this makes it difficult for surveillance operators to take multi vessel collision into account when monitoring collision risk targeting this problem establishing a model that can assess the global risk of multi vessel collision becomes essential such a model will not only help surveillance operators have a better understanding of the collision risk but also reduce their burdens and improve their working efficiencies faced with challenges from relative high traffic density or complexity the main contribution of this paper was to propose a multi vessel collision risk assessing model based on a cooperative game the model could assess the collision risk of each vessel between any two vessels and of multi vessel in encountering by using real time ais data it is helpful for surveillance operators to have a better understanding of the collision risk to assess the global collision risk of multi vessel a new collision risk indicator was proposed based on collision avoidance manoeuvre and ship domain to represent the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering first shapley value method in cooperative game was utilized to estimate the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering global collision risk could be assessed based on the collision risk and contribution of each vessel the paper was arranged as follows related work of collision risk quantification in encountering was presented in section 2 the framework of the proposed model was presented in section 3 in section 4 the methods of identifying the collision risk and the contribution of vessel were presented for validating the effectiveness of the model several experiments of different encountering cases were carried out in section 5 in addition some discussions about the models were also presented in this section finally the summary and the problems that deserve to be further researched were given in the section 6 2 related work for assessing the collision risk in encountering quantitatively plenty of researches were published in various methods the methods can be roughly divided into three general categories 1 analytical method 2 fuzzy logic method 3 machine learning method analytical method directly uses the motion parameters of vessels in encountering to calculate the collision risk index by analytical expression which is relatively simple in application however the coefficients in the expression are difficult to judge which may affect the accuracy of the results at early stage the most common factors considered in analytical method are distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa kearon 1977 the two factors are considered as important indexes in automatic radar plotting aid arpa system to judge the collision risk between vessels in spatial and temporal aspects respectively however considering that dcpa and tcpa cannot cover all the factors influencing the collision risk lisowski 2001 added the distance factor in the analytical expression of collision risk after that the model was improved to take account of the bearing factor by introducing of ship domain szlapczynski 2006 in addition xu et al 2016 established the collision risk expression in complex plane to involve the speed ratio of the vessels by introducing the weight factor of dcpa and tcpa and making them change with the relative speed of the vessels dynamically fuzzy logic method quantifies the collision risk by fuzzification of input values by membership functions first and combines these fuzzy values according to the rule base then the defuzzification is conducted to obtain the collision risk index the merits of fuzzy logic method is that it relies on expert knowledge and is no need for accurate mathematical expression however it has relative strong subjectivity same as analytical method early collision risk quantification work based on fuzzy logic method only included dcpa and tcpa factors hasegawa et al 1989 lee and rhee 2001 bukhari et al 2013 expanded the factors set by introducing the variation of a compass direction vcd which can reflect the collision risk by the dynamical variation of relative bearings goerlandt et al 2015 proposed a risk informed ship collision alert system by fuzzy logic method they divided the encounter scenarios into five categories and used different input values for different encounters in addition to fuzzy logic model related to dcpa and tcpa kao et al 2007 used ship size ship speed and sea state as input values for fuzzy logic model to obtained the radius of guarding ring and regarded the length of radical axis of two guarding rings as the collision risk index zhang et al 2017 used vessel collision risk operators vcro the change rate of vcro and ship size as the input values of fuzzy logic model to quantify the collision risk between vessels the vcro was defined in zhang et al 2015 and was an index relating to relative bearing distance and speed machine learning method such as neural network quantifies the collision risk by establishing a network which is able to calculate the collision risk index directly by input values the network is supposed to be trained many times by training sets from other collision risk models machine learning method can establish nonlinear mapping relationship between input values and output values easily and calculate the collision risk index rapidly however it is only a black box approach and cannot be able to quantify the collision risk without training sets the most common used machine learning method for collision risk quantification is back propagation neural network bpnn radial basis function neural network rbfnn and support vector machine svm ahn et al 2012 proposed a bpnn with two hidden layers to quantify the collision risk the input values were course speed bearing distance and domain of own ship and target ship and the training sets were obtained by fuzzy logic method yang and yang 2013 made an improvement to the bpnn for the drawbacks of random selection of initial weights threshold values and structure of network the author optimized the bpnn by adopting modified genetic algorithm to obtain a global searching place to replace the initial weights and threshold values with random selection in addition gang et al 2016 used svm to quantify the collision risk svm is another machine learning model and has advantages in dealing with small sample data the input values were courses and speeds of both vessels and their relative bearings and distances and the training sets were obtained by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation most of the studies published for quantifying collision risk in vessel encountering only focused on the collision risk between two vessels though bukhari et al 2013 and zhen et al 2017 proposed the collision risk assessing models related to multi vessel only the collision risks between any two vessels in the multi vessel encountering were considered which however ignored the global multi vessel collision risks as a result it may be hard for surveillance operators to comprehensively understand the collision risk especially multi vessel collision risk in multi vessel encountering therefore to effectively assess the multi vessel collision risk and provide surveillance operators with a better understanding of the global collision risk this paper proposed a model which was able to assess the collision risk not only between any two vessels but also among multiple vessels in multi vessel encountering this is the challenge we tackled in our work proposing a model for assessing the collision risk in multi vessel encountering 3 the assessing framework 3 1 encountering type and collision avoidance responsibility encountering between vessels includes head on crossing and overtaking liu et al 2007 the collision avoidance responsibility of each vessel in the encountering is different according to the different types of encountering and it judges the collision risk through the proposed method the responsibility can be divided based on the principle in convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg imo 1972 navigation habits and automatic collision avoidance methods tsou et al 2010 as shown in fig 1 when the target vessel approaches from sector f a or b the own vessel should give way to the target vessel among the three sectors vessel from f forms head on encountering with the own vessel and vessel from a or b forms crossing encountering with the own vessel when target vessel approaches from sector e d or c the target vessel should give way to the own vessel and the own vessel is no need for any collision avoidance manoeuvres under normal conditions besides if the own vessel comes up with the target vessel from a direction more than 22 5 abaft the target vessel s beam the own vessel should give way to the target vessel in overtaking encountering 3 2 the framework of assessing global collision risk in multi vessel encountering as multi vessel encountering is composed of each vessel in the encountering it can be considered as a combination of the encountering between any vessel and other vessels hence it was assumed that the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering was composed of the collision risk of each vessel in the encountering however as the encountering type and collision avoidance manoeuvre of each vessel were different the contribution made by each vessel to the global collision risk would also be different based on the assumption above the global collision risk g c r in multi vessel encountering can be expressed by the following equation 1 g c r i 1 n c r i c i where c r i and c i refer to the collision risk and the contribution of vessel i in multi vessel encountering as a result in order to assess the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering the collision risk of each vessel in the encountering and its contribution should be identified first in this paper a new collision risk indicator based on collision avoidance manoeuvre and ship domain was proposed to identify the collision risk of each vessel and then shapley value method in cooperative game was utilized to identify the contribution of each vessel the flow chart of the entire process of assessing global collision risk is shown in fig 2 4 collision risk and contribution identification 4 1 collision risk identification 4 1 1 a new collision risk indicator in multi vessel encountering for identifying the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 a new collision risk indicator called danger sector was proposed at first in this paper to represent the collision risk between vessels as shown in fig 3 this new collision risk indicator was to represent the collision risk according to the amplitude of collision avoidance manoeuvre based on ship domain definition the danger sector of a vessel refers to the sector which is composed of plenty of course lines if adopts these courses the vessel will invade in the ship domain of the target vessel to avoid invading in other ship s domain the vessel can alter the course which is the most common collision avoidance manoeuvre tsou et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 danger sectors are illustrated in head on crossing and overtaking encountering respectively and vessel 1 could either alter to the port side or starboard side to avoid invading in the ship domain of vessel 2 the sector between the port alteration course line oa and the starboard alteration course line ob was the danger sector rad of vessel 1 if vessel 1 adopted the courses between oa and ob it will invade in the ship domain of vessel 2 from the fig 3 and then it can be found that the danger sector increased with the decrease of the distance between two vessels due to the negative correlation between distance and collision risk lisowski 2001 it was assumed that the danger sector is positively correlated with collision risk c r which is expressed as the following equation danger sectors between any two vessels can be calculated by means of algorithm 1 2 c r r a d algorithm 1 calculating danger sector between vessel i and j r a d i j image 1 4 1 2 danger sector in multi vessel encountering as danger sector proposed in section 4 1 1 could only represent the collision risk between two vessels this section attempted to find the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering by using danger sector under the inspiration from szlapczynski 2008 the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering was obtained by overlapping the danger sectors of the vessel to illustrate the method a three vessels encountering case was simulated as shown in fig 4 vessel 1 was set as own vessel with other vessels as target vessels the three vessels were in crossing encountering according to colreg vessel 1 should give way to vessel 2 and vessel 3 therefore vessel 1 was supposed to take collision avoidance manoeuvre to avoid invading in the ship domains of vessel 2 and vessel 3 indicating that vessel 1 should alter to the course without the danger sectors to vessel 2 and vessel 3 the danger sector of vessel 1 to vessel 2 was aob if vessel 1 adopted the course within aob it was unable to avoid invading in the ship domain of vessel 2 and the danger sector of vessel 1 to vessel 3 was cod if vessel 1 adopted the course within cod it was unable to avoid invading in the ship domain of vessel 3 therefore in order to avoid the ship domains of vessel 2 and vessel 3 simultaneously vessel 1 was supposed to adopt the course without aod aod was the new danger sector called multi vessel danger sector r a d m u l t i which was obtained by overlapping the danger sectors aob and cod for a vessel in encountering its multi vessel danger sector can be obtained by means of the following procedure 1 calculate the right danger sectors and left dangers sectors between vessels based on algorithm 1 and form the matrix of r a d i j r and r a d i j l 2 for each vessel i extract ith row of matrix of r a d i j r and r a d i j l namely the danger sectors for vessel i and form a new matrix r a d i 3 judge collision avoidance responsibilities between vessel i and other vessels and exclude the not given way vessels from matrix r a d i 4 find the maximum value in each row of matrix r a d i namely the maximum right danger sector and left danger sector for vessel i 5 obtain multi vessel danger sector of vessel i by summing the maximum right danger sector and left danger sector 6 check whether vessel i would invade in the ship domains of not given way vessels when adopt the course at the margin of multi vessel danger sector if domain was invaded in the danger sector between vessel i and the invaded vessel should be merged into multi vessel danger sector of vessel i according to the correlation between danger sector and collision risk found in section 4 1 1 multi vessel danger sector of a vessel is also positively correlated with collision risk of the vessel in multi vessel encountering in other words collision risk of the vessel in multi vessel encountering increase with the growing of multi vessel danger sector thus the following equation is obtained 3 c r m u l t i r a d m u l t i 4 1 3 identify the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering in section 4 1 2 multi vessel danger sector was obtained which could indicate the collision risk of a vessel in multi vessel encountering to represent the collision risk by multi vessel danger sector quantitatively fuzzy membership function and stevens s power law were introduced stevens s power law is an empirical relationship between an increased intensity or strength in a physical stimulus and the perceived magnitude increase in the sensation created by the stimulus stevens 1957 the general form of the law is as follows 4 ϕ i k i a where i is intensity or strength in a physical stimulus ϕ i is perceived magnitude increase in the sensation k is a constant that depends on the units used a is an exponent depends on the type of stimulation according to the stevens s power law the following membership function between multi vessel danger sector and collision risk is established 5 c r i 1 r a d i r a d m a x r a d i m u l t i r a d m i n r a d m a x r a d m i n 0 33 r a d m i n r a d i m u l t i 0 r a d i r a d m i n r a d m a x where r a d i m u l t i refers to the multi vessel danger sector of the vessel i r a d m a x is the maximum value of danger sector which can be considered as 180 r a d m i n is the minimum value of danger sector which can be considered as 0 the exponent of membership function refers to the type of stimulation since the course alteration stimulates the operators through course indicator by visual sense the stimulation is brightness and the exponent is supposed to be 0 33 according to stevens s power law c r i which represents the degree of membership of collision risk was considered as the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 as c r i becomes bigger indicating the increase in the degree of membership of collision risk higher collision risk is obtained it will provide a reference for surveillance operators regarding which vessel is of great collision risk also it is helpful for them in making suggestions and decisions during collision risk monitoring 4 2 contribution identification 4 2 1 shapley value method in cooperative game cooperative game can be considered as the competition of different groups requiring both coalition and cooperation different from non cooperative game cooperative game focuses on collective rationality instead of personal rationality it is usually used to determine how to allocate the amounts generated by cooperation shapley value method is one of the solution of cooperative game by representing the contribution of each player to the entire group shapley and shubik 1954 it provides a solution to not only the allocation problem wu 2011 fu 2013 but also power estimating problem tarashev et al 2016 wu 2018 because the method allocates the cooperative amounts by estimating the contribution of each player the general form of shapley value is shown as follows 6 s i a t n i t t 1 n t n a t a t i where i refers to the player of the game t refers to the coalition formed by player i t refers to the number of players of coalition t n refers to the number of players of the entire group a t refers to the amounts generated by coalition t a t i refers to the amounts generated by coalition t before player i joining s i a refers to the shapley value of player i 4 2 2 identify the contribution of each vessel in multi vessel encountering as shapley value method can estimate the contribution of players to the entire group in cooperative game the method was utilized to obtain the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 for applying shapley value method multi vessel encountering was considered as a cooperative game where each vessel in the encountering was considered as game player and its collision risk was considered as the amount of player the vessels can form different coalitions via permutation and combination according to eq 6 to calculate the shapley value of each vessel the amount of each coalition should be obtained at first namely a t coalition amount was assumed as the summation of the amount of each vessel in the coalition which can be expressed as the following equation 7 a vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel n i 1 n c r i 1 2 n where c r i 1 2 n refers to the collision risk of vessel i in n vessel encountering to illustrate the setting of coalition amount and the calculating of shapley value a three vessels encountering case was simulated as shown in fig 5 according to permutation and combination the three vessels could form the following four coalitions vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel 1 vessel 3 vessel 2 vessel 3 and vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel 3 take the coalition vessel 1 vessel 2 as example the coalition amount was the sum of the collision risk of vessel 1 and vessel 2 when only vessel 1 and vessel 2 were encountering it can be expressed as following equation 8 a vessel 1 vessel 2 c r 1 1 2 c r 2 1 2 similarly all other coalition amounts can be obtained based on eq 7 the results are shown in table 1 a t i in eq 6 could be obtained by obtaining the coalition amounts of coalition t without player i joining for example a vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel 3 vessel 1 was equal to the coalition amount of coalition vessel 2 vessel 3 when vessel 2 and vessel 3 were encountering after determining all coalition amounts the shapley value of each vessel could be calculated based on eq 6 and the results of the case are shown in table 2 after normalization shapley value of each vessel could represent the contribution of the vessel to the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 in sum the contribution of each vessel can be obtained by means of the following procedure 1 find all coalitions of vessels via permutation and combination 2 for each coalition calculate the coalition amount by accumulating the amount of each vessel based on eq 7 it should be noticed that the amount of each vessel was obtained from the multi vessel danger sector without vessels which were not included in the coalition 3 calculate the shapley value of each vessel based on eq 6 4 normalize the shapley values to obtain the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk apart from the vessel of great collision risk that can be identified in section 4 1 it is also necessary for surveillance operators to focus on the vessel with high shapley value which is crucial for the increasing of global collision risk this is because the reduction in collision risk of the vessel with high shapley value is conducive to the relief of the global collision risk 5 case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model several experiments were carried out to assess the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering in the present paper the experiments included the cases of two vessel encountering three vessel encountering four vessel encountering five vessel encountering and seven vessel encountering in addition a macroscopic experiment for two regions in the studied water area was carried out ais data were collected for experiments the studied water area included mainly two part one part was in dover strait in uk located at 50 0 n to 52 0 n 0 0 e to 3 0 e the other one part was in northern yellow sea in china located at 37 4 n to 38 4 n 121 5 e to 123 0 e the two regions were featured with relatively large ship density and various encountering which were easier for the formation of multi vessel encountering 5 1 two vessel encountering experiment two vessel encountering is the simplest case among multi vessel encountering in fact assessing the collision risk of multi vessel encountering with two vessels is similar to the research on the collision risk index in automatic collision avoidance which also focuses on two vessels fig 6 shows the trajectories of two vessels in the cases of head on crossing and overtaking encountering as for vessels in the each case 30 moments with same intervals were selected and the time of the moments for two vessels in each case was the same in order to obtain the ais data of these 30 moments ais data were decoded at first and then the interpolation was carried out the data required for assessing the global collision risk were five dimensional data x y v c l where x and y refer to the vessel s position v refers to the speed c refers to the course and l refers to the length after obtaining the data of 30 moments for vessels in each case the data was input into the proposed model and the results of the global collision risk of two vessel encountering in three different encountering cases are shown in fig 7 to examine the effectiveness of the results the distance between vessels was introduced as a collision risk indicator because it has negative correlation with collision risk as above mentioned the distances between vessels for 30 moments in each case are shown in fig 8 it can be found that the distance between vessels became smaller indicating increase in collision risk over time the results of global collision risk of the cases which are illustrated in fig 7 also confirmed the increasing trends of collision risk in order to further validate the effectiveness it adopted another collision risk indicator which is the traditional collision risk index cri in automatic collision avoidance because the global collision risk assessment of two vessels encountering is similar to traditional collision risk index fig 9 shows the traditional collision risk indexes for 30 moments in the three cases the trends of collision risk for these moments were found similar to those of the global collision risk of the cases illustrated in fig 7 where the collision risk increased over time these results suggested the effectiveness of the proposed model in representing the global collision risk of two vessel encountering in addition the positive correlation between danger sector and collision risk was further verified 5 2 three vessel encountering experiment then the experiment of three vessel encountering cases was carried out being different from two vessel encountering most of the collision risk quantification studies were difficult to obtain the global collision risk of three vessels the trajectories of three vessels in the cases of head on crossing and overtaking encountering are shown in fig 10 similar to the cases of two vessels 30 moments were selected for each vessel and the required data for each moment were obtained by interpolation after inputting these data into the proposed model the results of the global collision risk for these 30 moments in each case were obtained as shown in fig 11 to validate the effectiveness of the results the distance between vessels was introduced again however being different from the cases of two vessels the distance between vessels in the cases of three vessels was an average distance between vessels which could measure the distance between multi vessel the following equation expresses the average distance between vessels ad 9 a d i 1 j 1 n d i j n n 1 where d i j refers to the distance between vessel i and vessel j average distances between vessels for 30 moments in each case are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that average distance between vessels became smaller presenting the increase in the collision risk over time this trend was also reflected by the results of global collision risk of the cases which are illustrated in fig 11 these findings proved that the proposed model could effectively represent global collision risk of the case with three vessel encountering similarly traditional collision risk index was introduced again however traditional collision risk could not represent the global collision risk directly in three vessel encountering for representing the global collision risk a weighting and summing process was conducted for traditional collision risk index which is expressed as follows 10 g c r ω i j c r i i j fig 13 shows the results derived from traditional collision risk index and it can be found that in addition to the head on encountering there was no obvious negative correlation between the results from traditional collision risk index and the average distance therefore traditional collision risk index could not effectively represent the global collision risk in three vessel encountering 5 3 complexity encountering experiments firstly a relatively complicated four vessel encountering experiment was carried out and the trajectories of the four vessels are shown in fig 14 a among these vessels vessel 1 3 4 were in head on encountering while vessel 2 formed crossing encountering with vessel 1 3 4 in addition vessel 4 was overtaking vessel 3 similarly 30 moments were selected for each vessel to assess global collision risk and average distance between vessels was introduced to examine the results the global collision risk and average distance between vessels for this case are shown in fig 15 a and fig 16 a it can be observed that the average distance between vessels became smaller presenting the increase in the collision risk over time this trend was also reflected by the results of global collision risk of the case however for the results from traditional collision risk index showed in fig 17 a the negative correlation with average distance was not found indicating that traditional collision risk could not represent the global collision risk in this case effectively as shown in fig 15 a the collision risk increased significantly between moment 16 and 17 this is because the ship domain of vessel 3 was invaded by vessel 4 between these two moments and resulted in a rapid increase in danger sector thus finally leading to a significant increase in collision risk then in order to validate the proposed model in more complicated encountering cases a five vessel encountering case and a seven vessel encountering case were carried out 30 moments were selected for the five vessels in encountering and their trajectories are shown in fig 14 b all the three types of encountering existed in the case simultaneously the results of global collision risk obtained by the proposed model are shown in fig 15 b while the results from traditional collision risk index are shown in fig 17 b meanwhile fig 16 b shows the average distances between the vessels in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the results it can be found that the global collision risk obtained by the proposed model had a negative correlation with average distance while the results derived from traditional collision risk index were not negatively correlated with the average distance these findings proved that the proposed model could effectively represents global collision risk in five vessel encountering case compared with traditional collision risk index fig 14 c shows the trajectories of vessels in seven vessel encountering case compared with the above cases the seven vessel encountering case was more complicated because more multi vessel encountering were formed for the 30 moments selected for the seven vessels the global collision risk obtained by the proposed model and the traditional collision risk index are shown in figs 15 c and fig 17 c respectively meanwhile the average distances between vessels are shown in fig 16 c to evaluate the effectiveness of the results the negative correlation between the results obtained by the proposed model and the average distance was also clearly found indicating that the proposed model could represent the global collision risk in seven vessel encountering effectively however the correlation between the results obtained from traditional collision risk index and average distance was not clear which proved that it was difficult for traditional collision risk index to represent the collision risk in multi vessel encountering as can be seen there were some slight fluctuations in the graph of global collision risk as shown in fig 15 c because the collision risk between some vessels reduced over time in the complicated encountering case such as vessel 2 and vessel 4 as the collision risk of most of the vessels became large with the time the overall trend of the global collision risk remained increased 5 4 macroscopic experiment to further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model it carried out a macroscopic experiment two regions in the studied water area were selected which are shown in fig 18 region a is chengshanjiao precautionary area and region b is a relative open area with northwestern and southeastern traffic flows which are northwest to region a generally speaking just as its name implies precautionary area usually possess a higher collision risk than other water areas because there are multiple courses of vessels here and the movements of vessels are various then there needs precautions fig 19 shows the trajectories map for the water area around the two regions and it can be found that there were more traffic flows gathered in region a than those in region b in addition the trajectories in region a were very dense while were relatively sparse in region b therefore region a was supposed to have more encountering and greater collision risks than region b in order to find the collision risks in the two regions plenty of moments were selected for each region and all of these moments happened in august 19 2018 with an interval of 10 min hence there were 6 moments selected in each hour and 144 moments in total for each region based on the proposed model the global collision risks for the two regions are shown in fig 20 respectively and the average values are given in table 3 then it can be found that the collision risk in region a was obviously greater than that in region b which was consistent with the actual traffic situation in the two regions therefore it can be proved that the proposed model could effectively represent the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering the proposed model displayed its effectiveness of reflecting the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering cases even when the number of vessels and the complexity of encountering increased compared to the previous studies on multi vessel collision risk quantification the proposed model effectively realized the assessment of not only the collision risk between two vessels but also that of each vessel and the global risk of multi vessel collision in multi vessel encountering which was the main advantage and contribution of our work the proposed model was in agreement with traditional collision risk index in two vessel encountering cases which proved the effectiveness of the danger sector in addition it had advantage in assessing the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering because it was difficult for traditional collision risk index to represent the global collision risk when the number of encountering vessels was more than 2 the proposed model can provide surveillance operators with assistance in collision risk monitoring of multi vessel encountering by making them understand the global collision risk more comprehensively it can also reduce their burdens and improve their working efficiencies faced with challenges from relative high traffic density or complexity despite the advantages mentioned above the proposed model still had some limitations in section 4 1 1 ship domain was used to determine the margins of danger sector in this paper the ship domain adopted was a simplified circular domain in fact the ship domain may be different according to the different water types and traffic characteristics where the size shape can be varied szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 therefore to further enhance the accuracy of the model it can apply different ship domain models to the proposed model according to the different situations besides the positive correlation between danger sector and collision risk though validated in section 5 1 was only represented by fuzzy membership function and stevens s power law in this paper in order to make the results of the proposed model more accurate the detailed quantitative relationship between danger sector and collision risk can be further researched 6 conclusion for assessing the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering this paper proposed a multi vessel collision risk assessing model based on a cooperative game the model could assess the collision risk not only between any two vessels but also the global collision risk of multi vessel in the encountering by using real time ais data at first a new collision risk indicator was proposed based on collision avoidance manoeuvre and ship domain to represent the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering shapley value method in cooperative game was utilized to estimate the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk global collision risk of multi vessel could be assessed based on the collision risk and contribution of each vessel the model can help surveillance operators find the vessels or vessel pairs of relative high collision risk and have a better understanding of the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering it will also lower their burdens faced with challenges from relative high traffic density or complexity for validating the effectiveness of the proposed model several experiments of different cases were carried out the results of the experiments suggested that the proposed model could represent the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering effectively which can provide surveillance operators with assistance in collision risk monitoring and improve the navigational safety in modeling danger sector simplified circular ship domain was used for determining the margins in order to further improve the accuracy of the model different ship domain models can be applied according to different situations besides the positive correlation between danger sector and collision risk was only represented by fuzzy membership function and stevens s power law in this paper to enhance the accuracy of the results for the proposed model the detailed quantitative relationship between collision risk and danger sector deserves to be further studied in

22615,collision risk quantification is important for reducing collision accidents and improving navigational safety however most of the related studies attached more importance to the collision risk

2007 has underwent a continuous increase in demand over past decades with the development of the global economy chai et al 2017 the increasing maritime transportation can lead to the augment of maritime traffic density and maritime traffic complexity thereby increasing occurrence rate of maritime accidents especially collision accidents as countermeasures collision risk monitoring is usually carried out by maritime surveillance operators zhen et al 2017 despite the improvement in the technologies of collision risk monitoring such as automatic identification system ais and electronic chart display and information system ecdis there are still some limitations in this field faced with relative high traffic density or complexity surveillance operators perform the monitoring with subjectivity and randomness in most cases having little idea of the global collision risk in addition they may undertake relative more cognitive pressure from high traffic density or complexity wen et al 2015 and it will result in lower monitoring efficiency and impact the navigational safety to reduce the occurrence rate of collision accidents many studies highlighting the collision risk quantification have been carried out these studies facilitated the development of automatic collision avoidance and collision risk monitoring despite the great progress was made in this field most of the studies attached more importance to the collision risk between two vessels but failed to obtain the global risk of multi vessel collision during the encountering of multiple vessels this makes it difficult for surveillance operators to take multi vessel collision into account when monitoring collision risk targeting this problem establishing a model that can assess the global risk of multi vessel collision becomes essential such a model will not only help surveillance operators have a better understanding of the collision risk but also reduce their burdens and improve their working efficiencies faced with challenges from relative high traffic density or complexity the main contribution of this paper was to propose a multi vessel collision risk assessing model based on a cooperative game the model could assess the collision risk of each vessel between any two vessels and of multi vessel in encountering by using real time ais data it is helpful for surveillance operators to have a better understanding of the collision risk to assess the global collision risk of multi vessel a new collision risk indicator was proposed based on collision avoidance manoeuvre and ship domain to represent the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering first shapley value method in cooperative game was utilized to estimate the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering global collision risk could be assessed based on the collision risk and contribution of each vessel the paper was arranged as follows related work of collision risk quantification in encountering was presented in section 2 the framework of the proposed model was presented in section 3 in section 4 the methods of identifying the collision risk and the contribution of vessel were presented for validating the effectiveness of the model several experiments of different encountering cases were carried out in section 5 in addition some discussions about the models were also presented in this section finally the summary and the problems that deserve to be further researched were given in the section 6 2 related work for assessing the collision risk in encountering quantitatively plenty of researches were published in various methods the methods can be roughly divided into three general categories 1 analytical method 2 fuzzy logic method 3 machine learning method analytical method directly uses the motion parameters of vessels in encountering to calculate the collision risk index by analytical expression which is relatively simple in application however the coefficients in the expression are difficult to judge which may affect the accuracy of the results at early stage the most common factors considered in analytical method are distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa kearon 1977 the two factors are considered as important indexes in automatic radar plotting aid arpa system to judge the collision risk between vessels in spatial and temporal aspects respectively however considering that dcpa and tcpa cannot cover all the factors influencing the collision risk lisowski 2001 added the distance factor in the analytical expression of collision risk after that the model was improved to take account of the bearing factor by introducing of ship domain szlapczynski 2006 in addition xu et al 2016 established the collision risk expression in complex plane to involve the speed ratio of the vessels by introducing the weight factor of dcpa and tcpa and making them change with the relative speed of the vessels dynamically fuzzy logic method quantifies the collision risk by fuzzification of input values by membership functions first and combines these fuzzy values according to the rule base then the defuzzification is conducted to obtain the collision risk index the merits of fuzzy logic method is that it relies on expert knowledge and is no need for accurate mathematical expression however it has relative strong subjectivity same as analytical method early collision risk quantification work based on fuzzy logic method only included dcpa and tcpa factors hasegawa et al 1989 lee and rhee 2001 bukhari et al 2013 expanded the factors set by introducing the variation of a compass direction vcd which can reflect the collision risk by the dynamical variation of relative bearings goerlandt et al 2015 proposed a risk informed ship collision alert system by fuzzy logic method they divided the encounter scenarios into five categories and used different input values for different encounters in addition to fuzzy logic model related to dcpa and tcpa kao et al 2007 used ship size ship speed and sea state as input values for fuzzy logic model to obtained the radius of guarding ring and regarded the length of radical axis of two guarding rings as the collision risk index zhang et al 2017 used vessel collision risk operators vcro the change rate of vcro and ship size as the input values of fuzzy logic model to quantify the collision risk between vessels the vcro was defined in zhang et al 2015 and was an index relating to relative bearing distance and speed machine learning method such as neural network quantifies the collision risk by establishing a network which is able to calculate the collision risk index directly by input values the network is supposed to be trained many times by training sets from other collision risk models machine learning method can establish nonlinear mapping relationship between input values and output values easily and calculate the collision risk index rapidly however it is only a black box approach and cannot be able to quantify the collision risk without training sets the most common used machine learning method for collision risk quantification is back propagation neural network bpnn radial basis function neural network rbfnn and support vector machine svm ahn et al 2012 proposed a bpnn with two hidden layers to quantify the collision risk the input values were course speed bearing distance and domain of own ship and target ship and the training sets were obtained by fuzzy logic method yang and yang 2013 made an improvement to the bpnn for the drawbacks of random selection of initial weights threshold values and structure of network the author optimized the bpnn by adopting modified genetic algorithm to obtain a global searching place to replace the initial weights and threshold values with random selection in addition gang et al 2016 used svm to quantify the collision risk svm is another machine learning model and has advantages in dealing with small sample data the input values were courses and speeds of both vessels and their relative bearings and distances and the training sets were obtained by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation most of the studies published for quantifying collision risk in vessel encountering only focused on the collision risk between two vessels though bukhari et al 2013 and zhen et al 2017 proposed the collision risk assessing models related to multi vessel only the collision risks between any two vessels in the multi vessel encountering were considered which however ignored the global multi vessel collision risks as a result it may be hard for surveillance operators to comprehensively understand the collision risk especially multi vessel collision risk in multi vessel encountering therefore to effectively assess the multi vessel collision risk and provide surveillance operators with a better understanding of the global collision risk this paper proposed a model which was able to assess the collision risk not only between any two vessels but also among multiple vessels in multi vessel encountering this is the challenge we tackled in our work proposing a model for assessing the collision risk in multi vessel encountering 3 the assessing framework 3 1 encountering type and collision avoidance responsibility encountering between vessels includes head on crossing and overtaking liu et al 2007 the collision avoidance responsibility of each vessel in the encountering is different according to the different types of encountering and it judges the collision risk through the proposed method the responsibility can be divided based on the principle in convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg imo 1972 navigation habits and automatic collision avoidance methods tsou et al 2010 as shown in fig 1 when the target vessel approaches from sector f a or b the own vessel should give way to the target vessel among the three sectors vessel from f forms head on encountering with the own vessel and vessel from a or b forms crossing encountering with the own vessel when target vessel approaches from sector e d or c the target vessel should give way to the own vessel and the own vessel is no need for any collision avoidance manoeuvres under normal conditions besides if the own vessel comes up with the target vessel from a direction more than 22 5 abaft the target vessel s beam the own vessel should give way to the target vessel in overtaking encountering 3 2 the framework of assessing global collision risk in multi vessel encountering as multi vessel encountering is composed of each vessel in the encountering it can be considered as a combination of the encountering between any vessel and other vessels hence it was assumed that the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering was composed of the collision risk of each vessel in the encountering however as the encountering type and collision avoidance manoeuvre of each vessel were different the contribution made by each vessel to the global collision risk would also be different based on the assumption above the global collision risk g c r in multi vessel encountering can be expressed by the following equation 1 g c r i 1 n c r i c i where c r i and c i refer to the collision risk and the contribution of vessel i in multi vessel encountering as a result in order to assess the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering the collision risk of each vessel in the encountering and its contribution should be identified first in this paper a new collision risk indicator based on collision avoidance manoeuvre and ship domain was proposed to identify the collision risk of each vessel and then shapley value method in cooperative game was utilized to identify the contribution of each vessel the flow chart of the entire process of assessing global collision risk is shown in fig 2 4 collision risk and contribution identification 4 1 collision risk identification 4 1 1 a new collision risk indicator in multi vessel encountering for identifying the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 a new collision risk indicator called danger sector was proposed at first in this paper to represent the collision risk between vessels as shown in fig 3 this new collision risk indicator was to represent the collision risk according to the amplitude of collision avoidance manoeuvre based on ship domain definition the danger sector of a vessel refers to the sector which is composed of plenty of course lines if adopts these courses the vessel will invade in the ship domain of the target vessel to avoid invading in other ship s domain the vessel can alter the course which is the most common collision avoidance manoeuvre tsou et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 danger sectors are illustrated in head on crossing and overtaking encountering respectively and vessel 1 could either alter to the port side or starboard side to avoid invading in the ship domain of vessel 2 the sector between the port alteration course line oa and the starboard alteration course line ob was the danger sector rad of vessel 1 if vessel 1 adopted the courses between oa and ob it will invade in the ship domain of vessel 2 from the fig 3 and then it can be found that the danger sector increased with the decrease of the distance between two vessels due to the negative correlation between distance and collision risk lisowski 2001 it was assumed that the danger sector is positively correlated with collision risk c r which is expressed as the following equation danger sectors between any two vessels can be calculated by means of algorithm 1 2 c r r a d algorithm 1 calculating danger sector between vessel i and j r a d i j image 1 4 1 2 danger sector in multi vessel encountering as danger sector proposed in section 4 1 1 could only represent the collision risk between two vessels this section attempted to find the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering by using danger sector under the inspiration from szlapczynski 2008 the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering was obtained by overlapping the danger sectors of the vessel to illustrate the method a three vessels encountering case was simulated as shown in fig 4 vessel 1 was set as own vessel with other vessels as target vessels the three vessels were in crossing encountering according to colreg vessel 1 should give way to vessel 2 and vessel 3 therefore vessel 1 was supposed to take collision avoidance manoeuvre to avoid invading in the ship domains of vessel 2 and vessel 3 indicating that vessel 1 should alter to the course without the danger sectors to vessel 2 and vessel 3 the danger sector of vessel 1 to vessel 2 was aob if vessel 1 adopted the course within aob it was unable to avoid invading in the ship domain of vessel 2 and the danger sector of vessel 1 to vessel 3 was cod if vessel 1 adopted the course within cod it was unable to avoid invading in the ship domain of vessel 3 therefore in order to avoid the ship domains of vessel 2 and vessel 3 simultaneously vessel 1 was supposed to adopt the course without aod aod was the new danger sector called multi vessel danger sector r a d m u l t i which was obtained by overlapping the danger sectors aob and cod for a vessel in encountering its multi vessel danger sector can be obtained by means of the following procedure 1 calculate the right danger sectors and left dangers sectors between vessels based on algorithm 1 and form the matrix of r a d i j r and r a d i j l 2 for each vessel i extract ith row of matrix of r a d i j r and r a d i j l namely the danger sectors for vessel i and form a new matrix r a d i 3 judge collision avoidance responsibilities between vessel i and other vessels and exclude the not given way vessels from matrix r a d i 4 find the maximum value in each row of matrix r a d i namely the maximum right danger sector and left danger sector for vessel i 5 obtain multi vessel danger sector of vessel i by summing the maximum right danger sector and left danger sector 6 check whether vessel i would invade in the ship domains of not given way vessels when adopt the course at the margin of multi vessel danger sector if domain was invaded in the danger sector between vessel i and the invaded vessel should be merged into multi vessel danger sector of vessel i according to the correlation between danger sector and collision risk found in section 4 1 1 multi vessel danger sector of a vessel is also positively correlated with collision risk of the vessel in multi vessel encountering in other words collision risk of the vessel in multi vessel encountering increase with the growing of multi vessel danger sector thus the following equation is obtained 3 c r m u l t i r a d m u l t i 4 1 3 identify the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering in section 4 1 2 multi vessel danger sector was obtained which could indicate the collision risk of a vessel in multi vessel encountering to represent the collision risk by multi vessel danger sector quantitatively fuzzy membership function and stevens s power law were introduced stevens s power law is an empirical relationship between an increased intensity or strength in a physical stimulus and the perceived magnitude increase in the sensation created by the stimulus stevens 1957 the general form of the law is as follows 4 ϕ i k i a where i is intensity or strength in a physical stimulus ϕ i is perceived magnitude increase in the sensation k is a constant that depends on the units used a is an exponent depends on the type of stimulation according to the stevens s power law the following membership function between multi vessel danger sector and collision risk is established 5 c r i 1 r a d i r a d m a x r a d i m u l t i r a d m i n r a d m a x r a d m i n 0 33 r a d m i n r a d i m u l t i 0 r a d i r a d m i n r a d m a x where r a d i m u l t i refers to the multi vessel danger sector of the vessel i r a d m a x is the maximum value of danger sector which can be considered as 180 r a d m i n is the minimum value of danger sector which can be considered as 0 the exponent of membership function refers to the type of stimulation since the course alteration stimulates the operators through course indicator by visual sense the stimulation is brightness and the exponent is supposed to be 0 33 according to stevens s power law c r i which represents the degree of membership of collision risk was considered as the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 as c r i becomes bigger indicating the increase in the degree of membership of collision risk higher collision risk is obtained it will provide a reference for surveillance operators regarding which vessel is of great collision risk also it is helpful for them in making suggestions and decisions during collision risk monitoring 4 2 contribution identification 4 2 1 shapley value method in cooperative game cooperative game can be considered as the competition of different groups requiring both coalition and cooperation different from non cooperative game cooperative game focuses on collective rationality instead of personal rationality it is usually used to determine how to allocate the amounts generated by cooperation shapley value method is one of the solution of cooperative game by representing the contribution of each player to the entire group shapley and shubik 1954 it provides a solution to not only the allocation problem wu 2011 fu 2013 but also power estimating problem tarashev et al 2016 wu 2018 because the method allocates the cooperative amounts by estimating the contribution of each player the general form of shapley value is shown as follows 6 s i a t n i t t 1 n t n a t a t i where i refers to the player of the game t refers to the coalition formed by player i t refers to the number of players of coalition t n refers to the number of players of the entire group a t refers to the amounts generated by coalition t a t i refers to the amounts generated by coalition t before player i joining s i a refers to the shapley value of player i 4 2 2 identify the contribution of each vessel in multi vessel encountering as shapley value method can estimate the contribution of players to the entire group in cooperative game the method was utilized to obtain the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 for applying shapley value method multi vessel encountering was considered as a cooperative game where each vessel in the encountering was considered as game player and its collision risk was considered as the amount of player the vessels can form different coalitions via permutation and combination according to eq 6 to calculate the shapley value of each vessel the amount of each coalition should be obtained at first namely a t coalition amount was assumed as the summation of the amount of each vessel in the coalition which can be expressed as the following equation 7 a vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel n i 1 n c r i 1 2 n where c r i 1 2 n refers to the collision risk of vessel i in n vessel encountering to illustrate the setting of coalition amount and the calculating of shapley value a three vessels encountering case was simulated as shown in fig 5 according to permutation and combination the three vessels could form the following four coalitions vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel 1 vessel 3 vessel 2 vessel 3 and vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel 3 take the coalition vessel 1 vessel 2 as example the coalition amount was the sum of the collision risk of vessel 1 and vessel 2 when only vessel 1 and vessel 2 were encountering it can be expressed as following equation 8 a vessel 1 vessel 2 c r 1 1 2 c r 2 1 2 similarly all other coalition amounts can be obtained based on eq 7 the results are shown in table 1 a t i in eq 6 could be obtained by obtaining the coalition amounts of coalition t without player i joining for example a vessel 1 vessel 2 vessel 3 vessel 1 was equal to the coalition amount of coalition vessel 2 vessel 3 when vessel 2 and vessel 3 were encountering after determining all coalition amounts the shapley value of each vessel could be calculated based on eq 6 and the results of the case are shown in table 2 after normalization shapley value of each vessel could represent the contribution of the vessel to the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering in eq 1 in sum the contribution of each vessel can be obtained by means of the following procedure 1 find all coalitions of vessels via permutation and combination 2 for each coalition calculate the coalition amount by accumulating the amount of each vessel based on eq 7 it should be noticed that the amount of each vessel was obtained from the multi vessel danger sector without vessels which were not included in the coalition 3 calculate the shapley value of each vessel based on eq 6 4 normalize the shapley values to obtain the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk apart from the vessel of great collision risk that can be identified in section 4 1 it is also necessary for surveillance operators to focus on the vessel with high shapley value which is crucial for the increasing of global collision risk this is because the reduction in collision risk of the vessel with high shapley value is conducive to the relief of the global collision risk 5 case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model several experiments were carried out to assess the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering in the present paper the experiments included the cases of two vessel encountering three vessel encountering four vessel encountering five vessel encountering and seven vessel encountering in addition a macroscopic experiment for two regions in the studied water area was carried out ais data were collected for experiments the studied water area included mainly two part one part was in dover strait in uk located at 50 0 n to 52 0 n 0 0 e to 3 0 e the other one part was in northern yellow sea in china located at 37 4 n to 38 4 n 121 5 e to 123 0 e the two regions were featured with relatively large ship density and various encountering which were easier for the formation of multi vessel encountering 5 1 two vessel encountering experiment two vessel encountering is the simplest case among multi vessel encountering in fact assessing the collision risk of multi vessel encountering with two vessels is similar to the research on the collision risk index in automatic collision avoidance which also focuses on two vessels fig 6 shows the trajectories of two vessels in the cases of head on crossing and overtaking encountering as for vessels in the each case 30 moments with same intervals were selected and the time of the moments for two vessels in each case was the same in order to obtain the ais data of these 30 moments ais data were decoded at first and then the interpolation was carried out the data required for assessing the global collision risk were five dimensional data x y v c l where x and y refer to the vessel s position v refers to the speed c refers to the course and l refers to the length after obtaining the data of 30 moments for vessels in each case the data was input into the proposed model and the results of the global collision risk of two vessel encountering in three different encountering cases are shown in fig 7 to examine the effectiveness of the results the distance between vessels was introduced as a collision risk indicator because it has negative correlation with collision risk as above mentioned the distances between vessels for 30 moments in each case are shown in fig 8 it can be found that the distance between vessels became smaller indicating increase in collision risk over time the results of global collision risk of the cases which are illustrated in fig 7 also confirmed the increasing trends of collision risk in order to further validate the effectiveness it adopted another collision risk indicator which is the traditional collision risk index cri in automatic collision avoidance because the global collision risk assessment of two vessels encountering is similar to traditional collision risk index fig 9 shows the traditional collision risk indexes for 30 moments in the three cases the trends of collision risk for these moments were found similar to those of the global collision risk of the cases illustrated in fig 7 where the collision risk increased over time these results suggested the effectiveness of the proposed model in representing the global collision risk of two vessel encountering in addition the positive correlation between danger sector and collision risk was further verified 5 2 three vessel encountering experiment then the experiment of three vessel encountering cases was carried out being different from two vessel encountering most of the collision risk quantification studies were difficult to obtain the global collision risk of three vessels the trajectories of three vessels in the cases of head on crossing and overtaking encountering are shown in fig 10 similar to the cases of two vessels 30 moments were selected for each vessel and the required data for each moment were obtained by interpolation after inputting these data into the proposed model the results of the global collision risk for these 30 moments in each case were obtained as shown in fig 11 to validate the effectiveness of the results the distance between vessels was introduced again however being different from the cases of two vessels the distance between vessels in the cases of three vessels was an average distance between vessels which could measure the distance between multi vessel the following equation expresses the average distance between vessels ad 9 a d i 1 j 1 n d i j n n 1 where d i j refers to the distance between vessel i and vessel j average distances between vessels for 30 moments in each case are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that average distance between vessels became smaller presenting the increase in the collision risk over time this trend was also reflected by the results of global collision risk of the cases which are illustrated in fig 11 these findings proved that the proposed model could effectively represent global collision risk of the case with three vessel encountering similarly traditional collision risk index was introduced again however traditional collision risk could not represent the global collision risk directly in three vessel encountering for representing the global collision risk a weighting and summing process was conducted for traditional collision risk index which is expressed as follows 10 g c r ω i j c r i i j fig 13 shows the results derived from traditional collision risk index and it can be found that in addition to the head on encountering there was no obvious negative correlation between the results from traditional collision risk index and the average distance therefore traditional collision risk index could not effectively represent the global collision risk in three vessel encountering 5 3 complexity encountering experiments firstly a relatively complicated four vessel encountering experiment was carried out and the trajectories of the four vessels are shown in fig 14 a among these vessels vessel 1 3 4 were in head on encountering while vessel 2 formed crossing encountering with vessel 1 3 4 in addition vessel 4 was overtaking vessel 3 similarly 30 moments were selected for each vessel to assess global collision risk and average distance between vessels was introduced to examine the results the global collision risk and average distance between vessels for this case are shown in fig 15 a and fig 16 a it can be observed that the average distance between vessels became smaller presenting the increase in the collision risk over time this trend was also reflected by the results of global collision risk of the case however for the results from traditional collision risk index showed in fig 17 a the negative correlation with average distance was not found indicating that traditional collision risk could not represent the global collision risk in this case effectively as shown in fig 15 a the collision risk increased significantly between moment 16 and 17 this is because the ship domain of vessel 3 was invaded by vessel 4 between these two moments and resulted in a rapid increase in danger sector thus finally leading to a significant increase in collision risk then in order to validate the proposed model in more complicated encountering cases a five vessel encountering case and a seven vessel encountering case were carried out 30 moments were selected for the five vessels in encountering and their trajectories are shown in fig 14 b all the three types of encountering existed in the case simultaneously the results of global collision risk obtained by the proposed model are shown in fig 15 b while the results from traditional collision risk index are shown in fig 17 b meanwhile fig 16 b shows the average distances between the vessels in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the results it can be found that the global collision risk obtained by the proposed model had a negative correlation with average distance while the results derived from traditional collision risk index were not negatively correlated with the average distance these findings proved that the proposed model could effectively represents global collision risk in five vessel encountering case compared with traditional collision risk index fig 14 c shows the trajectories of vessels in seven vessel encountering case compared with the above cases the seven vessel encountering case was more complicated because more multi vessel encountering were formed for the 30 moments selected for the seven vessels the global collision risk obtained by the proposed model and the traditional collision risk index are shown in figs 15 c and fig 17 c respectively meanwhile the average distances between vessels are shown in fig 16 c to evaluate the effectiveness of the results the negative correlation between the results obtained by the proposed model and the average distance was also clearly found indicating that the proposed model could represent the global collision risk in seven vessel encountering effectively however the correlation between the results obtained from traditional collision risk index and average distance was not clear which proved that it was difficult for traditional collision risk index to represent the collision risk in multi vessel encountering as can be seen there were some slight fluctuations in the graph of global collision risk as shown in fig 15 c because the collision risk between some vessels reduced over time in the complicated encountering case such as vessel 2 and vessel 4 as the collision risk of most of the vessels became large with the time the overall trend of the global collision risk remained increased 5 4 macroscopic experiment to further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model it carried out a macroscopic experiment two regions in the studied water area were selected which are shown in fig 18 region a is chengshanjiao precautionary area and region b is a relative open area with northwestern and southeastern traffic flows which are northwest to region a generally speaking just as its name implies precautionary area usually possess a higher collision risk than other water areas because there are multiple courses of vessels here and the movements of vessels are various then there needs precautions fig 19 shows the trajectories map for the water area around the two regions and it can be found that there were more traffic flows gathered in region a than those in region b in addition the trajectories in region a were very dense while were relatively sparse in region b therefore region a was supposed to have more encountering and greater collision risks than region b in order to find the collision risks in the two regions plenty of moments were selected for each region and all of these moments happened in august 19 2018 with an interval of 10 min hence there were 6 moments selected in each hour and 144 moments in total for each region based on the proposed model the global collision risks for the two regions are shown in fig 20 respectively and the average values are given in table 3 then it can be found that the collision risk in region a was obviously greater than that in region b which was consistent with the actual traffic situation in the two regions therefore it can be proved that the proposed model could effectively represent the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering the proposed model displayed its effectiveness of reflecting the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering cases even when the number of vessels and the complexity of encountering increased compared to the previous studies on multi vessel collision risk quantification the proposed model effectively realized the assessment of not only the collision risk between two vessels but also that of each vessel and the global risk of multi vessel collision in multi vessel encountering which was the main advantage and contribution of our work the proposed model was in agreement with traditional collision risk index in two vessel encountering cases which proved the effectiveness of the danger sector in addition it had advantage in assessing the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering because it was difficult for traditional collision risk index to represent the global collision risk when the number of encountering vessels was more than 2 the proposed model can provide surveillance operators with assistance in collision risk monitoring of multi vessel encountering by making them understand the global collision risk more comprehensively it can also reduce their burdens and improve their working efficiencies faced with challenges from relative high traffic density or complexity despite the advantages mentioned above the proposed model still had some limitations in section 4 1 1 ship domain was used to determine the margins of danger sector in this paper the ship domain adopted was a simplified circular domain in fact the ship domain may be different according to the different water types and traffic characteristics where the size shape can be varied szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 therefore to further enhance the accuracy of the model it can apply different ship domain models to the proposed model according to the different situations besides the positive correlation between danger sector and collision risk though validated in section 5 1 was only represented by fuzzy membership function and stevens s power law in this paper in order to make the results of the proposed model more accurate the detailed quantitative relationship between danger sector and collision risk can be further researched 6 conclusion for assessing the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering this paper proposed a multi vessel collision risk assessing model based on a cooperative game the model could assess the collision risk not only between any two vessels but also the global collision risk of multi vessel in the encountering by using real time ais data at first a new collision risk indicator was proposed based on collision avoidance manoeuvre and ship domain to represent the collision risk of each vessel in multi vessel encountering shapley value method in cooperative game was utilized to estimate the contribution of each vessel to the global collision risk global collision risk of multi vessel could be assessed based on the collision risk and contribution of each vessel the model can help surveillance operators find the vessels or vessel pairs of relative high collision risk and have a better understanding of the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering it will also lower their burdens faced with challenges from relative high traffic density or complexity for validating the effectiveness of the proposed model several experiments of different cases were carried out the results of the experiments suggested that the proposed model could represent the global collision risk in multi vessel encountering effectively which can provide surveillance operators with assistance in collision risk monitoring and improve the navigational safety in modeling danger sector simplified circular ship domain was used for determining the margins in order to further improve the accuracy of the model different ship domain models can be applied according to different situations besides the positive correlation between danger sector and collision risk was only represented by fuzzy membership function and stevens s power law in this paper to enhance the accuracy of the results for the proposed model the detailed quantitative relationship between collision risk and danger sector deserves to be further studied in

22616,the evolution of a water column pulled by a partially submerged sphere known as the water exit problem is evaluated by numerical simulation the lattice boltzmann method was combined with a mass tracking algorithm the accuracy of the numerical method was demonstrated by comparisons with previous experimental results moreover the evolution processes of the water column with different froude and weber numbers 0 4134 fr 8 2479 5 15 102 we 2 06 105 as well as different initial submergence depths hs d 1 2 1 4 1 8 were discussed spontaneous breakup of water column was observed for higher weber numbers moreover vertical stretching of the water column approximately followed a power law in which the power exponent depended on the initial setup of the sphere and its time scales however the horizontal evolution of the water column followed an approximately linear rule variation in the water column diameter appeared to be irregular at different physical times or in non dimensional time furthermore the initial submergence depth of the sphere was also a significant factor in the pinch off dynamics and water column evolution this study of water exit is of a great importance in designing marine vehicles that take off from a free water surface keywords evolution of water column lattice boltzmann method numerical simulation partially submerged sphere deformation of free surface submergence depth 1 introduction multiphase flows appear in many natural and industrial processes a unique multiphase flow occurs when a partially submerged object is lifted from a liquid bath specifically when the partially submerged object exits the liquid a liquid column is rapidly withdrawn from the liquid bath this phenomenon is known as the water exit problem such flows have attracted great scientific interest due to the richness of the underlying physics in the formation of the water column extensive studies on the water exit problem have been performed because the behavior of this liquid column during the pulling process under lower froude numbers 0 10 and pulling velocities 0 2 m s plays an important role in both natural systems reis et al 2010 gart et al 2015 and industrial applications ahmed et al 2011 in nature animals of the families felidae e g house cats and lions and canis e g dogs and wolves use their tongue in a lapping motion to stretch a water column from the bath in order to drink kim and bush 2012 reis et al 2010 have performed a physical experiment in which a cat s tongue was replaced by a disk to reveal the mechanism of cats drinking likewise gart et al 2015 used a rounded rod to replace a dog s tongue in experiments and successfully modeled the drinking mechanism of dogs which is different from that of cats in addition the extended process of liquid columns has some industrial applications such as high speed printing kumar 2015 as computational power has increased numerical simulations have become a more effective means of understanding water column evolution kim et al 2018 and ahmed et al 2011 used the volume of fluid vof method to simulate the extension and pinch off phenomenon of a liquid column pulled by an accelerated sphere and two parallel plates respectively korobkin 2013 presented a model of hydrodynamic loads acting on a partially submerged rigid body with a small deadrise angle during the lifting of the body some other methods have been used to solve problems related to the large deformation of free surface water including the water entry zarghami et al 2014 krastev et al 2018 russo et al 2018 fanelli et al 2017 and water exit problems haohao et al 2019 used a three dimensional 3d lattice boltzmann method lbm to simulate the breaking of the free surface during the water exit process of fully submerged sphere using the constrained interpolation profile cip method and incompressible smooth particle hydrodynamics isph zhu et al 2007 and nair and tomar 2014 studied the fully nonlinear free surface deformations of initially calm water caused by the water entry and exit of a horizontal circular cylinder with both forced and free vertical motions additionally coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method and finite element analysis have also been employed to model the water entry problem of a 3d projectile erfanian et al 2015 wang 2012 the pinch off dynamics of an axisymmetric liquid column is a classical problem that has attracted much attention notz et al 2001 chen et al 2002 for example gart et al 2015 showed that the pinch off time of the water column coincided with the time when the dog closed its mouth three scaling theories describing the drop formation after the column was pinched off involve a inertia viscosity and capillarity eggers 1993 b inertia and capillarity day et al 1998 and c viscosity and capillarity papageorgiou 1995 moreover the pinch off dynamics and evolution of the liquid column differ significantly depending on the forces inertia viscosity and capillarity that dominate the pulling of the liquid column reis et al 2010 gart et al 2015 kim et al 2018 furthermore kim et al 2018 summarized the scaling analysis results of pinch off time from previous studies and showed the dramatic phenomenon that the pinch off location shifts from higher to lower points under different sphere accelerations the spatial extension of a liquid column has also been studied however most studies have been confined to cases where capillarity dominates at low froude and weber numbers for instance marmottant and villermaux 2004 studied the pulling process of liquid ligaments produced by the withdrawal of a tube from a liquid bath with slow and fast extension ratios ligaments undergoing fast elongation fragment and break up into droplets during the pulling process where the break up ligament consists of a linear succession of liquid blobs such blobs are also subject to aggregative processes and rearrangements wu et al 2017 presented their experimental process for the forced water exit of a partially submerged sphere and the stretching shape of the water column was similar to the physical rod experiment by gart et al 2015 this similarity occurred because both experiments used objects with a semi spherical bottom to stretch the water column even though the rod and sphere experiments have different initial submergence depths velocities and accelerations in contrast to the extensive research on the longitudinal extension process of the water column much less work has been dedicated to the transverse extension of water column such as how the water column radius varies during the pulling process and the difference in the water column radius with different froude numbers and initial submergence depths nevertheless tassin et al 2017 used a light emitting diode led and a draughtboard to experimentally measure the evolution of the contact line and wetted surface during the lifting of a circular disk initially floating on the water surface the evolution of the contact line and the minimal diameter of the water column were measured from different views a review of the literature shows a lack of systematic study of the evolution of a water column pulled by a partially submerged sphere especially for higher velocities and different initial submergence depths in addition most studies focused on small scale objects with low froude numbers and 0 fr 10 and pulling velocities 0 m s v 2 m s therefore the evolution of the water column at higher pulling velocities must be investigated for relevance to the field of ocean engineering in this study a front tracking lattice boltzmann lb approach is applied to investigate the effect of the froude number and initial submergence depth on the evolution of water column the computational results are expected to offer theoretical reference for future numerical analyses of water column evolution additionally the water exit of a partially submerged body is of great importance in designing marine vehicles that take off from the free water surface such as sea planes and wing in ground wig effect vehicles and that pierce through the free surface such as missiles and submarines understanding the complex fluid phenomenon of missiles is also meaningful to their design in this article we focus on the evolution of water columns pulled by partially submerged spheres especially at higher velocities 1 6496 fr 8 2479 than those in existing studies 0 fr 10 in addition the effect of the submergence depth has been systematically studied in this paper the 3d lbm and the numerical model used in this study are presented in section 2 in section 3 numerical tests are used to validate the proposed method in section 4 the evolution of water column is analyzed and the impact of initial submergence depth is discussed finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 mathematical methods 2 1 lattice boltzmann equations the common lb equation has the following form chen et al 1991 1 f i x c i d t t d t f i x t ω i in the most common approach a single relaxation time srt was based on the bhatnagar gross krook bgk approximation bhatnagar et al 1954 chen et al 1992 qian et al 1992 as 2 ω i b g k 1 τ f i e q f i where f i e q is the local equilibrium function at which the state is relaxed the parameter τ is the relaxation time which controls the lattice kinematic fluid viscosity ν as follows benzi et al 1992 3 v c s 2 τ 1 2 where c s is the lattice sound speed the fluid density ρ and velocity u at x t could be found through weighted sums known as moments of f i x t and the pressure p was determined from the state equation as follows 4 ρ x t i f i x t ρ u x t i c i f i x t p ρ x t c s 2 where c i is one of a small discrete set of velocities c i as shown in fig 1 in this work the d3q19 model qian et al 1992 chen et al 1997 was used where d3 is the space dimension of the simulation and q19 refers to the number of discrete velocities i e ci for i 0 18 as shown in fig 1 to recover the macroscopic hydrodynamics the model must be chosen in such a way that the essential conservation laws are satisfied and the resulting macroscopic equations are galilean invariant for the single phase collision operator an equilibrium distribution function proposed by qian et al 1992 was used which is given by 5 f i e q ρ w i 1 c i u c s 2 c i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where c s 1 3 and w i are weighting parameters 6 w i 1 3 i 0 1 18 i 1 2 6 1 36 i 7 8 18 the distribution functions moved on the d3q19 lattice with lattice velocity c i which is defined as 7 c i c i x c i y c i z 0 0 0 c i 0 1 0 0 c 0 1 0 c 0 0 1 c i 1 2 6 1 1 0 c 0 1 1 c 1 0 1 c i 7 8 18 where c dx dt for lattice spacing dx and time step dt both were normalized by the condition dx dt 1 the effect of gravity g on the deformation of the free surface during removal of a sphere from the water was regarded as a body force which was introduced by calculating the equilibrium distribution with an altered velocity buick and greated 2000 8 f i e q ρ w i 1 c i u c s 2 c i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where u is the equilibrium velocity 9 u u g d t 2 2 2 free surface boundary condition in this study the single phase free surface model proposed by thürey 2007 was used to solve the high density ratio problem e g wherein the density ratio between the air and the water at the free surface is approximately 1000 for water exit problems the main feature of this method is that the gas phase is discarded in the dynamics of the liquid which remarkably increases the computational efficiency a summary of this method is presented in this section as shown in fig 2 a the lattice was divided into three types of cells gas interface and fluid cells through the volume fraction of the fluid ε the fluid fraction was computed using the cell mass and density as ε m ρ where m is the fluid mass contained in the cell the fluid fraction was equal to 0 and 1 for pure gas and fluid cells respectively whereas a value between 0 and 1 indicated cells were partially filled with fluid the computation consisted of three steps falcucci et al 2011a determining interface motion determining boundary conditions and updating cell types the interface motion was determined in the first step in a similar process to the vof methods interface motion was tracked by computing the fluxes between the cells for a cell located at x at time t the mass change due to the streaming of the i th population was given by 10 δ m i x t 0 x c i d t g f i p c x c i d t t f i p c x t x c i d t f f i p c x c i d t t f i p c x t ε x t ε x c i d t t 2 x c i d t i 11 m x t δ t m x t i 0 18 δ m i x t where pc characterizes the post collision state and i defines the opposite direction with respect to i here g f and i represent respectively gas fluid and interface cells in the second step boundary conditions were determined at the interface between gas and liquid because the dynamics of the gas phase were neglected the distribution functions associated with gas cells were never accessed and thus need to be reconstructed körner et al 2005 for an interface cell at site x with an empty cell at x c i d t the post streaming density function was governed by 12 f i p c x t d t f i e q ρ g a s u f i e q ρ g a s u f i x t d t where u is the fluid velocity at the interface cell the surface tension model introduced by xing et al 2007 is used to study the effect of the weber number on the deformation of the water column as given in eq 13 13 f i p c x t d t f i e q ρ g a s u f i e q ρ g a s u f i x t δ f i the surface tension is included by adding a perturbation term δ f i which is defined as 14 δ f i β m n cos 2 θ i θ n where β is a constant chosen to set the surface tension in the model m n is the mass gradient of the liquid the direction of which is perpendicular to the interface θ i is the angle of the lattice direction i and θ n is the angle of the local mass gradient the surface tension model is described in further detail in xing et al 2007 finally the cell type was updated the density calculated after the collision was used to check whether the interface cell was to be filled or emptied during the time step which can be expressed as 15 m x t d t 1 ℓ ρ x t d t cell filled m x t d t 0 ℓ ρ x t d t cell emptied where ℓ is an offset usually ℓ 10 3 more information on the accuracy of the method and the stability of the free interface can be found in thürey 2007 falcucci et al 2011a and falcucci and ubertini et al 2011 2 3 computational domain and moving wall boundary conditions for the computational domain boundary conditions the so called full way bounce back method was used to satisfy the no slip boundaries sukop and thorne 2006 in this method particles are assumed to travel the complete link path from the boundary to the solid node before the particle velocity is inverted in the collision step bounce back boundary conditions for a moving sphere were employed a schematic depiction of these boundary conditions is shown in fig 2 b here δx denotes the space between lattice nodes subscripts b and f denote the lattice nodes on the body and fluid side respectively and w denotes intersections of the body s perimeter the length fraction of the intersected link between x f and x b was defined as δ x f x w x f x b the unknown probability density function on the sphere side was recovered as follows filippova and hänel 1997 16 f i p c x b t 1 χ f i x f t χ f i x b t 2 ω i ρ x b t c i u x w t c s 2 where u x w t is the boundary velocity at the intersection between the body and the link and χ is a weighting factor mei et al 1999 2000 defined as 17 χ 2 δ 1 τ 1 2 δ 0 5 2 δ 1 τ 2 δ 0 5 here u b f and f i x b t are defined as mei et al 2002 18 u

generated in the domain in the case of the abrupt start of a moving body which causes the pressure p density ρ and fluid velocity u to fluctuate these fluctuations are sufficiently weak that ma u c s 1 kinsler et al 1999 krüger et al 2016 therefore to guarantee sufficiently low compressibility effects the mach numbers were ma v max c s 1 where v max is the maximum lattice speed in all simulations 2 4 turbulence model given a sufficient number of grids the lbm enables the direct numerical simulation of fluid flows at high reynolds numbers however most studies have shown that using the lbm for high reynolds number flows without modeling unresolved small scale effects on large scale dynamics results in numerical instability hou et al 1994 therefore to stabilize the simulation a turbulence model was integrated into the basic lb algorithm as the lbm stability becomes limited when the relaxation parameter τ approaches 1 2 which is equivalent to ω being close to 2 here the wall adapting local eddy wale viscosity model ducros et al 1998 was used to improve the numerical stability and capture turbulent structures in the flow thus providing a consistent local eddy viscosity and accurately predicting the force near the wall in the filtered lb equation the effect of unresolved scale motion was modeled through the modified collision relaxation time τ s τ s 3 v v t 0 5 for the kinematic viscosity ν in eq 3 and eddy viscosity v t 20 v t δ f 2 s α β d s α β d 3 2 s α β s α β 5 2 s α β d s α β d 5 4 where δ f c w d x is the filter scale and the constant c w was set to 0 325

experiments the applicability of the proposed algorithm to model water entry and exit for a spherical body was demonstrated using two examples the water exit of partially and fully submerged spheres with a constant speed was simulated and compared against experimental measurements from a water flume wu et al 2017 the parameters of the sphere were the same as those used by wu et al 2017 which are listed in table 1 to ensure that the numerical simulation results are independent of the domain size the computational domain should be sufficiently large in all three directions the dimensions of the cubic computational domain were 3 m 3 m 3 m and the water depth was 1 5 m as shown in the schematic diagram of computational domain in fig 3 the gravitational acceleration was g 9 8 m s2 and the surface tension coefficient of water was σ 7 2 10 2 n m 3 1 water exit of a partially submerged sphere the model was first validated for the case of the 3d water exit of a partially submerged sphere with constant vertical velocity the numerical results were compared with the experimental results obtained by wu et al 2017 fig 3 schematically shows the water exit of a partially submerged sphere the initial submergence depth of the center of sphere was h i 0 as shown in fig 4 and the time step was δ t 2 10 4 s to further verify the effectiveness of this approach the numerical results at the moment when the water column detaches from the sphere surface were compared with the experimental data wu et al 2017 the method for estimating the moment and water column height was identical with the method proposed by wu et al 2017 table 2 compares the experimental and numerical results of the water column height and detachment moment for different froude fr numbers the detachment moment for the experimental and computational results was defined as t c and t c respectively and the water column height for the experimental and computational results was defined as h c and h c respectively the error in the water column height and detachment moment between experimental and numerical results is defined as ε h and ε t respectively the errors of the water column height and detachment moment were defined as ε h h c h c h c 100 and ε t t c t c t c 100 respectively the numerical predictions showed quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of water column height and detachment moment fig 5 shows a visual comparison of the computed results with the experimental data obtained by wu et al 2017 on the deformation of the free surface during the water exit of a partially submerged sphere at a constant vertical velocity v 0 5 m s for f r v g d 0 41 the initial moment t 0 ms corresponds to the moment when the sphere began to move vertically from fig 5 b d the free surface around the sphere was concave during the initial ascent then the concavity disappears and the formation and extension of the water column was observed in both the numerical simulation and experimental results the water column became thinner with its extension additionally a bulge in the free surface was pulled with the water column as shown in fig 5 f k the column s ascent was eventually interrupted by the pinch off at which point the bulge of the free surface and the water column fell quickly under the action of gravity as shown in fig 5 l in the numerical data the body surface was wrapped by a thin water layer for viscidity however the experimental photographs do not accurately display this phenomenon due to the extremely small thickness of the water layer on the body surface 3 2 water exit of a fully submerged sphere in this section we calculate the exit of a fully submerged sphere with a constant vertical velocity v through an initially calm water surface the numerical cases were nearly identical to the experiment by wu et al 2017 as listed in table 3 the initial submergence depth of the center of sphere was h i 0 193 m as shown in fig 6 the computational domain and time step were the same for validation cases 1 3 the initial moment t 0 ms corresponds to the time when the sphere began to move vertically the height of the spike was defined as h and a new time coordinate t proposed by wu et al 2017 was defined to compare the height of the spike for the free surface under different vertical velocities zero time or t 0 corresponds to the moment when the vertex of the sphere was in contact with the calm free surface as shown in fig 6 table 3 shows the comparison of the spike height between experimental and numerical results under different froude numbers f r v g d in this study the definition of spike height h sn was identical with h s proposed by wu et al 2017 when the distance between the peak of the free surface and the vertex of the sphere was approximately equal to 1 of the sphere diameter the height of free surface peak relative to the initial water surface was defined as h sn the error of the spike height was defined as ε s h sn h s h s 100 from table 3 h sn was extremely close to h s and the difference between h sn and h s was close to zero the numerical results about the height of the spike with respect to time show good agreement with the experimental results wu et al 2017 fig 7 compares the computed results with experimental data on the deformation of the free surface during the water exit of a fully submerged sphere at a constant vertical speed v 0 5 m s with froude number fr 0 41 from fig 7 a h as the sphere rose the free surface was gradually uplifted and the distance between the uppermost point of the sphere and the peak of the free surface decreased which can be attributed to the fact that the free surface flows down along with the water layer on the surface of the sphere the free surface pushed up by the body is commonly referred to as the surge effect and this special phenomenon was captured through the numerical computation in fig 7 h i the height of free surface was close to the peak and the water layer was broken up the moment predicted by the computation approximately coincided with the experimental data when the surge effect occurs the above analysis indicates that typical features of the deformation of the free surface during the water exit of a sphere such as the surge effect the concavity around the body and the bulge relative to the calm surface were captured accurately using the proposed method 3 3 convergence analysis in this section the effects of the grid size and time step on the calculated results are evaluated first the grid convergence is analyzed by comparing the numerical and experimental results validation case 5 in table 3 was chosen for the grid convergence analysis and the simulation was performed for three lattices d δx 30 60 120 under the same conditions fig 8 compares the height of the spike with different grid numbers at constant speed v 0 5 m s for the spike height the cases with d δx 60 and d δx 120 are not significantly different the spike heights for these two cases agree well with the experimental data in order to analyze the effect of grid size on the formation of the droplet breakup at high velocities we define the number of fragments and droplets n and the dimensionless area s s s wc s sq where s wc denotes the surface area of the water column and s sq is the surface area of sphere likewise three different grid resolutions d δx 30 60 and 120 are used for the study with fr 8 14 or u 10 m s the results in figs 9 and 10 reveal that the grid size has a slight effect on the formation of fragments and droplets when the non dimensional parameter d δx is more than 60 thus the medium lattice d δx 60 was selected for all simulations presented in tables 5 and 6 to strike a balance between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency additionally convergence studies are performed to obtain a time independent solution here we define a non dimensional time size parameterδt uδt d where u δt and d represent the velocity time size and diameter of the sphere respectively in addition the height of the water column and the diameter of its transverse section at z 0 are defined as h w and d w respectively as shown in fig 20 for fr 8 14 three different time sizesδt 0 01 0 0067 and 0 0034 are used for the study figs 11 and 12 show the time history of h w d and d w d the results indicate that the resolution of 0 0067 is sufficient for fr 8 14 to attain a convergent result similarly the number of fragments and droplets n and the dimensionless area s are considered in the time step tests to investigate the effect of the time step on the breakup of the water column and the formation of droplets tests with three different time sizesδt 0 01 0 0067 and 0 0034 were carried out for fr 8 14 or u 10 m s the results with different time steps shown in figs 13 and 14 reveal that the cases withδt 0 0067 andδt 0 0034 agree well with each other indicating that the time step has little effect on the n and s when the non dimensional time stepδt is less than 0 0067 therefore the non dimensional time stepδt 0 0067 was chosen for all simulations presented in tables 5 and 6 note that the numerical error decreases with increasing grid resolution and decreasing time step but never becomes zero this error should not dominantly affect the dynamics of water column breakup i e the formation of ligaments and droplets hence the numerical errors can be concluded to be small but this error may require a complete theoretical analysis in future work moreover to justify the convergence condition with respect to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the courant number n cour uδt δx was determined as listed in table 4 where δx is the grid spacing and d δx 60 for all the cases in tables 5 and 6 n cour is less than 1 thus a non dimensional time step δt 0 0067 and grid size d δx 60 were utilized in subsequent studies the analyses in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 indicate that the proposed model effectively captured a few of the classical phenomena describing the deformation of free surface thus the proposed lbm combined with the mass tracking algorithm can be used to accurately treat the problem of water column evolution 4 results and discussion 4 1 evolution of the water column with different sphere velocities in this section a water column pulled by a sphere at different velocities was investigated using the proposed model section 2 the partially submerged spheres d 0 15 m have the same initial submersed depth h s h s d 1 2 and the center of the sphere was located initially at the free surface z 0 as shown in figs 3 and 4 table 5 shows detailed parameters for the water exit cases froude number f r v g d and weber number w e ρ v 2 d σ we focus only on the rising process of water column in this study 4 1 1 characteristics of water column evolution at a low pulling velocity v 0 5 m s fig 5 shows a comparison between the validation case 2 wu et al 2017 and case 1 where time t represents physical time the sphere was located at the calm free surface and began to rise at t 0 ms and the water column was formed under the disturbance of the sphere the evolution of the water column with a slow extension velocity v 0 5 m s is stable and symmetrical during the rising process and the water column reaches a stable equilibrium under the action of gravity and surface tension more details are discussed in section 3 1 the shape of the liquid column depends on the shape of object exiting the water such as a partially submerged disk or tube for a disk or tube the shape of the water column resembles a catenoid or hyperboloid before pinch off reis et al 2010 gart et al 2015 kumar 2015 however for a moving sphere the water column stretches into a slender cone wu et al 2017 kim et al 2018 and a thread like region is formed with a small variation in curvature t 436 ms during the stretching process the water column cannot consistently adhere to the rising sphere due to the action of gravity hence the water column pinches off below the surface of the sphere after a certain height is reached the evolution of the coniform column is consistent with that observed in previous literature gart et al 2015 wu et al 2017 4 1 2 characteristics of water column evolution at a high pulling velocity v 10 m s fig 15 shows the 3d interface evolution of the simulation for case 5 in table 5 the 2d slice through the center of sphere is shown in fig 16 which presents the time history of volume of liquid phase the other parameters are identical to the validation case 2 and case 1 except for the sphere velocity the evolution of the water column with high sphere velocity has a totally different characteristic than the case of low sphere velocity formation of the water column occurred quickly once the sphere exited the water at t 7 5 ms the sphere exited the initial free surface entirely then the shape of water column was similar to the water column in case 1 at t 10 ms although no spatial perturbation was assumed in the initial or boundary conditions the interface of the water column became unstable which was entirely different to the behavior of case 1 subsequently the length of the unstable part of the water column continuously increased at t 20 ms at later stages t 30 ms to t 60 ms droplet formation appeared on the side of the water column and then spontaneous breakup of the water column occurred at its leading edge even though the sphere was no longer in contact with the water column after t 70 ms the top of the water column spontaneously broke up into multiple droplets 4 2 effect of the submergence depth of the sphere on the water column in this section we discuss the effect of the submergence depth of the sphere with different velocities on the evolution of the water column to reduce the influence of waterfall breaking phenomenon greenhow and lin 1983 on the water column submergence depths h s d greater than 1 2 were not taken into account therefore we chose three initially submergence depths of h s d 1 2 1 4 and 1 8 as shown in fig 17 table 6 presents the detailed parameters for the water exit cases discussed in this section case 5 in table 6 is identical to case 5 in table 5 the schematic diagram of the parameter definitions is shown in fig 18 the shapes of the water column of cases 5 6 and 7 at different moments are shown in fig 19 the initial submergence depth has a considerable effect on the water column involving its pinch off volume and horizontal and vertical extension fig 19 shows that the horizontal and vertical extension of water column decreases simultaneously with the reduction in the initial submergence depth and the pinch off times of cases 5 6 and 7 are also different as discussed in section 4 3 2 essentially the decrease in the submergence depth affects the geometrical shape of the sphere interacting with the free surface and consequently the shape of the water column pulled by the sphere is influenced these effects will be discussed further in the following sections however the spontaneous breakup of the water column is independent of the initial submergence depth 4 3 vertical and horizontal extension of the water column as the sphere rises the water column undergoes a continual and obvious change in its length and width therefore we discuss the evolution of the vertical and horizontal extension of the water column in this section fig 20 represents a schematic of water column pulled at a constant velocity v note that this simplified picture does not include the phenomenon of breakup or capillary waves around the water column for quantification purposes h w and d w were used to describe the height and diameter of the water column respectively specifically d w represents the diameter of the water column at z 0 where breakup does not occur because the breakup of the water column could increase the diameter of the water column and lead to a discontinuous diameter along the vertical direction as shown in fig 20 the free surface can be divided into three parts after deformation i water column region ii sunken region and iii steady region among the three parts we focused on evolution of the water column region i 4 3 1 evolution of the vertical extension fig 21 presents the rising process of a water column that could be distinctly divided into two stages in the first stage the water column is in contact with the moving sphere which is represented by the black solid line h w1 in the second stage the water column separates from the sphere after pinch off which is denoted by the blue solid line h w2 the gray solid dot signifies the pitch off the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the gray solid dot represent the pinch off time and pinch off height of the water column respectively moreover the gray dotted lines represent the extension of the black solid line which also represents the height of the bottom of the moving sphere h s d 2 the evolution of the water column height h w as a function of time are displayed in fig 21 a f and fig 22 compares h w for cases with different submergence depths the effect of the sphere velocity on the water column height h w is revealed by comparing fig 21 a through d moreover cases with different submergence depths are shown in fig 21 e and f fig 21 a d show that as the sphere velocity increases the pinch off height clearly increases while the pinch off time decreases wu et al 2017 drew an identical conclusion additionally fig 21 d f show that the pinch off point also depends on the initially submergence depth therefore reducing the submergence depth or volume is an effective method of reducing the pinch off height of the water column and advancing the pinch off time for example the pinch off height of case 7 fig 21 f is close to that of case 2 fig 21 a the pulling velocity of the water column in the rising process depends on the initial velocity of the sphere which is mainly because the kinetic energy of water column is provided by the rising sphere after pinch off the water column continues rising under the action of inertia and gravity eventually the water column reaches its peak and its vertical velocity becomes zero therefore the evolution of the water column height h w approximately follows a power law after pinch off which can be observed in fig 21 a for cases 3 7 we chose the same non dimensional time vt d 6 to study the evolution of the water column in fig 21 b f finally the exponential law followed by the water column height h w as a function of the physical time t after pinch off is given in fig 21 a f the power exponent generally increased as the pulling velocity increased and it decreased with the decrease of the initial submergence depth for a given initial condition the value of the exponent depends on not only the initially pulling velocity and the submergence depth but also the pinch off time and the total computation time for instance section 4 2 reveals that the pitch off height decreases with the reduction in the initial submergence depth but h w has little difference at t 90 ms because the initially pulling velocity is the same therefore the power exponent shown in fig 21 e is larger than that in fig 21 d because the pinch off time of case 6 is earlier than that of case 5 although the pinch off time of case 7 is also earlier than of case 6 the power exponent in fig 21 e is larger than that in fig 21 f the reason for this difference is that the ascending velocity of the water column after pinch off decreases with the reduction in the initial submergence depth in short the pinch off time and the ascending velocity together significantly influence the power exponent value as shown in fig 22 although the submergence depths are different the trend in h w is similar the value of h w mainly depends on the rising velocity of sphere the value of h w in case 7 is slightly lower than that in cases 5 and 6 although the h w is mainly affected by the sphere velocity and varies slightly with the decrease in the submergence depth the potential energy of the water column generally decreases with the decreasing submergence depth which is reflected in the obvious decrease in the radius of the liquid column which will be discussed in section 4 3 2 therefore it can be concluded that with the decrease in the immersion depth the kinetic energy obtained by the water column from the moving sphere decreases thus decreasing the potential energy of the water column however the vertical movement of the water column is affected by the moving sphere which has little influence on the height of water column but will reduce the radius 4 3 2 evolution of the horizontal extension as shown in figs 23 and 24 the horizontal evolution of the water column followed an approximately linear rule fig 23 shows the non dimensional water column diameter d w d with respect to the physical time t and fig 24 shows the non dimensional water column diameter d w d with respect to the non dimensional time vt d the diameter extends horizontally over time which can be seen in fig 19 as shown in these two figures the pinch off phenomenon shows no effect on the horizontal extension of the water column which is considerably different from the effect on the vertical extension the height of the water column relies more on the inertia force however the diameter of the water column shows more complicated features than the height of the water column at the same physical time if the spheres have the same initial submergence depth the diameter d w of a water column under a higher pulling velocity is greater than the diameter of a water column under a lower pulling velocity therefore as shown in fig 23 the water column diameter d w of case 5 has the maximum value among cases 2 5 because it has the highest pulling velocity and the deepest submergence depth in addition a decrease in the initial submergence depth can also result in a reduction in the water column diameter d w as discussed in section 4 2 finally the growth rate of the water column diameter d w in different cases can be very approximatively evidently figs 23 and 24 present some differences with the evolution of the water column vt d 1 0 the diameter d w of case 2 is larger than the diameter of the other cases at the same vertical position correspondingly the water column volume of case 2 obtains the maximum value among all cases the growth rate of d w d with respect to vt d shows obvious distinctions between different cases specifically the non dimensional water column diameter d w d of case 2 shows a faster growth rate than the other cases 5 conclusion the temporal evolution of the water column generated by lifting partially submerged spheres from a body of water at different velocities and submergence depths was studied numerically the time history of the water column under low froude number fr 0 41 v 0 5 m s was compared with the experiment results of wu et al 2017 and the quantitative comparison of the pinch off time and height agreed well with the experimental data some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the evolution of the water column varies with increasing pulling velocity and spontaneous breakup of water column was observed for a high weber number we 2 05 105 the water column under a low froude number fr 0 41 maintained a stable and symmetrical cone shape during the pulling process on the other hand the shape of the water column under a high froude number fr 8 25 does not change considerably however the water column evolution become complex and can be divided into three stages instability in the initial interface of the water column droplet formation from the side of the water column and spray at the top of the water column the main reason the water column spontaneously breaks up is that the inertial forces acting on the water column increases with the increasing froude number 2 the initial submergence depth of the sphere is also a significant factor in the pinch off dynamics and water column evolution in the case of a low initial submergence depth the water column pinches off at lower height and earlier time compared to water columns drawn from a greater submergence depth resulting in a shorter water column 3 the rising process of a water column can be distinctly divided into two stages due to the pinch off in the first stage the water column keeps rising at the same velocity as the sphere after pinch off the increase in the water column height approximately follows a power law 4 the horizontal extension evolution of the water column depends not only on the froude number but also on the contact time between the sphere and the water column funding this work was supported by the equipment pre research project grant number 41407010501 
22616,the evolution of a water column pulled by a partially submerged sphere known as the water exit problem is evaluated by numerical simulation the lattice boltzmann method was combined with a mass tracking algorithm the accuracy of the numerical method was demonstrated by comparisons with previous experimental results moreover the evolution processes of the water column with different froude and weber numbers 0 4134 fr 8 2479 5 15 102 we 2 06 105 as well as different initial submergence depths hs d 1 2 1 4 1 8 were discussed spontaneous breakup of water column was observed for higher weber numbers moreover vertical stretching of the water column approximately followed a power law in which the power exponent depended on the initial setup of the sphere and its time scales however the horizontal evolution of the water column followed an approximately linear rule variation in the water column diameter appeared to be irregular at different physical times or in non dimensional time furthermore the initial submergence depth of the sphere was also a significant factor in the pinch off dynamics and water column evolution this study of water exit is of a great importance in designing marine vehicles that take off from a free water surface keywords evolution of water column lattice boltzmann method numerical simulation partially submerged sphere deformation of free surface submergence depth 1 introduction multiphase flows appear in many natural and industrial processes a unique multiphase flow occurs when a partially submerged object is lifted from a liquid bath specifically when the partially submerged object exits the liquid a liquid column is rapidly withdrawn from the liquid bath this phenomenon is known as the water exit problem such flows have attracted great scientific interest due to the richness of the underlying physics in the formation of the water column extensive studies on the water exit problem have been performed because the behavior of this liquid column during the pulling process under lower froude numbers 0 10 and pulling velocities 0 2 m s plays an important role in both natural systems reis et al 2010 gart et al 2015 and industrial applications ahmed et al 2011 in nature animals of the families felidae e g house cats and lions and canis e g dogs and wolves use their tongue in a lapping motion to stretch a water column from the bath in order to drink kim and bush 2012 reis et al 2010 have performed a physical experiment in which a cat s tongue was replaced by a disk to reveal the mechanism of cats drinking likewise gart et al 2015 used a rounded rod to replace a dog s tongue in experiments and successfully modeled the drinking mechanism of dogs which is different from that of cats in addition the extended process of liquid columns has some industrial applications such as high speed printing kumar 2015 as computational power has increased numerical simulations have become a more effective means of understanding water column evolution kim et al 2018 and ahmed et al 2011 used the volume of fluid vof method to simulate the extension and pinch off phenomenon of a liquid column pulled by an accelerated sphere and two parallel plates respectively korobkin 2013 presented a model of hydrodynamic loads acting on a partially submerged rigid body with a small deadrise angle during the lifting of the body some other methods have been used to solve problems related to the large deformation of free surface water including the water entry zarghami et al 2014 krastev et al 2018 russo et al 2018 fanelli et al 2017 and water exit problems haohao et al 2019 used a three dimensional 3d lattice boltzmann method lbm to simulate the breaking of the free surface during the water exit process of fully submerged sphere using the constrained interpolation profile cip method and incompressible smooth particle hydrodynamics isph zhu et al 2007 and nair and tomar 2014 studied the fully nonlinear free surface deformations of initially calm water caused by the water entry and exit of a horizontal circular cylinder with both forced and free vertical motions additionally coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method and finite element analysis have also been employed to model the water entry problem of a 3d projectile erfanian et al 2015 wang 2012 the pinch off dynamics of an axisymmetric liquid column is a classical problem that has attracted much attention notz et al 2001 chen et al 2002 for example gart et al 2015 showed that the pinch off time of the water column coincided with the time when the dog closed its mouth three scaling theories describing the drop formation after the column was pinched off involve a inertia viscosity and capillarity eggers 1993 b inertia and capillarity day et al 1998 and c viscosity and capillarity papageorgiou 1995 moreover the pinch off dynamics and evolution of the liquid column differ significantly depending on the forces inertia viscosity and capillarity that dominate the pulling of the liquid column reis et al 2010 gart et al 2015 kim et al 2018 furthermore kim et al 2018 summarized the scaling analysis results of pinch off time from previous studies and showed the dramatic phenomenon that the pinch off location shifts from higher to lower points under different sphere accelerations the spatial extension of a liquid column has also been studied however most studies have been confined to cases where capillarity dominates at low froude and weber numbers for instance marmottant and villermaux 2004 studied the pulling process of liquid ligaments produced by the withdrawal of a tube from a liquid bath with slow and fast extension ratios ligaments undergoing fast elongation fragment and break up into droplets during the pulling process where the break up ligament consists of a linear succession of liquid blobs such blobs are also subject to aggregative processes and rearrangements wu et al 2017 presented their experimental process for the forced water exit of a partially submerged sphere and the stretching shape of the water column was similar to the physical rod experiment by gart et al 2015 this similarity occurred because both experiments used objects with a semi spherical bottom to stretch the water column even though the rod and sphere experiments have different initial submergence depths velocities and accelerations in contrast to the extensive research on the longitudinal extension process of the water column much less work has been dedicated to the transverse extension of water column such as how the water column radius varies during the pulling process and the difference in the water column radius with different froude numbers and initial submergence depths nevertheless tassin et al 2017 used a light emitting diode led and a draughtboard to experimentally measure the evolution of the contact line and wetted surface during the lifting of a circular disk initially floating on the water surface the evolution of the contact line and the minimal diameter of the water column were measured from different views a review of the literature shows a lack of systematic study of the evolution of a water column pulled by a partially submerged sphere especially for higher velocities and different initial submergence depths in addition most studies focused on small scale objects with low froude numbers and 0 fr 10 and pulling velocities 0 m s v 2 m s therefore the evolution of the water column at higher pulling velocities must be investigated for relevance to the field of ocean engineering in this study a front tracking lattice boltzmann lb approach is applied to investigate the effect of the froude number and initial submergence depth on the evolution of water column the computational results are expected to offer theoretical reference for future numerical analyses of water column evolution additionally the water exit of a partially submerged body is of great importance in designing marine vehicles that take off from the free water surface such as sea planes and wing in ground wig effect vehicles and that pierce through the free surface such as missiles and submarines understanding the complex fluid phenomenon of missiles is also meaningful to their design in this article we focus on the evolution of water columns pulled by partially submerged spheres especially at higher velocities 1 6496 fr 8 2479 than those in existing studies 0 fr 10 in addition the effect of the submergence depth has been systematically studied in this paper the 3d lbm and the numerical model used in this study are presented in section 2 in section 3 numerical tests are used to validate the proposed method in section 4 the evolution of water column is analyzed and the impact of initial submergence depth is discussed finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 mathematical methods 2 1 lattice boltzmann equations the common lb equation has the following form chen et al 1991 1 f i x c i d t t d t f i x t ω i in the most common approach a single relaxation time srt was based on the bhatnagar gross krook bgk approximation bhatnagar et al 1954 chen et al 1992 qian et al 1992 as 2 ω i b g k 1 τ f i e q f i where f i e q is the local equilibrium function at which the state is relaxed the parameter τ is the relaxation time which controls the lattice kinematic fluid viscosity ν as follows benzi et al 1992 3 v c s 2 τ 1 2 where c s is the lattice sound speed the fluid density ρ and velocity u at x t could be found through weighted sums known as moments of f i x t and the pressure p was determined from the state equation as follows 4 ρ x t i f i x t ρ u x t i c i f i x t p ρ x t c s 2 where c i is one of a small discrete set of velocities c i as shown in fig 1 in this work the d3q19 model qian et al 1992 chen et al 1997 was used where d3 is the space dimension of the simulation and q19 refers to the number of discrete velocities i e ci for i 0 18 as shown in fig 1 to recover the macroscopic hydrodynamics the model must be chosen in such a way that the essential conservation laws are satisfied and the resulting macroscopic equations are galilean invariant for the single phase collision operator an equilibrium distribution function proposed by qian et al 1992 was used which is given by 5 f i e q ρ w i 1 c i u c s 2 c i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where c s 1 3 and w i are weighting parameters 6 w i 1 3 i 0 1 18 i 1 2 6 1 36 i 7 8 18 the distribution functions moved on the d3q19 lattice with lattice velocity c

the condition dx dt 1 the effect of gravity g on the deformation of the free surface during removal of a sphere from the water was regarded as a body force which was introduced by calculating the

boundary condition in this study the single phase free surface model proposed by thürey 2007 was used to solve the high density ratio problem e g wherein the density ratio between the air and the water at the free surface is approximately 1000 for water exit problems the main feature of this method is that the gas phase is discarded in the dynamics of the liquid which remarkably increases the computational efficiency a summary of this method is presented in this section as shown in fig 2 a the lattice was divided into three types of cells gas interface and fluid cells through the volume fraction of the fluid ε the fluid fraction was computed using the cell mass and density as ε m ρ where m is the fluid mass contained in the cell the fluid fraction was equal to 0 and 1 for pure gas and fluid cells respectively whereas a value between 0 and 1 indicated cells were partially filled with fluid the computation consisted of three steps falcucci et al 2011a determining interface motion determining boundary conditions and updating cell types the interface motion was determined in the first step in a similar process to the vof methods interface motion was tracked by computing the fluxes between the cells for a cell located at x at time t the mass change due to the streaming of the i th population was given by 10 δ m i x t 0 x c i d t g f i p c x c i d t t f i p c x t x c i d t f f i p c x c i d t t f i p c x t ε x t ε x c i d t t 2 x c i d t i 11 m x t δ t m x t i 0 18 δ m i x t where pc characterizes the post collision state and i defines the opposite direction with respect to i here g f and i represent respectively gas fluid and interface cells in the second step boundary conditions were determined at the interface between gas and liquid because the dynamics of the gas phase were neglected the distribution functions associated with gas cells were never accessed and thus need to be reconstructed körner et al 2005 for an interface cell at site x with an empty cell at x c i d t the post streaming density function was governed by 12 f i p c x t d t f i e q ρ g a s u f i e q ρ g a s u f i x t d t where u is the fluid velocity at the interface cell the surface tension model introduced by xing et al 2007 is used to study the effect of the weber number on the deformation of the water column as given in eq 13 13 f i p c x t d t f i e q ρ g a s u f i e q ρ g a s u f i x t δ f i the surface tension is included by adding a perturbation term δ f i which is defined as 14 δ f i β m n cos 2 θ i θ n where β is a constant chosen to set the surface tension in the model m n is the mass gradient of the liquid the direction of which is perpendicular to the interface θ i is the angle of the lattice direction i and θ n is the angle of the local mass gradient the surface tension model is described in further detail in xing et al 2007 finally the cell type was updated the density calculated after the collision was used to check whether the interface cell was to be filled or emptied during the time step which can be expressed as 15 m x t d t 1 ℓ ρ x t d t cell filled m x t d t 0 ℓ ρ x t d t cell emptied where ℓ is an offset usually ℓ 10 3 more information on the accuracy of the method and the stability of the free interface can be found in thürey 2007 falcucci et al 2011a and falcucci and ubertini et al 2011 2 3 computational domain and moving wall boundary conditions for the computational domain boundary conditions the so called full way bounce back method was used to satisfy the no slip boundaries sukop and thorne 2006 in this method particles are assumed to travel the complete link path from the boundary to the solid node before the particle velocity is inverted in the collision step bounce back boundary conditions for a moving sphere were employed a schematic depiction of these boundary conditions is shown in fig 2 b here δx denotes the space between lattice nodes subscripts b and f denote the lattice nodes on the body and fluid side respectively and w denotes intersections of the body s perimeter the length fraction of the intersected link between x f and x b was defined as δ x f x w x f x b the unknown probability density function on the sphere side was recovered as follows filippova and hänel 1997 16 f i p c x b t 1 χ f i x f t χ f i x b t 2 ω i ρ x b t c i u x w t c s 2 where u x w t is the boundary velocity at the intersection between the body and the link and χ is a weighting factor mei et al 1999 2000 defined as 17 χ 2 δ 1 τ 1 2 δ 0 5 2 δ 1 τ 2 δ 0 5 here u b f and f i x b t are defined as mei et al 2002 18 u

generated in the domain in the case of the abrupt start of a moving body which causes the pressure p density ρ and fluid velocity u to fluctuate these fluctuations are sufficiently weak that ma u c s 1 kinsler et al 1999 krüger et al 2016 therefore to guarantee sufficiently low compressibility effects the mach numbers were ma v max c s 1 where v max is the maximum lattice speed in all simulations 2 4 turbulence model given a sufficient number of grids the lbm enables the direct numerical simulation of fluid flows at high reynolds numbers however most studies have shown that using the lbm for high reynolds number flows without modeling unresolved small scale effects on large scale dynamics results in numerical instability hou et al 1994 therefore to stabilize the simulation a turbulence model was integrated into the basic lb algorithm as the lbm stability becomes limited when the relaxation parameter τ approaches 1 2 which is equivalent to ω being close to 2 here the wall adapting local eddy wale viscosity model ducros et al 1998 was used to improve the numerical stability and capture turbulent structures in the flow thus providing a consistent local eddy viscosity and accurately predicting the force near the wall in the filtered lb equation the effect of unresolved scale motion was modeled through the modified collision relaxation time τ s τ s 3 v v t 0 5 for the kinematic viscosity ν in eq 3 and eddy viscosity v t 20 v t δ f 2 s α β d s α β d 3 2 s α β s α β 5 2 s α β d s α β d 5 4 where δ f c w d x is the filter scale and the constant c w was set to 0 325

experiments the applicability of the proposed algorithm to model water entry and exit for a spherical body was demonstrated using two examples the water exit of partially and fully submerged spheres with a constant speed was simulated and compared against experimental measurements from a water flume wu et al 2017 the parameters of the sphere were the same as those used by wu et al 2017 which are listed in table 1 to ensure that the numerical simulation results are independent of the domain size the computational domain should be sufficiently large in all three directions the dimensions of the cubic computational domain were 3 m 3 m 3 m and the water depth was 1 5 m as shown in the schematic diagram of computational domain in fig 3 the gravitational acceleration was g 9 8 m s2 and the surface tension coefficient of water was σ 7 2 10 2 n m 3 1 water exit of a partially submerged sphere the model was first validated for the case of the 3d water exit of a partially submerged sphere with constant vertical velocity the numerical results were compared with the experimental results obtained by wu et al 2017 fig 3 schematically shows the water exit of a partially submerged sphere the initial submergence depth of the center of sphere was h i 0 as shown in fig 4 and the time step was δ t 2 10 4 s to further verify the effectiveness of this approach the numerical results at the moment when the water column detaches from the sphere surface were compared with the experimental data wu et al 2017 the method for estimating the moment and water column height was identical with the method proposed by wu et al 2017 table 2 compares the experimental and numerical results of the water column height and detachment moment for different froude fr numbers the detachment moment for the experimental and computational results was defined as t c and t c respectively and the water column height for the experimental and computational results was defined as h c and h c respectively the error in the water column height and detachment moment between experimental and numerical results is defined as ε h and ε t respectively the errors of the water column height and detachment moment were defined as ε h h c h c h c 100 and ε t t c t c t c 100 respectively the numerical predictions showed quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of water column height and detachment moment fig 5 shows a visual comparison of the computed results with the experimental data obtained by wu et al 2017 on the deformation of the free surface during the water exit of a partially submerged sphere at a constant vertical velocity v 0 5 m s for f r v g d 0 41 the initial moment t 0 ms corresponds to the moment when the sphere began to move vertically from fig 5 b d the free surface around the sphere was concave during the initial ascent then the concavity disappears and the formation and extension of the water column was observed in both the numerical simulation and experimental results the water column became thinner with its extension additionally a bulge in the free surface was pulled with the water column as shown in fig 5 f k the column s ascent was eventually interrupted by the pinch off at which point the bulge of the free surface and the water column fell quickly under the action of gravity as shown in fig 5 l in the numerical data the body surface was wrapped by a thin water layer for viscidity however the experimental photographs do not accurately display this phenomenon due to the extremely small thickness of the water layer on the body surface 3 2 water exit of a fully submerged sphere in this section we calculate the exit of a fully submerged sphere with a constant vertical velocity v through an initially calm water surface the numerical cases were nearly identical to the experiment by wu et al 2017 as listed in table 3 the initial submergence depth of the center of sphere was h i 0 193 m as shown in fig 6 the computational domain and time step were the same for validation cases 1 3 the initial moment t 0 ms corresponds to the time when the sphere began to move vertically the height of the spike was defined as h and a new time coordinate t proposed by wu et al 2017 was defined to compare the height of the spike for the free surface under different vertical velocities zero time or t 0 corresponds to the moment when the vertex of the sphere was in contact with the calm free surface as shown in fig 6 table 3 shows the comparison of the spike height between experimental and numerical results under different froude numbers f r v g d in this study the definition of spike height h sn was identical with h s proposed by wu et al 2017 when the distance between the peak of the free surface and the vertex of the sphere was approximately equal to 1 of the sphere diameter the height of free surface peak relative to the initial water surface was defined as h sn the error of the spike height was defined as ε s h sn h s h s 100 from table 3 h sn was extremely close to h s and the difference between h sn and h s was close to zero the numerical results about the height of the spike with respect to time show good agreement with the experimental results wu et al 2017 fig 7 compares the computed results with experimental data on the deformation of the free surface during the water exit of a fully submerged sphere at a constant vertical speed v 0 5 m s with froude number fr 0 41 from fig 7 a h as the sphere rose the free surface was gradually uplifted and the distance between the uppermost point of the sphere and the peak of the free surface decreased which can be attributed to the fact that the free surface flows down along with the water layer on the surface of the sphere the free surface pushed up by the body is commonly referred to as the surge effect and this special phenomenon was captured through the numerical computation in fig 7 h i the height of free surface was close to the peak and the water layer was broken up the moment predicted by the computation approximately coincided with the experimental data when the surge effect occurs the above analysis indicates that typical features of the deformation of the free surface during the water exit of a sphere such as the surge effect the concavity around the body and the bulge relative to the calm surface were captured accurately using the proposed method 3 3 convergence analysis in this section the effects of the grid size and time step on the calculated results are evaluated first the grid convergence is analyzed by comparing the numerical and experimental results validation case 5 in table 3 was chosen for the grid convergence analysis and the simulation was performed for three lattices d δx 30 60 120 under the same conditions fig 8 compares the height of the spike with different grid numbers at constant speed v 0 5 m s for the spike height the cases with d δx 60 and d δx 120 are not significantly different the spike heights for these two cases agree well with the experimental data in order to analyze the effect of grid size on the formation of the droplet breakup at high velocities we define the number of fragments and droplets n and the dimensionless area s s s wc s sq where s wc denotes the surface area of the water column and s sq is the surface area of sphere likewise three different grid resolutions d δx 30 60 and 120 are used for the study with fr 8 14 or u 10 m s the results in figs 9 and 10 reveal that the grid size has a slight effect on the formation of fragments and droplets when the non dimensional parameter d δx is more than 60 thus the medium lattice d δx 60 was selected for all simulations presented in tables 5 and 6 to strike a balance between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency additionally convergence studies are performed to obtain a time independent solution here we define a non dimensional time size parameterδt uδt d where u δt and d represent the velocity time size and diameter of the sphere respectively in addition the height of the water column and the diameter of its transverse section at z 0 are defined as h w and d w respectively as shown in fig 20 for fr 8 14 three different time sizesδt 0 01 0 0067 and 0 0034 are used for the study figs 11 and 12 show the time history of h w d and d w d the results indicate that the resolution of 0 0067 is sufficient for fr 8 14 to attain a convergent result similarly the number of fragments and droplets n and the dimensionless area s are considered in the time step tests to investigate the effect of the time step on the breakup of the water column and the formation of droplets tests with three different time sizesδt 0 01 0 0067 and 0 0034 were carried out for fr 8 14 or u 10 m s the results with different time steps shown in figs 13 and 14 reveal that the cases withδt 0 0067 andδt 0 0034 agree well with each other indicating that the time step has little effect on the n and s when the non dimensional time stepδt is less than 0 0067 therefore the non dimensional time stepδt 0 0067 was chosen for all simulations presented in tables 5 and 6 note that the numerical error decreases with increasing grid resolution and decreasing time step but never becomes zero this error should not dominantly affect the dynamics of water column breakup i e the formation of ligaments and droplets hence the numerical errors can be concluded to be small but this error may require a complete theoretical analysis in future work moreover to justify the convergence condition with respect to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the courant number n cour uδt δx was determined as listed in table 4 where δx is the grid spacing and d δx 60 for all the cases in tables 5 and 6 n cour is less than 1 thus a non dimensional time step δt 0 0067 and grid size d δx 60 were utilized in subsequent studies the analyses in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 indicate that the proposed model effectively captured a few of the classical phenomena describing the deformation of free surface thus the proposed lbm combined with the mass tracking algorithm can be used to accurately treat the problem of water column evolution 4 results and discussion 4 1 evolution of the water column with different sphere velocities in this section a water column pulled by a sphere at different velocities was investigated using the proposed model section 2 the partially submerged spheres d 0 15 m have the same initial submersed depth h s h s d 1 2 and the center of the sphere was located initially at the free surface z 0 as shown in figs 3 and 4 table 5 shows detailed parameters for the water exit cases froude number f r v g d and weber number w e ρ v 2 d σ we focus only on the rising process of water column in this study 4 1 1 characteristics of water column evolution at a low pulling velocity v 0 5 m s fig 5 shows a comparison between the validation case 2 wu et al 2017 and case 1 where time t represents physical time the sphere was located at the calm free surface and began to rise at t 0 ms and the water column was formed under the disturbance of the sphere the evolution of the water column with a slow extension velocity v 0 5 m s is stable and symmetrical during the rising process and the water column reaches a stable equilibrium under the action of gravity and surface tension more details are discussed in section 3 1 the shape of the liquid column depends on the shape of object exiting the water such as a partially submerged disk or tube for a disk or tube the shape of the water column resembles a catenoid or hyperboloid before pinch off reis et al 2010 gart et al 2015 kumar 2015 however for a moving sphere the water column stretches into a slender cone wu et al 2017 kim et al 2018 and a thread like region is formed with a small variation in curvature t 436 ms during the stretching process the water column cannot consistently adhere to the rising sphere due to the action of gravity hence the water column pinches off below the surface of the sphere after a certain height is reached the evolution of the coniform column is consistent with that observed in previous literature gart et al 2015 wu et al 2017 4 1 2 characteristics of water column evolution at a high pulling velocity v 10 m s fig 15 shows the 3d interface evolution of the simulation for case 5 in table 5 the 2d slice through the center of sphere is shown in fig 16 which presents the time history of volume of liquid phase the other parameters are identical to the validation case 2 and case 1 except for the sphere velocity the evolution of the water column with high sphere velocity has a totally different characteristic than the case of low sphere velocity formation of the water column occurred quickly once the sphere exited the water at t 7 5 ms the sphere exited the initial free surface entirely then the shape of water column was similar to the water column in case 1 at t 10 ms although no spatial perturbation was assumed in the initial or boundary conditions the interface of the water column became unstable which was entirely different to the behavior of case 1 subsequently the length of the unstable part of the water column continuously increased at t 20 ms at later stages t 30 ms to t 60 ms droplet formation appeared on the side of the water column and then spontaneous breakup of the water column occurred at its leading edge even though the sphere was no longer in contact with the water column after t 70 ms the top of the water column spontaneously broke up into multiple droplets 4 2 effect of the submergence depth of the sphere on the water column in this section we discuss the effect of the submergence depth of the sphere with different velocities on the evolution of the water column to reduce the influence of waterfall breaking phenomenon greenhow and lin 1983 on the water column submergence depths h s d greater than 1 2 were not taken into account therefore we chose three initially submergence depths of h s d 1 2 1 4 and 1 8 as shown in fig 17 table 6 presents the detailed parameters for the water exit cases discussed in this section case 5 in table 6 is identical to case 5 in table 5 the schematic diagram of the parameter definitions is shown in fig 18 the shapes of the water column of cases 5 6 and 7 at different moments are shown in fig 19 the initial submergence depth has a considerable effect on the water column involving its pinch off volume and horizontal and vertical extension fig 19 shows that the horizontal and vertical extension of water column decreases simultaneously with the reduction in the initial submergence depth and the pinch off times of cases 5 6 and 7 are also different as discussed in section 4 3 2 essentially the decrease in the submergence depth affects the geometrical shape of the sphere interacting with the free surface and consequently the shape of the water column pulled by the sphere is influenced these effects will be discussed further in the following sections however the spontaneous breakup of the water column is independent of the initial submergence depth 4 3 vertical and horizontal extension of the water column as the sphere rises the water column undergoes a continual and obvious change in its length and width therefore we discuss the evolution of the vertical and horizontal extension of the water column in this section fig 20 represents a schematic of water column pulled at a constant velocity v note that this simplified picture does not include the phenomenon of breakup or capillary waves around the water column for quantification purposes h w and d w were used to describe the height and diameter of the water column respectively specifically d w represents the diameter of the water column at z 0 where breakup does not occur because the breakup of the water column could increase the diameter of the water column and lead to a discontinuous diameter along the vertical direction as shown in fig 20 the free surface can be divided into three parts after deformation i water column region ii sunken region and iii steady region among the three parts we focused on evolution of the water column region i 4 3 1 evolution of the vertical extension fig 21 presents the rising process of a water column that could be distinctly divided into two stages in the first stage the water column is in contact with the moving sphere which is represented by the black solid line h w1 in the second stage the water column separates from the sphere after pinch off which is denoted by the blue solid line h w2 the gray solid dot signifies the pitch off the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the gray solid dot represent the pinch off time and pinch off height of the water column respectively moreover the gray dotted lines represent the extension of the black solid line which also represents the height of the bottom of the moving sphere h s d 2 the evolution of the water column height h w as a function of time are displayed in fig 21 a f and fig 22 compares h w for cases with different submergence depths the effect of the sphere velocity on the water column height h w is revealed by comparing fig 21 a through d moreover cases with different submergence depths are shown in fig 21 e and f fig 21 a d show that as the sphere velocity increases the pinch off height clearly increases while the pinch off time decreases wu et al 2017 drew an identical conclusion additionally fig 21 d f show that the pinch off point also depends on the initially submergence depth therefore reducing the submergence depth or volume is an effective method of reducing the pinch off height of the water column and advancing the pinch off time for example the pinch off height of case 7 fig 21 f is close to that of case 2 fig 21 a the pulling velocity of the water column in the rising process depends on the initial velocity of the sphere which is mainly because the kinetic energy of water column is provided by the rising sphere after pinch off the water column continues rising under the action of inertia and gravity eventually the water column reaches its peak and its vertical velocity becomes zero therefore the evolution of the water column height h w approximately follows a power law after pinch off which can be observed in fig 21 a for cases 3 7 we chose the same non dimensional time vt d 6 to study the evolution of the water column in fig 21 b f finally the exponential law followed by the water column height h w as a function of the physical time t after pinch off is given in fig 21 a f the power exponent generally increased as the pulling velocity increased and it decreased with the decrease of the initial submergence depth for a given initial condition the value of the exponent depends on not only the initially pulling velocity and the submergence depth but also the pinch off time and the total computation time for instance section 4 2 reveals that the pitch off height decreases with the reduction in the initial submergence depth but h w has little difference at t 90 ms because the initially pulling velocity is the same therefore the power exponent shown in fig 21 e is larger than that in fig 21 d because the pinch off time of case 6 is earlier than that of case 5 although the pinch off time of case 7 is also earlier than of case 6 the power exponent in fig 21 e is larger than that in fig 21 f the reason for this difference is that the ascending velocity of the water column after pinch off decreases with the reduction in the initial submergence depth in short the pinch off time and the ascending velocity together significantly influence the power exponent value as shown in fig 22 although the submergence depths are different the trend in h w is similar the value of h w mainly depends on the rising velocity of sphere the value of h w in case 7 is slightly lower than that in cases 5 and 6 although the h w is mainly affected by the sphere velocity and varies slightly with the decrease in the submergence depth the potential energy of the water column generally decreases with the decreasing submergence depth which is reflected in the obvious decrease in the radius of the liquid column which will be discussed in section 4 3 2 therefore it can be concluded that with the decrease in the immersion depth the kinetic energy obtained by the water column from the moving sphere decreases thus decreasing the potential energy of the water column however the vertical movement of the water column is affected by the moving sphere which has little influence on the height of water column but will reduce the radius 4 3 2 evolution of the horizontal extension as shown in figs 23 and 24 the horizontal evolution of the water column followed an approximately linear rule fig 23 shows the non dimensional water column diameter d w d with respect to the physical time t and fig 24 shows the non dimensional water column diameter d w d with respect to the non dimensional time vt d the diameter extends horizontally over time which can be seen in fig 19 as shown in these two figures the pinch off phenomenon shows no effect on the horizontal extension of the water column which is considerably different from the effect on the vertical extension the height of the water column relies more on the inertia force however the diameter of the water column shows more complicated features than the height of the water column at the same physical time if the spheres have the same initial submergence depth the diameter d w of a water column under a higher pulling velocity is greater than the diameter of a water column under a lower pulling velocity therefore as shown in fig 23 the water column diameter d w of case 5 has the maximum value among cases 2 5 because it has the highest pulling velocity and the deepest submergence depth in addition a decrease in the initial submergence depth can also result in a reduction in the water column diameter d w as discussed in section 4 2 finally the growth rate of the water column diameter d w in different cases can be very approximatively evidently figs 23 and 24 present some differences with the evolution of the water column vt d 1 0 the diameter d w of case 2 is larger than the diameter of the other cases at the same vertical position correspondingly the water column volume of case 2 obtains the maximum value among all cases the growth rate of d w d with respect to vt d shows obvious distinctions between different cases specifically the non dimensional water column diameter d w d of case 2 shows a faster growth rate than the other cases 5 conclusion the temporal evolution of the water column generated by lifting partially submerged spheres from a body of water at different velocities and submergence depths was studied numerically the time history of the water column under low froude number fr 0 41 v 0 5 m s was compared with the experiment results of wu et al 2017 and the quantitative comparison of the pinch off time and height agreed well with the experimental data some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the evolution of the water column varies with increasing pulling velocity and spontaneous breakup of water column was observed for a high weber number we 2 05 105 the water column under a low froude number fr 0 41 maintained a stable and symmetrical cone shape during the pulling process on the other hand the shape of the water column under a high froude number fr 8 25 does not change considerably however the water column evolution become complex and can be divided into three stages instability in the initial interface of the water column droplet formation from the side of the water column and spray at the top of the water column the main reason the water column spontaneously breaks up is that the inertial forces acting on the water column increases with the increasing froude number 2 the initial submergence depth of the sphere is also a significant factor in the pinch off dynamics and water column evolution in the case of a low initial submergence depth the water column pinches off at lower height and earlier time compared to water columns drawn from a greater submergence depth resulting in a shorter water column 3 the rising process of a water column can be distinctly divided into two stages due to the pinch off in the first stage the water column keeps rising at the same velocity as the sphere after pinch off the increase in the water column height approximately follows a power law 4 the horizontal extension evolution of the water column depends not only on the froude number but also on the contact time between the sphere and the water column funding this work was supported by the equipment pre research project grant number 41407010501 
22617,the evaluation of speed loss is the most important studies in the optimal ship routing however the mode of speed loss during rough sea voyages is complicated because of the involvement of the human factor a speed loss analysis is conducted to improve the accuracy of evaluation of measured data extracted from actual marine conditions first the conventional criteria to judge the deliberate speed reduction is summarized with the conventional ship maneuvering techniques second a nationwide questionnaire for marine engineers implemented for engine safety during rough sea voyages is detailed third these conventional criteria are validated by analyzing the collated data on accelerations ship motions navigation and engine parameters the limiting value of vertical acceleration agrees with that obtained via practical measurements on the contrary the limiting values of lateral acceleration roll motions probabilities of deck wetness and slamming do not agree with that obtained via measurements the probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing start to increase at approximately the same instant where the deliberate speed reduction occurs some relations between the deck and engine parameters detailed in this paper were found to be highly correlated finally the results of the analysis were used to model simpler estimations keywords speed loss deliberate speed reduction vertical acceleration pitch motion probability of deck wetness probability of propeller racing 1 introduction the amount of marine cargo transported has exceeded 10 billion tons in 2016 which is approximately five times that in the 1960s ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2012 it is expected to increase to 15 billion tons in 2050 maritime transportation which will become one of the most important types of infrastructure in the future has been sustaining world economy for decades and it dominates more than 95 of global cargos qinetiq et al 2013 it is possible for ships to carry larger quantities of cargo than other modes of transport despite slower speeds a ship s performance is strongly influenced by weather conditions including waves winds currents etc these conditions may delay transportation or jeopardize the safety of the ship from environmental aspects the energy efficiency design index eedi which has been in effect since 2012 gives various changes to the ship design to reduce gas emissions dnv gl 2016 the international maritime organization imo also issued the ship energy efficiency management plan seemp and the energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi to achieve environmental friendly transportation through improved ship operations prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 although factors related to ship operations has been relatively depending on empirical techniques a theoretical method is required to optimize these factors optimal ship routing is one such methodology to optimize factors including voyage time fuel consumption gas emissions etc there have been many studies on optimal ship routing since the 1950s hanssen and james 1960 hagiwara et al 1997 maki et al 2011 lin et al 2013 in these studies the evaluation of speed loss in rough seas has been pivotal for the method s accuracy studies have already indicated that speed loss consists of natural and deliberate speed reductiones naito et al 1979 faltinsen 1993 natural speed loss is caused by the dynamic relation between propulsion and resistance which includes the added resistance due to waves and winds deliberate speed reduction is caused by intentional human operations aimed at preventing damage to ship hulls or main engines etc in seakeeping theory many studies on the added resistance have been conducted kashiwagi 1991 1992 faltinsen et al 1980 okusu 1986 there also have been many studies on deliberate speed reduction with proposals of various parameters to evaluate it in the period between 1960s and 1980s aertssen 1967 aertssen and van sluyus 1972 ochi and motter 1974 gerritsma 1984 however because of technological limitations of that time practical data from actual voyages was not available those studies were mainly based on field surveys for seafarers instead of on data analysis in the field of ship maneuvering methodologies on ship handling at rough seas are empirically explained honda 1980 it includes deliberate speed reduction and steering which may be constructed from experiences of seafarers more recently onboard monitoring and measuring techniques have been developed to enable continuous data collation that can analyze ship performance in various weather conditions because gas emission fuel consumption varies in rough sea voyages it becomes important to understand deliberate speed reduction with respect to the eedi the seemp and the eeoi the international towing tank committee ittc defines deliberate speed reduction as one of the important topics in 2018 the criteria for deliberate speed reduction proposed between 1960s and 1980s should be revaluated against contemporary data from practical marine environments the authors of this paper in a separate study had already produced the results of performance analysis of the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in the rough seas of the southern hemisphere sasa et al 2017 hence the validity of the criteria in this paper is shown with the measured data gathered from some rough sea voyages firstly the validation is studied for vertical and lateral accelerations roll motion probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing which were previously shown as the criteria for calculating deliberate speed reduction these parameters are usually monitored from the ship bridge other parameters are monitored from the engine room to prevent overloading the main engine or damaging machineries however there are few studies on the deliberate speed reduction in relation to the engine parameters as the emergency operation in rough sea voyages thus current conditions of engine operations in rough sea voyages are gathered by surveying marine engineers in japanese shipping companies details of speed loss are analyzed both from measured data and survey results this paper shows that the limiting value of vertical acceleration of a ship at the bridge is suitable to judge the deliberate speed reduction on the other hand limiting values of horizontal acceleration and roll motion are not consistent with the measured results different patterns were found for probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing and the speed was intentionally reduced when values became nonzero the study also shows that the engine parameters were affected by the speed loss finally simple models were constructed to estimate the deliberate speed reduction as the quadratic function of vertical acceleration or pitch motion these models can be applied to the numerical simulation of speed loss in rough sea voyages for accurate optimal ship routing 2 evaluation parameters for deliberate speed reduction in rough seas vertical and horizontal accelerations of the ship tend to increase during rough sea voyages when vertical or horizontal acceleration increases work difficulty of the ship crew occurs in the ship s bridge or engine room if the tides worsen strongly nonlinear phenomena such as deck wetness or slamming which pose danger to a ship may occur in addition strengthening of wind waves increases the added resistance these factors make it difficult to maintain the navigation speed even when the engine power is increased this is the typical pattern of natural speed loss because it begins to overload as the host ship tries to maintain its speed the main engine is usually maintained at a constant power studies related to natural speed loss began since the 1960s and various studies were conducted between 1970s and 1980s in europe japan etc aertssen 1967 analyzed voyage records in rough seas for cargo vessels and discussed the relation among speed loss slamming deck wetness and propeller racing ochi and motter 1974 and kim et al 1984 proposed vertical acceleration in fore peak as the criteria for estimating deliberate speed reduction in a container ship and kitazawa et al 1975 added to the studies roll motion from the viewpoint of work difficulty gerritsma 1984 derived these criteria for naval ships as well there are many other related studies that propose various criteria for natural speed loss nordforsk 1987 conducted an extensive survey on rough sea voyage for ship crews and summarized the relevant criteria against a cargo ship as shown in table 1 limit values of vertical acceleration at the ship s bridge and fore peak lateral acceleration at the bridge and roll motion are defined as their root mean square rms values slamming and deck wetness in terms of probability are evaluated as 2 5 and 5 0 a ship shifts from the natural speed loss to the deliberate speed reduction if either of them exceeds its limiting value because these criteria were derived from the documents or records available at that time there are few examples that fit long range continuous data measured by accurate sensors in actual seas most of the seafarers surveyed were permanent employees of flagships before the 1980s this implicates that they have been trained to mature their maneuvering technique in rough seas through long time experience the actions taken by these employees for ship handling during rough sea maneuvering are summarized below honda 1980 1 sound a warning if the drop rate of air pressure at the ship is 1 hpa per hour if the drop rate of air pressure is more than 2 hpa per hour the ship varies its heading for 180 to turn around its course 2 reduce speed as a countermeasure against deck wetness slamming hull damage collapse of cargo propeller racing seasickness etc for safety of the ship reducing the engine power of a ship to a level corresponding to the standby speed when the speed of the ship can no longer be increased beyond standby even if the engine is operating at full speed and power mode 3 make a decision to slow down with slamming or deck wetness 4 set the relative wave direction at 30 45 from the bow until the beaufort wind scale is 6 7 a ship should be at the bow quartering sea state because rough sea maneuvering is usually conducted under beaufort scale 8 the maneuvering difficulty can be seen in head sea state more than the beaufort scale 9 5 switch from autopilot to manual steering when roll and pitch motions of the ship increase however steering angles must be within 20 repeatedly avoiding large tides to prevent precarious situations that arise with large angle steering highly skilled maneuvering techniques are required for these ship handling actions those criteria could be decided on the premise of skilled seafarers ship crews have been replaced by foreign crews who were temporarily employed after the 1990s which makes academic operating systems such as optimal ship routing a necessity it is also necessary to validate the criteria for current seafarers to construct an accurate optimal routing system 3 survey of engine operations in rough sea voyages some parameters have been proposed in the previous section to evaluate deliberate speed reduction all of which can be experienced in the ship s bridge machinery parts of the main engine and shaft are also influenced by the rough sea conditions and it is necessary to know the engine operation related to tackling the rough sea condition however there are few studies focused on the relation between speed loss and engine parameters some intentional operations such as engine speed could be seen in the measured data it is necessary to find out the operational limits for marine engineers whether they have their own standards or not thus a nationwide questionnaire on current safety operations and standards in rough sea voyages for marine engineers was conducted questionnaires were sent to 140 japanese shipping companies and nearly half of them 71 companies responded the main questions are shown in table 2 analyzing which revealed some patterns responders are classified as shown in table 3 as shown here domestic ferries and cargo vessels are the main responders the types of propulsion systems is different for ferries and cargo vessels which are controllable pitch propeller cpp and fixed pitch propeller fpp the analyzed results of the answers to q1 q5 are summarized in figs 1 5 fig 1 shows that the responders encountered rough sea conditions mainly in the winter 49 and in the typhoon season from summer to fall 30 frequencies of the encounter are 0 6 times per year 31 7 12 times per year 18 and more than 12 times per year 18 etc this means that nearly 20 percent of responders experienced rough sea voyages at least once a month many ships reduced their speed as 60 90 of the navigation speed in fig 2 there are around 15 parameters marine engineers monitor during rough sea voyages in fig 3 the main monitoring parameters are the exhaust temperatures of cylinders 48 engine speed 33 fuel injection pump mark 32 engine power 27 revolution of blades in the turbocharger 26 etc other parameters are cooling fresh water temperature 14 boost air pressure 11 and automatic load control alc for ships with cpp 14 the resistance increases at the propeller due to external forces and it is transferred from the shaft to the main engine in these harsh weather conditions the ship performance worsens and the phenomenon of engine surging may also be triggered under such a situation the engine speed cannot be maintained and is actually very low this situation causes incomplete combustion in the main engine and the rising of exhausted gas temperatures in rough sea voyages the airflow between the main engine and turbo charger may be reversed unless the engine speed is reduced this is referred to as the surging phenomenon firstly fuel injection usually is shifted from automatic to manual control to reduce the volume of fuel injected the purpose of this operation is to gradually reduce the engine speed lowering engine load through deliberate speed reduction it is reasonable to monitor these parameters for this purpose in fig 4 the limiting value is decided from the performance curves of manufacturers 26 the empirical values defined from their experience 33 and the alc 10 for ships with cpp fig 5 shows that the slow down operation is decided when the monitoring value approaches the limiting value in the performance curves 25 ship motions or sea conditions become worse 15 the engine power approaches the criteria 11 the possibility of surging increases 10 the temperature of exhaust gas increases 8 communication with the captain 7 etc although many parameters are monitored in the engine room the final decision of deliberately decreasing speed is not made by the marine engineers alone this point is further surveyed through a visiting interview with a japanese shipping company in june 2018 the main points of the survey are summarized below 1 the employment of seafarers has changed since the 1980s and skilled seafarers with more experience are fewer in number today the maneuvering over rough seas discussed in section 2 cannot be applied for many of the current seafarers scientific support such as optimal ship routing must be simultaneously used in the ship operation 2 the chief engineer usually directs the captain to lower the loads when the engine power increases the captain then makes a decision about the emergency operation to be implemented by considering all the situations 3 it is ideal to reduce the engine speed ship speed right before entering turbulent waters it is said that the pitch motion especially in the container ship tends to reduce its ship speed the steering should be avoided as much as possible especially in the ballast condition 4 marine engineers monitor various parameters and report any abnormalities to the ship s bridge however they do not have the authority to make decisions independently the captain takes the final decision on the operation these comments are mostly consistent with the questionnaire result therefore each parameter shown in table 1 will be validated and at the same time the engine parameters will be analyzed in the next section 4 validation of survey results with onboard measured data 4 1 onboard measured data in actual sea the validity of parameters discussed in previous sections is considered for the measured data of the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in actual seas sasa et al 2015 sasa et al 2017 lu et al 2017 the measurement was conducted from july 2010 to august 2016 with periods of missing data in between because of mechanical troubles main dimensions of the 28 000 dwt bulk carrier are shown in table 4 the measurement system consists of the voyage data recorder and the engine data logger and these data are transmitted to the integrated bridge satellite system ibss for establishing communication between ship and ground station here two laptops are connected with the ibss to collate navigation data such as position speed course steer angle wind direction and speed etc and engine data such as engine speed shaft thrust engine power exhaust gas temperature revolution of blades in the turbocharger etc which are recorded every 1 0 s ship motions and accelerations are measured by an inertial measurement unit nav440 that records measured results every 0 1 s it is necessary to estimate the wave conditions which are numerically estimated by wave watch iii a third generation global wave model tolman 2002 the model computes for the global region using the two way nesting technique the condition is defined by the outer region of 0 5 and the inner region of 0 1 global wind information is required for the computation with two types of reanalysis database ncep fnl distributed from the ncep national centers for environmental prediction kalnay et al 1996 which is based in the usa and the era interim distributed from the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 which is based in europe three types of wind data are defined as the input of wave watch iii as shown in table 5 the ncep method defines wave estimation using ncep fnl with a spatial resolution of 1 0 and interpolates linearly to 0 5 and 0 1 the era method defines wave estimation using era interim with a spatial resolution of 0 75 and interpolates linearly to 0 5 and 0 1 the wrf method defines wave estimation using wind conditions computed by the wrf shamarock et al 2008 the regional air model for the ncep fnl three types of wave information are used to calculate probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing respectively the ship trajectory from february to october 2013 is shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure the bulk carrier has been mainly cruising in the southern hemisphere through the indian ocean the atlantic ocean the tasman sea and the pacific ocean three rough sea voyages are selected for the validation as shown in table 6 as shown in fig 6 cases a and b are on the same trajectory from china to uruguay with the half loaded condition the ship encountered rough seas offshore the african and south american continents case c embarks on a rough sea voyage from australia to new zealand with the ballast condition estimated wave heights at the ship positions in each case are shown from figs 7 9 lu et al 2017 the maximum value of significant wave height for case a in june 3 is 5 7 m and this is the roughest wave condition among the three cases wave heights for case b in june 15 are 4 5 m for case c from march 15 to march 17 they are 3 5 m and the wave direction varies from head sea state to following state larger ship motions in pitch and roll directions are generated with significant speed losses and detailed situations are analyzed for those cases 4 2 analysis method of measured data if a ship encounters turbulent sea conditions the added resistance is considered as a function of wave height wave period wave direction wind speed and wind direction the added wave resistance is a time averaged value of the longitudinal second order hydrodynamic force which can be analyzed by the seakeeping theory kashiwagi 1991 1992 the ship speed is then decided as a relation of the following equations it is basically discussed for regular waves in frequency domain in case of irregular sea state the ship speed is decided by solving the following equations in frequency and time domain sasa et al 2017 1 β v x p y p z r 1 t t n v r s w v r a w χ ω h v r a w d ϕ u v 2 m m 11 ω d v d t β v x p y p z r 1 t t n v r s w v r a w χ ω h v r a w d ϕ u v where β v is the thrust deduction factor due to ventilation smogeli 2006 t is the thrust deduction fraction which reflects the ship s increase in resistance in calm waters due to working propulsion units such as the propeller t is the shaft thrust n is the revolution of the main engine and shaft no reduction gears in the ship v is the ship s speed r s w is the resistance of still water r a w is the added resistance from waves χ is the relative wave direction ω is the encounter frequency h is the significant wave height r a w d is the added resistance due to winds ϕ is the relative wind direction and u is the wind speed m is the ship s mass and m 11 is the added mass in surge mode if wave conditions become rougher the value of β v will decrease and the values of r a w and r a w d will increase remarkably in harsh sea conditions the thrust deduction is also evaluated in the following method faltinsen et al 1980 3 t 2 1 1 c t w p 1 w where w is the effective wake w p is the potential wake and c t is expressed as 4 c t 2 t n v ρ v a 2 π r 2 where ρ is the water density v a is the speed of advance r is the radius of propeller if the speed of advance decreases the value of t also decreases wave series have different amplitudes and periods for each component the added resistance in irregular waves can be approximated as a series of regular waves with different amplitudes and periods each regular wave is a combination of two neighboring waves of half wave length the zero up cross method is used to analyze the wave series eq 2 is numerically solved using the fourth order runge kutta method the speed loss can be estimated in eqs 1 and 2 in eq 1 the ship s speed v should be decreased to reduce r s w for the right hand term to be equivalent to the left hand term when the added resistances increase in rough sea conditions therefore the ship s speed v is controlled to decrease with the revolution n this is the typical mechanism of speed loss and the deliberate speed reduction is also added here an inertial measurement unit is installed at the ship s bridge and is evaluated as the root mean square 5 z b 1 n i 1 n z b r i 2 6 y b 1 n i 1 n y b r i 2 7 x b 1 n i 1 n x b r i 2 8 x r s 1 n i 1 n x r b r i 2 where z b y b and x b are the root mean square values of the vertical lateral and longitudinal accelerations x rs is the root mean square of roll motion z b r i y b r i and x b r i are the i th amplitudes of accelerations in the vertical lateral and longitudinal directions x r b r i is the i th amplitude of roll motion n is the amplitude number the volume of data should be large enough to obtain statistically stable results the relative wave direction should be constant in each data unit according to the former research sasa et al 2017 the relative wave direction varies every 10 30 min in rough sea conditions therefore the data unit length is defined as 10 min statistical accuracy is shown to be almost constant for this data period lu et al 2017 the amplitudes are obtained from measured time series using the zero up crossing method probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing are defined below 9 p d w p z r f p h f 10 p s p z r f p d f z r f p v c 11 p p r p z r a p d p where p dw p s and p pr are the probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing respectively h f is the vertical height between the water surface and the deck d f is the draft forward of the ship and d p is the vertical distance between the water surface and the propeller if the water surface is below one third of the propeller diameter from the top then propeller racing will occur z r fp and z r ap are the relative water surfaces in the fore peak and aft peak defined as 12 z r f p t x h t ℓ x x p t ζ 0 t 13 z r a p t x h t ℓ x x p t ζ 0 t where x h t and x p t are heave and roll motions ζ 0 t is the free surface of water elevation under the ship ℓ x and ℓ x are the longitudinal distances from the center of gravity to the fore peak and the aft peak respectively the inertial measurement unit does not output the heave motion which is obtained as follows 14 x h t i 1 n f 2 s h ω i δ ω cos ω i t ε i where s h ω is the frequency spectrum of heave motion ω is the angular frequency ε is the phase and nf is the number of wave components the spectrum of heave motion can be obtained as the integration of vertical acceleration at the center of gravity 15 s h ω s z ω ω 4 where s z ω is the frequency spectrum of vertical acceleration at the center of gravity and its value is set as a constant of s z 0 125 for ω 0 125 rad s the free surface ζ 0 t is defined as 16 ζ 0 t i 1 n d j 1 n f 2 d w ω i θ i δ θ δ ω cos ω i t ε i where d w ω θ is the directional spectrum of the wave which is obtained from the wave simulator wave watch iii in eq 17 v c is the vertical speed of impact on the water surface with the bow part of ship ochi s formula is used here as 17 v c 0 08 0 11 g l where g is the acceleration due to gravity and l is the length of the ship those parameters are computed every 10 min of the measured data and are compared with the criteria given in table 1 parameters in the engine room are also analyzed as a 1 min average value relations of these parameters with deliberate speed reduction are analyzed in later subsections 4 3 analyzed results of onboard measured data measured data of ship motions accelerations the ship s speed etc are analyzed and compared with the criteria of earlier studies in each case 1 case a variations of z b y b x b and x r s are analyzed in june 1 3 2013 as shown in fig 10 the criteria for each parameter are represented by the red line in the figure to compare variations of the ship s speed over the ground and engine speed per minute in rpm are shown in fig 11 in fig 10 the value of z b increases significantly from approximately 40 h and exceeds the criteria 0 15 g the value of x b also approaches the criteria of lateral acceleration 0 12 g from approximately 40 50 h this tendency is similar to that of the vertical acceleration with pitch motion significantly influencing it values of lateral acceleration and roll motion exceed the criteria 0 12 g and 6 in most of the periods as shown in fig 11 the ship s speed increases once to 18 knots in 12 20 h before the speed loss occurs this might be influenced by the agulhas current which is a strong current off the coast of south africa the ship reduces its speed from 14 knots to 12 knots to save fuel the marginal speed loss can be seen at approximately 30 h while the engine speed is still constant the reductions in the ship s speed and engine speed obviously occur at the same time after 40 h which is almost the same time at which the vertical acceleration in the bridge exceeded the criteria of 0 15 g it can be assumed that the speed loss from 24 to 40 h is natural and that after 40 h is deliberate however the lateral acceleration and the roll motion are not consistent with the timing of deliberate speed reduction the increased steering after 40 h helps maintain the ship s course and it sail in head waves although this maneuvering leads to an increase in fuel consumption the roll motion can be effectively controlled they also increase remarkably after 60 h and have very similar variations meaning that a time difference of 20 h can be observed between the vertical and lateral motions it is thought that measured results agree with the criteria in longitudinal motions but not with that in lateral motions fig 12 shows the total rudder angles in port and starboard as an integrated value per minute and the averaged variation of ship s heading the amount of steering increased once at approximately 36 h which is a few hours before the significant reduction in the ship s speed and engine speed it increases after 40 h and the possibility of intentional steering can be thought to vary with the relative wave direction however the details are still unclear relative water surfaces at the fore peak and the probabilities of deck wetness are summarized in each wave estimation method era ncep and wrf as shown in fig 13 the relative water surface is the smallest in the era method and the largest in the wrf method red lines in the figure indicate the height of the deck from the water surface 5 57 m and the deck wetness can occur if the relative water surface exceeds this height the probability is evaluated as the number of exceedances per hour the probability begins to yield positive values after 40 h for three methods and this is the same timing of the reduction of the ship s speed and engine speed and the exceedance of the criteria of vertical acceleration the probabilities are 1 3 after 50 h which is still less than the criteria of deck wetness 5 the criteria are inconsistent with the measured result of speed loss for case a the probability of slamming is computed as shown in fig 14 the probability is extremely low the maximum value is 0 5 2 0 at approximately 50 h because the ship is in the half loaded condition there are no results exceed the criteria of slamming 2 5 for case a the relative water surface and the probability of propeller racing is computed as shown in fig 15 red lines in the figure show the vertical distance between the water surface and the height of one third of the propeller diameter from the top d p the propeller racing begins at approximately 40 h which is almost the same timing as the occurrence of deck wetness and the lowering of the ship s speed and engine speed these results indicate that the ship captain intentionally reduces its speed at the start of deck wetness and propeller racing and do not agree with the probabilities shown in table 1 this is consistent with the survey results in section 2 2 case b variations in z b y b x b and x r s are analyzed for june 14 17 2013 as shown in fig 16 variations in the ship s speed and engine speed for the same period are summarized in fig 17 from fig 16 it is obvious that the value of z b increases and exceeds the criteria of 0 15 g from 24 h and its maximum value is approximately 0 3 g which is similar to that in case a the values of x b are less than the criteria of 0 12 g while the values of y b exceed the criteria of 0 12 g during the period the value of x r s varies at the same timing with the vertical acceleration the speed loss and reducing engine speed can be observed from 24 h and they can be seen almost at the same timing thus deliberated speed loss could have occurred from 24 h in this case the range of speed loss and engine speed is 4 5 knots and 3 rpm respectively and they are smaller than those in case a it is necessary to consider the reason for the difference of speed loss despite the similar trends of vertical acceleration variations of the total rudder angles and the ship s heading are summarized in fig 18 it is obvious that the degree of steering has increased during the period of 24 60 h and the ship s heading has been varied for 80 from 42 to 54 h during this period it can also be seen that vertical and longitudinal accelerations have decreased significantly in fig 16 a description of the difficulty of maintaining the course is recorded in the logbook at that time which presents the need for an intentional maneuver to avoid the very harsh head sea state as the vertical motions have been reduced a strong current exists offshore the south african continent besides the high tides which lead the ship with larger steering angles larger angles should be avoided for safety as mentioned in section 2 as a result of this steering accelerations are significantly reduced and the ship s speed and engine speed are recovered in the case relative water surfaces and probabilities of deck wetness are summarized for three methods as shown in fig 19 in this case too the relative water surface is the smallest in the era method and the largest in the wrf method probabilities begin to climb above zero from approximately 30 h which is a few hours after the speed loss has occurred and is the close to the timing of the vertical acceleration the ship s speed and the engine speed however the probability is around 1 in this case which is nearly half of that in case a the difference of probability may have a relation with the difference of speed loss probabilities of slamming for three methods are summarized in fig 20 the maximum probability is 0 3 which means that slamming has not occurred significantly the relative water surface is less for 2 4 m than those in case a which is one of the reasons for the reduced speed loss relative water surfaces at the aft peak and probabilities of propeller racing are shown in fig 21 the figure shows that propeller racing also occurs at almost the same time as deck wetness does which is approximately 24 h and is consistent with the lowering of the ship s speed and engine speed the probability of propeller racing widely decreases at approximately 40 h and the lowering of longitudinal motions by varying wave directions strongly contributes to this result the probability of the propeller racing is 2 0 3 0 which is lower by 1 2 than those in case a a similar tendency is followed by the probability of deck wetness which can be used for the evaluation of deliberate speed reduction 3 case c in this case the ship is in the tasman sea between australia and new zealand from march 14 17 2013 in our previous study lu et al 2017 low pressure trough exists in the tasman sea with swells from the south pole it makes the wave conditions complex and causes the ship to alter its heading repeatedly and irregularly the loaded condition in this case is a near ballast one which is quite different from those in cases a and b variations in z b y b x b and x r s are analyzed for march 14 17 2013 as shown in fig 22 variations in the ship s speed and engine speed are also summarized for the same period as shown in fig 23 values of z b and x b increase remarkably in the time periods of 24 34 h and 40 55 h after 30 h the vertical acceleration exceeds the criteria of 0 15 g the longitudinal acceleration follows a similar tendency as that of z b the lateral acceleration exceeds the criteria 0 12 g during the period the roll motion exceeds the criteria of 6 0 in the time period of 24 72 h it is obvious that the ship s speed and engine speed follow a decreasing trend from 24 h which is nearly the same time as the vertical acceleration as shown in fig 23 these patterns are similar to those in cases a and b the ship proceeds at 14 knots initially and slows down to approximately 8 knots the speed loss in this case is deliberate variations in the total rudder angle per minute and the ship s heading are summarized in fig 24 large steering angles 1500 2000 min are repeatedly used after 30 h and this makes the value of z b decrease in the time period from 34 to 44 h however the value of z b increases again after 44 h when the ship has altered its course to the east although speed loss occurs again in this situation it must be natural as the engine speed is constant the abnormal drop in engine speed by more than 60 rpm occurs at approximately 33 h right after the second steering with large angle has begun this phenomenon is not regarded as natural speed loss because the engine trouble seems to occur as the result of the emergency operation in the rapid change of sea state as mentioned large steering angles are not recommended especially in the ballast condition this could induce massive loads on the main engine through the propeller shaft causing propeller racing which in turn could trigger the main engine to stop as an emergency action the main engine resumes 4 min after the suspension which is a dangerous situation in rough sea voyages relative water surfaces at the fore peak and probabilities of slamming are summarized as shown in fig 25 probabilities of slamming are 2 5 3 5 at the maximum which are close to the probabilities of deck wetness in case a as seen in fig 23 although the maximum value exceeds the criteria in table 1 deliberate speed reduction occurs at approximately 24 h which is almost the same time when the possibility of slamming becomes nonzero relative water surfaces at the aft peak and the probabilities of propeller racing are summarized in fig 26 probabilities of propeller racing are much higher than those in cases a and b because of the ballast condition in fig 26 propeller racing becomes a nonzero from 24 h and increases remarkably thereafter the maximum value reaches approximately 20 near 30 h which is a few hours before the abnormal drop in engine speed it is shown that the limiting value of vertical acceleration corresponds to the deliberate speed reduction however limiting values of lateral acceleration and roll motion do not necessarily agree with the timing of the speed loss it is also shown that the probabilities of slamming and propeller racing can be used to evaluate the occurrence of deliberate speed reduction at the point where they start to increase from zero 4 4 analysis of engine parameters in rough sea voyages the criteria applicable in the ship s bridge which have been proposed in earlier studies were validated in the previous section while in rough sea voyages the increased resistance to a ship s motion is transmitted to the main engine via the propeller shaft this sometimes causes engine overload incomplete combustion and surging phenomenon in the turbocharger which are dangerous to ships thus marine engineers monitor various parameters and reduce fuel injection to intentionally lower the engine load here variations in engine parameters are analyzed to identify their relation with speed loss the analyzed parameters are fuel pump mark fuel injection per second engine power exhaust gas temperature of cylinder shaft thrust revolution of blades in the turbocharger etc 1 case a fig 27 shows the variations of fuel pump mark engine power exhausted gas temperatures ship thrust and revolution of blades in the turbocharger as 1 min average values from june 1 3 2013 similar variations can be seen in the fuel pump mark engine power shaft thrust and revolution of blades in the turbocharger in the figure they increased once at approximately 20 h and reverted to the previous values although there are no remarkable fluctuations in vertical acceleration at that time the gradual speed loss for 2 knots occurs this operation is thought to prevent speed loss through the added resistance engine speed has been almost constant from 20 to 40 h except for a temporary rise in automatic multiplication once a day the engine power becomes a constant after it has slightly decreased at approximately 40 h when both the ship s speed and engine speed have reduced in the figure it is obvious that the temperature of no 5 and no 3 are higher in all the cylinders reasons the exhaust gas temperature is higher include 1 overload 2 delay in fuel injection 3 incomplete fuel spray 4 early opening of exhaust valve and 6 soot in air pipe hasegawa 2010 although it is difficult to identify the exact reason in these cases there is a possibility that any of them can affect the temperature decided from the viewpoint of safe engine operation the risk of incomplete combustion in this case becomes apparent because of the rise in exhaust gas temperature or engine overload when the power is increased more than that in the 40 h case the alarming increase in added resistance makes it impossible to maintain the ship s speed the ship s speed is intentionally reduced to avoid the additional increase in exhaust gas temperature which helps to maintain the safety of the main engine the decision to cause a deliberate speed reduction can be decided at approximately 40 h if marine engineers attempt to prevent engine overload and incomplete combustion by monitoring those parameters the deck wetness and the main engine overload occur at almost the same timing 2 case b fig 28 shows the variations in fuel pump mark engine power exhausted gas temperatures ship thrust and revolutions of the turbo charger as 1 min average values from june 14 to 17 2013 there are similar variations in the fuel pump mark the engine power the shaft thrust and the revolution of blades in the turbocharger as the same with case a although they once decrease at the same timing with the ship s speed and the engine speed they have been increasing until 40 h gradually this pattern is quite different from that in case a it implicates that the added resistance is smaller than that in case a and the ship can increase engine power here after 40 h engine parameters decrease so much because the relative wave direction varies by the steering with large angles this is a typical pattern of avoiding the overload of main engine by steering with larger angles 3 case c fig 29 shows variations of fuel pump mark the engine power the exhausted gas temperatures the ship thrust and the revolution of blades in the turbocharger as 1 min average values from march 14 to 17 2013 similar patterns can be seen in fuel pump mark engine power shaft thrust and the revolution of in the turbocharger these values have been decreased rapidly for 4 min at approximately 30 h this occurs at the same time as the larger steering angle and the abnormal situation is caused by steering in rough seas it is common for a ship to choose the larger steering angles to change the wave direction as in case b however this operation puts the ship in a precarious situation for this reason deceleration operations should be conducted in the early stages and avoid large steering angles as much as possible 4 frequency property of engine parameters as discussed in section 3 the analysis of frequency property of an engine operation is important for rough sea voyages this is analyzed for the measured data via a fast fourier transformation fft algorithm according to the questionnaire time periods of the emergency operation range from several minutes to an hour or so data length is set as 6 h with the sampling time at 1 s for the fft analysis the spectra of engine speed fuel pump mark revolution of blades in the turbocharger and ship speed are shown for the calm sea state in may 12 2013 and the rough sea state in june 3 2013 in figs 30 and 31 in fig 30 peaks can be observed from 0 005 to 0 008 hz 125 200 s for the spectrum of engine speed in the calm sea state similar peaks can be seen in the spectrum in the rough sea state on the right hand side too this frequency range corresponds to the autopilot steering frequency there are two different spectrum shapes in the figures on the left representing the instant when the ship automatically accelerates from 12 to 14 knots the ship then decelerates from 14 knots the navigation full speed to conserve fuel and it is necessary to increase the speed for the soot blow at the funnel once a day in fig 31 strong peaks appear around 0 1 hz 10 s in all types of spectra it is obvious that they are components influenced by ship motions on the waves furthermore strong peaks appear from 0 001 to 0 002 hz 500 1000 s it is shown that the main period of emergency engine operations ranges from 10 min to 1 h peak frequencies measured from 0 001 to 0 002 hz are similar to those of the period of emergency engine operations this indicates that the results of the questionnaire can be validated with the analyzed results of measured data it is shown that three types of periods exist in the variations of engine parameters a approximately 10 15 s due to ship motions on waves b 125 200 s due to autopilot or manual steering c 500 1000 s due to emergency operations to decelerate it is shown that components of a and c add to b in rough sea voyages and these parameters can be estimated as the summation of the frequency components corresponding to these three types of time periods 5 results and discussion the probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing can be effective measures to evaluate deliberate speed reduction in previous studies speed loss occurs before the probabilities reach their limiting values of 2 5 or 5 however speed loss occurs right after the probabilities have exceeded zero and its range depends on the values of these probabilities the difference with the current seafarers might influence the analyzed results of deliberate speed reduction first correlations between the pitch motion and probabilities of deck wetness and propeller racing are analyzed estimation formulas are established and validated against measured data second relations between the speed loss and probabilities are analyzed the speed loss properties are considered with the analyzed results correlations are obtained from the measured results of cases a and b but case c is excluded from the calculation due to the difference of loaded conditions and few number of data these results are only validated for the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier the applicability for other types of ships should be considered using a measurement database in future studies it is obvious that the probabilities of deck wetness and propeller racing should be estimated from the pitch motion thus the following formula is modeled as a simple quadratic curve 18 prob 0 0 x p s b a x p s b 2 b x p s where prob is the probability of deck wetness or propeller racing and x ps is the pitch motion it is characteristic of the probabilities to be zero from the origin to a certain value in the x axis and the value rapidly increases as nonlinear functions in eq 18 the boundary point b is defined as 2 5 for the pitch motion the value of b is decided when the determinant coefficient is the highest the most fitting with measured data in several values the relations between probabilities of deck wetness propeller racing and pitch motion are shown in figs 32 and 33 the probability of deck wetness has high correlations of 0 836 0 829 and 0 824 with the pitch motion there are also higher correlations with respect to the probability of propeller racing 0 891 0 888 and 0 873 that is approximately 0 9 probabilities are almost zero when the pitch motion is less than 2 5 3 0 where deliberate speed reduction has not occurred yet these values rapidly increase from the boundary point and can be well fitted by the quadratic curves the coefficients of determination are 0 824 0 827 and 0 835 for the deck wetness and 0 880 0 912 and 0 896 for propeller racing this means that the probability of deck wetness and propeller racing tend to be proportionate with the square of pitch motion in a region above the boundary point of 2 5 3 0 relations between the speed loss and these probabilities are shown in figs 34 and 35 in these figures the speed loss δv is defined as δv 12 0 v it is obvious that the values of p dw and p pr are almost zero when δv 3 4 knots which is the boundary area they significantly increase in the region above the boundary area which is indicated by a dotted red circle however the plotted points appear to have large variability although the correlation coefficients are not very low that is they are 0 7 0 8 it seems necessary to accumulate more measured data in various sea and loading conditions to estimate the speed loss from probabilities of deck wetness or propeller racing relations between the speed loss and the main wave direction are shown in fig 36 the wave direction is defined as 0 for the head sea state and 180 for the following sea state speed loss greater than 4 knots is primarily observed at approximately 45 60 these speed losses are not commonly observed in the head sea state this implies that the ship empirically avoids the head sea or beam sea states this is the same as the rough sea maneuvering shown in section 2 in this situation the longitudinal motions were dominant with the speed loss which was not observed in the range of 90 180 as described in the seakeeping theory kashiwagi et al 2004 the relation between the speed loss and the pitch motion is analyzed as shown in fig 37 the correlation coefficient is 0 883 and the speed loss δv is fitted by eq 15 the coefficient of determination is 0 742 which is lower for 0 1 than for probabilities of deck wetness and propeller racing this uncertainty might be related on the complexity of deliberate speed reduction currently the analyzed results are still limited further analysis will be conducted to accurately evaluate the speed loss 6 conclusions this study analyzes and evaluates speed loss during rough sea voyages and reproduces the validity of previous studies for a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in rough sea conditions the limiting value of vertical acceleration shows nearly the same timing as the measured result on the other hand the limiting values of lateral acceleration or roll motion are smaller than the measured result although the limiting values of the probabilities of deck wetness or slamming are defined as 2 5 or 5 deliberate speed reduction occurs at the point when the probability exceeds zero initial stage of deck wetness slamming or propeller racing detailed variations of engine parameters are summarized in rough sea voyages and they have very similar time varying properties there are two patterns of engine operations at the point where natural speed loss switches on to the deliberate speed reduction one is making fuel injection rate constant after increasing it to maintain engine speed as shown in case a the second one is making fuel injection rate constant after it has decreased once due to the large steering angle as shown in case b it is also shown case c that steering sometimes causes temporary engine failure in turbulent sea conditions the frequency property of engine operations was analyzed and additional peaks around 10 s and 500 1000 s were observed due to ship motions and intentional handling of machines in rough sea voyages besides the frequency of autopilot being approximately 125 200 s these time periods of operations could affect the deliberate speed reduction and agree with the results of the questionnaire the correlation coefficients are high 0 82 0 89 between the pitch motion and the probabilities of deck wetness or propeller racing the simple estimations are modeled as the quadratic curves which have a high coefficient of determination 0 82 0 91 it confirms that the probabilities of deck wetness or propeller racing can be expressed as a quadratic function of pitch motion when the amount of speed loss is discussed the probability of deck wetness or propeller racing is almost zero in δv 3 4 knots this implies that deliberate speed reduction may occur when the speed loss exceeds 3 4 knots there are some dispersions between the speed loss and the probabilities for δv 3 4 knots the speed loss for δv 3 4 knots occurs when the main wave direction is approximately 45 from the bow considering the influence of the longitudinal motions they have a relatively good correlation with measured the speed loss however the coefficient of determination decreases to 0 742 this may be caused by the uncertainty of speed loss including the deliberate speed reduction the criteria for bulk carrier is mainly summarized as the 0 15 g of vertical acceleration at ship s bridge which is the same as the former study on the other hand the probability of deck wetness and propeller racing should be revised as 0 0 5 which corresponds with 3 of pitch motion it is also shown that the roll motion or lateral acceleration does not lead to the deliberate speed reduction very much a further analysis of the measured data must be conducted for different sea regions weather conditions loading conditions ship types etc based on this study the estimation of speed loss will be more accurate for the practical use in the optimal ship routing acknowledgements the authors wish to extend their gratitude to shoei kisen kaisha ltd for their cooperation in conducting onboard measurements of the 28 000 dwt bulk

22617,the evaluation of speed loss is the most important studies in the optimal ship routing however the mode of speed loss during rough sea voyages is complicated because of the involvement of the human factor a speed loss analysis is conducted to improve the accuracy of evaluation of measured data extracted from actual marine conditions first the conventional criteria to judge the deliberate speed reduction is summarized with the conventional ship maneuvering techniques second a nationwide questionnaire for marine engineers implemented for engine safety during rough sea voyages is detailed third these conventional criteria are validated by analyzing the collated data on accelerations ship motions navigation and engine parameters the limiting value of vertical acceleration agrees with that obtained via practical measurements on the contrary the limiting values of lateral acceleration roll motions probabilities of deck wetness and slamming do not agree with that obtained via measurements the probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing start to increase at approximately the same instant where the deliberate speed reduction occurs some relations between the deck and engine parameters detailed in this paper were found to be highly correlated finally the results of the analysis were used to model simpler estimations keywords speed loss deliberate speed reduction vertical acceleration pitch motion probability of deck wetness probability of propeller racing 1 introduction the amount of marine cargo transported has exceeded 10 billion tons in 2016 which is approximately five times that in the 1960s ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2012 it is expected to increase to 15 billion tons in 2050 maritime transportation which will become one of the most important types of infrastructure in the future has been sustaining world economy for decades and it dominates more than 95 of global cargos qinetiq et al 2013 it is possible for ships to carry larger quantities of cargo than other modes of transport despite slower speeds a ship s performance is strongly influenced by weather conditions including waves winds currents etc these conditions may delay transportation or jeopardize the safety of the ship from environmental aspects the energy efficiency design index eedi which has been in effect since 2012 gives various changes to the ship design to reduce gas emissions dnv gl 2016 the international maritime organization imo also issued the ship energy efficiency management plan seemp and the energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi to achieve environmental friendly transportation through improved ship operations prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 although factors related to ship operations has been relatively depending on empirical techniques a theoretical method is required to optimize these factors optimal ship routing is one such methodology to optimize factors including voyage time fuel consumption gas emissions etc there have been many studies on optimal ship routing since the 1950s hanssen and james 1960 hagiwara et al 1997 maki et al 2011 lin et al 2013 in these studies the evaluation of speed loss in rough seas has been pivotal for the method s accuracy studies have already indicated that speed loss consists of natural and deliberate speed reductiones naito et al 1979 faltinsen 1993 natural speed loss is caused by the dynamic relation between propulsion and resistance which includes the added resistance due to waves and winds deliberate speed reduction is caused by intentional human operations aimed at preventing damage to ship hulls or main engines etc in seakeeping theory many studies on the added resistance have been conducted kashiwagi 1991 1992 faltinsen et al 1980 okusu 1986 there also have been many studies on deliberate speed reduction with proposals of various parameters to evaluate it in the period between 1960s and 1980s aertssen 1967 aertssen and van sluyus 1972 ochi and motter 1974 gerritsma 1984 however because of technological limitations of that time practical data from actual voyages was not available those studies were mainly based on field surveys for seafarers instead of on data analysis in the field of ship maneuvering methodologies on ship handling at rough seas are empirically explained honda 1980 it includes deliberate speed reduction and steering which may be constructed from experiences of seafarers more recently onboard monitoring and measuring techniques have been developed to enable continuous data collation that can analyze ship performance in various weather conditions because gas emission fuel consumption varies in rough sea voyages it becomes important to understand deliberate speed reduction with respect to the eedi the seemp and the eeoi the international towing tank committee ittc defines deliberate speed reduction as one of the important topics in 2018 the criteria for deliberate speed reduction proposed between 1960s and 1980s should be revaluated against contemporary data from practical marine environments the authors of this paper in a separate study had already produced the results of performance analysis of the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in the rough seas of the southern hemisphere sasa et al 2017 hence the validity of the criteria in this paper is shown with the measured data gathered from some rough sea voyages firstly the validation is studied for vertical and lateral accelerations roll motion probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing which were previously shown as the criteria for calculating deliberate speed reduction these parameters are usually monitored from the ship bridge other parameters are monitored from the engine room to prevent overloading the main engine or damaging machineries however there are few studies on the deliberate speed reduction in relation to the engine parameters as the emergency operation in rough sea voyages thus current conditions of engine operations in rough sea voyages are gathered by surveying marine engineers in japanese shipping companies details of speed loss are analyzed both from measured data and survey results this paper shows that the limiting value of vertical acceleration of a ship at the bridge is suitable to judge the deliberate speed reduction on the other hand limiting values of horizontal acceleration and roll motion are not consistent with the measured results different patterns were found for probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing and the speed was intentionally reduced when values became nonzero the study also shows that the engine parameters were affected by the speed loss finally simple models were constructed to estimate the deliberate speed reduction as the quadratic function of vertical acceleration or pitch motion these models can be applied to the numerical simulation of speed loss in rough sea voyages for accurate optimal ship routing 2 evaluation parameters for deliberate speed reduction in rough seas vertical and horizontal accelerations of the ship tend to increase during rough sea voyages when vertical or horizontal acceleration increases work difficulty of the ship crew occurs in the ship s bridge or engine room if the tides worsen strongly nonlinear phenomena such as deck wetness or slamming which pose danger to a ship may occur in addition strengthening of wind waves increases the added resistance these factors make it difficult to maintain the navigation speed even when the engine power is increased this is the typical pattern of natural speed loss because it begins to overload as the host ship tries to maintain its speed the main engine is usually maintained at a constant power studies related to natural speed loss began since the 1960s and various studies were conducted between 1970s and 1980s in europe japan etc aertssen 1967 analyzed voyage records in rough seas for cargo vessels and discussed the relation among speed loss slamming deck wetness and propeller racing ochi and motter 1974 and kim et al 1984 proposed vertical acceleration in fore peak as the criteria for estimating deliberate speed reduction in a container ship and kitazawa et al 1975 added to the studies roll motion from the viewpoint of work difficulty gerritsma 1984 derived these criteria for naval ships as well there are many other related studies that propose various criteria for natural speed loss nordforsk 1987 conducted an extensive survey on rough sea voyage for ship crews and summarized the relevant criteria against a cargo ship as shown in table 1 limit values of vertical acceleration at the ship s bridge and fore peak lateral acceleration at the bridge and roll motion are defined as their root mean square rms values slamming and deck wetness in terms of probability are evaluated as 2 5 and 5 0 a ship shifts from the natural speed loss to the deliberate speed reduction if either of them exceeds its limiting value because these criteria were derived from the documents or records available at that time there are few examples that fit long range continuous data measured by accurate sensors in actual seas most of the seafarers surveyed were permanent employees of flagships before the 1980s this implicates that they have been trained to mature their maneuvering technique in rough seas through long time experience the actions taken by these employees for ship handling during rough sea maneuvering are summarized below honda 1980 1 sound a warning if the drop rate of air pressure at the ship is 1 hpa per hour if the drop rate of air pressure is more than 2 hpa per hour the ship varies its heading for 180 to turn around its course 2 reduce speed as a countermeasure against deck wetness slamming hull damage collapse of cargo propeller racing seasickness etc for safety of the ship reducing the engine power of a ship to a level corresponding to the standby speed when the speed of the ship can no longer be increased beyond standby even if the engine is operating at full speed and power mode 3 make a decision to slow down with slamming or deck wetness 4 set the relative wave direction at 30 45 from the bow until the beaufort wind scale is 6 7 a ship should be at the bow quartering sea state because rough sea maneuvering is usually conducted under beaufort scale 8 the maneuvering difficulty can be seen in head sea state more than the beaufort scale 9 5 switch from autopilot to manual steering when roll and pitch motions of the ship increase however steering angles must be within 20 repeatedly avoiding large tides to prevent precarious situations that arise with large angle steering highly skilled maneuvering techniques are required for these ship handling actions those criteria could be decided on the premise of skilled seafarers ship crews have been replaced by foreign crews who were temporarily employed after the 1990s which makes academic operating systems such as optimal ship routing a necessity it is also necessary to validate the criteria for current seafarers to construct an accurate optimal routing system 3 survey of engine operations in rough sea voyages some parameters have been proposed in the previous section to evaluate deliberate speed reduction all of which can be experienced in the ship s bridge machinery parts of the main engine and shaft are also influenced by the rough sea conditions and it is necessary to know the engine operation related to tackling the rough sea condition however there are few studies focused on the relation between speed loss and engine parameters some intentional operations such as engine speed could be seen in the measured data it is necessary to find out the operational limits for marine engineers whether they have their own standards or not thus a nationwide questionnaire on current safety operations and standards in rough sea voyages for marine engineers was conducted questionnaires were sent to 140 japanese shipping companies and nearly half of them 71 companies responded the main questions are shown in table 2 analyzing which revealed some patterns responders are classified as shown in table 3 as shown here domestic ferries and cargo vessels are the main responders the types of propulsion systems is different for ferries and cargo vessels which are controllable pitch propeller cpp and fixed pitch propeller fpp the analyzed results of the answers to q1 q5 are summarized in figs 1 5 fig 1 shows that the responders encountered rough sea conditions mainly in the winter 49 and in the typhoon season from summer to fall 30 frequencies of the encounter are 0 6 times per year 31 7 12 times per year 18 and more than 12 times per year 18 etc this means that nearly 20 percent of responders experienced rough sea voyages at least once a month many ships reduced their speed as 60 90 of the navigation speed in fig 2 there are around 15 parameters marine engineers monitor during rough sea voyages in fig 3 the main monitoring parameters are the exhaust temperatures of cylinders 48 engine speed 33 fuel injection pump mark 32 engine power 27 revolution of blades in the turbocharger 26 etc other parameters are cooling fresh water temperature 14 boost air pressure 11 and automatic load control alc for ships with cpp 14 the resistance increases at the propeller due to external forces and it is transferred from the shaft to the main engine in these harsh weather conditions the ship performance worsens and the phenomenon of engine surging may also be triggered under such a situation the engine speed cannot be maintained and is actually very low this situation causes incomplete combustion in the main engine and the rising of exhausted gas temperatures in rough sea voyages the airflow between the main engine and turbo charger may be reversed unless the engine speed is reduced this is referred to as the surging phenomenon firstly fuel injection usually is shifted from automatic to manual control to reduce the volume of fuel injected the purpose of this operation is to gradually reduce the engine speed lowering engine load through deliberate speed reduction it is reasonable to monitor these parameters for this purpose in fig 4 the limiting value is decided from the performance curves of manufacturers 26 the empirical values defined from their experience 33 and the alc 10 for ships with cpp fig 5 shows that the slow down operation is decided when the monitoring value approaches the limiting value in the performance curves 25 ship motions or sea conditions become worse 15 the engine power approaches the criteria 11 the possibility of surging increases 10 the temperature of exhaust gas increases 8 communication with the captain 7 etc although many parameters are monitored in the engine room the final decision of deliberately decreasing speed is not made by the marine engineers alone this point is further surveyed through a visiting interview with a japanese shipping company in june 2018 the main points of the survey are summarized below 1 the employment of seafarers has changed since the 1980s and skilled seafarers with more experience are fewer in number today the maneuvering over rough seas discussed in section 2 cannot be applied for many of the current seafarers scientific support such as optimal ship routing must be simultaneously used in the ship operation 2 the chief engineer usually directs the captain to lower the loads when the engine power increases the captain then makes a decision about the emergency operation to be implemented by considering all the situations 3 it is ideal to reduce the engine speed ship speed right before entering turbulent waters it is said that the pitch motion especially in the container ship tends to reduce its ship speed the steering should be avoided as much as possible especially in the ballast condition 4 marine engineers monitor various parameters and report any abnormalities to the ship s bridge however they do not have the authority to make decisions independently the captain takes the final decision on the operation these comments are mostly consistent with the questionnaire result therefore each parameter shown in table 1 will be validated and at the same time the engine parameters will be analyzed in the next section 4 validation of survey results with onboard measured data 4 1 onboard measured data in actual sea the validity of parameters discussed in previous sections is considered for the measured data of the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in actual seas sasa et al 2015 sasa et al 2017 lu et al 2017 the measurement was conducted from july 2010 to august 2016 with periods of missing data in between because of mechanical troubles main dimensions of the 28 000 dwt bulk carrier are shown in table 4 the measurement system consists of the voyage data recorder and the engine data logger and these data are transmitted to the integrated bridge satellite system ibss for establishing communication between ship and ground station here two laptops are connected with the ibss to collate navigation data such as position speed course steer angle wind direction and speed etc and engine data such as engine speed shaft thrust engine power exhaust gas temperature revolution of blades in the turbocharger etc which are recorded every 1 0 s ship motions and accelerations are measured by an inertial measurement unit nav440 that records measured results every 0 1 s it is necessary to estimate the wave conditions which are numerically estimated by wave watch iii a third generation global wave model tolman 2002 the model computes for the global region using the two way nesting technique the condition is defined by the outer region of 0 5 and the inner region of 0 1 global wind information is required for the computation with two types of reanalysis database ncep fnl distributed from the ncep national centers for environmental prediction kalnay et al 1996 which is based in the usa and the era interim distributed from the ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 which is based in europe three types of wind data are defined as the input of wave watch iii as shown in table 5 the ncep method defines wave estimation using ncep fnl with a spatial resolution of 1 0 and interpolates linearly to 0 5 and 0 1 the era method defines wave estimation using era interim with a spatial resolution of 0 75 and interpolates linearly to 0 5 and 0 1 the wrf method defines wave estimation using wind conditions computed by the wrf shamarock et al 2008 the regional air model for the ncep fnl three types of wave information are used to calculate probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing respectively the ship trajectory from february to october 2013 is shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure the bulk carrier has been mainly cruising in the southern hemisphere through the indian ocean the atlantic ocean the tasman sea and the pacific ocean three rough sea voyages are selected for the validation as shown in table 6 as shown in fig 6 cases a and b are on the same trajectory from china to uruguay with the half loaded condition the ship encountered rough seas offshore the african and south american continents case c embarks on a rough sea voyage from australia to new zealand with the ballast condition estimated wave heights at the ship positions in each case are shown from figs 7 9 lu et al 2017 the maximum value of significant wave height for case a in june 3 is 5 7 m and this is the roughest wave condition among the three cases wave heights for case b in june 15 are 4 5 m for case c from march 15 to march 17 they are 3 5 m and the wave direction varies from head sea state to following state larger ship motions in pitch and roll directions are generated with significant speed losses and detailed situations are analyzed for those cases 4 2 analysis method of measured data if a ship encounters turbulent sea conditions the added resistance is considered as a function of wave height wave period wave direction wind speed and wind direction the added wave resistance is a time averaged value of the longitudinal second order hydrodynamic force which can be analyzed by the seakeeping theory kashiwagi 1991 1992 the ship speed is then decided as a relation of the following equations it is basically discussed for regular waves in frequency domain in case of irregular sea state the ship speed is decided by solving the following equations in frequency and time domain sasa et al 2017 1 β v x p y p z r 1 t t n v r s w v r a w χ ω h v r a w d ϕ u v 2 m m 11 ω d v d t β v x p y p z r 1 t t n v r s w v r a w χ ω h v r a w d ϕ u v where β v is the thrust deduction factor due to ventilation smogeli 2006 t is the thrust deduction fraction which reflects the ship s increase in resistance in calm waters due to working propulsion units such as the propeller t is the shaft thrust n is the revolution of the main engine and shaft no reduction gears in the ship v is the ship s speed r s w is the resistance of still water r a w is the added resistance from waves χ is the relative wave direction ω is the encounter frequency h is the significant wave height r a w d is the added resistance due to winds ϕ is the relative wind direction and u is the wind speed m is the ship s mass and m 11 is the added mass in surge mode if wave conditions become rougher the value of β v will decrease and the values of r a w and r a w d will increase remarkably in harsh sea conditions the thrust deduction is also evaluated in the following method faltinsen et al 1980 3 t 2 1 1 c t w p 1 w where w is the effective wake w p is the potential wake and c t is expressed as 4 c t 2 t n v ρ v a 2 π r 2 where ρ is the water density v a is the speed of advance r is the radius of propeller if the speed of advance decreases the value of t also decreases wave series have different amplitudes and periods for each component the added resistance in irregular waves can be approximated as a series of regular waves with different amplitudes and periods each regular wave is a combination of two neighboring waves of half wave length the zero up cross method is used to analyze the wave series eq 2 is numerically solved using the fourth order runge kutta method the speed loss can be estimated in eqs 1 and 2 in eq 1 the ship s speed v should be decreased to reduce r s w for the right hand term to be equivalent to the left hand term when the added resistances increase in rough sea conditions therefore the ship s speed v is controlled to decrease with the revolution n this is the typical mechanism of speed loss and the deliberate speed reduction is also added here an inertial measurement unit is installed at the ship s bridge and is evaluated as the root mean square 5 z b 1 n i 1 n z b r i 2 6 y b 1 n i 1 n y b r i 2 7 x b 1 n i 1 n x b r i 2 8 x r s 1 n i 1 n x r b r i 2 where z b y b and x b are the root mean square values of the vertical lateral and longitudinal accelerations x rs is the root mean square of roll motion z b r i y b r i and x b r i are the i th amplitudes of accelerations in the vertical lateral and longitudinal directions x r b r i is the i th amplitude of roll motion n is the amplitude number the volume of data should be large enough to obtain statistically stable results the relative wave direction should be constant in each data unit according to the former research sasa et al 2017 the relative wave direction varies every 10 30 min in rough sea conditions therefore the data unit length is defined as 10 min statistical accuracy is shown to be almost constant for this data period lu et al 2017 the amplitudes are obtained from measured time series using the zero up crossing method probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing are defined below 9 p d w p z r f p h f 10 p s p z r f p d f z r f p v c 11 p p r p z r a p d p where p dw p s and p pr are the probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing respectively h f is the vertical height between the water surface and the deck d f is the draft forward of the ship and d p is the vertical distance between the water surface and the propeller if the water surface is below one third of the propeller diameter from the top then propeller racing will occur z r fp and z r ap are the relative water surfaces in the fore peak and aft peak defined as 12 z r f p t x h t ℓ x x p t ζ 0 t 13 z r a p t x h t ℓ x x p t ζ 0 t where x h t and x p t are heave and roll motions ζ 0 t is the free surface of water elevation under the ship ℓ x and ℓ x are the longitudinal distances from the center of gravity to the fore peak and the aft peak respectively the inertial measurement unit does not output the heave motion which is obtained as follows 14 x h t i 1 n f 2 s h ω i δ ω cos ω i t ε i where s h ω is the frequency spectrum of heave motion ω is the angular frequency ε is the phase and nf is the number of wave components the spectrum of heave motion can be obtained as the integration of vertical acceleration at the center of gravity 15 s h ω s z ω ω 4 where s z ω is the frequency spectrum of vertical acceleration at the center of gravity and its value is set as a constant of s z 0 125 for ω 0 125 rad s the free surface ζ 0 t is defined as 16 ζ 0 t i 1 n d j 1 n f 2 d w ω i θ i δ θ δ ω cos ω i t ε i where d w ω θ is the directional spectrum of the wave which is obtained from the wave simulator wave watch iii in eq 17 v c is the vertical speed of impact on the water surface with the bow part of ship ochi s formula is used here as 17 v c 0 08 0 11 g l where g is the acceleration due to gravity and l is the length of the ship those parameters are computed every 10 min of the measured data and are compared with the criteria given in table 1 parameters in the engine room are also analyzed as a 1 min average value relations of these parameters with deliberate speed reduction are analyzed in later subsections 4 3 analyzed results of onboard measured data measured data of ship motions accelerations the ship s speed etc are analyzed and compared with the criteria of earlier studies in each case 1 case a variations of z b y b x b and x r s are analyzed in june 1 3 2013 as shown in fig 10 the criteria for each parameter are represented by the red line in the figure to compare variations of the ship s speed over the ground and engine speed per minute in rpm are shown in fig 11 in fig 10 the value of z b increases significantly from approximately 40 h and exceeds the criteria 0 15 g the value of x b also approaches the criteria of lateral acceleration 0 12 g from approximately 40 50 h this tendency is similar to that of the vertical acceleration with pitch motion significantly influencing it values of lateral acceleration and roll motion exceed the criteria 0 12 g and 6 in most of the periods as shown in fig 11 the ship s speed increases once to 18 knots in 12 20 h before the speed loss occurs this might be influenced by the agulhas current which is a strong current off the coast of south africa the ship reduces its speed from 14 knots to 12 knots to save fuel the marginal speed loss can be seen at approximately 30 h while the engine speed is still constant the reductions in the ship s speed and engine speed obviously occur at the same time after 40 h which is almost the same time at which the vertical acceleration in the bridge exceeded the criteria of 0 15 g it can be assumed that the speed loss from 24 to 40 h is natural and that after 40 h is deliberate however the lateral acceleration and the roll motion are not consistent with the timing of deliberate speed reduction the increased steering after 40 h helps maintain the ship s course and it sail in head waves although this maneuvering leads to an increase in fuel consumption the roll motion can be effectively controlled they also increase remarkably after 60 h and have very similar variations meaning that a time difference of 20 h can be observed between the vertical and lateral motions it is thought that measured results agree with the criteria in longitudinal motions but not with that in lateral motions fig 12 shows the total rudder angles in port and starboard as an integrated value per minute and the averaged variation of ship s heading the amount of steering increased once at approximately 36 h which is a few hours before the significant reduction in the ship s speed and engine speed it increases after 40 h and the possibility of intentional steering can be thought to vary with the relative wave direction however the details are still unclear relative water surfaces at the fore peak and the probabilities of deck wetness are summarized in each wave estimation method era ncep and wrf as shown in fig 13 the relative water surface is the smallest in the era method and the largest in the wrf method red lines in the figure indicate the height of the deck from the water surface 5 57 m and the deck wetness can occur if the relative water surface exceeds this height the probability is evaluated as the number of exceedances per hour the probability begins to yield positive values after 40 h for three methods and this is the same timing of the reduction of the ship s speed and engine speed and the exceedance of the criteria of vertical acceleration the probabilities are 1 3 after 50 h which is still less than the criteria of deck wetness 5 the criteria are inconsistent with the measured result of speed loss for case a the probability of slamming is computed as shown in fig 14 the probability is extremely low the maximum value is 0 5 2 0 at approximately 50 h because the ship is in the half loaded condition there are no results exceed the criteria of slamming 2 5 for case a the relative water surface and the probability of propeller racing is computed as shown in fig 15 red lines in the figure show the vertical distance between the water surface and the height of one third of the propeller diameter from the top d p the propeller racing begins at approximately 40 h which is almost the same timing as the occurrence of deck wetness and the lowering of the ship s speed and engine speed these results indicate that the ship captain intentionally reduces its speed at the start of deck wetness and propeller racing and do not agree with the probabilities shown in table 1 this is consistent with the survey results in section 2 2 case b variations in z b y b x b and x r s are analyzed for june 14 17 2013 as shown in fig 16 variations in the ship s speed and engine speed for the same period are summarized in fig 17 from fig 16 it is obvious that the value of z b increases and exceeds the criteria of 0 15 g from 24 h and its maximum value is approximately 0 3 g which is similar to that in case a the values of x b are less than the criteria of 0 12 g while the values of y b exceed the criteria of 0 12 g during the period the value of x r s varies at the same timing with the vertical acceleration the speed loss and reducing engine speed can be observed from 24 h and they can be seen almost at the same timing thus deliberated speed loss could have occurred from 24 h in this case the range of speed loss and engine speed is 4 5 knots and 3 rpm respectively and they are smaller than those in case a it is necessary to consider the reason for the difference of speed loss despite the similar trends of vertical acceleration variations of the total rudder angles and the ship s heading are summarized in fig 18 it is obvious that the degree of steering has increased during the period of 24 60 h and the ship s heading has been varied for 80 from 42 to 54 h during this period it can also be seen that vertical and longitudinal accelerations have decreased significantly in fig 16 a description of the difficulty of maintaining the course is recorded in the logbook at that time which presents the need for an intentional maneuver to avoid the very harsh head sea state as the vertical motions have been reduced a strong current exists offshore the south african continent besides the high tides which lead the ship with larger steering angles larger angles should be avoided for safety as mentioned in section 2 as a result of this steering accelerations are significantly reduced and the ship s speed and engine speed are recovered in the case relative water surfaces and probabilities of deck wetness are summarized for three methods as shown in fig 19 in this case too the relative water surface is the smallest in the era method and the largest in the wrf method probabilities begin to climb above zero from approximately 30 h which is a few hours after the speed loss has occurred and is the close to the timing of the vertical acceleration the ship s speed and the engine speed however the probability is around 1 in this case which is nearly half of that in case a the difference of probability may have a relation with the difference of speed loss probabilities of slamming for three methods are summarized in fig 20 the maximum probability is 0 3 which means that slamming has not occurred significantly the relative water surface is less for 2 4 m than those in case a which is one of the reasons for the reduced speed loss relative water surfaces at the aft peak and probabilities of propeller racing are shown in fig 21 the figure shows that propeller racing also occurs at almost the same time as deck wetness does which is approximately 24 h and is consistent with the lowering of the ship s speed and engine speed the probability of propeller racing widely decreases at approximately 40 h and the lowering of longitudinal motions by varying wave directions strongly contributes to this result the probability of the propeller racing is 2 0 3 0 which is lower by 1 2 than those in case a a similar tendency is followed by the probability of deck wetness which can be used for the evaluation of deliberate speed reduction 3 case c in this case the ship is in the tasman sea between australia and new zealand from march 14 17 2013 in our previous study lu et al 2017 low pressure trough exists in the tasman sea with swells from the south pole it makes the wave conditions complex and causes the ship to alter its heading repeatedly and irregularly the loaded condition in this case is a near ballast one which is quite different from those in cases a and b variations in z b y b x b and x r s are analyzed for march 14 17 2013 as shown in fig 22 variations in the ship s speed and engine speed are also summarized for the same period as shown in fig 23 values of z b and x b increase remarkably in the time periods of 24 34 h and 40 55 h after 30 h the vertical acceleration exceeds the criteria of 0 15 g the longitudinal acceleration follows a similar tendency as that of z b the lateral acceleration exceeds the criteria 0 12 g during the period the roll motion exceeds the criteria of 6 0 in the time period of 24 72 h it is obvious that the ship s speed and engine speed follow a decreasing trend from 24 h which is nearly the same time as the vertical acceleration as shown in fig 23 these patterns are similar to those in cases a and b the ship proceeds at 14 knots initially and slows down to approximately 8 knots the speed loss in this case is deliberate variations in the total rudder angle per minute and the ship s heading are summarized in fig 24 large steering angles 1500 2000 min are repeatedly used after 30 h and this makes the value of z b decrease in the time period from 34 to 44 h however the value of z b increases again after 44 h when the ship has altered its course to the east although speed loss occurs again in this situation it must be natural as the engine speed is constant the abnormal drop in engine speed by more than 60 rpm occurs at approximately 33 h right after the second steering with large angle has begun this phenomenon is not regarded as natural speed loss because the engine trouble seems to occur as the result of the emergency operation in the rapid change of sea state as mentioned large steering angles are not recommended especially in the ballast condition this could induce massive loads on the main engine through the propeller shaft causing propeller racing which in turn could trigger the main engine to stop as an emergency action the main engine resumes 4 min after the suspension which is a dangerous situation in rough sea voyages relative water surfaces at the fore peak and probabilities of slamming are summarized as shown in fig 25 probabilities of slamming are 2 5 3 5 at the maximum which are close to the probabilities of deck wetness in case a as seen in fig 23 although the maximum value exceeds the criteria in table 1 deliberate speed reduction occurs at approximately 24 h which is almost the same time when the possibility of slamming becomes nonzero relative water surfaces at the aft peak and the probabilities of propeller racing are summarized in fig 26 probabilities of propeller racing are much higher than those in cases a and b because of the ballast condition in fig 26 propeller racing becomes a nonzero from 24 h and increases remarkably thereafter the maximum value reaches approximately 20 near 30 h which is a few hours before the abnormal drop in engine speed it is shown that the limiting value of vertical acceleration corresponds to the deliberate speed reduction however limiting values of lateral acceleration and roll motion do not necessarily agree with the timing of the speed loss it is also shown that the probabilities of slamming and propeller racing can be used to evaluate the occurrence of deliberate speed reduction at the point where they start to increase from zero 4 4 analysis of engine parameters in rough sea voyages the criteria applicable in the ship s bridge which have been proposed in earlier studies were validated in the previous section while in rough sea voyages the increased resistance to a ship s motion is transmitted to the main engine via the propeller shaft this sometimes causes engine overload incomplete combustion and surging phenomenon in the turbocharger which are dangerous to ships thus marine engineers monitor various parameters and reduce fuel injection to intentionally lower the engine load here variations in engine parameters are analyzed to identify their relation with speed loss the analyzed parameters are fuel pump mark fuel injection per second engine power exhaust gas temperature of cylinder shaft thrust revolution of blades in the turbocharger etc 1 case a fig 27 shows the variations of fuel pump mark engine power exhausted gas temperatures ship thrust and revolution of blades in the turbocharger as 1 min average values from june 1 3 2013 similar variations can be seen in the fuel pump mark engine power shaft thrust and revolution of blades in the turbocharger in the figure they increased once at approximately 20 h and reverted to the previous values although there are no remarkable fluctuations in vertical acceleration at that time the gradual speed loss for 2 knots occurs this operation is thought to prevent speed loss through the added resistance engine speed has been almost constant from 20 to 40 h except for a temporary rise in automatic multiplication once a day the engine power becomes a constant after it has slightly decreased at approximately 40 h when both the ship s speed and engine speed have reduced in the figure it is obvious that the temperature of no 5 and no 3 are higher in all the cylinders reasons the exhaust gas temperature is higher include 1 overload 2 delay in fuel injection 3 incomplete fuel spray 4 early opening of exhaust valve and 6 soot in air pipe hasegawa 2010 although it is difficult to identify the exact reason in these cases there is a possibility that any of them can affect the temperature decided from the viewpoint of safe engine operation the risk of incomplete combustion in this case becomes apparent because of the rise in exhaust gas temperature or engine overload when the power is increased more than that in the 40 h case the alarming increase in added resistance makes it impossible to maintain the ship s speed the ship s speed is intentionally reduced to avoid the additional increase in exhaust gas temperature which helps to maintain the safety of the main engine the decision to cause a deliberate speed reduction can be decided at approximately 40 h if marine engineers attempt to prevent engine overload and incomplete combustion by monitoring those parameters the deck wetness and the main engine overload occur at almost the same timing 2 case b fig 28 shows the variations in fuel pump mark engine power exhausted gas temperatures ship thrust and revolutions of the turbo charger as 1 min average values from june 14 to 17 2013 there are similar variations in the fuel pump mark the engine power the shaft thrust and the revolution of blades in the turbocharger as the same with case a although they once decrease at the same timing with the ship s speed and the engine speed they have been increasing until 40 h gradually this pattern is quite different from that in case a it implicates that the added resistance is smaller than that in case a and the ship can increase engine power here after 40 h engine parameters decrease so much because the relative wave direction varies by the steering with large angles this is a typical pattern of avoiding the overload of main engine by steering with larger angles 3 case c fig 29 shows variations of fuel pump mark the engine power the exhausted gas temperatures the ship thrust and the revolution of blades in the turbocharger as 1 min average values from march 14 to 17 2013 similar patterns can be seen in fuel pump mark engine power shaft thrust and the revolution of in the turbocharger these values have been decreased rapidly for 4 min at approximately 30 h this occurs at the same time as the larger steering angle and the abnormal situation is caused by steering in rough seas it is common for a ship to choose the larger steering angles to change the wave direction as in case b however this operation puts the ship in a precarious situation for this reason deceleration operations should be conducted in the early stages and avoid large steering angles as much as possible 4 frequency property of engine parameters as discussed in section 3 the analysis of frequency property of an engine operation is important for rough sea voyages this is analyzed for the measured data via a fast fourier transformation fft algorithm according to the questionnaire time periods of the emergency operation range from several minutes to an hour or so data length is set as 6 h with the sampling time at 1 s for the fft analysis the spectra of engine speed fuel pump mark revolution of blades in the turbocharger and ship speed are shown for the calm sea state in may 12 2013 and the rough sea state in june 3 2013 in figs 30 and 31 in fig 30 peaks can be observed from 0 005 to 0 008 hz 125 200 s for the spectrum of engine speed in the calm sea state similar peaks can be seen in the spectrum in the rough sea state on the right hand side too this frequency range corresponds to the autopilot steering frequency there are two different spectrum shapes in the figures on the left representing the instant when the ship automatically accelerates from 12 to 14 knots the ship then decelerates from 14 knots the navigation full speed to conserve fuel and it is necessary to increase the speed for the soot blow at the funnel once a day in fig 31 strong peaks appear around 0 1 hz 10 s in all types of spectra it is obvious that they are components influenced by ship motions on the waves furthermore strong peaks appear from 0 001 to 0 002 hz 500 1000 s it is shown that the main period of emergency engine operations ranges from 10 min to 1 h peak frequencies measured from 0 001 to 0 002 hz are similar to those of the period of emergency engine operations this indicates that the results of the questionnaire can be validated with the analyzed results of measured data it is shown that three types of periods exist in the variations of engine parameters a approximately 10 15 s due to ship motions on waves b 125 200 s due to autopilot or manual steering c 500 1000 s due to emergency operations to decelerate it is shown that components of a and c add to b in rough sea voyages and these parameters can be estimated as the summation of the frequency components corresponding to these three types of time periods 5 results and discussion the probabilities of deck wetness slamming and propeller racing can be effective measures to evaluate deliberate speed reduction in previous studies speed loss occurs before the probabilities reach their limiting values of 2 5 or 5 however speed loss occurs right after the probabilities have exceeded zero and its range depends on the values of these probabilities the difference with the current seafarers might influence the analyzed results of deliberate speed reduction first correlations between the pitch motion and probabilities of deck wetness and propeller racing are analyzed estimation formulas are established and validated against measured data second relations between the speed loss and probabilities are analyzed the speed loss properties are considered with the analyzed results correlations are obtained from the measured results of cases a and b but case c is excluded from the calculation due to the difference of loaded conditions and few number of data these results are only validated for the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier the applicability for other types of ships should be considered using a measurement database in future studies it is obvious that the probabilities of deck wetness and propeller racing should be estimated from the pitch motion thus the following formula is modeled as a simple quadratic curve 18 prob 0 0 x p s b a x p s b 2 b x p s where prob is the probability of deck wetness or propeller racing and x ps is the pitch motion it is characteristic of the probabilities to be zero from the origin to a certain value in the x axis and the value rapidly increases as nonlinear functions in eq 18 the boundary point b is defined as 2 5 for the pitch motion the value of b is decided when the determinant coefficient is the highest the most fitting with measured data in several values the relations between probabilities of deck wetness propeller racing and pitch motion are shown in figs 32 and 33 the probability of deck wetness has high correlations of 0 836 0 829 and 0 824 with the pitch motion there are also higher correlations with respect to the probability of propeller racing 0 891 0 888 and 0 873 that is approximately 0 9 probabilities are almost zero when the pitch motion is less than 2 5 3 0 where deliberate speed reduction has not occurred yet these values rapidly increase from the boundary point and can be well fitted by the quadratic curves the coefficients of determination are 0 824 0 827 and 0 835 for the deck wetness and 0 880 0 912 and 0 896 for propeller racing this means that the probability of deck wetness and propeller racing tend to be proportionate with the square of pitch motion in a region above the boundary point of 2 5 3 0 relations between the speed loss and these probabilities are shown in figs 34 and 35 in these figures the speed loss δv is defined as δv 12 0 v it is obvious that the values of p dw and p pr are almost zero when δv 3 4 knots which is the boundary area they significantly increase in the region above the boundary area which is indicated by a dotted red circle however the plotted points appear to have large variability although the correlation coefficients are not very low that is they are 0 7 0 8 it seems necessary to accumulate more measured data in various sea and loading conditions to estimate the speed loss from probabilities of deck wetness or propeller racing relations between the speed loss and the main wave direction are shown in fig 36 the wave direction is defined as 0 for the head sea state and 180 for the following sea state speed loss greater than 4 knots is primarily observed at approximately 45 60 these speed losses are not commonly observed in the head sea state this implies that the ship empirically avoids the head sea or beam sea states this is the same as the rough sea maneuvering shown in section 2 in this situation the longitudinal motions were dominant with the speed loss which was not observed in the range of 90 180 as described in the seakeeping theory kashiwagi et al 2004 the relation between the speed loss and the pitch motion is analyzed as shown in fig 37 the correlation coefficient is 0 883 and the speed loss δv is fitted by eq 15 the coefficient of determination is 0 742 which is lower for 0 1 than for probabilities of deck wetness and propeller racing this uncertainty might be related on the complexity of deliberate speed reduction currently the analyzed results are still limited further analysis will be conducted to accurately evaluate the speed loss 6 conclusions this study analyzes and evaluates speed loss during rough sea voyages and reproduces the validity of previous studies for a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in rough sea conditions the limiting value of vertical acceleration shows nearly the same timing as the measured result on the other hand the limiting values of lateral acceleration or roll motion are smaller than the measured result although the limiting values of the probabilities of deck wetness or slamming are defined as 2 5 or 5 deliberate speed reduction occurs at the point when the probability exceeds zero initial stage of deck wetness slamming or propeller racing detailed variations of engine parameters are summarized in rough sea voyages and they have very similar time varying properties there are two patterns of engine operations at the point where natural speed loss switches on to the deliberate speed reduction one is making fuel injection rate constant after increasing it to maintain engine speed as shown in case a the second one is making fuel injection rate constant after it has decreased once due to the large steering angle as shown in case b it is also shown case c that steering sometimes causes temporary engine failure in turbulent sea conditions the frequency property of engine operations was analyzed and additional peaks around 10 s and 500 1000 s were observed due to ship motions and intentional handling of machines in rough sea voyages besides the frequency of autopilot being approximately 125 200 s these time periods of operations could affect the deliberate speed reduction and agree with the results of the questionnaire the correlation coefficients are high 0 82 0 89 between the pitch motion and the probabilities of deck wetness or propeller racing the simple estimations are modeled as the quadratic curves which have a high coefficient of determination 0 82 0 91 it confirms that the probabilities of deck wetness or propeller racing can be expressed as a quadratic function of pitch motion when the amount of speed loss is discussed the probability of deck wetness or propeller racing is almost zero in δv 3 4 knots this implies that deliberate speed reduction may occur when the speed loss exceeds 3 4 knots there are some dispersions between the speed loss and the probabilities for δv 3 4 knots the speed loss for δv 3 4 knots occurs when the main wave direction is approximately 45 from the bow considering the influence of the longitudinal motions they have a relatively good correlation with measured the speed loss however the coefficient of determination decreases to 0 742 this may be caused by the uncertainty of speed loss including the deliberate speed reduction the criteria for bulk carrier is mainly summarized as the 0 15 g of vertical acceleration at ship s bridge which is the same as the former study on the other hand the probability of deck wetness and propeller racing should be revised as 0 0 5 which corresponds with 3 of pitch motion it is also shown that the roll motion or lateral acceleration does not lead to the deliberate speed reduction very much a further analysis of the measured data must be conducted for different sea regions weather conditions loading conditions ship types etc based on this study the estimation of speed loss will be more accurate for the practical

22618,environmental contours are used to characterize multivariate natural hazards for the purpose of structural analysis and design they specify combinations of environmental variables for finding the maximum system response associated with a given exceedance probability appropriate modeling of the multivariate probability distribution of the environmental variables is fundamental for the computation of contours in this work a framework using copulas is presented for environmental contours of two linear variables such as wave height and peak spectral period conditioned on circular variables such as wave or wind direction a formulation using three dimensional vine copulas is discussed and adopted the advantage of the vine copula approach is the flexibility to model multivariate distributions using combinations of bivariate copulas that model pairwise dependencies between the environmental variables directionality effects on the environmental contours are analyzed considering the degree of association for given circular linear copula models and the dispersion in the circular distributions the formulation is then used for building directional environmental contours of metocean variables describing extreme sea states the methodology for the statistical modeling of the metocean variables is described and contours of significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed are obtained considering wave and wind directionality keywords environmental contours directionality effects circular linear metocean variables wind direction wave direction vine copulas 1 introduction environmental contours were developed to characterize multivariate natural hazards for structural design purposes winterstein et al 1993 an environmental contour defines combinations of possible values of environmental variables to be considered for finding the maximum structural response associated with a given exceedance probability or return period an advantage of using environmental contours is that the characterization of the natural hazard can be uncoupled from the structural response applications of environmental contours can be found in offshore earthquake and wind engineering see e g winterstein et al 1999 van de lindt and niedzwecki 2000 saranyasoontorn and manuel 2005 huseby et al 2013 huseby et al 2015 vanem and britner gregersen 2015 computing environmental contours requires a complete description of the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables for instance developing environmental contours of extreme sea states for the design of offshore facilities requires that the multivariate distribution of metocean variables such as significant or maximum wave height peak spectral period wind velocity or current velocity be specified the joint probability distribution may be expressed in terms of a set of conditional distributions of the environmental variables for instance the joint distribution of significant wave height h s and peak spectral period t p can be expressed in terms of the marginal distribution f h s and the conditional distribution f t p h s a significant amount of data is required for estimating the conditional distributions such requirement increases greatly with the problem dimension making its application more difficult in practical cases without having to introduce some independence assumptions another common approach is to estimate the marginal distributions of the environmental variables and the corresponding linear correlation coefficients which can then be used in the nataf model to assemble the multivariate probability distribution nataf 1962 liu and der kiureghian 1986 the statistical dependence between environmental variables has a significant influence on the environmental contours silva gonzalez et al 2013 focusing on a rigorous modeling of the dependence structure montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 developed a procedure for computing environmental contours using copulas and applied it to the case of metocean variables copulas are functions that link the marginal distributions of a set of random variables to their multivariate distribution nelsen 2006 a fundamental property of copulas is that they contain all the information on the stochastic dependence between the random variables it is currently known that the nataf model produces normal dependence structures defined by the gaussian copula lebrun and dutfoy 2009a copula theory has been applied in civil engineering to model natural hazards and for reliability assessment salvadori et al 2007 de michele et al 2007 goda 2010 tang et al 2013a 2013b vanem 2016 has investigated models for the joint distribution of significant wave height and zero crossing wave period considering families of copulas and evaluated their effect on environmental contours using a vine copula approach aas et al 2009 czado 2010 brechmann et al 2012 joe 2014 a procedure has been advanced by montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2016 in which bivariate copulas are employed for computing multivariate environmental contours involving more than two variables the vine copula approach has also been used for applications in hydrology pereira et al 2017 and environmental science jäger and morales nápoles 2017 the procedures for computing environmental contours using copula models have not yet considered the directionality of variables such as wind waves or current accounting for directional effects requires a formulation based on copula models for circular and linear variables let θ and x be a circular and a linear random variables with probability density functions f θ θ and f x x respectively the joint density function f θ x θ x can be assembled using a circular linear copula c θ x u v 1 f θ x θ x c θ x f θ θ f x x f θ θ f x x where c θ x u v is the copula density c θ x 0 v c θ x 1 v v 0 1 u f θ θ v f x x and f θ θ with fixed arbitrary origin f x x are the marginal distributions based on the family of so called copulas with quadratic section qs the following model has been proposed for circular linear variables nelsen 2006 garcía portugués 2013 2 c u v u v α sin 2 π u v 1 v where α is the copula parameter α 1 2 π 0 159 another copula model can be derived from the formulation proposed by johnson and wehrly 1978 for f θ x θ x 3 f θ x θ x 2 π g 2 π f θ θ f x x f

johnson and wehrly jw model is a particular case of eq 1 where c θ x u v 2 π g 2 π u v other models can be obtained using mixtures of copulas non parametric bernstein copulas or non parametric copulas with kernel functions nelsen 2006 garcía portugués 2013 carnicero et al 2011 2013 in this work a framework using copulas is presented for modeling directional environmental contours of two linear variables conditioned on a circular variable a three dimensional vine copula formulation is discussed and adopted the advantage of the vine copula approach is the flexibility to build multivariate distributions using combinations of bivariate copulas that model the pairwise dependence between environmental variables the influence of the degree of association between circular and linear variables as determined by their copula and of the dispersion of the circular probability distribution is examined first then the formulation is used for computing directional environmental contours of metocean variables describing extreme sea states the methodology for the statistical modeling of the metocean variables is described and contours of significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed are obtained accounting for wave and wind directionality 2 directional environmental contours using copulas let x x 1 x d denote a vector of linear environmental variables and θ a circular one which characterize a natural hazard for the assessment of a system response we are interested in computing the environmental contour of x x 1 x d conditional on a given value θ θ such directional contour is defined by the values of x x 1 x d in the physical space which are mapped from the values of a vector z in a reduced space of independent standard normal variables where z φ 1 λ e 1 ln 1 1 t r θ t r θ is the conditional return period given θ θ t r θ 1 1 exp λ e p f θ and p f θ is the conditional exceedance probability of the system response assuming a poisson occurrence of the hazard event with mean annual rate λ e the mapping from the physical to the reduced space is performed using rosenblatt s transformation rosenblatt 1952 4 f 1 θ x 1 θ e 1 f 2 1 θ x 2 x 1 θ e 2 f d 1 d 1 θ x d x 1 x d 1 θ e d where f i 1 i 1 θ x i x 1 x i 1 θ is the conditional distribution of x i given x 1 x 1 x i 1 x i 1 θ θ and e j φ z j j 1 d 1 φ being the standard normal distribution function only the environmental variables are considered to be uncertain whereas the system response is a deterministic function the set of transformations u i f i x i and u θ f θ θ where f i x i and f θ θ are the marginal distributions define a dependent uniformly distributed vector of random variables u 1 u d u θ on 0 1 d 1 provided the marginals are continuous the joint distribution function f x θ can be expressed as f x θ c f 1 x 1 f d x d f θ θ where c u 1 u d u θ is the copula the conditional marginal distributions of x in eq 4 can be calculated from see e g genest et al 2009 lebrun and dutfoy 2009b 5 f i 1 i 1 θ x i x 1 x i 1 θ c i 1 i 1 θ u i u 1 u i 1 u θ where 6 c i 1 i 1 θ u i u 1 u i 1 u θ i 1 c u 1 u i 1 1 u θ u 1 u i 1 u θ i 1 c u 1 u i 1 1 1 u θ u 1 u i 1 u θ rosenblatt s transformation in eq 4 can be expressed in terms of copulas as follows 7 u 1 c 1 θ 1 e 1 u θ u 2 c 2 1 θ 1 e 2 u 1 u θ u d c d 1 d 1 θ 1 e d u 1 u d 1 u θ once all u i components are determined the corresponding values of the conditional environmental contour given θ θ are calculated from x i f i 1 u i i 1 d for directional environmental contours describing extreme sea states consider now the case of two linear variables x y such as wave height or wind speed and a circular variable θ such as wave or wind direction from the first two expressions in eq 4 8 f x θ x θ e 1 9 f y x θ y x θ e 2 let c θ x y u v w be the trivariate copula of θ x and y and u f θ θ v f x x w f y y from eqs 5 and 6 we have 10 f x θ x θ c x θ v u c θ x u v u where c θ x u v c θ x y u v 1 hofert et al 2015 and 11 f y x θ y x θ c y x θ w u v where 12 c y x θ w u v 2 c θ x y u v w u v 2 c θ x y u v 1 u v 2 c θ x y u v w u v c θ x u v and c θ x u v 2 c θ x u v u v is the copula density of pair θ x as seen the conditional marginal distributions in eqs 8 and 9 necessary for building the contours require the tri variate copula of θ x and y c θ x y u v w to be known an alternative approach is to use a vine copula formulation in which multivariate distributions are constructed using bivariate copulas as building blocks the advantage of such an approach is the flexibility to assemble multivariate distributions through bivariate copulas that model the dependence between pairs of random variables and for which efficient estimation methods are available when all mutual pairwise dependencies are given with respect to a given variable the construction is called a canonical vine c vine if mutual dependencies are given for each variable after another the formulation is known as a d vine both of them are special cases of regular vines which comprise all possible pairwise decompositions for the tri variate case involving for instance variables θ x and y there is no difference between the c and the d vine formulations in the vine copula approach a conditional density f y x is expressed in terms of bivariate conditional copulas aas et al 2009 13 f y x c y x j x j f y x j f x j x j f y x j where x j is an arbitrarily selected component of vector x x j is x excluding such component and c y x j x j is a conditional bivariate copula density consider now the case of the two linear variables x y and the circular one θ from eq 13 14 f x θ x θ c θ x f θ θ f x x f x x 15 f y x θ y x θ c x y θ f x θ x θ f y θ y θ f y θ y θ and similarly to eq 14 16 f y θ y θ c θ y f θ θ f y y f y y since a vine copula formulation is being used eqs 14 16 involve three bivariate copulas the pairwise dependence between each linear variable and the circular one is defined by copulas c θ x f x x f θ θ and c θ y f y y f θ θ and c x y θ f y θ y θ f x θ x θ characterizes the dependence between the two linear variables conditional on the circular one the conditional marginal distributions of x and y given θ θ are 17 f x θ x θ c x θ v u c θ x u v u 18 f y θ y θ c y θ w u c θ y u w u and the marginal conditional distribution f y x θ y x θ can be expressed as joe 1996 19 f y x θ y x θ c x y θ f x θ x θ f y θ y θ f x θ x θ let 20 v θ f x θ x θ w θ f y θ y θ then 21 c y x θ w θ v θ c x y θ v θ w θ v θ and 22 f y x θ y x θ c y x θ w θ v θ notice that the arguments of copula c x y θ v θ w θ depend on the value of θ however the copula function itself does not depend on the conditioning value of θ this simplifying assumption is used in the vine copula formulation in order to decompose the multivariate distributions in terms of conditional bivariate copulas aas et al 2009 it is considered to be a good approximation and allows the flexibility of the procedure for constructing multivariate models brechmann et al 2012 for the computation of directional environmental contours it follows from eq 7 that 23 u 1 c x θ 1 e 1 u u 2 c y x θ 1 e 2 e 1 u and the contour coordinates in the physical space are then obtained from 24 x f x θ 1 u 1 θ y f y θ 1 u 2 θ 3 case study using theoretical models of copulas the proposed procedure was applied to compute 100 year directional contours using theoretical models of copulas two log normal linear variables x and y with mean equal to 1 and standard deviation equal to 0 2 were considered for the circular variable θ a von mises distribution was used with circular mean μ θ 0 and values of the concentration factor κ θ equal to 0 1 and 4 a description of the von mises distribution is given in appendix a the association structure of pair x y was modeled using a frank copula and kendall s tau equal to 0 5 two circular linear copula models were used for both θ x and θ y i the johnson and wehrly jw model with g given by the von mises pdf with mean μ 0 and values of the concentration factor κ 0 3 and 2 and ii the quadratic section qs model with values of parameter α equal to 0 05 and 0 159 when κ 0 and α 0 independent copulas are obtained four values of θ were considered 0 90 180 and 270 the parameters selected for the copulas models represent different degrees of association between the linear and circular variables plots of the copula densities for pairs θ x and θ y are presented in fig 1 the value of rank based correlation coefficient for circular linear variables d n analogous to spearman s ρ is also given in fig 1 for the copula models the definition of correlation coefficient d n is given below regarding the statistical modeling of metocean data see eqs 27 and 28 for comparison purposes fig 2 shows level curve plots of the jw and qs copula densities for a common value of d n 0 17 as seen copula densities exhibit significant differences in the dependence structure for a common degree of association given by d n fig 3 shows directional environmental contours for the case of statistical independence between the circular and linear variables also shown is the omnidirectional environmental contour calculated using the copula of pair x y contours obtained when copulas of pairs θ x and θ y are independent coincide for different directions θ and also coincide with the omnidirectional contour directional contours using the jw copula model are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a and b show the effect of the association structure contours of fig 4 a are similar to the case of independence since for κ 0 3 the copula does not introduce a significant degree of association between the variables the shapes and values of contours in fig 4 b for κ 2 are considerably different from the case of independence and illustrate the way in which the copula is modeling the dependence structure between the variables similar results on the effect of the association structure can also be observed when comparing fig 4 c and d and fig 4 e and f in fig 4 e and f the contours coincide for values of θ equal to 90 180 and 270 these results show the influence of the marginal distribution of θ in these cases the concentration factor around the circular mean μ θ 0 is quite large κ θ 4 thus for θ equal to 90 180 and 270 the pdf has very small values and the probability distribution remains practically constant in such domain to explain this further let us analyze the x component of the directional contours obtained from f x θ x θ examining the behavior of copula c x θ v u suppose that integration of the distribution function f θ θ starts from θ 0 let f θ 90 δ then f θ 270 1 δ and f θ 180 0 5 in the case of the jw copula model it can be shown that 25 c x θ v u υ 2 π u υ 2 π u v where 26 υ ϕ 1 2 π ϕ 2 i 0 κ j 1 i j κ sin j ϕ μ j given that u f θ θ then i for θ 0 u 0 c x θ v u υ 0 υ 2 π v ii for θ 180 u 0 5 c x θ v u υ π υ π 2 π v iii for θ 90 u δ c x θ v u υ 2 π δ υ 2 π δ v iv for θ 270 u 1 δ c x θ v u υ 2 π 1 δ υ 2 π 1 δ v the four cases i to iv are in general different and will yield different values for the x component of the contours as shown in fig 4 a 4 d however as the degree of concentration around the mean value becomes larger there will be a wider interval in the domain of the pdf of θ with very small ordinates in which the value of u f θ θ varies very little in this example when κ θ 4 δ approaches 0 5 and the same conditional copula c x θ v u is obtained for θ 90 180 and 270 which then results in the same values of the x component of the contours similar trends will be obtained for the y component and the contours will tend to overlap as seen in fig 4 e and f fig 5 shows directional contours using the qs copula model similarly to the jw case fig 5 a and b show the effect of the association structure contours in fig 5 a are similar to the case of independence since for α 0 05 the copula does not introduce a significant degree of association between the variables the differences between the contours in fig 5 b are related to the dependence structure considering that α 0 159 similar results on the effect of the association structure can be seen in fig 5 c and d notice that contours in fig 5 coincide for values of θ equal to 90 and 270 for the qs model the conditional copula c x θ is given by c v u v 2 π α cos 2 π u v 1 v thus i for θ 0 u 0 c x θ v u v 1 2 π α 1 v ii for θ 180 u 0 5 c x θ v u v 1 2 π α 1 v iii for θ 90 u δ c x θ v u v 2 π α cos 2 π δ v 1 v iv for θ 270 u 1 δ c x θ v u v 2 π α cos 2 π 1 δ v 1 v given that cos 2 π 1 δ cos 2 π δ the same conditional copula is obtained for cases iii and iv in this case this results from the symmetry of the marginal distribution of θ values of the x component of the contours will be equal for these directions similar conclusions can be drawn for the y component of the contours it can be noted that cases iii and iv can be generalized to any two directions say θ 1 and θ 2 such that θ 1 θ 2 360 fig 5 e and f further show that except for θ 0 the other three contours overlap which is due to the additional effect of the marginal distribution of θ when κ θ 4 the degree of concentration in the pdf is such that u 0 5 for θ 90 180 and 270 therefore as the same conditional copula c x θ v u is obtained for these three directions the corresponding x components of the contours are equal the same applies for the y components of the contours and these coincide 4 statistical modeling for metocean directional contours this section presents a general procedure for the statistical modeling of copulas between linear and circular metocean variables as well as for the estimation of the marginal distributions of the circular ones these procedures are applied using data from hindcast time series of tropical storms hurricanes and extra tropical events northers for a 41 year period from 1958 to 1999 for a site located in the gulf of mexico oceanweather inc 2006 these data have been used in previous studies montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 2016 silva gonzález et al 2013 the time series include data for significant wave height h s m peak spectral period t p s 10 m hourly wind speed w m s meteorological wind direction θ w and wave direction θ h in standard oceanographic convention θ w measures the direction from which wind originates and θ h is the direction towards which waves are travelling the circular variables are measured clockwise from the north the significant wave height data for extreme sea states are taken as those for which h s h s th provided h s at time t peak is a peak value within time window t peak δ t cluster and t peak δ t cluster smith 1989 using a de clustering time window δ t cluster 30 h and a threshold value h s th 4 5 m the threshold value used here comes from an analysis of extreme value data based on the pot approach ferreira and guedes 1998 and the time window is introduced for statistical independence of peak values montes iturrizaga et al 2012 the values of the associated environmental variables i e peak spectral period and 10 m hourly wind speed are taken as those occurring at the same time t peak as the peak values of significant wave height the total number of extreme events at the site is 48 thus the mean annual rate λ e 1 17 per year the calculations were carried out using r language r core team 2017 and some of its packages hofert et al 2015 agostinelli and lund 2013 venables and ripley 2002 4 1 assessment of correlation and association measures pearson correlation coefficients for pairs of environmental variables are listed in table 1 definitions of pearson correlation for pairs of circular circular and circular linear variables are given in appendix b table 2 shows rank based correlation coefficients for pairs of circular and linear variables these coefficients can be considered analogous to spearman s ρ suppose x i θ i i 1 n is ordered data such that x 1 x n and r 1 r n are the corresponding ranks of θ i θ n the rank based correlation coefficient is defined as mardia and jupp 2000 27 u n 24 t c 2 t s 2 n 2 n 1 where β i 2 π r i n t c i 1 n i cos β i and t c i 1 n i sin β i a scaled version of the coefficient in the range 0 1 is given by 28 d n a n t c 2 t s 2 where 29 a n 1 1 5 cot 2 π n 4 cot 4 π n i f n i s e v e n 2 sin 4 π n 1 cos π n 3 i f n i s o d d it can be seen from table 1 that the pearson coefficient between the circular variables is high this is in agreement with the data since as observed in fig 6 relative wind and wave directions cluster around a value close to π there is less correlation between the linear environmental variables and the directional ones nonetheless wind speed correlates better with wind and wave directions than the significant wave height in terms of rank based correlations results in table 2 indicate that the degree of association between the linear and the circular variables is not very large particularly for peak period and wave direction where the measure of association is about 0 01 this is also consistent with the data as seen in fig 6 most wind and wave directions are concentrated around a prevailing n to s direction similarly to the case of pearson correlation coefficients there is a higher degree of association for wind speed with wind and wave directions than for significant wave height regarding implications on modeling dependence one could expect that a model similar to an independent copula would be appropriate for peak period and wave direction 4 2 estimation of marginal distributions the following probability distributions were considered from montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 weibull three parameters for h s and lognormal for t p and w the parameter estimates and their corresponding standard deviations using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method are listed in table 3 for the circular variables θ w and θ h a von mises distribution was examined first table 4 shows the mle parameter estimates agostinelli and lund 2013 mardia and jupp 2000 harris 2015 the distributions have high concentration factors κ the estimates of κ have much lower variance than those of the circular mean for goodness of fit the watson test of uniformity for a circular distribution f can be applied using a transformed sample θ i 2 π f θ i where the original sample data is θ i i 1 n based on the ordered sample u i θ i 2 π the statistics u 2 is evaluated as follows see e g mardia and jupp 2000 30 u 2 i 1 n u i u i 1 2 n 1 2 2 1 12 n where u u 1 u n n the critical values for different levels of statistical significance can be found in mardia and jupp 2000 the uniformity test was applied to the estimated von mises distribution considering a 5 significance level results in table 5 show that values of statistics u 2 are greater than the critical value for both θ w and θ h hence the hypotheses that data comes from a uniform distribution or from the von mises distribution are both rejected non parametric distributions were estimated for the circular variables using a von mises pdf kernel taylor 2008 a bandwidth value equal to 35 was taken for the kernel and the goodness of fit test results shown in table 5 were obtained these indicate that the fitted distributions are consistent with the data at 5 significance level fig 6 a and b show rose diagrams for the circular data a large portion of the sample data is concentrated around the mean values fig 6 c and d show the empirical and the estimated probability distributions visual inspection also indicates that a better fit of the data is obtained with the estimated non parametric distributions 4 3 estimation of copula models for a detailed analysis of the estimation of bivariate copulas for metocean data the reader is referred to montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 2016 the estimation of copulas under the vine approach proceeds as follows 1 calculate the pseudo observations of x y and θ based on the sample data 2 estimate copulas c θ x and c θ y applying the method of maximum pseudo likelihood genest et al 1995 3 obtain the conditional copulas c x θ and c y θ from eqs 17 and 18 and 4 calculate samples of the conditional cumulative distribution functions f x θ x i θ i and f y θ y i θ i obtain the corresponding pseudo observations and estimate copula c x y θ notice that although the arguments in c x y θ depend on the value of θ as indicated in eqs 20 and 21 the conditional distributions f x θ x θ and f y θ y θ are non linear monotonically increasing transformations of x and y therefore under the independence assumption used in the vine approach estimating c x y θ is the same as estimating c x y for the unconditional data of the two linear variables such simplifying assumption is used for the benefit of simplicity however its appropriateness is not assessed here because of the lack of sufficient extreme value data at the site it could be examined in future works as more information on extremes becomes available from hindcast time series or for other sites where large data samples may be available montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 examined the use of the frank gaussian and gumbel families of bivariate copulas for modeling the pairwise dependence structure between significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed a detailed analysis of measures of association rank based methods for estimation of copulas such as pseudo maximum likelihood and inference from the margins goodness of fit tests for copulas and copula selection criteria based on information theory is given in their study their results for the same hindcast data considered here indicated that these copula models could be applied for modeling the dependence structure between such linear environmental variables using the crámer von mises statistics based on empirical copulas and on the rosenblatt transformation these models showed to be consistent with the data at 5 significance level here we have used the frank copula for the pairs of linear variables h s t p and h s w provided it is a better model than the gaussian or gumbel ones as indicated by the results of the goodness of fit tests and the evaluation of the akaike and the bayesian information criteria fig 7 a shows the scatter plot of h s w in the u v space fig 7 b shows a comparison of environmental contours of h s w in the u v space using the empirical copula and the estimated frank model as seen the frank model can represent reasonably well the extreme value data from tropical cyclones and storms analyzed by montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 for such linear metocean variables at other sites in the gulf of mexico with different water depths or different exposures to the occurrence of tropical cyclones and storms or for other types of metocean data such as seasonal operational conditions other copula models could yield a better statistical fit alternative procedures such as the use of asymmetrical copulas vanem 2016 which can be constructed from combinations of symmetrical copulas could also be employed as needed to model the environmental data at the site of interest selecting the optimal copula among a variety of candidate models is beyond the scope of the application example presented here which illustrates the use of the proposed vine copula approach for the computation of directional environmental contours the maximum pseudo likelihood estimates of the frank copula parameters are 7 346 standard deviation equal to 1 195 for pair h s t p and 7 233 standard deviation equal to 1 126 for pair h s w for the pairs of circular linear variables two copula models are used 1 the jw model with function g given by a von mises pdf and 2 the qs model the estimated parameters using the r circular statistics package agostinelli and lund 2013 are listed in table 6 it is worth noting that the qs model parameter for t p θ h is the maximum possible value since α 1 2 π 0 159 see section 1 figs 8 and 9 show the densities of the estimated copulas a goodness of fit test based on empirical copulas and the cramér von mises statistics s n was used genest et al 2009 31 s n 0 1 d ℂ n 2 u d c n u where d is the copula dimension u u 1 u d in this case d 2 and therefore u u v ℂ n n c n c α n c n is the empirical copula and c α n is the parametric copula with estimated parameters α n the p

corresponding values of the empirical copula c n k 3 estimate the parametric copula c α n k 4 calculate the value of statistic s n k for each sample and 5 estimate the p value as the fraction of the number of simulations in which s n k s n table 7 shows the results of the goodness of fit tests for the jw and qs copula models none of the copula models is rejected at 5 significance level except only for the qs copula model of w θ h based on the minimum values of s n or the maximum p values the models that fit the data better can be identified from table 7 the jw copula model fits better the data for h s θ w w θ w and w θ h the qs model does so for t p θ w and for h s θ h t p θ h observe that for variables t p and θ w the estimated qs copula model shown in fig 8 d which yields the best fit is similar to the independent copula model as was anticipated in section 4 1 regarding the measures of association given in table 2 4 4 computation of directional contours directional environmental contours were calculated using the models from sections 4 1 to 4 3 the copula models that best fitted the data according to the results in table 7 were used the estimated non parametric marginal distributions of θ w and θ h were also used figs 10 and 11 show environmental contours of pairs h s t p and h s w conditional on θ w and θ h for return periods t r 100 and 500 years omnidirectional contours are included for comparison purposes in the case of wind direction θ w fig 10 shows that differences between directional and omnidirectional contours are relatively small it is seen that contours h s w are more sensitive to wind direction θ w than contours h s t p fig 11 shows that the effect of wave directionality is significantly greater it also shows that contours h s t p are now more sensitive to wave direction θ h than contours h s w take for example the 100 year h s t p contour in fig 11 a some of the observed differences between the omnidirectional and directional contours can be significant according to the omnidirectional contour h s is about 8m for t p around 15 5 s whereas from the directional contour for θ h 180 the significant wave height h s may be equal to 7 m or 10 5 m for the same t p the shapes and values of the contours are defined by the copula models and the marginal distributions of the circular variables given that the qs copula models were used for pairs h s θ h and t p θ h they fit the data better as indicated in table 7 the h s t p contours overlap for directions 90 and 270 as explained in section 3 furthermore since the value of the marginal distribution of θ h is approximately constant for the interval between 0 and 90 see fig 6 d then the contours for these two directions practically coincide as well fig 6 d shows that the marginal distribution of θ h rapidly increases to one around 180 being equal to 0 5 at 180 consequently the contours for directions around 180 are not only different but located progressively between the ones calculated for 90 and 180 as shown in fig 12 relevant differences can be observed in the h s t p contours between 150 and 180 for h s ranging from 8 m to 12 m and t p from 12 s to 16 s see fig 12 a although the variability with θ h is comparatively lower in the h s w contours noticeable differences can be observed too for example for h s between 10 m and 12m and w ranging from 18 m s to 22 m s 5 conclusions a framework using three dimensional vine copulas was presented for the computation of environmental contours of linear variables such as wave height peak spectral period or wind speed conditioned on circular variables such as wave and wind directions this vine approach facilitates the assembly of the multivariate probability distribution by means of bivariate copulas that model the pairwise dependence between the environmental variables a simplifying assumption under the vine approach is that the copula of a pair of linear variables is independent from the circular ones a parametric analysis was conducted in a case study using theoretical linear circular copula models and circular marginal distributions results showed that the following have a significant effect on the shapes and values of the directional environmental contours 1 the dependence structure of the linear circular variables as defined by a particular copula model 2 the degree of association between the circular and the linear variables depending on the values of the copula parameters and 3 the dispersion around the mean of the circular marginal distribution the results also showed considerable differences between omnidirectional contours where the linear circular copula model is the independent one compared to those where directionality is taken into account the vine copula formulation was used for computing metocean directional contours the methodological framework for the statistical modeling of metocean hindcast data was described in detail including estimation and goodness of fit for circular linear copulas and circular marginal distributions environmental contours of significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed depending on wind and wave directions were computed using the copula models and the marginal distributions that best fit the data results were easier to interpret in the light of observations from the parametric analysis in the theoretical case study contours of significant wave height and wind speed were found to be more sensitive to wind direction whereas contours of significant wave height and peak period were more so to wave direction there was greater variability in the contours conditioned on wave direction than those on wind direction differences in the order of up to 30 were found between omnidirectional contours and contours considering directionality of waves appendix a von mises distribution the von mises distribution for circular random variables has two parameters the circular mean μ 0 2 π and the concentration factor κ 0 around μ the probability density function pdf is defined as see e g mardia and jupp 2000 a 1 f θ θ e κ cos θ μ 2 π i 0 κ θ 0 2 π where i 0 κ 1 π 0 π e κ

22618,environmental contours are used to characterize multivariate natural hazards for the purpose of structural analysis and design they specify combinations of environmental variables for finding the maximum system response associated with a given exceedance probability appropriate modeling of the multivariate probability distribution of the environmental variables is fundamental for the computation of contours in this work a framework using copulas is presented for environmental contours of two linear variables such as wave height and peak spectral period conditioned on circular

wind speed are obtained considering wave and wind directionality keywords environmental contours directionality effects circular linear metocean variables wind direction wave direction vine copulas 1 introduction environmental contours were developed to characterize multivariate natural hazards for structural design purposes winterstein et al 1993 an environmental contour defines combinations of possible values of environmental variables to be considered for finding the maximum structural response associated with a given exceedance probability or return period an advantage of using environmental contours is that the characterization of the natural hazard can be uncoupled from the structural response applications of environmental contours can be found in offshore earthquake and wind engineering see e g winterstein et al 1999 van de lindt and niedzwecki 2000 saranyasoontorn and manuel 2005 huseby et al 2013 huseby et al 2015 vanem and britner gregersen 2015 computing environmental contours requires a complete description of the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables for instance developing environmental contours of extreme sea states for the design of offshore facilities requires that the multivariate distribution of metocean variables such as significant or maximum wave height peak spectral period wind velocity or current velocity be specified the joint probability distribution may be expressed in terms of a set of conditional distributions of the environmental variables for instance the joint distribution of significant wave height h s and peak spectral period t p can be expressed in terms of the marginal distribution f h s and the conditional distribution f t p h s a significant amount of data is required for estimating the conditional distributions such requirement increases greatly with the problem dimension making its application more difficult in practical cases without having to introduce some independence assumptions another common approach is to estimate the marginal distributions of the environmental variables and the corresponding linear correlation coefficients which can then be used in the nataf model to assemble the multivariate probability distribution nataf 1962 liu and der kiureghian 1986 the statistical dependence between environmental variables has a significant influence on the environmental contours silva gonzalez et al 2013 focusing on a rigorous modeling of the dependence structure montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 developed a procedure for computing environmental contours using copulas and applied it to the case of metocean variables copulas are functions that link the marginal distributions of a set of random variables to their multivariate distribution nelsen 2006 a fundamental property of copulas is that they contain all the information on the stochastic dependence between the random variables it is currently known that the nataf model produces normal dependence structures defined by the gaussian copula lebrun and dutfoy 2009a copula theory has been applied in civil engineering to model natural hazards and for reliability assessment salvadori et al 2007 de michele et al 2007 goda 2010 tang et al 2013a 2013b vanem 2016 has investigated models for the joint distribution of significant wave height and zero crossing wave period considering families of copulas and evaluated their effect on environmental contours using a vine copula approach aas et al 2009 czado 2010 brechmann et al 2012 joe 2014 a procedure has been advanced by montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2016 in which bivariate copulas are employed for computing multivariate environmental contours involving more than two variables the vine copula approach has also been used for applications in hydrology pereira et al 2017 and environmental science jäger and morales nápoles 2017 the procedures for computing environmental contours using copula models have not yet considered the directionality of variables such as wind waves or current accounting for directional effects requires a formulation based on copula models for circular and linear variables let θ and x be a circular and a linear random variables with probability density functions f θ θ and f x x respectively the joint density function f θ x θ x can be assembled using a circular linear copula c θ x u v 1 f θ x θ x c θ x f θ θ f x x f θ θ f x x where c θ x u v is the copula density c θ x 0 v c θ x 1 v v 0 1 u f θ θ v f x x and f θ θ with fixed arbitrary origin f x x are the marginal distributions based on the family of so called copulas with quadratic section qs the following model has been proposed for circular linear variables nelsen 2006 garcía portugués 2013 2 c u v u v α sin

johnson and wehrly jw model is a particular case of eq 1 where c θ x u v 2 π g 2 π u v other models can be obtained using mixtures of copulas non parametric bernstein copulas or non parametric copulas with kernel functions nelsen 2006 garcía portugués 2013 carnicero et al 2011 2013 in this work a framework using copulas is presented for modeling directional environmental contours of two linear variables conditioned on a circular variable a three dimensional vine copula formulation is discussed and adopted the advantage of the vine copula approach is the flexibility to build multivariate distributions using combinations of bivariate copulas that model the pairwise dependence between environmental variables the influence of the degree of association between circular and linear variables as determined by their copula and of the dispersion of the circular probability distribution is examined first then the formulation is used for computing directional environmental contours of metocean variables describing extreme sea states the methodology for the statistical modeling of the metocean variables is described and contours of significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed are obtained accounting for wave and wind directionality 2 directional environmental contours using copulas let x x 1 x d denote a vector of linear environmental variables and θ a circular one which characterize a natural hazard for the assessment of a system response we are interested in computing the environmental contour of x x 1 x d conditional on a given value θ θ such directional contour is defined by the values of x x 1 x d in the physical space which are mapped from the values of a vector z in a reduced space of independent standard normal variables where z φ 1 λ e 1 ln 1 1 t r θ t r θ is the conditional return period given θ θ t r θ 1 1 exp λ e p f θ and p f θ is the conditional exceedance probability of the system response assuming a poisson occurrence of the hazard event with mean annual rate λ e the mapping from the physical to the reduced space is performed using rosenblatt s transformation rosenblatt 1952 4 f 1 θ x 1 θ e 1 f 2 1 θ x 2 x 1 θ e 2 f d 1 d 1 θ x d x 1 x d 1 θ e d where f i 1 i 1 θ x i x 1 x i 1 θ is the conditional distribution of x i given x 1 x 1 x i 1 x i 1 θ θ and e j φ z j j 1 d 1 φ being the standard normal distribution function only the environmental variables are considered to be uncertain whereas the system response is a deterministic function the set of transformations u i f i x i and u θ f θ θ where f i x i and f θ θ are the marginal distributions define a dependent uniformly distributed vector of random variables u 1 u d u θ on 0 1 d 1 provided the marginals are continuous the joint distribution function f x θ can be expressed as f x θ c f 1 x 1 f d x d f θ θ where c u 1 u d u θ is the copula the conditional marginal distributions of x in eq 4 can be calculated from see e g genest et al 2009 lebrun and dutfoy 2009b 5 f i 1 i 1 θ x i x 1 x i 1 θ c i 1 i 1 θ u i u 1 u i 1 u θ where 6 c i 1 i 1 θ u i u 1 u i 1 u θ i 1 c u 1 u i 1 1 u θ u 1 u i 1 u θ i 1 c u 1 u i 1 1 1 u θ u 1 u i 1 u θ rosenblatt s

corresponding values of the conditional environmental contour given θ θ are calculated from x i f i 1 u i i 1 d for directional environmental contours describing extreme sea states consider now the case of two linear variables x y such as wave height or wind speed and a circular variable θ such as wave or wind direction from the first two expressions in eq 4 8 f x θ x θ e 1 9 f y x θ y x θ e 2 let c θ x y u v w be the trivariate copula of θ x and y and u f θ θ v f x x w f y y from eqs 5 and 6 we have 10 f x θ x θ c x θ v u c θ x u v u where c θ x u v c θ x y u v 1 hofert et al 2015 and 11 f y x θ y x θ c y x θ w u v where 12 c y x θ w u v 2 c θ x y u v w u v 2 c θ x y u v 1 u v 2 c θ x y u v w u v c θ x u v and c θ x u v 2 c θ x u v u v is the copula density of pair θ x as seen the conditional marginal distributions in eqs 8 and 9 necessary for building the contours require the tri variate copula of θ x and y c θ x y u v w to be known an alternative approach is to use a vine copula formulation in which multivariate distributions are constructed using bivariate copulas as building blocks the advantage of such an approach is the flexibility to assemble multivariate distributions through bivariate copulas that model the dependence between pairs of random variables and for which efficient estimation methods are available when all mutual pairwise dependencies are given with respect to a given variable the construction is called a canonical vine c vine if mutual dependencies are given for each variable after another the formulation is known as a d vine both of them are special cases of regular vines which comprise all possible pairwise decompositions for the tri variate case involving for instance variables θ x and y there is no difference between the c and the d vine formulations in the vine copula approach a conditional density f y x is expressed in terms of bivariate conditional copulas aas et al 2009 13 f y x c y x j x j f y x j f x j x j f y x j where x j is an arbitrarily selected component of vector x x j is x excluding such component and c y x j x j is a conditional bivariate copula density consider now the case of the two linear variables x y and the circular one θ from eq 13 14 f x θ x θ c θ x f θ θ f x x f x x 15 f y x θ y x θ c x y θ f x θ x θ f y θ y θ f y θ y θ and similarly to eq 14 16 f y θ y θ c θ y f θ θ f y y f y y since a vine copula formulation is being used eqs 14 16 involve three bivariate copulas the pairwise dependence between each linear variable and the circular one is defined by copulas c θ x f x x f θ θ and c θ y f y y f θ θ and c x y θ f y θ y θ f x θ x θ characterizes the dependence between the two linear variables conditional on the circular one the conditional marginal distributions of x and y given θ θ are 17 f x θ x θ c x θ v u c θ x u v u 18 f y θ y θ c y θ w u c θ y u w u and the marginal conditional distribution f y x θ y x θ can be expressed as joe 1996 19 f y x θ y x θ c x y θ f x θ x θ f y θ y θ f x θ x θ let 20 v θ f x θ x θ w θ f y θ y θ then 21 c y x θ w θ v θ c x y θ v θ w θ v θ and 22 f y x θ y x θ c y x θ w θ v θ notice that the arguments of copula c x y θ v θ w θ depend on the value of θ however the copula function itself does not depend on the conditioning value of θ this simplifying assumption is used in the vine copula formulation in order to decompose the multivariate distributions in terms of conditional bivariate copulas aas et al 2009 it is considered to be a good approximation and allows the flexibility of the procedure for constructing multivariate models brechmann et al 2012 for the computation of directional environmental contours it follows from eq 7 that 23 u 1 c x θ 1 e 1 u u 2 c y x θ 1 e 2 e 1 u and the contour coordinates in the physical space are then obtained from 24 x f x θ 1 u 1 θ y f y θ 1 u 2 θ 3 case study using theoretical models of copulas the proposed procedure was applied to compute 100 year directional contours using theoretical models of copulas two log normal linear variables x and y with mean equal to 1 and standard deviation equal to 0 2 were considered for the circular variable θ a von mises distribution was used with circular mean μ θ 0 and values of the concentration factor κ θ equal to 0 1 and 4 a description of the von mises distribution is given in appendix a the association structure of pair x y was modeled using a frank copula and kendall s tau equal to 0 5 two circular linear copula models were used for both θ x and θ y i the johnson and wehrly jw model with g given by the von mises pdf with mean μ 0 and values of the concentration factor κ 0 3 and 2 and ii the quadratic section qs model with values of parameter α equal to 0 05 and 0 159 when κ 0 and α 0 independent copulas are obtained four values of θ were considered 0 90 180 and 270 the parameters selected for the copulas models represent different degrees of association between the linear and circular variables plots of the copula densities for pairs θ x and θ y are presented in fig 1 the value of rank based correlation coefficient for circular linear variables d n analogous to spearman s ρ is also given in fig 1 for the copula models the definition of correlation coefficient d n is given below regarding the statistical modeling of metocean data see eqs 27 and 28 for comparison purposes fig 2 shows level curve plots of the jw and qs copula densities for a common value of d n 0 17 as seen copula densities exhibit significant differences in the dependence structure for a common degree of association given by d n fig 3 shows directional environmental contours for the case of statistical independence between the circular and linear variables also shown is the omnidirectional environmental contour calculated using the copula of pair x y contours obtained when copulas of pairs θ x and θ y are independent coincide for different directions θ and also coincide with the omnidirectional contour directional contours using the jw copula model are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a and b show the effect of the association structure contours of fig 4 a are similar to the case of independence since for κ 0 3 the copula does not introduce a significant degree of association between the variables the shapes and values of contours in fig 4 b for κ 2 are considerably different from the case of independence and illustrate the way in which the copula is modeling the dependence structure between the variables similar results on the effect of the association structure can also be observed when comparing fig 4 c and d and fig 4 e and f in fig 4 e and f the contours coincide for values of θ equal to 90 180 and 270 these results show the influence of the marginal distribution of θ in these cases the concentration factor around the circular mean μ θ 0 is quite large κ θ 4 thus for θ equal to 90 180 and 270 the pdf has very small values and the probability distribution remains practically constant in such domain to explain this further let us analyze the x component of the directional contours obtained from f x θ x θ examining the behavior of copula c x θ v u suppose that integration of the distribution function f θ θ starts from θ 0 let f θ 90 δ then f θ 270 1 δ and f θ 180 0 5 in the case of the jw copula model it can be shown that 25 c x θ v u υ 2 π u υ 2 π u v where 26 υ ϕ 1 2 π ϕ 2 i 0 κ j 1 i j κ sin j ϕ μ j given that u f θ θ then i for θ 0 u 0 c x θ v u υ 0 υ 2 π v ii for θ 180 u 0 5 c x θ v u υ π υ π 2 π v iii for θ 90 u δ c x θ v u υ 2 π δ υ 2 π δ v iv for θ 270 u 1 δ c x θ v u υ 2 π 1 δ υ 2 π 1 δ v the four cases i to iv are in general different and will yield different values for the x component of the contours as shown in fig 4 a 4 d however as the degree of concentration around the mean value becomes larger there will be a wider interval in the domain of the pdf of θ with very small ordinates in which the value of u f θ θ varies very little in this example when κ θ 4 δ approaches 0 5 and the same conditional copula c x θ v u is obtained for θ 90 180 and 270 which then results in the same values of the x component of the contours similar trends will be obtained for the y component and the contours will tend to overlap as seen in fig 4 e and f fig 5 shows directional contours using the qs copula model similarly to the jw case fig 5 a and b show the effect of the association structure contours in fig 5 a are similar to the case of independence since for α 0 05 the copula does not introduce a significant degree of association between the variables the differences between the contours in fig 5 b are related to the dependence structure considering that α 0 159 similar results on the effect of the association structure can be seen in fig 5 c and d notice that contours in fig 5 coincide for values of θ equal to 90 and 270 for the qs model the conditional copula c x θ is given by c v u v 2 π α cos 2 π u v 1 v thus i for θ 0 u 0 c x θ v u v 1 2 π α 1 v ii for θ 180 u 0 5 c x θ v u v 1 2 π α 1 v iii for θ 90 u δ c x θ v u v 2 π α cos 2 π δ v 1 v iv for θ 270 u 1 δ c x θ v u v 2 π α cos 2 π 1 δ v 1 v given that cos 2 π 1 δ cos 2 π δ the same conditional copula is obtained for cases iii and iv in this case this results from the symmetry of the marginal distribution of θ values of the x component of the contours will be equal for these directions similar conclusions can be drawn for the y component of the contours it can be noted that cases iii and iv can be generalized to any two directions say θ 1 and θ 2 such that θ 1 θ 2 360 fig 5 e and f further show that except for θ 0 the other three contours overlap which is due to the additional effect of the marginal distribution of θ when κ θ 4 the degree of concentration in the pdf is such that u 0 5 for θ 90 180 and 270 therefore as the same conditional copula c x θ v u is obtained for these three directions the corresponding x components of the contours are equal the same applies for the y components of the contours and these coincide 4 statistical modeling for metocean directional contours this section presents a general procedure for the statistical modeling of copulas between linear and circular metocean variables as well as for the estimation of the marginal distributions of the circular ones these procedures are applied using data from hindcast time series of tropical storms hurricanes and extra tropical events northers for a 41 year period from 1958 to 1999 for a site located in the gulf of mexico oceanweather inc 2006 these data have been used in previous studies montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 2016 silva gonzález et al 2013 the time series include data for significant wave height h s m peak spectral period t p s 10 m hourly wind speed w m s meteorological wind direction θ w and wave direction θ h in standard oceanographic convention θ w measures the direction from which wind originates and θ h is the direction towards which waves are travelling the circular variables are measured clockwise from the north the significant wave height data for extreme sea states are taken as those for which h s h s th provided h s at time t peak is a peak value within time window t peak δ t cluster and t peak δ t cluster smith 1989 using a de clustering time window δ t cluster 30 h and a threshold value h s th 4 5 m the threshold value used here comes from an analysis of extreme value data based on the pot approach ferreira and guedes 1998 and the time window is introduced for statistical independence of peak values montes iturrizaga et al 2012 the values of the associated environmental variables i e peak spectral period and 10 m hourly wind speed are taken as those occurring at the same time t peak as the peak values of significant wave height the total number of extreme events at the site is 48 thus the mean annual rate λ e 1 17 per year the calculations were carried out using r language r core team 2017 and some of its packages hofert et al 2015 agostinelli and lund 2013 venables and ripley 2002 4 1 assessment of correlation and association measures pearson correlation coefficients for pairs of environmental variables are listed in table 1 definitions of pearson correlation for pairs of circular circular and circular linear variables are given in appendix b table 2 shows rank based correlation coefficients for pairs of circular and linear variables these coefficients can be considered analogous to spearman s ρ suppose x i θ i i 1 n is ordered data such that x 1 x n and r 1 r n are the corresponding ranks of θ i θ n the rank based correlation coefficient is defined as mardia and jupp 2000 27 u n 24 t c 2 t s 2 n 2 n 1 where β i 2 π r i n t c i 1 n i cos β i and t c i 1 n i sin β i a scaled version of the coefficient in the range 0 1 is given by 28 d n a n t c 2 t s 2 where 29 a n 1 1 5 cot 2 π n 4 cot 4 π n i f n i s e v e n 2 sin 4 π n 1 cos π n 3 i f n i s o d d it can be seen from table 1 that the pearson coefficient between the circular variables is high this is in agreement with the data since as observed in fig 6 relative wind and wave directions cluster around a value close to π there is less correlation between the linear environmental variables and the directional ones nonetheless wind speed correlates better with wind and wave directions than the significant wave height in terms of rank based correlations results in table 2 indicate that the degree of association between the linear and the circular variables is not very large particularly for peak period and wave direction where the measure of association is about 0 01 this is also consistent with the data as seen in fig 6 most wind and wave directions are concentrated around a prevailing n to s direction similarly to the case of pearson correlation coefficients there is a higher degree of association for wind speed with wind and wave directions than for significant wave height regarding implications on modeling dependence one could expect that a model similar to an independent copula would be appropriate for peak period and wave direction 4 2 estimation of marginal distributions the following probability distributions were considered from montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 weibull three parameters for h s and lognormal for t p and w the parameter estimates and their corresponding standard deviations using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method are listed in table 3 for the circular variables θ w and θ h a von mises distribution was examined first table 4 shows the mle parameter estimates agostinelli and lund 2013 mardia and jupp 2000 harris 2015 the distributions have high concentration factors κ the estimates of κ have much lower variance than those of the circular mean for goodness of fit the watson test of uniformity for a circular distribution f can be applied using a transformed sample θ i 2 π f θ i where the original sample data is θ i i 1 n based on the ordered sample u i θ i 2 π the statistics u 2 is evaluated as follows see e g mardia and jupp 2000 30 u 2 i 1 n u i u i 1 2 n 1 2 2 1 12 n where u u 1 u n n the critical values for different levels of statistical significance can be found in mardia and jupp 2000 the uniformity test was applied to the estimated von mises distribution considering a 5 significance level results in table 5 show that values of statistics u 2 are greater than the critical value for both θ w and θ h hence the hypotheses that data comes from a uniform distribution or from the von mises distribution are both rejected non parametric distributions were estimated for the circular variables using a von mises pdf kernel taylor 2008 a bandwidth value equal to 35 was taken for the kernel and the goodness of fit test results shown in table 5 were obtained these indicate that the fitted distributions are consistent with the data at 5 significance level fig 6 a and b show rose diagrams for the circular data a large portion of the sample data is concentrated around the mean values fig 6 c and d show the empirical and the estimated probability distributions visual inspection also indicates that a better fit of the data is obtained with the estimated non parametric distributions 4 3 estimation of copula models for a detailed analysis of the estimation of bivariate copulas for metocean data the reader is referred to montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 2016 the estimation of copulas under the vine approach proceeds as follows 1 calculate the pseudo observations of x y and θ based on the sample data 2 estimate copulas c θ x and c θ y applying the method of maximum pseudo likelihood genest et al 1995 3 obtain the conditional copulas c x θ and c y θ from eqs 17 and 18 and 4 calculate samples of the conditional cumulative distribution functions f x θ x i θ i and f y θ y i θ i obtain the corresponding pseudo observations and estimate copula c x y θ notice that although the arguments in c x y θ depend on the value of θ as indicated in eqs 20 and 21 the conditional distributions f x θ x θ and f y θ y θ are non linear monotonically increasing transformations of x and y therefore under the independence assumption used in the vine approach estimating c x y θ is the same as estimating c x y for the unconditional data of the two linear variables such simplifying assumption is used for the benefit of simplicity however its appropriateness is not assessed here because of the lack of sufficient extreme value data at the site it could be examined in future works as more information on extremes becomes available from hindcast time series or for other sites where large data samples may be available montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 examined the use of the frank gaussian and gumbel families of bivariate copulas for modeling the pairwise dependence structure between significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed a detailed analysis of measures of association rank based methods for estimation of copulas such as pseudo maximum likelihood and inference from the margins goodness of fit tests for copulas and copula selection criteria based on information theory is given in their study their results for the same hindcast data considered here indicated that these copula models could be applied for modeling the dependence structure between such linear environmental variables using the crámer von mises statistics based on empirical copulas and on the rosenblatt transformation these models showed to be consistent with the data at 5 significance level here we have used the frank copula for the pairs of linear variables h s t p and h s w provided it is a better model than the gaussian or gumbel ones as indicated by the results of the goodness of fit tests and the evaluation of the akaike and the bayesian information criteria fig 7 a shows the scatter plot of h s w in the u v space fig 7 b shows a comparison of environmental contours of h s w in the u v space using the empirical copula and the estimated frank model as seen the frank model can represent reasonably well the extreme value data from tropical cyclones and storms analyzed by montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 for such linear metocean variables at other sites in the gulf of mexico with different water depths or different exposures to the occurrence of tropical cyclones and storms or for other types of metocean data such as seasonal operational conditions other copula models could yield a better statistical fit alternative procedures such as the use of asymmetrical copulas vanem 2016 which can be constructed from combinations of symmetrical copulas could also be employed as needed to model the environmental data at the site of interest selecting the optimal copula among a variety of candidate models is beyond the scope of the application example presented here which illustrates the use of the proposed vine copula approach for the computation of directional environmental contours the maximum pseudo likelihood estimates of the frank copula parameters are 7 346 standard deviation equal to 1 195 for pair h s t p and 7 233 standard deviation equal to 1 126 for pair h s w for the pairs of circular linear variables two copula models are used 1 the jw model with function g given by a von mises pdf and 2 the qs model the estimated parameters using the r circular statistics package agostinelli and lund 2013 are listed in table 6 it is worth noting that the qs model parameter for t p θ h is the maximum possible value since α 1 2 π 0 159 see section 1 figs 8 and 9 show the densities of the estimated copulas a goodness of fit test based on empirical copulas and the cramér von mises statistics s n was used genest et al 2009 31 s n 0 1 d ℂ n 2 u d c n u where d is the copula dimension u u 1 u d in this case d 2 and therefore u u v ℂ n n c n c α n c n is the empirical copula and c α n is the parametric copula with estimated parameters α n the p values are calculated as follows genest et al 2009 1 simulate n samples u i k k 1 n from the parametric copula c α n 2 obtain the pseudo observations for each sample u i k and calculate the corresponding values of the empirical copula c n k 3 estimate the parametric copula c α n k 4 calculate the value of statistic s n k for each sample and 5 estimate the p value as the fraction of the number of simulations in which s n k s n table 7 shows the results of the goodness of fit tests for the jw and qs copula models none of the copula models is rejected at 5 significance level except only for the qs copula model of w θ h based on the minimum values of s n or the maximum p values the models that fit the data better can be identified from table 7 the jw copula model fits better the data for h s θ w w θ w and w θ h the qs model does so for t p θ w and for h s θ h t p θ h observe that for variables t p and θ w the estimated qs copula model shown in fig 8 d which yields the best fit is similar to the independent copula model as was anticipated in section 4 1 regarding the measures of association given in table 2 4 4 computation of directional contours directional environmental contours were calculated using the models from sections 4 1 to 4 3 the copula models that best fitted the data according to the results in table 7 were used the estimated non parametric marginal distributions of θ w and θ h were also used figs 10 and 11 show environmental contours of pairs h s t p and h s w conditional on θ w and θ h for return periods t r 100 and 500 years omnidirectional contours are included for comparison purposes in the case of wind direction θ w fig 10 shows that differences between directional and omnidirectional contours are relatively small it is seen that contours h s w are more sensitive to wind direction θ w than contours h s t p fig 11 shows that the effect of wave directionality is significantly greater it also shows that contours h s t p are now more sensitive to wave direction θ h than contours h s w take for example the 100 year h s t p contour in fig 11 a some of the observed differences between the omnidirectional and directional contours can be significant according to the omnidirectional contour h s is about 8m for t p around 15 5 s whereas from the directional contour for θ h 180 the significant wave height h s may be equal to 7 m or 10 5 m for the same t p the shapes and values of the contours are defined by the copula models and the marginal distributions of the circular variables given that the qs copula models were used for pairs h s θ h and t p θ h they fit the data better as indicated in table 7 the h s t p contours overlap for directions 90 and 270 as explained in section 3 furthermore since the value of the marginal distribution of θ h is approximately constant for the interval between 0 and 90 see fig 6 d then the contours for these two directions practically coincide as well fig 6 d shows that the marginal distribution of θ h rapidly increases to one around 180 being equal to 0 5 at 180 consequently the contours for directions around 180 are not only different but located progressively between the ones calculated for 90 and 180 as shown in fig 12 relevant differences can be observed in the h s t p contours between 150 and 180 for h s ranging from 8 m to 12 m and t p from 12 s to 16 s see fig 12 a although the variability with θ h is comparatively lower in the h s w contours noticeable differences can be observed too for example for h s between 10 m and 12m and w ranging from 18 m s to 22 m s 5 conclusions a framework using three dimensional vine copulas was presented for the computation of environmental contours of linear variables such as wave height peak spectral period or wind speed conditioned on circular variables such as wave and wind directions this vine approach facilitates the assembly of the multivariate probability distribution by means of bivariate copulas that model the pairwise dependence between the environmental variables a simplifying assumption under the vine approach is that the copula of a pair of linear variables is independent from the circular ones a parametric analysis was conducted in a case study using theoretical linear circular copula models and circular marginal distributions results showed that the following have a significant effect on the shapes and values of the directional environmental contours 1 the dependence structure of the linear circular variables as defined by a particular copula model 2 the degree of association between the circular and the linear variables depending on the values of the copula parameters and 3 the dispersion around the mean of the circular marginal distribution the results also showed considerable differences between omnidirectional contours where the linear circular copula model is the independent one compared to those where directionality is taken into account the vine copula formulation was used for computing metocean directional contours the methodological framework for the statistical modeling of metocean hindcast data was described in detail including estimation and goodness of fit for circular linear copulas and circular marginal distributions environmental contours of significant wave height peak spectral period and wind speed depending on wind and wave directions were computed using the copula models and the marginal distributions that best fit the data results were easier to interpret in the light of observations from the parametric analysis in the theoretical case study contours of significant wave height and wind speed were found to be more sensitive to wind direction whereas contours of significant wave height and peak period were more so to wave direction there was greater variability in the contours conditioned on wave direction than those on wind direction differences in the order of up to 30 were found between omnidirectional contours and contours considering directionality of waves appendix a von mises distribution the von mises distribution for circular random variables has two parameters the circular mean μ 0 2 π and the concentration factor κ 0 around μ the probability density function pdf is defined as see e g mardia and jupp 2000 a 1 f θ θ e κ cos θ μ 2 π i 0 κ θ 0 2 π where i 0 κ 1 π 0 π e κ cos ω d ω is the modified bessel function of the first kind and order zero if κ 0 eq a 1 corresponds to the uniform circular pdf f θ θ 1 2 π the distribution function can be expressed as mardia and zemroch 1975 a 2 f θ θ υ θ υ θ 0 where θ 0 is an arbitrary fixed origin and a 3 υ ϕ 1 2 π ϕ 2 i 0 κ j 1 i j κ sin j ϕ μ j where i j κ 1 π 0 π e κ cos ω cos j ω d ω is the modified bessel function of

reference value for the design optimization of other similar submarines keywords argo profiling float shell optimization response surface model nsga ii main effect analysis pareto front optimization efficiency 1 introduction with the further exploration and exploitation of marine environment and resources argo real time ocean observing network has become an important pillar of the global ocean observing system at present there are more than 3000 profiling floats working normally in the ocean they are playing an increasingly important role in scientific research and operational activities in the fields of ocean atmosphere and meteorology sterl 2009 showstack 2013 at present most profiling floats launched in argo real time ocean observing network work at the depth of about 2000m however the average depth of the global ocean is 3850 m so it is necessary to extend the observation depth of argo profiling floats from the current 2000m to a greater depth liu and xu 2009 among the deep sea intelligent profile profiling floats currently operating in the global argo real time ocean observing network the main profiling floats are the 6000 m apex floats developed by webb company of the united states the 6000 m deep solo floats developed by scripps oceanographic research institute the 4000 m arvor floats developed by martec company of france and the 4000 m deep ninja floats developed

of floats in the indian ocean and for expanding the regional argo observation network in the south china sea liu et al 2017 the first generation 4000 m autonomous intelligent argo profiling float designed and developed by our research team was tested in the mariana trench in march 2018 the sea trial situation is shown in fig 1 the shell materials of the first generation argo profiling float are all titanium alloys which results in the gravity of the profiling float far greater than buoyancy so it is necessary to carry buoyancy materials to increase buoyancy which leads to the mass and volume of the profiling float far beyond the project design index in addition the existence of buoyancy materials increases the resistance of the profile motion by summarizing the results of sea trials the first generation argo profiling float has poor hydrodynamic performance endurance and carrying capacity because of the influence of buoyancy material excessive float mass and poor hydrodynamic shape therefore in the shell design of the second generation argo profiling float it is necessary to optimize the hydrodynamic shape and re select the shell material so as to increase buoyancy without relying on the buoyancy material and improve the overall performance of the profiling float the optimization method based on response surface approximation model has been widely used in robust design and agent model of multi objective and multi disciplinary optimization design zhang and yao 2007 ding et al 2007 papila et al 2001 which also provides an efficient solution for rapid

both the apex floats and deep solo floats petzrick et al 2014 available online 2018b streamlined revolving body is used as pressure tank by the arvor floats teledyne webb research 2014 compared with revolving body the processing of glass ball is more difficult and its underwater attitude is unstable in view of the excessive mass of the first generation argo profiling float the pressure tank of the second generation is replaced by t700 carbon fiber composite compared with titanium alloy used in the first generation there are lower specific gravity about 40 density of titanium alloy higher strength lower thermal expansion coefficient stronger corrosion resistance and radiation resistance for carbon fiber composite the application of carbon fiber composite is more and more extensive in underwater vehicles a carbon fiber reinforced composite cylindrical shell was used as the structure of autosub pressure tank of autonomous underwater vehicle wang tan of northeast university used carbon fiber composite as the material of the pressure tank for 7000 m deep sea glider tan the mechanical properties of the carbon fiber composites used in the pressure tank of the second generation profiling float are shown in table 1 drawing lessons from the shell design experience of the first generation profiling float streamlined revolving body is still used as pressure tank of the second

the space utilization of the nose and tail parts the semi ellipsoid of tc4 titanium alloy is used in both nose and tail parts the curve equations of the nose and tail parts are elliptic equations with adjustable exponent which are as follows zhu 1992 1 y f d 2 1 x l f n f 1 n f 2 y a d 2 1 x l a n a 1 n a where d is the maximum diameter of the revolving body l f and l a are the lengths of the nose and tail parts respectively n f and n a are the indexes of the nose and tail shapes which represent the fullness of the nose and tail parts respectively fig 2 shows the shape of the shell for the second generation argo profiling float the maximum diameter of the revolving body is d 298 m m and the wall thickness is t c 22 m m both the nose and tail parts are made of tc4 semi ellipsoid with wall thickness t f t a 10 m m the nose part and tail part are connected with carbon fiber cylinder through titanium alloy connecting ring and the total length of the shell is kept as l 1160 m m 2 2 definition of design variables and optimization objectives based on the shape of the shell described in fig 2 four parameters are selected as design variables as shown in table 2 fig 3 shows the definition of optimization objectives from which we can see the influence of optimization objectives on profiling float s performance and the relationship among optimization objectives considering the limited energy carried by profiling floats the resistance and the mass of the shell should be reduced as much as possible while the envelope volume should be increased as much as possible to increase net buoyancy and decrease energy consumption the hydrodynamic performance is influenced by the resistance and the envelope volume while maximum envelope volume and minimum resistance are conflicting similarly the effective carrying capacity are influenced by the envelope volume and the mass while maximum envelope volume and minimum mass are conflicting 3 establishment of approximation model 3 1 design of experiments doe to make the selection of parameters uniform and ensure the accuracy of the approximation model the optimal latin hypercube method is adopted which improves the uniformity of random latin hypercube design and makes the fitting of factor and response more accurate and true lai and jiang 2012 sampling comparison of the two experimental designs is shown in fig 4 second order nonlinearity polynomial response surface is used to fit four design variables at least n 1 n 2 2 sample points are required in the initialization process where n is the number of factors considering the efficiency and the limitation of engineering feasibility each factor takes 24 levels randomly combine 24 levels of each factor and each level should be used only once then 24 sets of schemes are obtained 3 2 calculation of optimization objectives the envelope volume and the mass of the shell are obtained by 3 d drawing software solidworks directly the meshing of the shell are completed in icem and the number of unstructured grids is 3 million grid encryption is done by dividing the boundary layer on the surface of the shell the fluid field is a cylindrical body with a length of 11 m

the fitting value of response surface y is the mean of real response r 2 is a real number in the range of 0 1 the closer it is to 1 the better the fitting effect is the fitting requirement can be

respectively which shows that the obtained response surface models fully meet the requirements 4 optimization results 4 1 multi objective optimization and pareto front the mathematical model of multi

n t represents n dimensional design variables in multi objective optimization because of the contradictions and constraints among objectives the improvement of one objective is often at the expense of the loss of other objectives and there is no solution to achieve the optimal solution for all objectives so the solution of multi objective optimization problem is often a non inferior solution also known as pareto optimal solution srinivas and deb 2014 the set of pareto optimal solution is called pareto optimal solution set and the image of the corresponding objective function space is called pareto front 4 2 non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii the nsga ii proposed by deb has greatly improved the speed and robustness of the algorithm deb et al 2002 as an improved version of nsga nsga ii used in this paper has the advantage of good exploratory performance fig 5 shows the nsga ii procedure a fast non dominated sorting method is proposed which reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm from the original o m n 3 to o m n 2 where m is the number of objective functions and n is the size of population it is important to note that although the time complexity has reduced to o m n 2 the storage requirement has increased to o n 2 crowding distance and crowded comparison operator are proposed which replaces the fitness sharing strategy that needs to specify the sharing radius and is used as the winning criterion in the same level comparison after fast non dominated sorting so that the individuals in the quasi pareto domain can be extended to the whole pareto domain thus maintaining the diversity of the population in fig 6 the crowding distance of the i t h solution in its front marked with solid circles is the average side length of the cuboid shown with a dashed box for each objective function it is assumed that the crowding distance of its endpoints is infinite the crowding distance of individuals are calculated in eq 11 11 i d j 1 m f j

elitist strategy is introduced to expand sampling space combining the parent population with its offspring population and competing together to produce the offspring population will help to keep the good individuals in the parent generation into the next generation by layering all the individuals in the population the best individuals will not be lost and the population level will be improved rapidly the main steps of nsga ii are as follows step1 input variables and parameters step2 randomly initialize a parent population with n individuals step3 after non dominant sorting the first generation population can be obtained by three basic operations of genetic algorithm selection crossover and mutation step4 starting from the second generation the parent population and the offspring

the response surface models of objective functions are established by matlab and the accuracy of the model is tested by correlation coefficient r 2 finally pareto front is obtained by multi objective optimization using nsga ii after the pareto solution set is obtained five pareto optimal solutions are selected at both ends and in the middle of the pareto front according to the three optimization objectives of minimum resistance minimum mass and maximum envelope volume the results are as follows see table 4 solutions 1 2 and 3 represent the design schemes with minimum resistance maximum envelope volume and minimum mass respectively while solutions 4 and 5 represent the balanced design schemes of three design objectives all pareto solutions can be used as design scheme of the shell and the optimal selection of one objective can be made when other design objectives meet the requirements the selection of the final scheme depends on the actual design indictors and the internal space requirement 4 4 main effect analysis in shell design and optimization of the profiling float the optimization efficiency can be improved by obtaining the influence degree of each design variable on the optimization objective and the purpose of design and optimization is stronger so it is necessary to analyze the main effect of design variables through the analysis by isight the main effect plots of four design variables on each response are obtained as shown in figs 9 11 from fig 9 it can be seen that within the limits of design variables the resistance of the shell increases approximately linearly with the increase of the indexes of nose and tail shape when the indexes are lower the resistance is easier to be increased by the index of nose shape but when the indexes are higher the resistance is easier to be increased by the index of tail shape the resistance decreases first and then increases with the increase of the nose length which is opposite to the tail length overall the nose length is greater than that of the tail length on the hydrodynamic performance of the profiling float when better hydrodynamic performance is required the nose and tail with smaller shape index can be selected meanwhile the appropriate nose and tail length can be selected according to the main effect plot fig 10 shows that the mass of the shell increases approximately linearly with the increase of the indexes of nose and tail shape and decreases linearly with the increase of the nose and tail length when the thickness of the shell is constant within the limits of the design variables when better endurance is required the nose and tail with smaller shape index can be selected and the nose and tail length can be increased appropriately fig 11 shows that the envelope volume of the shell increases approximately linearly with the increase of the indexes of nose and tail shape and decreases linearly with the increase of the nose and tail length within the limits of design variables when the profiling float needs adequate installation space for internal equipment layout the nose and tail with larger shape index can be selected and the nose and tail length can be reduced appropriately through the analysis of the main effect plots the influence rule and degree of each design variable on the optimization objective can be obtained in the design of the shell the range of design variables can be determined according to the requirements of design indicators which is very important for reducing the resistance and mass of the shell and increasing the envelope volume 5 comparison and simulation analysis considering the processing difficulty of the shell and the design index of the profiling float the carrying capacity is not less than 30 kg solution 5 is selected as the design scheme of the shell for second generation argo profiling float and the optimization objectives of the shells are compared in table 5 the mass and envelope volume of the shell for the first

effective carrying capacity is about 33 k g the overall hydrodynamic performance endurance and carrying capacity of the profiling float have been greatly improved and the hydrodynamic performance of profiling floats before and after optimization is compared and analyzed the results are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 from the analysis of figs 12 and 13 it can be seen that the pressure and velocity distribution of the optimized argo profiling float are more uniform than that of the first generation because of the existence of buoyancy materials the pressure drag of the first generation argo profiling float is greatly increased we can see the hydrodynamic performance of the optimized argo profiling float is greatly improved the overall linear buckling analysis of the optimized shell is carried out by ansys and the overall displacement contour fig 14 and the first order buckling contour fig 15 are obtained under external pressure 48 m p a based on the above buckling analysis the

efficiency 1 introduction with the further exploration and exploitation of marine environment and resources argo real time ocean observing network has become an important pillar of the global ocean observing system at present there are more than 3000 profiling floats working normally in the ocean they are playing an increasingly important role in scientific research and operational activities in the fields of ocean atmosphere and meteorology sterl 2009 showstack 2013 at present most profiling floats launched in argo real time ocean observing network work at the depth of about 2000m however the average depth of the global ocean is 3850 m so it is necessary to extend the observation depth of argo profiling floats from the current 2000m to a greater depth liu and xu 2009 among the deep sea intelligent profile profiling floats currently operating in the global argo real time ocean observing network the main profiling floats are the 6000 m apex floats developed by webb company of the united states the 6000 m deep solo floats developed by scripps oceanographic research institute the 4000 m arvor floats developed by martec company of france and the 4000 m deep ninja floats developed by japan johnson et al 2008 available online 2018a andré et al 2015 kobayashiet al 2012 available online 2019 the development of chinese argo profiling floats china ocean profiling explorer copex begun in 2001 nowadays ocean experiments have been carried with copex and satisfactory results have been gained li zhong et al 2005 discussion also focuses on the necessity for increasing the number of floats in the indian ocean and for expanding the regional argo observation network in the south china sea liu et al 2017 the first generation 4000 m autonomous intelligent argo profiling float designed and developed by our research team was tested in the mariana trench in march 2018 the sea trial situation is shown in fig 1 the shell materials of the first generation argo profiling float are all titanium alloys which results in the gravity of the profiling float far greater than buoyancy so it is necessary to carry buoyancy materials to increase buoyancy which leads to the mass and volume of the profiling float far beyond the project design index in addition the existence of buoyancy materials increases the resistance of the profile motion by summarizing the results of sea trials the first generation argo profiling float has poor hydrodynamic performance endurance and carrying capacity because of the influence of buoyancy material excessive float mass and poor hydrodynamic shape therefore in the shell design of the second generation argo profiling float it is necessary to optimize the hydrodynamic shape and re select the shell material so as to increase buoyancy without relying on the buoyancy material and improve the overall performance of the profiling float the optimization method based on response surface approximation model has been widely used

definition of optimization objectives from which we can see the influence of optimization objectives on profiling float s performance and the relationship among optimization objectives considering the limited energy carried by profiling floats the resistance and the mass of the shell should be reduced as much as possible while the envelope volume should be increased as much as possible to increase net buoyancy and decrease energy consumption the hydrodynamic performance is influenced by the resistance and the envelope volume while maximum envelope volume and minimum resistance are conflicting similarly the effective carrying capacity are influenced by the envelope volume and the mass while maximum envelope volume and minimum mass are conflicting 3 establishment of approximation model 3 1

this paper the shell of the first generation argo profiling float is taken as the optimization target a shell optimization method based on response surface approximation model and multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ii is proposed three approximation models of the resistance mass and envelope volume of the shell are established based on the optimal latin hypercube method the pareto front is obtained with the application of nsga ii and a set of solutions is selected as the final shell design scheme of the second generation argo profiling float conclusions are as follows 1 the main effect analysis presents the influence rule and degree of each design variable on the optimization objective in the design of the shell the range of design variables can be determined according to the requirements of design indicators which has an important reference value for the initial design and optimization of the shell 2 compared with the first generation argo profiling float the resistance of the shell for the second generation is reduced by 37 278 n and through hydrodynamic simulation it can be seen that the pressure and velocity distribution are flatter the mass is reduced by 21 935 k g while the envelope volume is increased by 32 549 l through the buckling analysis the minimum critical buckling pressure of the shell is 96 m p a and the stability of the shell is verified by the high pressure test 3 the optimization process has great reference value for the initial design and subsequent optimization of the shell especially when there are high requirements for the hydrodynamic performance endurance and carrying capacity of the profiling float it can greatly reduce the design cost and improve the design and optimization efficiency this method can also be applied to the design and optimization of other similar submersible shells acknowledgement the research was supported by the shandong provincial natural science foundation wenhai program 4000 m self contained
