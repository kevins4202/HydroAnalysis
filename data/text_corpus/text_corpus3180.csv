15900,the formation of chlorinated byproducts represents a significant threat to the quality of the effluent treated using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops thus spurring investigation into alleviating their production this study presents a new strategy to minimize the release of chlorinated intermediates during the electrochemical oxidation of ni edta by establishing a dual mixed metal oxide mmo fe anode system the results indicate that the dual anode system achieved a substantially higher rate 0 141 min 1 of ni edta destruction and accordingly allowed a more pronounced removal of aqueous ni from 39 85 to 0 63 mg l 1 after alkaline precipitation compared with its single mmo anode 0 017 min 1 of ni edta removal with 14 38 mg l 1 ni remaining and single fe anode insignificant ni edta removal with 38 37 mg l 1 ni remaining counterparts compared to reactive chlorine species rcs produced from the single mmo anode system fe iv was in situ generated from the dual anode system and was predominantly responsible for the attenuation of chlorinated byproducts and thus the decrease in the acute toxicity of the treated solution evaluated using luminescent bacteria the fe iv dominated dual anode system also exhibited superior performance in removing multiple pollutants including organic ligands ni and phosphite in the real electroless plating effluent the findings suggest that the strategy for fe ii transition to fe iv by active chlorine paves a new avenue for yielding less chlorinated products with lower toxicity when eaops are used to treat chloride containing organic wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical oxidation high valence fe decomplexation chlorinated byproducts active chlorine electroless plating wastewater 1 introduction electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are attractive options for mineralizing recalcitrant pollutants because of their high efficiency easily automated operation and good tunability to variable organic loads feng et al 2013 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 radjenovic et al 2020 as the electrochemical system can be powered by sustainable energy i e solar or wind energy operated at ambient pressure and atmosphere and installed on highly integrated equipment eaops are suitable for small scale decentralized wastewater treatment valero et al 2010 zheng et al 2021 chloride cl prevalent in many real waste streams can indirectly facilitate the oxidation of organic pollutants via the formation of reactive chlorine species rcs including free chlorine and chlorine radicals from the anode in the electrochemical system hao et al 2022 scialdone et al 2009 however despite the beneficial effect of cl on the treatment of wastewater the involvement of rcs in pollutant abatement inevitably causes the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts that may be more hazardous than the initial organics are for example chlorinated byproducts such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids have been monitored upon electrolysis of latrine wastewater urine and reverse osmosis retentate bagastyo et al 2011 jasper et al 2017 zöllig et al 2015 this issue poses a serious challenge for the practical application of such an electrochemical technology in recent years many studies have shown that eaops are promising options for electroless plating wastewater treatment during which the decomplexation of metal complexes is a significant step in the effective treatment of chelated metals e g ni and or cu rong et al 2022 zhao et al 2013 the destruction of ligands such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid edta or cyanide has been achieved via a direct oxidation pathway and or an indirect one utilizing in situ generated oh at the anode however the reaction pathway may be altered in the presence of cl commonly available in electroless plating wastewater because of the formation of rcs particularly chlorine radicals which could react with many organics that are abundant in amino and carboxylic groups at reasonably high rates 1010 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a to date relatively few studies have focused on how cl affects the performance of decomplexation and little information has been available on the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts in the electrochemical system as such minimizing the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts while treating cl containing electroless plating wastewater represents an important goal for studies using electrochemical methods for decomplexation to achieve this purpose we propose a new approach by selectively changing free chlorine into another highly active chlorine free species that predominantly destroy the organics our previous study has demonstrated that the combination of free chlorine and fe2 in acid medium enables the production of high value iron oxo species i e fe iv which exhibit a strong capacity for oxidizing pollutants liang et al 2020 the primary aim of the current study is to determine whether the fe iv mediated eaop outperforms the rcs mediated one in terms of higher decomplexation rates and less production of chlorinated intermediates along this line a dual anode system incorporating a mixed metal oxide mmo electrode and an fe anode was constructed for the in situ generation of fe iv in the presence of cl under acid conditions with the use of ni edta as a model compound decomplexation rates along with the products and their toxicities were evaluated and compared under different operational conditions tests with real electroless plating wastewater were also performed to prove the superiority of fe iv over rcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and electrode materials ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt na2edta nickel

type zhong run hongfa stainless steel co ltd shenzhen china and an mmo electrode ruo2 and iro2 coated titanium plate changli specialty metals ltd shanxi china were used in the electrochemical reactors prior to the experiments the fe electrode was polished with a coarse emery cloth etched with diluted hcl solution 5 by weight and washed with deionized water the ni edta solution was prepared by dissolving niso4 and na2edta with a molar ratio of 1 1 in deionized water the ni2 edta molar ratio was 1 1 2 2 electrolysis experiments electrolysis tests of the different electrochemical systems for ni edta degradation were undertaken in an undivided cylindrical quartz electrolytic cell the dual anode system was composed of an fe plate anode an mmo anode and a stainless steel plate cathode all of which have a size of 30 30 mm with a thickness of 2 mm the cathode was placed in the center of the two anodes with 15 mm spacing the single mmo anode system and the single fe anode system were also constructed for comparison under the same conditions the experiments were run in a constant current mode controlled by a direct current power supply for each test the solution 250 ml included 0 68 mm

electrochemical reactor was run under open atmosphere and stirred at 350 rpm with a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar during the electrolysis process samples were taken with syringes at designated time intervals and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane at the end of the reaction the solution ph was adjusted to 11 with naoh to allow ni precipitation the real ni plating wastewater which was collected from a local metal plating plant dongguan guangdong china was also subjected to electrochemical treatment the electroless plating effluent diluted with

wavelength of 700 nm based on the formation of a blue molybdenum complex after digestion using peroxodisulfate the amount of active chlorine including cl2 hclo and clo available in the reactor was monitored using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method yan et al 2021 dmpo was used as a trapping agent for electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis emx a300 10 12 bruker germany and the detailed method is presented in text s2 the degradation intermediates of ni edta were identified with ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tof ms

current a t is the electrolytic time h v is the volume of the experimental solution 0 25 l c0 is the initial concentration mg l 1 of ni and ct is the concentration of ni after alkali precipitation at the end of the reaction 2 4 evaluation of acute toxicity the acute toxicity of ni edta before and after different treatments was measured using a luminescent bacteria assay photobacterium phosphoreum supplied by nanjing cas kuake technology co ltd china were used to carry out the acute toxicity test prior to the experiments the ph was adjusted to 6 5 and the solution was immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane to remove the precipitate and quenched with na2s2o3 the sample containing 3 nacl was added to a 200 μl bacterial suspension and incubated for 30 min and the luminous intensity was then measured with a multifunctional microplate detection system biotek cytation 5 usa to evaluate acute toxicity the relative inhibition rate was calculated according to eq 2 2 ir i 0 i t i 0 100 where i0 and it are the luminous intensities of photobacterium phosphoreum in 3 nacl solution and the sample taken at time t respectively in addition to the initial and treated ni edta solution toxicity assessments were performed with nitrilotriacetic acid nickel ni nta iminodiacetic acid nickel ni imda glycine nickel ni gly adipic acid nickel ni ions and the real ni plating effluent to mask the toxicities of ni in the form of free ions and weakly complexed states produced upon electrochemical ni edta degradation 0 68 mm na2edta was added to the sample at a ratio of 1 1 v v and incubated for 12 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced oxidizing capacity of dual anode eaop for ni edta abatement comparisons of the oxidizing capacity were made between the single fe anode system the single mmo anode system and the dual mmo fe anode system for which the rates of ni edta decomplexation and the subsequent ni removal from the aqueous phase were evaluated fig 1 a shows that a significant discrepancy in the rate of edta removal was observed for different treatments note that continuous hydroxyl production at the cathode caused a ph increase fig s1 which resulted in the formation of fe flocs however very low amounts of ni edta were removed in the single fe anode system suggesting the resistance of direct edta oxidation on fe and the ineffectiveness of the adsorption and co precipitation of ni edta by fe electrocoagulation by contrast the single mmo anode facilitated ni edta decomplexation the 180 min operation allowed the disappearance of 94 2 edta this improvement was attributed to the presence of rcs in situ generated at the mmo anode dong et al 2021 zhou et al 2011 according to the literature they are capable of oxidizing metal complexes zeng et al 2016 the formation of active chlorine and its reactions with ni edta are depicted in fig s2 in which the increasing electrolysis time caused a substantial increase in the concentration of active chlorine and the presence of ni edta reduced its level in the solution at 180 min the molar ratio of active chlorine consumed 0 96 mm to edta reduced around 0 64 mm exceeded 1 1 stoichiometry suggesting that more than one chlorine atom was added to the organic compound in some byproducts which was confirmed by uplc ms analysis in the later section interestingly the oxidizing capacity of the dual anode system increased dramatically compared with the single anode systems an approximately complete removal of ni edta was observed at 60 min of operation implying that alternative reactive species were in situ produced and were favorable to the oxidation of ni edta the apparent rate constant was calculated to be 0 141 min 1 and 0 017 min 1 corresponding to the dual mmo fe anode and the single mmo anode respectively mineralization of edta was achieved in the two mmo related systems but its extent was highly dependent on oxidizing capability as illustrated in fig 1b a similar trend of toc disappearance was displayed negligible toc removal for the single fe anode and 45 0 and 83 6 of toc abatement in relation to the single mmo anode and dual mmo fe anode respectively despite the increasing ph for the three cases fig s1 which may allow the precipitation or coagulation of aqueous ni the concentration of residual ni in the solution during the reaction did not substantially decrease fig s3 nevertheless the single mmo anode induced a slight improvement in the removal of aqueous ni which was likely ascribed to ni oxidation by rcs in this case the color of the solution turned gray observed by the naked eye and the precipitates which were identified as ni3o2 oh 4 through xrd characterizations jcpds 06 0144 can be collected via filtration fig s4 the xps analysis further confirmed that the composite contained a mixture valence of ni ii and ni iii fig s4 the dual anode system improved the removal of ni in the solution with an approximately 25 loss of aqueous ni after 180 min the relatively lower levels of ni removal compared with those of edta degradation and mineralization can be explained by the following 1 ni was prone to be combined with small molecule organic intermediates instead of hydroxyl under the present ph condition fu et al 2012 and ii there was a low affinity between the negatively charged fe flocs fig s5 and the complexed ni ions it should be noted that the ph adjustment at 11 by adding alkaline distinctly promoted the removal of aqueous ni fig 1c clearly indicates the major differences in the aqueous ni solutions between different treatments when the ph was set at 11 for the dual anode treatment the ni concentration in the supernatant pronouncedly decreased from the initial 39 85 to 0 63 mgl 1 because of alkaline precipitation on the other hand the residual ni concentration was as high as 14 38 mgl 1 in the single mmo anode system this differentiation was highly consistent with the extent of edta mineralization affirming that decomplexation and destruction of organic ligands are important pretreatment steps prior to the precipitation of heavy metals fu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the sec which is an important indicator for evaluating the performance of eaops was calculated and compared between different treatments as seen from fig 1d the dual anode system corresponded to an sec of 0 29 kwh g 1 ni which was manifestly lower than the 0 41 kwh g 1 ni and 0 77 kwh g 1 ni associated with the single mmo anode system and single fe anode system respectively all the findings indicate that the dual anode system is powerful for efficiently oxidizing ni edta and subsequently enabling the precipitation of un complexed weakly complexed aqueous ni at increasing ph 3 2 identification of key reactive species further efforts were made to identify the crucial reactive species that are in situ generated from the dual anode system and are responsible for the degradation of ni edta as illustrated in fig 2 a the anodic oxidation of cl stimulated the accumulation of active chlorine in the single mmo system by contrast the introduction of fe anode significantly attenuated the amounts of active chlorine implying the active chlorine stimulated fe ii transition to other reactive species likely fe iv as we predicted previously liang et al 2020 to further confirm this a series of quenching experiments with scavengers such as tba etoh and dmso was performed to identify the key species fig 2b tba was a good scavenger for oh and cl fang et al 2014 yamazaki and piette 1991 which however barely suppressed the degradation of edta indicating the absence of oh and cl generated from the dual anode system the introduction of etoh to the electrolyte slightly inhibited ni edta decomplexation the different retardation effects of tba and etoh could be reasonably explained by their varying levels of reactivity toward fe iv previous research has reported that the reaction rate between tba and fe iv is 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 which was two orders of magnitude lower than that of etoh with fe iv 2 51 103 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 moreover the addition of dmso an fe iv scavenger the reaction rate between dmso and fe iv is 1 3 105 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2006 substantially impeded the removal of ni edta the above mentioned quenching experiments indicated that fe iv should play an important role in oxidizing ni edta this was further verified with the epr characterizations performed with dmpo as the trapping agent fig 2c clearly shows that the seven line epr spectra were observed in the single mmo anode system presumedly corresponding to dmpox bilski et al 1996 which is derived from the oxidation of dmpo by free chlorine or chlorine radicals stan and daeschel 2005 by contrast the dual anode system in the presence of cl yielded a legible signal of dmpo oh adduct which could be assigned to the production of oh the oxidation of dmpo to a radical cation followed by a nucleophilic attack of water bejan et al 2012 or the presence of fe iv for the latter previous studies have shown that the oxidation of dmpo by fe iv could result in the formation of dmpo oh via a metal catalyzed nucleophilic addition pathway wang et al 2018b to identify possible origins of the dmpo oh adduct several scavengers were individually added to the electrolyte to react preferentially with the corresponding reactive species as illustrated in fig 2d the addition of the oh scavenger i e tba seldom altered the dmpo oh signal however when fe iv scavengers i e dmso and etoh were supplemented the epr signal of dmpo oh was dramatically suppressed in particular the c center radical signals were revealed in the case of dmso addition as observed previously liang et al 2020 these results suggest the active chlorine triggered fe ii transition to fe iv when fe ii is available in the cl laden anodic system 3 3 effects of key operational parameters on ni edta degradation the effects of operational parameters such as the anode current cl concentration and solution ph on ni edta removal in the dual anode system were evaluated time course ni edta concentrations were fitted with the first order kinetic law and the apparent rate constants were calculated and compared fig 3 a shows that when the current at the mmo anode was fixed at 200 ma increasing the current applied to the fe anode from 10 to 50 ma equivalent to the current density from 1 1 to 5 5 ma cm 2 slightly improved the reaction rate however a further increase from 50 to 100 ma resulted in a decrease in ni edta removal fig s6 illustrates that increasing the current from 0 to 100 ma remarkably augmented the amount of fe ii a linear relationship between them was attained indicative of a high current efficiency in the range from 92 to 98 for fe ii production although the elevated current also resulted in increased amounts of fe iii the values were significantly lower than the fe ii concentrations even with higher applied currents thus it can be inferred that the increment in the rate of ni edta removal should be attributed to more amounts of fe ii generated in situ which promoted the production of fe iv responsible for the edta degradation the excess fe ii that results from the increased current should competitively consume the fe iv leading to a reduction in the oxidizing capacity as reported previously wang et al 2018b note that the expected lifetime of the fe anode used in this study 30 30 2 mm should be at least 270 h at the applied current of 50 ma and a current efficiency of approximately 100 raising the current applied to the mmo anode from 100 to 300 ma corresponding to the current density from 11 1 to 33 3 ma cm 2 or the cl concentration from 25 to 100 ma was conducive to the evolution of active chlorine thus enhancing the reaction rate fig 3b and 3c this reflects that rcs are the key to accelerating edta degradation as rcs function not only as oxidants but also as precursors for generating fe iv it was noticeable that the current applied to the mmo anode from 200 to 300 ma led to a relatively lower increment compared with that observed at the current from 100 to 200 ma this phenomenon is likely due to the redundant amounts of rcs produced at the high mmo current the fe ii concentration was fixed at the constant fe current the removal of ni edta in the dual anode system was highly sensitive to the solution ph because ph significantly affects the species distribution of ni edta and the transformation of reactive species dong et al 2020 fig 3d illustrates that increasing the initial ph from 2 5 to 8 5 impeded the degradation of ni edta and only ph 2 5 was favorable for edta oxidation fig s7 depicts that nih2edta and nihedta are the dominant species at low ph values and that the increasing ph yields deprotonation with niedta 2 as the main species at high ph values previous studies have shown that protonated forms are more prone to oxidation by reactive species jiraroj et al 2006 another reason for the limited removal of ni edta at ph above 4 0 was the substantial consumption of fe ii as a result of fe ii oxidation and the subsequent fe ii fe iii precipitation the decline in fe ii concentration was closely linked to the decreased level of fe iv for all the investigated conditions the order of toc removal efficiency fig s8 and the extent of aqueous ni removal after alkaline precipitation fig s9 followed the same trend as the ranking of the ni edta degradation rate this again validates that mineralization of ni edta occurs in the dual anode system which is an important step in liberating free ni ions 3 4 pathways of ni edta degradation by fe iv and rcs to elucidate the degradation pathways of ni edta degradation in the single mmo and dual anode electrochemical systems the intermediates were analyzed using uplc tof ms typical degradation intermediates such as ni ed3a ni nta ni edma ni ed2a ni imda ni eda and ni gly were detected in the fe iv dominated dual anode system the detailed uplc ms data of the identified intermediates are listed in fig s10 and table s1 this implies that the fe iv initiated ni edta degradation follows a stepwise decarboxylation process proposed in fig 4 via pathways a and b similar to oh promoted ni edta cu edta oxidation reported previously wang et al 2018a zhao et al 2014 it has been shown that fe iv with a high oxidizing capacity can preferably react with organic contaminants containing electron rich moieties wang et al 2022 pathway a involves an attack on the α position c of ch2 cooh in edta by fe iv because it has a high electron density this would result in the deprotonation of the c h bond and the formation of c centered radicals relevant studies have shown that the oxidation of organics by fe iv proceeds via one electron transfer and yields c centered radicals pestovsky and bakac 2004 the epr tests performed during the operation of the dual anode system for ni edta decomplexation provide clear evidence of the generation of unsaturated c centered radicals αn 15 5 g and αh 22 3 g which were likely to be edta fig s11 liang et al 2021 these radicals having high reducing reactivity are easily converted to transient n centered ions which are subsequently hydrolyzed ouyang et al 2015 after the decarboxylation of the acetate group ni ed3a is generated the subsequent attack on ni ed3a creates ni edma or ni ed2a followed by ni eda another degradation pathway pathway b is associated with the h abstraction reaction occurring in ch2 of n ch2 ch2 n and generating c center radicals that go through the same process and end up forming ni nta subsequently ni imda is produced after cleavage of the acetate group further removing the acetate group leads to the formation of ni gly the ultimate ni edta decarboxylation was accompanied by the accumulation of small molecule organic acids such as ch3cooh and hcooh which were detected using ion chromatography these products were also frequently detected in other advanced oxidation processes for the mineralization of ni edta cu edta wang et al 2018a zhao et al 2014 the intermediates detected in the single mmo anode system are distinctly different from those in the dual anode system ni edma and ni nta were found indicating that degradation of ni edta by rcs can also proceed via pathways a and b similar results of h abstraction from ni edta or cu edta by the attack of chlorine radicals have been documented in the literature huang et al 2019 in addition to these compounds many chlorinated byproducts were generated in accordance with the observations reported in other eaops for treating wastewater containing high concentrations of chloride and organic matter brüninghoff et al 2019 these included ni eda cl ni edma 2cl ni nta cl ni imda cl and ni gly 2cl their relevant uplc ms mass data are shown in fig s12 and table s2 the possible pathways for their formation are also proposed in fig 4 in line with a similar stepwise decarboxylation process these results provide compelling evidence that the active chlorine triggered fe ii transition to fe iv significantly minimizes chlorinated byproduct formation only ni imda cl is detectable in the dual anode system table s3 presents and compares the uplc ms data of the average peak areas of intermediates detected in both systems it is apparent that the abundance of most cl free byproducts was much higher in the dual anode system than in the single mmo system whereas the latter permitted the generation of chlorinated intermediates with relatively larger quantities 3 5 evaluation of acute toxicity upon single and dual anode treatments of ni edta to gain insight into the acute toxicity of the degradation intermediates and products bio toxicity assay with the bioluminescent bacteria photobacterium phosphoreum wang and wang 2021 a widely used method because of its convenience high sensitivity and low cost was utilized to access and compare the variations in the toxicity of the ni edta solution as depicted in fig s13a the highly complexed and stabilized ni edta has a relatively good bio inert property which slightly inhibits bioluminescence the electrochemical treatments either in the single or dual anode mode significantly increased the toxicity of the ni edta solution in photobacterium this was attributed to the fact that the degradation products including free ni ions and ni complexed low molecule ligands e g ni nta ni imda and ni gly had a much higher bioavailability which was evident from fig s13b and the results reported in a previous study on cu edta destruction by uv h2o2 wang et al 2020b to distinguish the contribution of chlorinated and un chlorinated byproducts to acute toxicity edta as an effective quencher for ni in the uncomplexed form or complexed with low molecule organics was used for the bio luminescent tests ma et al 2003 pascual et al 2020 shuttleworth and unz 1991 of particular note from fig 5 a was the gradual increase in inhibition percentage with the increase in time for the rcs dominated electrochemical system single mmo anode on the contrary for the fe iv involved electrochemical system dual mmo fe anode the inhibition rate slightly increased reached a maximum value and then decayed upon the extended time of electrolysis the inhibition percentage of the single anode system after 180 min was considerably higher than that of the dual anode system this clearly indicates a substantially larger toxicity of the chlorinated byproducts produced from the rcs initiated ni edta degradation additional experiments with the bioluminescent bacteria were conducted before and after alkaline precipitation to remove uncomplexed ni ions as shown in fig 5b the addition of alkaline to the treated solution in the dual anode system remarkably reduced the inhibition rate whereas it only slightly changed in the single mmo anode system further suggesting that more levels of mineralization were achieved by fe iv moreover the destruction of most of edta 83 6 toc removal attained upon 180 min of dual anode treatment induced a relatively small increase in the inhibition rate compared with the initial sample from 9 61 to 13 65 by contrast this value rose substantially to 83 98 for the single anode treatment operated under the same conditions the results from fig 5a and 5b prove that the presence of high concentration chloride and organic matter resulted in the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts a common behavior for eaops deborde and von gunten 2008 schaefer et al 2015 and that the abatement of chlorinated intermediates and accordingly toxicity can be addressed by a change in the rcs to fe iv 3 6 application in real electroless plating wastewater treatment further efforts were made to implement the dual anode system for a proof of concept application in real electroless plating wastewater treatment comparisons of the removal efficiencies of multiple pollutants between different electrochemical systems were conducted 3d fluorescence spectra were utilized to qualitatively examine the destruction of organic matter in wastewater fig 6 a 6c reveals the remarkable differences in the fluorescence signals of the wastewater upon different electrochemical treatments as reported previously the excitation emission maxima appearing at around 227 304 nm peak a and 275 305 nm peak b are assigned to tyrosine like substances such as benzenesulfonic acids and their derivatives shen et al 2021 and those at 225 336 nm peak c and 275 334 nm peak d are generally categorized into tryptophan like substances lu et al 2021 the single fe anode system induced insignificant changes in the initial fluorescence peaks fig s14 suggesting the resistance of these organic pollutants to electrocoagulation in agreement with the observation of the artificial ni edta wastewater all the fluorescence peaks disappeared after a 30 min treatment with the dual anode system whereas peaks c and d existed when the single mmo anode system was operated for the same duration suggesting their persistence under the rcs dominated environment these results confirm the superior oxidizing capacity of the fe iv involved dual anode system fig 6d shows that the order of toc removal exhibited the same trend the 180 min electrolysis caused the disappearance of 2 93 21 78 and 48 52 of the toc corresponding to the single fe anode the single mmo anode and the dual fe mmo anode respectively the greater extent of destruction of organics led to larger amounts of uncomplexed ni ions which can be easily phase separated by alkaline precipitation as such the concentration of ni ion in the plating effluent after dual anode treatment dramatically decreased from 8 41 mg l 1 to 0 98 mg l 1 the residual ni concentration was much higher in the single fe anode system 7 24 mg l 1 or the single mmo anode system 4 49 mg l 1 in addition to destroying organic ligands the in situ generated fe iv was able to accelerate phosphite oxidation to phosphate which was then adsorbed by iron flocs liang et al 2020 an approximately complete removal of phosphite and tp was accomplished with the dual anode system around 40 of phosphite from 18 97 mg l 1 to 11 28 mg l 1 and tp from 19 70 mg l 1 to 11 73 mg l 1 was separated from the solution by electrocoagulation single fe anode the single mmo anode system allowed the removal of 46 of phosphite which still existed in the aqueous phase the acute toxicity of the plating effluent after electrochemical treatments was also examined electrochemical decomplexation increased the inhibition percentages and the alkaline precipitation of ni ions alleviated the inhibition which was more pronounced in the dual anode system fig s15 it should be noted that the acute toxicity of the treated effluent was still slightly higher than that of the untreated one this is attributed to the remaining organics that were not mineralized and could be resolved by prolonging the electrolysis time it can therefore be concluded that the dual anode system achieved much better performance than its single anode counterparts in terms of the simultaneous treatments of multiple pollutants including organic matter aqueous ni and phosphite and the lower toxicity of the treated solution as summarized in table 1 4 conclusions the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts is a major challenge in the application of eaops this study addressed this issue by implementing a dual anode design that included an fe anode and an mmo anode for ni edta degradation experimental evidence suggests that the dual anode system exhibited better oxidizing capacity than the single mmo or fe anode system because a much higher ni edta degradation rate was achieved the larger level of edta mineralization obtained from the dual anode system promoted the liberation of free ni ions so that greater amounts of ni precipitation from the aqueous phase were generated when alkaline was added mechanistic studies revealed that the introduction of an additional fe anode stimulated the generation of fe iv under acidic conditions thanks to the reaction between in situ generated fe ii and active chlorine the fe iv species played a critical role in accelerating edta destruction and more importantly alleviating the generation of chlorinated intermediates with the use of luminescent bacteria the toxicity of products in the fe iv dominated dual anode system was shown to be distinctly lower than that in the rcs involved single mmo system further tests with real electroless plating effluent demonstrated that the dual anode system was effective in concurrently oxidizing organic chelates and phosphite and facilitating the phase separation of aqueous ni and tp the findings derived from the dual anode system provide new guidance for the effective control of the formation of chlorinated products in eaops and present a new perspective for manipulating fe iv based oxidation techniques in electroless plating wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest

15900,the formation of chlorinated byproducts represents a significant threat to the quality of the effluent treated using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops thus spurring investigation into alleviating their production this study presents a new strategy to minimize the release of chlorinated intermediates during the electrochemical oxidation of ni edta by establishing a dual mixed metal oxide mmo fe anode system the results indicate that the dual anode system achieved a substantially higher rate 0 141 min 1 of ni edta destruction and accordingly allowed a more pronounced removal of aqueous ni from 39 85 to 0 63 mg l 1 after alkaline precipitation compared with its single mmo anode 0 017 min 1 of ni edta removal with 14 38 mg l 1 ni remaining and single fe anode insignificant ni edta removal with 38 37 mg l 1 ni remaining counterparts compared to reactive chlorine species rcs produced from the single mmo anode system fe iv was in situ generated from the dual anode system and was predominantly responsible for the attenuation of chlorinated byproducts and thus the decrease in the acute toxicity of the treated solution evaluated using luminescent bacteria the fe iv dominated dual anode system also exhibited superior performance in removing multiple pollutants including organic ligands ni and phosphite in the real electroless plating effluent the findings suggest that the strategy for fe ii transition to fe iv by active chlorine paves a new avenue for yielding less chlorinated products with lower toxicity when eaops are used to treat chloride containing organic wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical oxidation high valence fe decomplexation chlorinated byproducts active chlorine electroless plating wastewater 1 introduction electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are attractive options for mineralizing recalcitrant pollutants because of their high efficiency easily automated operation and good tunability to variable organic loads feng et al 2013 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 radjenovic et al 2020 as the electrochemical system can be powered by sustainable energy i e solar or wind energy operated at ambient pressure and atmosphere and installed on highly integrated equipment eaops are suitable for small scale decentralized wastewater treatment valero et al 2010 zheng et al 2021 chloride cl prevalent in many real waste streams can indirectly facilitate the oxidation of organic pollutants via the formation of reactive chlorine species rcs including free chlorine and chlorine radicals from the anode in the electrochemical system hao et al 2022 scialdone et al 2009 however despite the beneficial effect of cl on the treatment of wastewater the involvement of rcs in pollutant abatement inevitably causes the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts that may be more hazardous than the initial organics are for example chlorinated byproducts such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids have been monitored upon electrolysis of latrine wastewater urine and reverse osmosis retentate bagastyo et al 2011 jasper et al 2017 zöllig et al 2015 this issue poses a serious challenge for the practical application of such an electrochemical technology in recent years many studies have shown that eaops are promising options for electroless plating wastewater treatment during which the decomplexation of metal complexes is a significant step in the effective treatment of chelated metals e g ni and or cu rong et al 2022 zhao et al 2013 the destruction of ligands such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid edta or cyanide has been achieved via a direct oxidation pathway and or an indirect one utilizing in situ generated oh at the anode however the reaction pathway may be altered in the presence of cl commonly available in electroless plating wastewater because of the formation of rcs particularly chlorine radicals which could react with many organics that are abundant in amino and carboxylic groups at reasonably high rates 1010 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a to date relatively few studies have focused on how cl affects the performance of decomplexation and little information has been available on the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts in the electrochemical system as such minimizing the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts while treating cl containing electroless plating wastewater represents an important goal for studies using electrochemical methods for decomplexation to achieve this purpose we propose a new approach by selectively changing free chlorine into another highly active chlorine free species that predominantly destroy the organics our previous study has demonstrated that the combination of free chlorine and fe2 in acid medium enables the production of high value iron oxo species i e fe iv which exhibit a strong capacity for oxidizing pollutants liang et al 2020 the primary aim of the current study is to determine whether the fe iv mediated eaop outperforms the rcs mediated one in terms of higher decomplexation rates and less production of chlorinated intermediates along this line a dual anode system incorporating a mixed metal oxide mmo electrode and an fe anode was constructed for the in situ generation of fe iv in the presence of cl under acid conditions with the use of ni edta as a model compound decomplexation rates along with the products and their toxicities were evaluated and compared under different operational conditions tests with real electroless plating wastewater were also performed to prove the superiority of fe iv over rcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and electrode materials ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt na2edta nickel

dissolving niso4 and na2edta with a molar ratio of 1 1 in deionized water the ni2 edta molar ratio was 1 1 2 2 electrolysis experiments electrolysis tests of the different electrochemical systems for ni edta degradation were undertaken in an undivided cylindrical quartz electrolytic cell the dual anode system was composed of an fe plate anode an mmo anode and a stainless steel plate cathode all of which have a size of 30 30 mm with a thickness of 2 mm the cathode was placed in the center of the two anodes with 15 mm spacing the single mmo anode system and the single fe anode system were also constructed for comparison under the same conditions the experiments were run in a constant current mode controlled by a direct current power supply for each test the solution 250 ml included 0 68 mm

electrochemical reactor was run under open atmosphere and stirred at 350 rpm with a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar during the electrolysis process samples were taken with syringes at designated time intervals and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane at the end of the reaction the solution ph was adjusted to 11 with naoh to allow ni precipitation the

current a t is the electrolytic time h v is the volume of the experimental solution 0 25 l c0 is the initial concentration mg l 1 of ni and ct is the concentration of ni after alkali precipitation at the end of the reaction 2 4 evaluation of acute toxicity the acute toxicity of ni edta before and after different treatments was measured using a luminescent bacteria assay photobacterium phosphoreum supplied by nanjing cas kuake technology co ltd china were used to carry out the acute toxicity test prior to the experiments the ph was adjusted to 6 5 and the solution was immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane to remove the precipitate and quenched with na2s2o3 the sample containing 3 nacl was added to a 200 μl bacterial suspension and incubated for 30 min and the luminous intensity was then measured with a multifunctional microplate detection system biotek cytation 5 usa to evaluate acute toxicity the relative inhibition rate was calculated according to eq 2 2 ir i 0 i t i 0 100 where i0 and it are the luminous intensities of photobacterium phosphoreum in 3 nacl solution and the sample taken at time t respectively in addition to the initial and treated ni edta solution toxicity assessments were performed with nitrilotriacetic acid nickel ni nta iminodiacetic acid nickel ni imda glycine nickel ni gly adipic acid nickel ni ions and the real ni plating effluent to mask the toxicities of ni in the form of free ions and weakly complexed states produced upon electrochemical ni edta degradation 0 68 mm na2edta was added to the sample at a ratio of 1 1 v v and incubated for 12 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced oxidizing capacity of dual anode eaop for ni edta abatement comparisons of the oxidizing capacity were made between the single fe anode system the single mmo anode system and the dual mmo fe anode system for which the rates of ni edta decomplexation and the subsequent ni removal from the aqueous phase were evaluated fig 1 a shows that a significant discrepancy in the rate of edta removal was observed for different treatments note that continuous hydroxyl production at the cathode caused a ph increase fig s1 which resulted in the formation of fe flocs however very low amounts of ni edta were removed in the single fe anode system suggesting the resistance of direct edta oxidation on fe and the ineffectiveness of the adsorption and co precipitation of ni edta by fe electrocoagulation by contrast the single mmo anode facilitated ni edta decomplexation the 180 min operation allowed the disappearance of 94 2 edta this improvement was attributed to the presence of rcs in situ generated at the mmo anode dong et al 2021 zhou et al 2011 according to the literature they are capable of oxidizing metal complexes zeng et al 2016 the formation of active chlorine and its reactions with ni edta are depicted in fig s2 in which the increasing electrolysis time caused a substantial increase in the concentration of active chlorine and the presence of ni edta reduced its level in the solution at 180 min the molar ratio of active chlorine consumed 0 96 mm to edta reduced around 0 64 mm exceeded 1 1 stoichiometry suggesting that more than one chlorine atom was added to the organic compound in some byproducts which was confirmed by uplc ms analysis in the later section interestingly the oxidizing capacity of the dual anode system increased dramatically compared with the single anode systems an approximately complete removal of ni edta was observed at 60 min of operation implying that alternative reactive species were in situ produced and were favorable to the oxidation of ni edta the apparent rate constant was calculated to be 0 141 min 1 and 0 017 min 1 corresponding to the dual mmo fe anode and the single mmo anode respectively mineralization of edta was achieved in the two mmo related systems but its extent was highly dependent on oxidizing capability as illustrated in fig 1b a similar trend of toc disappearance was displayed negligible toc removal for the single fe anode and 45 0 and 83 6 of toc abatement in relation to the single mmo anode and dual mmo fe anode respectively despite the increasing ph for the three cases fig s1 which may allow the precipitation or coagulation of aqueous ni the concentration of residual ni in the solution during the reaction did not substantially decrease fig s3 nevertheless the single mmo anode induced a slight improvement in the removal of aqueous ni which was likely ascribed to ni oxidation by rcs in this case the color of the solution turned gray observed by the naked eye and the precipitates which were identified as ni3o2 oh 4 through xrd characterizations jcpds 06 0144 can be collected via filtration fig s4 the xps analysis further confirmed that the composite contained a mixture valence of ni ii and ni iii fig s4 the dual anode system improved the removal of ni in the solution with an approximately 25 loss of aqueous ni after 180 min the relatively lower levels of ni removal compared with those of edta degradation and mineralization can be explained by the following 1 ni was prone to be combined with small molecule organic intermediates instead of hydroxyl under the present ph condition fu et al 2012 and ii there was a low affinity between the negatively charged fe flocs fig s5 and the complexed ni ions it should be noted that the ph adjustment at 11 by adding alkaline distinctly promoted the removal of aqueous ni fig 1c clearly indicates the major differences in the aqueous ni solutions between different treatments when the ph was set at 11 for the dual anode treatment the ni concentration in the supernatant pronouncedly decreased from the initial 39 85 to 0 63 mgl 1 because of alkaline precipitation on the other hand the residual ni concentration was as high as 14 38 mgl 1 in the single mmo anode system this differentiation was highly consistent with the extent of edta mineralization affirming that decomplexation and destruction of organic ligands are important pretreatment steps prior to the precipitation of heavy metals fu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the sec which is an important indicator for evaluating the performance of eaops was calculated and compared between different treatments as seen from fig 1d the dual anode system corresponded to an sec of 0 29 kwh g 1 ni which was manifestly lower than the 0 41 kwh g 1 ni and 0 77 kwh g 1 ni associated with the single mmo anode system and single fe anode system respectively all the findings indicate that the dual anode system is powerful for efficiently oxidizing ni edta and subsequently enabling the precipitation of un complexed weakly complexed aqueous ni at increasing ph 3 2 identification of key reactive species further efforts were made to identify the crucial reactive species that are in situ generated from the dual anode system and are responsible for the degradation of ni edta as illustrated in fig 2 a the anodic oxidation of cl stimulated the accumulation of active chlorine in the single mmo system by contrast the introduction of fe anode significantly attenuated the amounts of active chlorine implying the active chlorine stimulated fe ii transition to other reactive species likely fe iv as we predicted previously liang et al 2020 to further confirm this a series of quenching experiments with scavengers such as tba etoh and dmso was performed to identify the key species fig 2b tba was a good scavenger for oh and cl fang et al 2014 yamazaki and piette 1991 which however barely suppressed the degradation of edta indicating the absence of oh and cl generated from the dual anode system the introduction of etoh to the electrolyte slightly inhibited ni edta decomplexation the different retardation effects of tba and etoh could be reasonably explained by their varying levels of reactivity toward fe iv previous research has reported that the reaction rate between tba and fe iv is 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 which was two orders of magnitude lower than that of etoh with fe iv 2 51 103 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 moreover the addition of dmso an fe iv scavenger the reaction rate between dmso and fe iv is 1 3 105 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2006 substantially impeded the removal of ni edta the above mentioned quenching experiments indicated that fe iv should play an important role in oxidizing ni edta this was further verified with the epr characterizations performed with dmpo as the trapping agent fig 2c clearly shows that the seven line epr spectra were observed in the single mmo anode system presumedly corresponding to dmpox bilski et al 1996 which is derived from the oxidation of dmpo by free chlorine or chlorine radicals stan and daeschel 2005 by contrast the dual anode system in the presence of cl yielded a legible signal of dmpo oh adduct which could be assigned to the production of oh the oxidation of dmpo to a radical cation followed by a nucleophilic attack of water bejan et al 2012 or the presence of fe iv for the latter previous studies have shown that the oxidation of dmpo by fe iv could result in the formation of dmpo oh via a metal catalyzed nucleophilic addition pathway wang et al 2018b to identify possible origins of the dmpo oh adduct several scavengers were individually added to the electrolyte to react preferentially with the corresponding reactive species as illustrated in fig 2d the addition of the oh scavenger i e tba seldom altered the dmpo oh signal however when fe iv scavengers i e dmso and etoh were supplemented the epr signal of dmpo oh was dramatically suppressed in particular the c center radical signals were revealed in the case of dmso addition as observed previously liang et al 2020 these results suggest the active chlorine triggered fe ii transition to fe iv when fe ii is available in the cl laden anodic system 3 3 effects of key operational parameters on ni edta degradation the effects of operational parameters such as the anode current cl concentration and solution ph on ni edta removal in the dual anode system were evaluated time course ni edta concentrations were fitted with the first order kinetic law and the apparent rate constants were calculated and compared fig 3 a shows that when the current at the mmo anode was fixed at 200 ma increasing the current applied to the fe anode from 10 to 50 ma equivalent to the current density from 1 1 to 5 5 ma cm 2 slightly improved the reaction rate however a further increase from 50 to 100 ma resulted in a decrease in ni edta removal fig s6 illustrates that increasing the current from 0 to 100 ma remarkably augmented the amount of fe ii a linear relationship between them was attained indicative of a high current efficiency in the range from 92 to 98 for fe ii production although the elevated current also resulted in increased amounts of fe iii the values were significantly lower than the fe ii concentrations even with higher applied currents thus it can be inferred that the increment in the rate of ni edta removal should be attributed to more amounts of fe ii generated in situ which promoted the production of fe iv responsible for the edta degradation the excess fe ii that results from the increased current should competitively consume the fe iv leading to a reduction in the oxidizing capacity as reported previously wang et al 2018b note that the expected lifetime of the fe anode used in this study 30 30 2 mm should be at least 270 h at the applied current of 50 ma and a current efficiency of approximately 100 raising the current applied to the mmo anode from 100 to 300 ma corresponding to the current density from 11 1 to 33 3 ma cm 2 or the cl concentration from 25 to 100 ma was conducive to the evolution of active chlorine thus enhancing the reaction rate fig 3b and 3c this reflects that rcs are the key to accelerating edta degradation as rcs function not only as oxidants but also as precursors for generating fe iv it was noticeable that the current applied to the mmo anode from 200 to 300 ma led to a relatively lower increment compared with that observed at the current from 100 to 200 ma this phenomenon is likely due to the redundant amounts of rcs produced at the high mmo current the fe ii concentration was fixed at the constant fe current the removal of ni edta in the dual anode system was highly sensitive to the solution ph because ph significantly affects the species distribution of ni edta and the transformation of reactive species dong et al 2020 fig 3d illustrates that increasing the initial ph from 2 5 to 8 5 impeded the degradation of ni edta and only ph 2 5 was favorable for edta oxidation fig s7 depicts that nih2edta and nihedta are the dominant species at low ph values and that the increasing ph yields deprotonation with niedta 2 as the main species at high ph values previous studies have shown that protonated forms are more prone to oxidation by reactive species jiraroj et al 2006 another reason for the limited removal of ni edta at ph above 4 0 was the substantial consumption of fe ii as a result of fe ii oxidation and the subsequent fe ii fe iii precipitation the decline in fe ii concentration was closely linked to the decreased level of fe iv for all the investigated conditions the order of toc removal efficiency fig s8 and the extent of aqueous ni removal after alkaline precipitation fig s9 followed the same trend as the ranking of the ni edta degradation rate this again validates that mineralization of ni edta occurs in the dual anode system which is an important step in liberating free ni ions 3 4 pathways of ni edta degradation by fe iv and rcs to elucidate the degradation pathways of ni edta degradation in the single mmo and dual anode electrochemical systems the intermediates were analyzed using uplc tof ms typical degradation intermediates such as ni ed3a ni nta ni edma ni ed2a ni imda ni eda and ni gly were detected in the fe iv dominated dual anode system the detailed uplc ms data of the identified intermediates are listed in fig s10 and table s1 this implies that the fe iv initiated ni edta degradation follows a stepwise decarboxylation process proposed in fig 4 via pathways a and b similar to oh promoted ni edta cu edta oxidation reported previously wang et al 2018a zhao et al 2014 it has been shown that fe iv with a high oxidizing capacity can preferably react with organic contaminants containing electron rich moieties wang et al 2022 pathway a involves an attack on the α position c of ch2 cooh in edta by fe iv because it has a high electron density this would result in the deprotonation of the c h bond and the formation of c centered radicals relevant studies have shown that the oxidation of organics by fe iv proceeds via one electron transfer and yields c centered radicals pestovsky and bakac 2004 the epr tests performed during the operation of the dual anode system for ni edta decomplexation provide clear evidence of the generation of unsaturated c centered radicals αn 15 5 g and αh 22 3 g which were likely to be edta fig s11 liang et al 2021 these radicals having high reducing reactivity are easily converted to transient n centered ions which are subsequently hydrolyzed ouyang et al 2015 after the decarboxylation of the acetate group ni ed3a is generated the subsequent attack on ni ed3a creates ni edma or ni ed2a followed by ni eda another degradation pathway pathway b is associated with the h abstraction reaction occurring in ch2 of n ch2 ch2 n and generating c center radicals that go through the same process and end up forming ni nta subsequently ni imda is produced after cleavage of the acetate group further removing the acetate group leads to the formation of ni gly the ultimate ni edta decarboxylation was accompanied by the accumulation of small molecule organic acids such as ch3cooh and hcooh which were detected using ion chromatography these products were also frequently detected in other advanced oxidation processes for the mineralization of ni edta cu edta wang et al 2018a zhao et al 2014 the intermediates detected in the single mmo anode system are distinctly different from those in the dual anode system ni edma and ni nta were found indicating that degradation of ni edta by rcs can also proceed via pathways a and b similar results of h abstraction from ni edta or cu edta by the attack of chlorine radicals have been documented in the literature huang et al 2019 in addition to these compounds many chlorinated byproducts were generated in accordance with the observations reported in other eaops for treating wastewater containing high concentrations of chloride and organic matter brüninghoff et al 2019 these included ni eda cl ni edma 2cl ni nta cl ni imda cl and ni gly 2cl their relevant uplc ms mass data are shown in fig s12 and table s2 the possible pathways for their formation are also proposed in fig 4 in line with a similar stepwise decarboxylation process these results provide compelling evidence that the active chlorine triggered fe ii transition to fe iv significantly minimizes chlorinated byproduct formation only ni imda cl is detectable in the dual anode system table s3 presents and compares the uplc ms data of the average peak areas of intermediates detected in both systems it is apparent that the abundance of most cl free byproducts was much higher in the dual anode system than in the single mmo system whereas the latter permitted the generation of chlorinated intermediates with relatively larger quantities 3 5 evaluation of acute toxicity upon single and dual anode treatments of ni edta to gain insight into the acute toxicity of the degradation intermediates and products bio toxicity assay with the bioluminescent bacteria photobacterium phosphoreum wang and wang 2021 a widely used method because of its convenience high sensitivity and low cost was utilized to access and compare the variations in the toxicity of the ni edta solution as depicted in fig s13a the highly complexed and stabilized ni edta has a relatively good bio inert property which slightly inhibits bioluminescence the electrochemical treatments either in the single or dual anode mode significantly increased the toxicity of the ni edta solution in photobacterium this was attributed to the fact that the degradation products including free ni ions and ni complexed low molecule ligands e g ni nta ni imda and ni gly had a much higher bioavailability which was evident from fig s13b and the results reported in a previous study on cu edta destruction by uv h2o2 wang et al 2020b to distinguish the contribution of chlorinated and un chlorinated byproducts to acute toxicity edta as an effective quencher for ni in the uncomplexed form or complexed with low molecule organics was used for the bio luminescent tests ma et al 2003 pascual et al 2020 shuttleworth and unz 1991 of particular note from fig 5 a was the gradual increase in inhibition percentage with the increase in time for the rcs dominated electrochemical system single mmo anode on the contrary for the fe iv involved electrochemical system dual mmo fe anode the inhibition rate slightly increased reached a maximum value and then decayed upon the extended time of electrolysis the inhibition percentage of the single anode system after 180 min was considerably higher than that of the dual anode system this clearly indicates a substantially larger toxicity of the chlorinated byproducts produced from the rcs initiated ni edta degradation additional experiments with the bioluminescent bacteria were conducted before and after alkaline precipitation to remove uncomplexed ni ions as shown in fig 5b the addition of alkaline to the treated solution in the dual anode system remarkably reduced the inhibition rate whereas it only slightly changed in the single mmo anode system further suggesting that more levels of mineralization were achieved by fe iv moreover the destruction of most of edta 83 6 toc removal attained upon 180 min of dual anode treatment induced a relatively small increase in the inhibition rate compared with the initial sample from 9 61 to 13 65 by contrast this value rose substantially to 83 98 for the single anode treatment operated under the same conditions the results from fig 5a and 5b prove that the presence of high concentration chloride and organic matter resulted in the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts a common behavior for eaops deborde and von gunten 2008 schaefer et al 2015 and that the abatement of chlorinated intermediates and accordingly toxicity can be addressed by a change in the rcs to fe iv 3 6 application in real electroless plating wastewater treatment further efforts were made to implement the dual anode system for a proof of concept application in real electroless plating wastewater treatment comparisons of the removal efficiencies of multiple pollutants between different electrochemical systems were conducted 3d fluorescence spectra were utilized to qualitatively examine the destruction of organic matter in wastewater fig 6 a 6c reveals the remarkable differences in the fluorescence signals of the wastewater upon different electrochemical treatments as reported previously the excitation emission maxima appearing at around 227 304 nm peak a and 275 305 nm peak b are assigned to tyrosine like substances such as benzenesulfonic acids and their derivatives shen et al 2021 and those at 225 336 nm peak c and 275 334 nm peak d are generally categorized into tryptophan like substances lu et al 2021 the single fe anode system induced insignificant changes in the initial fluorescence peaks fig s14 suggesting the resistance of these organic pollutants to electrocoagulation in agreement with the observation of the artificial ni edta wastewater all the fluorescence peaks disappeared after a 30 min treatment with the dual anode system whereas peaks c and d existed when the single mmo anode system was operated for the same duration suggesting their persistence under the rcs dominated environment these results confirm the superior oxidizing capacity of the fe iv involved dual anode system fig 6d shows that the order of toc removal exhibited the same trend the 180 min electrolysis caused the disappearance of 2 93 21 78 and 48 52 of the toc corresponding to the single fe anode the single mmo anode and the dual fe mmo anode respectively the greater extent of destruction of organics led to larger amounts of uncomplexed ni ions which can be easily phase separated by alkaline precipitation as such the concentration of ni ion in the plating effluent after dual anode treatment dramatically decreased from 8 41 mg l 1 to 0 98 mg l 1 the residual ni concentration was much higher in the single fe anode system 7 24 mg l 1 or the single mmo anode system 4 49 mg l 1 in addition to destroying organic ligands the in situ generated fe iv was able to accelerate phosphite oxidation to phosphate which was then adsorbed by iron flocs liang et al 2020 an approximately complete removal of phosphite and tp was accomplished with the dual anode system around 40 of phosphite from 18 97 mg l 1 to 11 28 mg l 1 and tp from 19 70 mg l 1 to 11 73 mg l 1 was separated from the solution by electrocoagulation single fe anode the single mmo anode system allowed the removal of 46 of phosphite which still existed in the aqueous phase the acute toxicity of the plating effluent after electrochemical treatments was also examined electrochemical decomplexation increased the inhibition percentages and the alkaline precipitation of ni ions alleviated the inhibition which was more pronounced in the dual anode system fig s15 it should be noted that the acute toxicity of the treated effluent was still slightly higher than that of the untreated one this is attributed to the remaining organics that were not mineralized and could be resolved by prolonging the electrolysis time it can therefore be concluded that the dual anode system achieved much better performance than its single anode counterparts in terms of the simultaneous treatments of multiple pollutants including organic matter aqueous ni and phosphite and the lower toxicity of the treated solution as summarized in table 1 4 conclusions the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts is a major challenge in the application of eaops this study addressed this issue by implementing a dual anode design that included an fe anode and an mmo anode for ni edta degradation experimental evidence suggests that the dual anode system exhibited better oxidizing capacity than the single mmo or fe anode system because a much higher ni edta degradation rate was achieved the larger level of edta mineralization obtained from the dual anode system promoted the liberation of free ni ions so that greater amounts of ni precipitation from the aqueous phase were generated when alkaline was added mechanistic studies revealed that the introduction of an additional fe anode stimulated the generation of fe iv under acidic conditions thanks to the reaction between in situ generated fe ii and active chlorine the fe iv species played a critical role in accelerating edta destruction and more importantly alleviating the generation of chlorinated intermediates with the use of luminescent bacteria the toxicity of products in the fe iv dominated dual anode system was shown to be distinctly lower than that in the rcs involved single mmo system further tests with real electroless plating effluent demonstrated that the dual anode system was effective in concurrently oxidizing organic chelates and phosphite and facilitating the phase separation of aqueous ni and tp the findings derived from the dual anode system provide new guidance for the effective control of the formation of chlorinated products in eaops and present a new perspective for manipulating fe iv based oxidation techniques in electroless plating wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest

chlorine resistance a sfb control strategy coupling pre oxidation coagulation sedimentation and uv aops inactivation in water treatment process was studied in lab scale five minutes pre oxidation treatment by applying cl2 and clo2 induced remarkable spore transformation longer pre oxidation exposure time didn t have apparent improvement cl2 and clo2 dosages of 0 9 mg l and 0 5 mg l were suggested respectively the formed spores can be efficiently removed by the following coagulation sedimentation treatment at a suggested dosage combination of 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam spore removal efficiency reached about 3 15 lg comparing to applying sole uv irradiation enhanced uv inactivation by adding 0 1 mm h2o2 or cl2 or peroxymonosulfate pms substantially improved the inactivation of the most chlorine resistant sfb strain lysinibacillus fusiformis uv aops stably achieved 2 lg inactivation rate at uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms inactivation kinetically enhanced 1 20 times 1 36 times and 1 91 times over sole uv irradiation intracellular dna and atp leakages were detected and remarkable damages of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells surface

isolated from a finished water and common engineering practical operations by providing engineeringly relevant references the outcomes obtained would be helpful for dealing with sfb outbreak risk in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water spore forming bacteria sfb pre oxidation coagulation sedimentation uv aops inactivation 1 introduction spore forming bacteria sfb in drinking water including bacillus sp fusiformis sp sporolactobacillus sp desulfotomaculum sp sporosarcina sp and etc can cause diseases such as diarrhea vomiting and bacteremia helgason et al 2000 luo et al 2021 moreover sfb strains exhibit great resistance to chlorine disinfection chauret et al 2001 garvey et al 2013 once cannot be properly controlled in water treatment their outbreaks in the finished water may pose a threat to drinking water security and public health for example a food poisoning case in china was revealed caused by bacillus cereus contamination in drinking water jiang 2009 in a drinking water plant in southern china which is implemented with conventional water treatment process bacteria colonies in the finished water occasionally reached the limit value 100 cfu ml specified in china s standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 our attempts for ameliorating such situation by increasing chlorine dosage in the disinfection process failed ding et al 2019 further detailed analysis revealed that most of the bacteria colonies were formed by sfb besides drinking water treatment sfb also showed present and had adverse effects in wastewater treatment especially limiting the reuse of treated wastewater luo et al 2022 shekhawat et al 2020 it advocated the need for implementing efficient sfb control measures in water treatment three sfb strains were isolated and identified from this finished water ding et al 2019 they were hence used for exploring efficient controlling alternatives in the present study due to their chlorine resistance alternative disinfection methods e g chlorine dioxide disinfection ozonation ultraviolet uv irradiation and combined processes ding et al 2019 hosni et al 2009 zeng et al 2020 have been used to inactivate sfb strains amongst these inactivation methods uv irradiation is considered an effective one that could inactivate chlorine resistant bacteria by damaging their dna and inhibiting their further reproduction hijnen et al 2006 jia et al 2020 sun et al 2013 nevertheless some bacteria become temporarily viable but non culturable vbnc presence after uv irridiation egli 2010 and may be able to reproduce again by dna photoreactivation and dark repairs li et al 2019 in addition to uv irradiation uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops showed appearent enhancement in sfb inactivation uv combined with h2o2 oxidation remarkably improved bacillus subtilis spores inactivation whose inactivation efficiency reached 3 lg at 20 mj cm2 of uv and 0 3 mm of h2o2 sun et al 2016 similar enhancements in bacillus subtilis spores inactivation were also observed when applying uv chlorine disinfection li et al 2018 and uv ozonation ekowati et al 2019 for self protection sfb can transform to spores by gene induction under harsh environmental conditions gauvry et al 2017 such as pre oxidation in drinking water treatment when transformed to spores they could be removed in coagulation sedimentation process bicudo et al 2021 and the removal efficiency showed higher than that of sfb cells jiang et al 2018 pre oxidation and coagulation sedimentation are common drinking water treatment methods aiming for micro organic pollutants degradation suspended solids and cyanobacterium removal degrémont 2007 jia et al 2018 qi et al 2021 thus besides uv enhanced inactivation at the end of drinking water treatment the coupling of pre oxidation with subsequent coagulation and sedimentation at the front stage of water treatment process was also considered to enhance the sfb removal detailed study focusing on this point however remains few moreover the sfb strains used in previous studies investigating drinking water treatment techniques were standard ones sourcing from microbiological culture collection centers cho et al 2011 jung et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 in the present study three sfb strains isolated from a finished water were used it would solidate the direct engineering relevance of the outcomes obtained in this study the goals of this study are to 1 explore the spore transformation characteristics of the three isolated sfb in different chlorine cl2 and chlorine dioxide clo2 dosages 2 investigate the spores removal efficiencies by coagulation sedimentation at varied operation conditions 3 evaluate the inactivation efficiencies of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells by uv and uv aops 4 examine the changes of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells in the regard of intracellular matters leakage cell surface morphology and their ultrastructures since the three sfb strains studied in this work were isolated from a finished water and the applied controlling operations were in their engineering practical ranges the outcomes of this study can provide a engineering relevant reference for others to deal with the risks of sfb outbreak in drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials and reagents all the glassware used in the experiments was soaked in the 0 25 naclo for over 24 h rinsed with ultrapure water nano pure 7146 thermo usa and then sterilized at 121 c for 30 min similarly phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 0 2 was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min before the experiment h2o2 naclo solution diluted to 1000 mg l active chlorine as cl2 peroxymonosulfate pms na2so3 were purchased from aladdin shanghai china polyaluminium chloride pac and polyacrylamide pam were taken from those used in the daily operation in a drinking water treatment plant nutrient broth and r2a medium were purchased from huankai microbial guangdong china 2 2 isolation and identification of spore forming bacteria in this study three sfb strains isolated from a finished water of a drinking water treatment plant in southern china were used for exploring sfb control methods gradient dilution coating method was employed in the isolation process and detailed procedures have been presented in ding et al 2019 the isolated bacteria were identified as bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis by 16s rdna gene sequencing their sequencing data have been submitted to ncbi s bankit ding et al 2019 and the corresponding genbank accession numbers were mk432812 mk418684 and mk418685 respectively according to the standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 in china the minimum contact time of chlorine disinfection is 30 min and the minimum residual chlorine in finished water is 0 3 mg l since the three isolated bacteria were found survived in and were isolated from a finished water under such chlorine disinfection conditions they were thus operationally defined as chlorine resistant bacteria their resistances to cl2 and clo2 were studied and described in part 1 in si lysinibacillus fusiformis exhibited the greatest resistance to cl2 and clo2 disinfection it was hence selected as the representative sfb strain in the experiments studying uv and uv aops inactivation 2 3 bacterial suspension preparation the three sfb strains were cultured with nutrient broth at 35 2 c for 24 h each bacteria suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with sterilized pbs three times the bacteria concentration was diluted to 106 cfu ml by pbs and subject to subsequent experimental operations 2 4 experimental procedures 2 4 1 spore transformation by pre oxidation the prepared bacterial suspension was transferred into conical glass flasks each flask contained 100 ml bacterial suspension 106 cfu ml certain amount of naclo or clo2 was added into the flask to achieve their different dosages for pre oxidation treatment naclo dosages were varied as 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 1 5 2 5 and 5 0 mg cl2 l clo2 dosages were varied as 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 mg l the flasks were then quickly sealed with silicone plugs and placed in a shaking incubator at 25 2 c and 150 rpm for 5 min or 15 min or 30 min at the end of pre oxidation the samples within the flasks were quickly quenched by adding 1 ml na2so3 solution 100 mg ml the flasks were subsequently placed in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min to kill the vegetative cells finally the number of spores in the samples was subsequently determined all the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 4 2 spore removal by coagulation sedimentation in order to precisely quantify the initial amount of sfb spores subject to coagulation and sedimentation treatment the three sfb strains were induced on solid nutrient to produce spores following the procedures presented in ding et al 2019 the produced spores were transferred into a sterilized reservoir water and diluted to an initial concentration of 106 cfu ml the reservoir is the water source of the drinking water treatment plant where the three sfb strains were isolated its water quality characteristics are shown in part 2 in si the prepared spore suspensions were next subject to coagulation sedimentation treatment in 1 l beakers pac was used as the coagulant different amount of stock pac solution was added into the spore suspensions to achieve its final dosages of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l when adding pac solution the spore suspensions were rapidly mixed at 250 r min for 1 min and slowly mixed at 50 r min for 12 min using a six pack mixer subsequently the suspensions were allowed for 30 min sedimentation before sampling the supernatant pam was further used as the flocculent to enhance coagulation treatment when applying pam pac dosage was fixed at 20 mg l and pam dosages were varied as 0 02 0 05 0 08 0 1 and 0 2 mg l one liter beakers containing spore suspensions were added with pac solution and rapidly mixed at 250 r min for 1 min followed by 50 r min for 6 min by a six pack mixer then certain amount of pam solution was added in and slow mixing was kept for another 6 min the suspensions were next allowed for 30 min sedimentation before sampling the supernatant the number of spores in the sampled supernatants were subsequently determined all the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 4 3 sfb inactivation by uv irradiation and uv aops in order to further investigate sfb inactivation efficiency of uv irradiation and uv aops for the finished water the most chlorine resistant sfb strain i e lysinibacillus fusiformis isolated from the finished water was employed as the representative sfb strain its bacteria suspension was diluted to 106 cfu ml by pbs and used for inactivation experiments a collimated beam apparatus coupled with a low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm wavelength was used for the sfb inactivation experiments part 3 in si the uv lamp was stabilized for more than 30 min prior to the experiments the ambient temperature was 25 2 c during the experiments the experiment was started by putting the petri dish 90 mm in diameter that was filled with 50 ml bacteria suspension beneath the uv lamp the uv fluence rate reaching the bacteria suspension surface was determined as 0 21 mw cm2 the bacteria suspension was gently mixed by a magnetic stirrer throughout the experiment in the experiments investigating the effects of uv aops i e uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms certain amount of h2o2 or cl2 dosed with naclo solution or pms was added into the bacteria suspension to reach a final concentration of 0 1 mm prior to the immediate uv exposure when uv dosage reached a certain value 10 20 40 60 80 or 100 mj cm2 1 ml na2so3 100 mg ml was quickly added into the bacteria suspension to quench the reaction the bacteria suspension was immediately sampled and subject to further analyses all the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 5 analytical methods the spore or colony number after the treatment was determined by pour plate method using r2a medium following the procedures presented in ding et al 2019 the samples were incubated at 35 2 c for 24 h and 30 300 cfu on a petri dish were considered as valid data the leakage of intracellular materials was investigated to evidence and evaluate sfb cell damages lysinibacillus fusiformis bacteria suspension before and after the inactivation experimet was pretreated by centrifugating at 8000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was subsequently sampled to determine the contents of dna and atp dna was determined using a micro spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo usa atp was analyzed by a luminometer glomax 20 20 promega biosystems usa with the bactiter glotm reagent g8231 promega usa wen et al 2015 the morphology and ultrastructure of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells before and after inactivation were examined respectively by scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were collected by centrifugating at 8000 rpm for 10 min washed with pbs for three times and then fixed overnight in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c the fixed lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were washed with pbs for three times and then fixed in the 1 osmic acid for 2 h at room temperature subsequently the lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were washed with pbs for three times again and then sequentially dehydrated thrice by 30 50 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol for sem analysis the dehydrated lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were dried in hexamethyldisilazane for 15 min thrice coated with platinum and then observed by sem su8100 hitachi japan for tem analysis the dehydrated lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were orderly treated with 100 propylene oxide and embedding medium the formed resin block was then sectioned using an ultramicrotome em uc7 leica germany and observed by tem ht7700 hitachi japan 2 6 data analysis the efficiency of enhanced spore transformation by pre oxidation was evaluated using changes of lg n c in this study n c was assigned to express the counted spore number after pre oxidation treatment the removal or inactivation efficiency was expressed by the logarithmic inactivation rate lg n 0 nt where n 0 and nt represent the number of bacteria before and after coagulation sedimentation or inactivation chick watson model eq 1 was used to describe a linear relationship between the inactivation efficiency and the reaction time 1 lg n 0 n t k i t where k i and t respectively represent the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant cm2 mj the intensity of uv light mw cm2 and uv irradiation time s 3 results and discussion 3 1 spore transformation by pre oxidation cl2 and clo2 are the widely used pre oxidants and disinfectants in water treatment their effects on spore formation of the three isolated sfb strains were studied the results were shown in fig 1 the proportion of the formed spores out of total bacteria cells was remarkably increased once cl2 or clo2 was dosed and finally reached near 100 spore transformation at a higher dosage it demonstrated that pre oxidation can indeed induce spore transformation of sfb pre oxidation exposure time didn t have apparent improvement the sfb strains basically completed spore transformation within 5 min long pre oxidation treatment cl2 dosage at 0 9 mg l showed a breaking point of the variation trend of spore proportion before which spore proportion increased apparently along with increasing cl2 dosage when cl2 dosage was 0 9 mg l spore proportions of the three sfb strains already reached over 75 further adding more cl2 led to slight increase in spore proportion near 100 spore formation was observed when cl2 dosage was increased as high as 5 mg l dosing clo2 showed immediate effect on the transformation of spores whose proportion sharply increased to 66 90 at a clo2 dosage of 0 2 mg l increasing clo2 dosage mildly improved spore transformation near 100 spore transformation was observed at 1 mg l clo2 dosage compared with cl2 clo2 addition at a lower dosage can achieve a higher spore transformation it s in consistence with their oxidation capacity the oxidation capacity of clo2 at 0 38 mg l is theoretically equivalent to that of cl2 at 1 mg l jia et al 2020 although experimental results showed the pre oxidation at 5 mg l cl2 or 1 mg l clo2 dosage brought almost complete spore transformation fig 1 these dosages are far beyond the common operations in water treatment plants in the studied city pre oxidation is implemented for organic contaminants removal in several other water treatment plants sharing a common raw water source with the plant where the three sfb strains were isolated from its finished water their operating dosages of cl2 and clo2 are usually around 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively in this study at 0 9 mg l cl2 and 0 5 mg l clo2 dosages spore transformation ratios of the three isolated sfb strains were severally 75 and 80 it indicated that sfb cells can be largely transformed to spores and may be removed in the following coagulation sedimentation treatment details see section 3 2 therefore cl2 and clo2 dosages of 0 9 mg l and 0 5 mg l were suggested for sfb spore conversion in water treatment the initial sfb bacteria concentration used in the pre oxidation experiment was 106 cfu ml this value is far higher than that in raw water 102 cfu ml jiang et al 2018 so the suggested cl2 and clo2 dosages shall have efficient sfb spore transformation in practical operation considering other influencing factors except sfb amount the specific dosages of cl2 and clo2 used for a raw water of course need to be determined by experiments according to its contamination and biological characteristics such as organic matter concentration algae density and reductive inorganic solutes 3 2 spore removal by coagulation sedimentation once spores are formed they are expected to be removed in coagulation sedimentation treatment that is commonly implemented in drinking water treatment plants spore removal efficiency using the common used coagulant and flocculent i e pac and pam was examined within their engineering relevant dosages fig 2 the removal efficiency of spores through coagulation sedimentation treatment when applied different pac dosages was shown in fig 2 a sole addition of pac at a dosage of 10 mg l recorded an about 0 85 lg spore removal efficiency for the three sfb strains when pac dosage was increased to 20 mg l and 30 mg l around 1 2 lg and 1 9 lg removal efficiencies were achieved respectively further increasing pac dosage to 40 mg l and 50 mg l did not much improve spore removal efficiency and it kept being about 2 lg because the exosporium and coat of spores are mainly composed of the hydrophobic lipid and protein the sfb spores are with high hydrophobicity ding et al 2019 elhariry 2011 the high hydrophobicity often leads to strong partition to non aqueous phase an and friedman 1998 additionally the sfb spores have an electronegativity nassima et al 2015 the hydrolyzed polymerization products of pac are positive charged in coagulation treatment cui et al 2020 lee et al 2000 thus the spores are easy to be destabilized in coagulation treatment and they can be incorporated into larger flocs with other negatively charged small particles including colloids and natural organic matters nom the settleability of the larger flocs would be further improved through charge neutralization adsorption and floc sweeping and they can be removed from the water in the following sedimentation process it was reported that the respective removal efficiencies for aerobic and anaerobic spores were 1 26 lg and 1 68 lg when being subject to pre chlorination followed by coagulation sedimentation treatment galofré et al 2004 based on the above rationale when the dosage of pac was 30 mg l the larger flocs with superior settleability had been formed then the contribution of further increasing pac dosage to 40 mg l and 50 mg l to the larger flocs formation and their settleability enhancement was marginal distinct improvement of spore removal efficiency was not observed when increasing pac dosage to 40 mg l and 50 mg l compared with 30 mg l what s more if the dosage of pac was further increased restabilization would occur with overdosing the already formed flocs started to be dispersed due to restabilization which may lead to the decrease of spore removal efficiency duan and gregory 2003 tang et al 2015 pam with spread molecular chains can further induce enhanced adsorption bridging enmeshment and sweeping effects zhao et al 2018 though 2 lg spore removal efficiency has been achieved in coagulation sedimentation treatment with sole pac addition additional pam dosing was thought to potentially further enhance spores removal hence spores removal at different pam dosages and with a fixed pac dosage 20 mg l was further investigated fig 2 b spore removal efficiencies of the three sfb strains firstly increased with increasing pam dosage and reached a plateau after pam dosage was as high as 0 08 mg l spore removal efficiencies reached about 3 15 lg it was increased by around 2 lg compared with 20 mg l dosage but without pam addition indicating a great improvement by the addition of pam based on the above results when adding pac alone pac dosage of 30 mg l is recommended for sfb spore removal in drinking water treatment in the case of applying both pac and pam a dosage combination of 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam is suggested these dosages are basically in the ranges of those used in drinking water treatment and obtained in previous studies i e pac dosage of 10 40 mg l pam dosage of 0 02 0 2 mg l hu et al 2016 ma et al 2017 in summary at the suggested cl2 0 9 mg l or clo2 0 5 mg l dosages spore transformation ratios achieved severally 75 and 80 in this study in the following coagulation sedimentation treatment most of the transformed spores 3 15 lg was removed at suggested dosage combination of 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam it can be seen that pre oxidation is the critical control point in sfb removal by the coupling of pre oxidation with the subsequent coagulation and sedimentation 3 3 lysinibacillus fusiformis cells inactivation and damages by uv aops although most spores transformed through pre oxidation were efficiently removed by the following coagulation sedimentation treatment the remaining sfb cells are still possible to penetrate the water treatment process and go into the clear water pool therefore enhanced disinfection is necessary to inactivate them at the end of drinking water treatment process since lysinibacillus fusiformis exhibited the greatest resistance to cl2 and clo2 disinfection see section 2 2 the optimized inactivation method and related parameters towards this sfb strain were investigated the obtained results shall be applicable for other sfb strains lysinibacillus fusiformis showed a little bit resistance to sole uv irradiation uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 maginally had 2 lg inactivation for lysinibacillus fusiformis cells fig 3 to confidently ensure its 2 lg inactivation a higher uv dosage i e 60 and 80 mj cm2 had to be implemented the regulated uv dosage is 40 mj cm2 for drinking water disinfection nourmoradi et al 2012 and it has been reported that more than 2 lg of bateria in drinking water can be inactivated by uv irradation at 40 mj cm2 lehtola et al 2003 the results of sole uv irradiation indicated the needs for enhanced uv inactivation of sfb uv aops showed substantially improved the inactivation of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells fig 3 by adding 0 1 mm h2o2 cl2 and pms uv aops stably achieved 2 lg inactivation rate of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells at uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 uv pms offered the greatest enhancement it even reached 3 lg inactivation of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells at uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 to assess the viability of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells the variation of extracellular dna genetic material and atp energy carrier were detected before and after uv and uv aops inactivation fig 4 there were almost no changes in extracellular dna concentration before and after uv irradiation even with uv dosage up to 100 mj cm2 fig 4 a however extracellular dna was observed when lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were subject to uv aops treatment extracellular dna concentration gradually increased with the increase of uv dosage in uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms inactivation treatment the increments showed in the order of uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 the observed increase in extracellular dna concentration can be attributed to the damage of cell wall and cell membrane allowing the release of intracellular genetic materials into the surrounding environment uv irradiation is well known to inactivate microorganisms by damaging their dna or rna but without cell wall destruction chatterley and linden 2010 chevremont et al 2012 thereby not leading to the release of intracellular materials the detected extracellular dna thus indicated the occurrence of cell wall and cell membrane damages in uv aops treatments as a result photoreactivation and dark repairs shall be inhibited after uv aops treatments wen et al 2019 this might be an advantage of uv aops over uv we also detected the changes in extracellular atp concentrations in lysinibacillus fusiformis cells samples inactivated by uv and uv aops treatments which had a similar trend as those of extracellular dna fig 4 b atp is an activated energy carrier in all viable cells it has been indicated that the concentration of permeablilized cells correlated well with the concentration of extracellular atp hammes et al 2010 the detected extracellular atp further justified intracellular materials leakage due to cell wall and cell membrane damaging in uv aops treatments the morphology of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells before and after uv or uv aops inactivation treatment was examined by sem fig 5 lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were rod shaped and plump and the surfaces were smooth before the uv and uv aops inactivation treatment fig 5 a once being subject to uv inactivation the surfaces of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were with slight shrinkage but intact and shall not lead to intracellular materials leakage fig 5 b however when being exposed to uv aops treatment lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were apparently destroyed the extent of cells damages were observed following the order of uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 fig 5 c d e cell surfaces became rough with folds especially for those treated by uv pms some cells developed sunken surfaces and even lost structural integrity though intracellular materials leakage could not be directly observed by sem analysis the visualized remarkable impacts on the surface morphology suggested substantial damages had been imposed on lysinibacillus fusiformis cells when being subject to uv aops inactivation treatment the ultrastructure of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells was observed by tem fig 6 overall before inactivation treatments no obvious edema and shrinkage were observed in the cells fig 6 a the cells internal structure and morphology were clear the protoplasm was abundant and scattered in the cells the protein mucosal layer was uniform cell wall was with uniform thickness and cell membrane was intact no obvious plasmolysis was found and a small amount of metachromatic granules were present in the cells nevertheless after uv inactivation treatment although the cells were intact as a whole they showed irregular shape and the cell wall became thicker the intracellular structure was disordered and the nucleoid area was dense fig 6 b for those inactivated by uv aops especially uv pms treatment the cells showed moderate or severe edema and were damaged to different degrees fig 6 c d e the protein mucosa was sparse and the thickness of cell wall was uneven large areas of intracellular edema with low electron density and cytoplasmic agglutination were observed indicating disintegrating of the cells especially for those treated by uv pms the noticeable damages to the ultrastructure of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells by uv aops inactivation treatment echoed well with the observed dna and atp leakage fig 4 3 4 uv photolysis enhanced sfb inactivation the above results showed substantial enhancement in lysinibacillus fusiformis cells inactivation by uv aops treatments with the occurrence of intracellular materials leakage and remarkle surface and ultrastructure damages besides the extent of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells inactivation inactivation kinetics of uv and uv aops was also assessed using chick watson model fitting part 4 in si the inactivation kinetics rate constants were severally 0 0336 cm2 mj 0 0404 cm2 mj 0 0445 cm2 mj and 0 0642 cm2 mj by uv uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms inactivation kinetically enhanced 1 20 times 1 36 times and 1 91 times over sole uv inactivation literatures have reported that sole h2o2 and pms had no chemical inactivation for spore forming microorganisms at a dosage of 0 1 mm wen et al 2017 our practical attempts of increasing chlorine dosage also failed in efficient sfb inactivation the observed uv enhanced inactivation by adding 0 1 mm h2o2 cl2 and pms shall relate to uv photolysis of the added reagents it is widely recognized that uv photolysis of h2o2 cl2 and pms can produce oh cl and so 4 radicals as described by the following reactions eq 2 5 fang et al 2014 feng et al 2007 hua et al 2019 luo et al 2015 2 h 2 o 2 h v 2 oh φ 0 50 mol einstei n 1 3 hclo h v oh cl φ 1 00 mol einstei n 1 4 cl o h 2 o h v oh cl o h φ 0 90 mol einstei n 1 5 hso 5 h v oh so 4 φ 0 52 mol einstei n 1 where φ is the quantum yields for photolysis oh cl and so 4 are strong oxidants with the standard reduction potentials of 1 8 2 7 v 2 4 v and 2 5 3 1 v respectively beitz et al 1998 ghanbari and moradi 2016 hua et al 2019 it have been proved that these reactive radicals can react with cell wall and cell membrane and further destroy them leading to the leakage of intracellular components such as dna atp and proteins xiao et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 upon the breaking of cell wall and cell membrane and the leakage of intracellular substances cell damages would be thus caused rattanakul and oguma 2017 wen et al 2017 the observed intracellular materials leakage and lysinibacillus fusiformis cells surface and ultrastructure damages in this study corresponded well this mechanism the quantum yields of cl2 and pms are higher than h2o2 and the standard reduction potential of so 4 is higher than that of cl the differences in radicals generating efficiency and radicals oxidizing capacity may be responsible for the observed inactivation rate order of uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 furthermore compared with uv irradiation uv pms treatment is not as markedly influenced by the water characteristics wen et al 2017 thus it might be the more practical application in the drinking water treatment except for the above reactive radicals produced by uv aops when cells are exposed to an external chemical or physical stressor mesquita et al 2013 excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species ros formed during metabolism may also destroy cellular structure and cellular contents increase the membrane permeability damage the intracellular compounds and function and result in cell death guo et al 2019 wan et al 2020 wen et al 2020 currently the study of sfb inactivation associated with ros analysis still remains few therefore the functions of intracellular ros and the associated effects on intracellular structures and contents such as metabolic enzymes nucleic acids and lipid membranes in sfb inactivation by uv aops should be focused in future studies for obtaining deeper understanding of the sfb inactivation mechanisms 4 conclusions in this study the main conclusions are as follows 1 under five minutes pre oxidation conditions 0 9 mg l cl2 and 0 5 mg l clo2 were suggested to induce spore transformation of sfb strains and the spore transformation ratios of the three isolated sfb strains were respectively 75 and 80 2 the spores could be effectively removed in coagulation sedimentation process spore removal efficiencies of the three isolated sfb strain were around 2 lg when using 30 mg l pac alone and those reached about 3 15 lg when applying both 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam 3 the inactivation efficiency of lysinibacillus fusiformis by uv aops treatment was greatly enhanced over uv irradiation alone the inactivation order followed by uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 and the inactivation accorded with the first order chick watson kinetics 4 uv irradiation inactivated the bacteria by damaging dna but did not break the cellular structure compared to uv irradiation alone uv aops treatment caused the leakage of intracellular matters and the damage of morphology and ultrastructure and ultimately result in the death of bacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

kinetically enhanced 1 20 times 1 36 times and 1 91 times over sole uv irradiation intracellular dna and atp leakages were detected and remarkable damages of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells surface

isolated from a finished water and common engineering practical operations by providing engineeringly relevant references the outcomes obtained would be helpful for dealing with sfb outbreak risk in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water spore forming bacteria sfb pre oxidation coagulation sedimentation uv aops inactivation 1 introduction spore forming bacteria sfb in drinking water including bacillus sp fusiformis sp sporolactobacillus sp desulfotomaculum sp sporosarcina sp and etc can cause diseases such as diarrhea vomiting and bacteremia helgason et al 2000 luo et al 2021 moreover sfb strains exhibit great resistance to chlorine disinfection chauret et al 2001 garvey et al 2013 once cannot be properly controlled in water treatment their outbreaks in the finished water may pose a threat to drinking water security and public health for example a food poisoning case in china was revealed caused by bacillus cereus contamination in drinking water jiang 2009 in a drinking water plant in southern china which is implemented with conventional water treatment process bacteria colonies in the finished water occasionally reached the limit value 100 cfu ml specified in china s standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 our attempts for ameliorating such situation by increasing chlorine dosage in the disinfection process failed ding et al 2019 further detailed analysis revealed that most of the bacteria colonies were formed by sfb besides drinking water treatment sfb also showed present and had adverse effects in wastewater treatment especially limiting the reuse of treated wastewater luo et al 2022 shekhawat et al 2020 it advocated the need for implementing efficient sfb control measures in water treatment three sfb strains were isolated and identified from this finished water ding et al 2019 they were hence used for exploring efficient controlling alternatives in the present study due to their chlorine resistance alternative disinfection methods e g chlorine dioxide disinfection ozonation ultraviolet uv irradiation and combined processes ding et al 2019 hosni et al 2009 zeng et al 2020 have been used to inactivate sfb strains amongst these inactivation methods uv irradiation is considered an effective one that could inactivate chlorine resistant bacteria by damaging their dna and inhibiting their further reproduction hijnen et al 2006 jia et al 2020 sun et al 2013 nevertheless some bacteria become temporarily viable but non culturable vbnc presence after uv irridiation egli 2010 and may be able to reproduce again by dna photoreactivation and dark repairs li et al 2019 in addition to uv irradiation uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops showed appearent enhancement in sfb inactivation uv combined with h2o2 oxidation remarkably improved bacillus subtilis spores inactivation whose inactivation efficiency reached 3 lg at 20 mj cm2 of uv and 0 3 mm of h2o2 sun et al 2016 similar enhancements in bacillus subtilis spores inactivation were also observed when applying uv chlorine disinfection li et al 2018 and uv ozonation ekowati et al 2019 for self protection sfb can transform to spores by gene induction under harsh environmental conditions gauvry et al 2017 such as pre oxidation in drinking water treatment when transformed to spores they could be removed in coagulation sedimentation process bicudo et al 2021 and the removal efficiency showed higher than that of sfb cells jiang et al 2018 pre oxidation and coagulation sedimentation are common drinking water treatment methods aiming for micro organic pollutants degradation suspended solids and cyanobacterium removal degrémont 2007 jia et al 2018 qi et al 2021 thus besides uv enhanced inactivation at the end of drinking water treatment the coupling of pre oxidation with subsequent coagulation and sedimentation at the front stage of water treatment process was also considered to enhance the sfb removal detailed study focusing on this point however remains few moreover the sfb strains used in previous studies investigating drinking water treatment techniques were standard ones sourcing from microbiological culture collection centers cho et al 2011 jung et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 in the present study three sfb strains isolated from a finished water were used it would solidate the direct engineering relevance of the outcomes obtained in this study the goals of this study are to 1 explore the spore transformation characteristics of the three isolated sfb in different chlorine cl2 and chlorine dioxide clo2 dosages 2 investigate the spores removal efficiencies by coagulation sedimentation at varied operation conditions 3 evaluate the inactivation efficiencies of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells by uv and uv aops 4 examine the changes of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells in the regard of intracellular matters leakage cell surface morphology and their ultrastructures since the three sfb strains studied in this work were isolated from a finished water and the applied controlling operations were in their engineering practical ranges the outcomes of this study can provide a engineering relevant reference for others to deal with the risks of sfb outbreak in drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials and reagents all the glassware used in the experiments was soaked in the 0 25 naclo for over 24 h rinsed with ultrapure water nano pure 7146 thermo usa and then sterilized at 121 c for 30 min similarly phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 0 2 was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min before the experiment h2o2 naclo solution diluted to 1000 mg l active chlorine as cl2 peroxymonosulfate pms na2so3 were purchased from aladdin shanghai china polyaluminium chloride pac and polyacrylamide pam were taken from those used in the daily operation in a drinking water treatment plant nutrient broth and r2a medium were purchased from huankai microbial guangdong china 2 2 isolation and identification of spore forming bacteria in this study three sfb strains isolated from a finished water of a drinking water treatment plant in southern china were used for exploring sfb control methods gradient dilution coating method was employed in the isolation process and detailed procedures have been presented in ding et al 2019 the isolated bacteria were identified as bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis by 16s rdna gene sequencing their sequencing data have been submitted to ncbi s bankit ding et al 2019 and the corresponding genbank accession numbers were mk432812 mk418684 and mk418685 respectively according to the standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 in china the minimum contact time of chlorine disinfection is 30 min and the minimum residual chlorine in finished water is 0 3 mg l since the three isolated bacteria were found survived in and were isolated from a finished water under such chlorine disinfection conditions they were thus operationally defined as chlorine resistant bacteria their resistances to cl2 and clo2 were studied and described in part 1 in si lysinibacillus fusiformis exhibited the greatest resistance to cl2 and clo2 disinfection it was hence selected as the representative sfb strain in the experiments studying uv and uv aops inactivation 2 3 bacterial suspension preparation the three sfb strains were cultured with nutrient broth at 35 2 c for 24 h each bacteria suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with sterilized pbs three times the bacteria concentration was diluted to 106 cfu ml by pbs and subject to subsequent experimental operations 2 4 experimental procedures 2 4 1 spore transformation by pre oxidation the prepared bacterial suspension was transferred into conical glass flasks each flask contained 100 ml bacterial suspension 106 cfu ml certain amount of naclo or clo2 was added into the flask to achieve their different dosages for pre oxidation treatment naclo dosages were varied as 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 1 5 2 5 and 5 0 mg cl2 l clo2 dosages were varied as 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 mg l the flasks were then quickly sealed with silicone plugs and placed in a shaking incubator at 25 2 c and 150 rpm for 5 min or 15 min or 30 min at the end of pre oxidation the samples within the flasks were quickly quenched by adding 1 ml na2so3 solution 100 mg ml the flasks were subsequently placed in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min to kill the vegetative cells finally the number of spores in the samples was subsequently determined all the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 4 2 spore removal by coagulation sedimentation in order to precisely quantify the initial amount of sfb spores subject to coagulation and sedimentation treatment the three sfb strains were induced on solid nutrient to produce spores following the procedures presented in ding et al 2019 the produced spores were transferred into a sterilized reservoir water and diluted to an initial concentration of 106 cfu ml the reservoir is the water source of the drinking water treatment plant where the three sfb strains were isolated its water quality characteristics are shown in part 2 in si the prepared spore suspensions were next subject to coagulation sedimentation treatment in 1 l beakers pac was used as the coagulant different amount of stock pac solution was added into the spore suspensions to achieve its final dosages of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l when adding pac solution the spore suspensions were rapidly mixed at 250 r min for 1 min and slowly mixed at 50 r min for 12 min using a six pack mixer subsequently the suspensions were allowed for 30 min sedimentation before sampling the supernatant pam was further used as the flocculent to enhance coagulation treatment when applying pam pac dosage was fixed at 20 mg l and pam dosages were varied as 0 02 0 05 0 08 0 1 and 0 2 mg l one liter beakers containing spore suspensions were added with pac solution and rapidly mixed at 250 r min for 1 min followed by 50 r min for 6 min by a six pack mixer then certain amount of pam solution was added in and slow mixing was kept for another 6 min the suspensions were next allowed for 30 min sedimentation before sampling the supernatant the number of spores in the sampled supernatants were subsequently determined all the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 4 3 sfb inactivation by uv irradiation and uv aops in order to further investigate sfb inactivation efficiency of uv irradiation and uv aops for the finished water the most chlorine resistant sfb strain i e lysinibacillus fusiformis isolated from the finished water was employed as the representative sfb strain its bacteria suspension was diluted to 106 cfu ml by pbs and used for inactivation experiments a collimated beam apparatus coupled with a low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm wavelength was used for the sfb inactivation experiments part 3 in si the uv lamp was stabilized for more than 30 min prior to the experiments the ambient temperature was 25 2 c during the experiments the experiment was started by putting the petri dish 90 mm in diameter that was filled with 50 ml bacteria suspension beneath the uv lamp the uv fluence rate reaching the bacteria suspension surface was determined as 0 21 mw cm2 the bacteria suspension was gently mixed by a magnetic stirrer throughout the experiment in the experiments investigating the effects of uv aops i e uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms certain amount of h2o2 or cl2 dosed with naclo solution or pms was added into the bacteria suspension to reach a final concentration of 0 1 mm prior to the immediate uv exposure when uv dosage reached a certain value 10 20 40 60 80 or 100 mj cm2 1 ml na2so3 100 mg ml was quickly added into the bacteria suspension to quench the reaction the bacteria suspension was immediately sampled and subject to further analyses all the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 5 analytical methods the spore or colony number after the treatment was determined by pour plate method using r2a medium following the procedures presented in ding et al 2019 the samples were incubated at 35 2 c for 24 h and 30 300 cfu on a petri dish were considered as valid data the leakage of intracellular materials was investigated to evidence and evaluate sfb cell damages lysinibacillus fusiformis bacteria suspension before and after the inactivation experimet was pretreated by centrifugating at 8000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was subsequently sampled to determine the contents of dna and atp dna was determined using a micro spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo usa atp was analyzed by a luminometer glomax 20 20 promega biosystems usa with the bactiter glotm reagent g8231 promega usa wen et al 2015 the morphology and ultrastructure of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells before and after inactivation were examined respectively by scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were collected by centrifugating at 8000 rpm for 10 min washed with pbs for three times and then fixed overnight in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c the fixed lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were washed with pbs for three times and then fixed in the 1 osmic acid for 2 h at room temperature subsequently the lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were washed with pbs for three times again and then sequentially dehydrated thrice by 30 50 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol for sem analysis the dehydrated lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were dried in hexamethyldisilazane for 15 min thrice coated with platinum and then observed by sem su8100 hitachi japan for tem analysis the dehydrated lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were orderly treated with 100 propylene oxide and embedding medium the formed resin block was then sectioned using an ultramicrotome em uc7 leica germany and observed by tem ht7700 hitachi japan 2 6 data analysis the efficiency of enhanced spore transformation by pre oxidation was evaluated using changes of lg n c in this study n c was assigned to express the counted spore number after pre oxidation treatment the removal or inactivation efficiency was expressed by the logarithmic inactivation rate lg n 0 nt where n 0 and nt represent the number of bacteria before and after coagulation sedimentation or inactivation chick watson model eq 1 was used to describe a linear relationship between the inactivation efficiency and the reaction time 1 lg n 0 n t k i t where k i and t respectively represent the pseudo first order inactivation rate constant cm2 mj the intensity of uv light mw cm2 and uv irradiation time s 3 results and discussion 3 1 spore transformation by pre oxidation cl2 and clo2 are the widely used pre oxidants and disinfectants in water treatment their effects on spore formation of the three isolated sfb strains were studied the results were shown in fig 1 the proportion of the formed spores out of total bacteria cells was remarkably increased once cl2 or clo2 was dosed and finally reached near 100 spore transformation at a higher dosage it demonstrated that pre oxidation can indeed induce spore transformation of sfb pre oxidation exposure time didn t have apparent improvement the sfb strains basically completed spore transformation within 5 min long pre oxidation treatment cl2 dosage at 0 9 mg l showed a breaking point of the variation trend of spore proportion before which spore proportion increased apparently along with increasing cl2 dosage when cl2 dosage was 0 9 mg l spore proportions of the three sfb strains already reached over 75 further adding more cl2 led to slight increase in spore proportion near 100 spore formation was observed when cl2 dosage was increased as high as 5 mg l dosing clo2 showed immediate effect on the transformation of spores whose proportion sharply increased to 66 90 at a clo2 dosage of 0 2 mg l increasing clo2 dosage mildly improved spore transformation near 100 spore transformation was observed at 1 mg l clo2 dosage compared with cl2 clo2 addition at a lower dosage can achieve a higher spore transformation it s in consistence with their oxidation capacity the oxidation capacity of clo2 at 0 38 mg l is theoretically equivalent to that of cl2 at 1 mg l jia et al 2020 although experimental results showed the pre oxidation at 5 mg l cl2 or 1 mg l clo2 dosage brought almost complete spore transformation fig 1 these dosages are far beyond the common operations in water treatment plants in the studied city pre oxidation is implemented for organic contaminants removal in several other water treatment plants sharing a common raw water source with the plant where the three sfb strains were isolated from its finished water their operating dosages of cl2 and clo2 are usually around 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively in this study at 0 9 mg l cl2 and 0 5 mg l clo2 dosages spore transformation ratios of the three isolated sfb strains were severally 75 and 80 it indicated that sfb cells can be largely transformed to spores and may be removed in the following coagulation sedimentation treatment details see section 3 2 therefore cl2 and clo2 dosages of 0 9 mg l and 0 5 mg l were suggested for sfb spore conversion in water treatment the initial sfb bacteria concentration used in the pre oxidation experiment was 106 cfu ml this value is far higher than that in raw water 102 cfu ml jiang et al 2018 so the suggested cl2 and clo2 dosages shall have efficient sfb spore transformation in practical operation considering other influencing factors except sfb amount the specific dosages of cl2 and clo2 used for a raw water of course need to be determined by experiments according to its contamination and biological characteristics such as organic matter concentration algae density and reductive inorganic solutes 3 2 spore removal by coagulation sedimentation once spores are formed they are expected to be removed in coagulation sedimentation treatment that is commonly implemented in drinking water treatment plants spore removal efficiency using the common used coagulant and flocculent i e pac and pam was examined within their engineering relevant dosages fig 2 the removal efficiency of spores through coagulation sedimentation treatment when applied different pac dosages was shown in fig 2 a sole addition of pac at a dosage of 10 mg l recorded an about 0 85 lg spore removal efficiency for the three sfb strains when pac dosage was increased to 20 mg l and 30 mg l around 1 2 lg and 1 9 lg removal efficiencies were achieved respectively further increasing pac dosage to 40 mg l and 50 mg l did not much improve spore removal efficiency and it kept being about 2 lg because the exosporium and coat of spores are mainly composed of the hydrophobic lipid and protein the sfb spores are with high hydrophobicity ding et al 2019 elhariry 2011 the high hydrophobicity often leads to strong partition to non aqueous phase an and friedman 1998 additionally the sfb spores have an electronegativity nassima et al 2015 the hydrolyzed polymerization products of pac are positive charged in coagulation treatment cui et al 2020 lee et al 2000 thus the spores are easy to be destabilized in coagulation treatment and they can be incorporated into larger flocs with other negatively charged small particles including colloids and natural organic matters nom the settleability of the larger flocs would be further improved through charge neutralization adsorption and floc sweeping and they can be removed from the water in the following sedimentation process it was reported that the respective removal efficiencies for aerobic and anaerobic spores were 1 26 lg and 1 68 lg when being subject to pre chlorination followed by coagulation sedimentation treatment galofré et al 2004 based on the above rationale when the dosage of pac was 30 mg l the larger flocs with superior settleability had been formed then the contribution of further increasing pac dosage to 40 mg l and 50 mg l to the larger flocs formation and their settleability enhancement was marginal distinct improvement of spore removal efficiency was not observed when increasing pac dosage to 40 mg l and 50 mg l compared with 30 mg l what s more if the dosage of pac was further increased restabilization would occur with overdosing the already formed flocs started to be dispersed due to restabilization which may lead to the decrease of spore removal efficiency duan and gregory 2003 tang et al 2015 pam with spread molecular chains can further induce enhanced adsorption bridging enmeshment and sweeping effects zhao et al 2018 though 2 lg spore removal efficiency has been achieved in coagulation sedimentation treatment with sole pac addition additional pam dosing was thought to potentially further enhance spores removal hence spores removal at different pam dosages and with a fixed pac dosage 20 mg l was further investigated fig 2 b spore removal efficiencies of the three sfb strains firstly increased with increasing pam dosage and reached a plateau after pam dosage was as high as 0 08 mg l spore removal efficiencies reached about 3 15 lg it was increased by around 2 lg compared with 20 mg l dosage but without pam addition indicating a great improvement by the addition of pam based on the above results when adding pac alone pac dosage of 30 mg l is recommended for sfb spore removal in drinking water treatment in the case of applying both pac and pam a dosage combination of 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam is suggested these dosages are basically in the ranges of those used in drinking water treatment and obtained in previous studies i e pac dosage of 10 40 mg l pam dosage of 0 02 0 2 mg l hu et al 2016 ma et al 2017 in summary at the suggested cl2 0 9 mg l or clo2 0 5 mg l dosages spore transformation ratios achieved severally 75 and 80 in this study in the following coagulation sedimentation treatment most of the transformed spores 3 15 lg was removed at suggested dosage combination of 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam it can be seen that pre oxidation is the critical control point in sfb removal by the coupling of pre oxidation with the subsequent coagulation and sedimentation 3 3 lysinibacillus fusiformis cells inactivation and damages by uv aops although most spores transformed through pre oxidation were efficiently removed by the following coagulation sedimentation treatment the remaining sfb cells are still possible to penetrate the water treatment process and go into the clear water pool therefore enhanced disinfection is necessary to inactivate them at the end of drinking water treatment process since lysinibacillus fusiformis exhibited the greatest resistance to cl2 and clo2 disinfection see section 2 2 the optimized inactivation method and related parameters towards this sfb strain were investigated the obtained results shall be applicable for other sfb strains lysinibacillus fusiformis showed a little bit resistance to sole uv irradiation uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 maginally had 2 lg inactivation for lysinibacillus fusiformis cells fig 3 to confidently ensure its 2 lg inactivation a higher uv dosage i e 60 and 80 mj cm2 had to be implemented the regulated uv dosage is 40 mj cm2 for drinking water disinfection nourmoradi et al 2012 and it has been reported that more than 2 lg of bateria in drinking water can be inactivated by uv irradation at 40 mj cm2 lehtola et al 2003 the results of sole uv irradiation indicated the needs for enhanced uv inactivation of sfb uv aops showed substantially improved the inactivation of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells fig 3 by adding 0 1 mm h2o2 cl2 and pms uv aops stably achieved 2 lg inactivation rate of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells at uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 uv pms offered the greatest enhancement it even reached 3 lg inactivation of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells at uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 to assess the viability of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells the variation of extracellular dna genetic material and atp energy carrier were detected before and after uv and uv aops inactivation fig 4 there were almost no changes in extracellular dna concentration before and after uv irradiation even with uv dosage up to 100 mj cm2 fig 4 a however extracellular dna was observed when lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were subject to uv aops treatment extracellular dna concentration gradually increased with the increase of uv dosage in uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms inactivation treatment the increments showed in the order of uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 the observed increase in extracellular dna concentration can be attributed to the damage of cell wall and cell membrane allowing the release of intracellular genetic materials into the surrounding environment uv irradiation is well known to inactivate microorganisms by damaging their dna or rna but without cell wall destruction chatterley and linden 2010 chevremont et al 2012 thereby not leading to the release of intracellular materials the detected extracellular dna thus indicated the occurrence of cell wall and cell membrane damages in uv aops treatments as a result photoreactivation and dark repairs shall be inhibited after uv aops treatments wen et al 2019 this might be an advantage of uv aops over uv we also detected the changes in extracellular atp concentrations in lysinibacillus fusiformis cells samples inactivated by uv and uv aops treatments which had a similar trend as those of extracellular dna fig 4 b atp is an activated energy carrier in all viable cells it has been indicated that the concentration of permeablilized cells correlated well with the concentration of extracellular atp hammes et al 2010 the detected extracellular atp further justified intracellular materials leakage due to cell wall and cell membrane damaging in uv aops treatments the morphology of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells before and after uv or uv aops inactivation treatment was examined by sem fig 5 lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were rod shaped and plump and the surfaces were smooth before the uv and uv aops inactivation treatment fig 5 a once being subject to uv inactivation the surfaces of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were with slight shrinkage but intact and shall not lead to intracellular materials leakage fig 5 b however when being exposed to uv aops treatment lysinibacillus fusiformis cells were apparently destroyed the extent of cells damages were observed following the order of uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 fig 5 c d e cell surfaces became rough with folds especially for those treated by uv pms some cells developed sunken surfaces and even lost structural integrity though intracellular materials leakage could not be directly observed by sem analysis the visualized remarkable impacts on the surface morphology suggested substantial damages had been imposed on lysinibacillus fusiformis cells when being subject to uv aops inactivation treatment the ultrastructure of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells was observed by tem fig 6 overall before inactivation treatments no obvious edema and shrinkage were observed in the cells fig 6 a the cells internal structure and morphology were clear the protoplasm was abundant and scattered in the cells the protein mucosal layer was uniform cell wall was with uniform thickness and cell membrane was intact no obvious plasmolysis was found and a small amount of metachromatic granules were present in the cells nevertheless after uv inactivation treatment although the cells were intact as a whole they showed irregular shape and the cell wall became thicker the intracellular structure was disordered and the nucleoid area was dense fig 6 b for those inactivated by uv aops especially uv pms treatment the cells showed moderate or severe edema and were damaged to different degrees fig 6 c d e the protein mucosa was sparse and the thickness of cell wall was uneven large areas of intracellular edema with low electron density and cytoplasmic agglutination were observed indicating disintegrating of the cells especially for those treated by uv pms the noticeable damages to the ultrastructure of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells by uv aops inactivation treatment echoed well with the observed dna and atp leakage fig 4 3 4 uv photolysis enhanced sfb inactivation the above results showed substantial enhancement in lysinibacillus fusiformis cells inactivation by uv aops treatments with the occurrence of intracellular materials leakage and remarkle surface and ultrastructure damages besides the extent of lysinibacillus fusiformis cells inactivation inactivation kinetics of uv and uv aops was also assessed using chick watson model fitting part 4 in si the inactivation kinetics rate constants were severally 0 0336 cm2 mj 0 0404 cm2 mj 0 0445 cm2 mj and 0 0642 cm2 mj by uv uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv pms inactivation kinetically enhanced 1 20 times 1 36 times and 1 91 times over sole uv inactivation literatures have reported that sole h2o2 and pms had no chemical inactivation for spore forming microorganisms at a dosage of 0 1 mm wen et al 2017 our practical attempts of increasing chlorine dosage also failed in efficient sfb inactivation the observed uv enhanced inactivation by adding 0 1 mm h2o2 cl2 and pms shall relate to uv photolysis of the added reagents it is widely recognized that uv photolysis of h2o2 cl2 and pms can produce oh cl and so 4 radicals as described by the following reactions eq 2 5 fang et al 2014 feng et al 2007 hua et al 2019 luo et al 2015 2 h 2 o 2 h v 2 oh φ 0 50 mol einstei n 1 3 hclo h v oh cl φ 1 00 mol einstei n 1 4 cl o h 2 o h v oh cl o h φ 0 90 mol einstei n 1 5 hso 5 h v oh so 4 φ 0 52 mol einstei n 1 where φ is the quantum yields for photolysis oh cl and so 4 are strong oxidants with the standard reduction potentials of 1 8 2 7 v 2 4 v and 2 5 3 1 v respectively beitz et al 1998 ghanbari and moradi 2016 hua et al 2019 it have been proved that these reactive radicals can react with cell wall and cell membrane and further destroy them leading to the leakage of intracellular components such as dna atp and proteins xiao et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 upon the breaking of cell wall and cell membrane and the leakage of intracellular substances cell damages would be thus caused rattanakul and oguma 2017 wen et al 2017 the observed intracellular materials leakage and lysinibacillus fusiformis cells surface and ultrastructure damages in this study corresponded well this mechanism the quantum yields of cl2 and pms are higher than h2o2 and the standard reduction potential of so 4 is higher than that of cl the differences in radicals generating efficiency and radicals oxidizing capacity may be responsible for the observed inactivation rate order of uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 furthermore compared with uv irradiation uv pms treatment is not as markedly influenced by the water characteristics wen et al 2017 thus it might be the more practical application in the drinking water treatment except for the above reactive radicals produced by uv aops when cells are exposed to an external chemical or physical stressor mesquita et al 2013 excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species ros formed during metabolism may also destroy cellular structure and cellular contents increase the membrane permeability damage the intracellular compounds and function and result in cell death guo et al 2019 wan et al 2020 wen et al 2020 currently the study of sfb inactivation associated with ros analysis still remains few therefore the functions of intracellular ros and the associated effects on intracellular structures and contents such as metabolic enzymes nucleic acids and lipid membranes in sfb inactivation by uv aops should be focused in future studies for obtaining deeper understanding of the sfb inactivation mechanisms 4 conclusions in this study the main conclusions are as follows 1 under five minutes pre oxidation conditions 0 9 mg l cl2 and 0 5 mg l clo2 were suggested to induce spore transformation of sfb strains and the spore transformation ratios of the three isolated sfb strains were respectively 75 and 80 2 the spores could be effectively removed in coagulation sedimentation process spore removal efficiencies of the three isolated sfb strain were around 2 lg when using 30 mg l pac alone and those reached about 3 15 lg when applying both 20 mg l pac and 0 08 mg l pam 3 the inactivation efficiency of lysinibacillus fusiformis by uv aops treatment was greatly enhanced over uv irradiation alone the inactivation order followed by uv pms uv cl2 uv h2o2 and the inactivation accorded with the first order chick watson kinetics 4 uv irradiation inactivated the bacteria by damaging dna but did not break the cellular structure compared to uv irradiation alone uv aops treatment caused the leakage of intracellular matters and the damage of morphology and ultrastructure and ultimately result in the death of bacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15902,peracetic acid paa has been widely used as a disinfectant in many industries however information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions paa and h2o2 on biological wastewater treatment processes is very limited the work reported here assessed the effect of paa and h2o2 solutions on nitrification kinetics and inhibition cellular level responses and gene expression of a suspended growth nitrifying culture the initial ammonia removal and nitrate production rates significantly decreased at 1 0 14 to 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 h2o2 up to 3 mg l did not impact nitrification cell viability or related respiratory activities thus the impact of the paa solution is attributed to paa alone or in some combination with h2o2 nitrification inhibition by paa was predominantly related to enzyme inhibition rather than to loss of cell viability and or cell lysis paa and h2o2 negatively affected nitrosomonas but resulted in nitrosospira enrichment most nitrogen metabolism related genes e g hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and nitrite oxidoreductase genes as well as oxidase genes e g cytochrome c oxidase catalase peroxidase and peroxidase genes were upregulated in paa and h2o2 amended cultures major atpase genes were downregulated while atp synthase genes upregulated under the effect of paa and or h2o2 upregulation of atp dependent protease genes indicates protein damage predominantly caused by paa rather than h2o2 the transcriptional level of genes related to cell division and dna repair did not show a particular pattern thus cell division functionality and dna integrity were not significantly affected by paa or h2o2 the results of this study have significant implications in the design and operation of effective biological nitrogen removal systems for

amino acids tolleson et al 2012 which can inhibit cell growth and activity a comprehensive review was recently published with focus on paa initiated reactions with organic compounds of a range of structures kim and huang 2021 paa as an electrophile participates in highly selective reactions in particular reactions with organic compounds bearing electron donating groups especially sulfur bearing moieties kim and huang 2021 transition metals activate paa and h2o2 for example cobalt co ii and co iii activated paa resulting in the formation of acetyloxyl ch3c o o and acetylperoxyl ch3c o oo radicals which in turn led to fast degradation of organic compounds kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in addition cobalt induced activation of h2o2 led to selective ketonization oxidation and deoxygenation of various organic compounds tung and sawyer 1990 little information is available regarding the effect of paa at cellular molecular and transcriptional level as well as its inhibition mechanism collapse of cell structure after treatment of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with paa was reported attributed to paa damage of cell membrane by reacting with the phospholipid bilayer and or membrane proteins chino et al 2017 in another study free chlorine resulted in cell desiccation whereas paa caused holes in the center of the cells zhang et al 2019a the impact of paa on the functionality of a plasmid dna harboring two antibiotic resistance genes in escherichia coli top10 was significantly lower compared with that of chlorine attributed to faster oxidation of the plasmid dna by chlorine than by paa zhang et al 2019b few studies have explored the transcriptional responses of bacterial populations exposed to paa and or h2o2 mainly for single pathogenic species e g chang et al 2005 2006 small et al 2007 ceragioli et al 2010 wong et al 2018 pereira et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge information relative to the transcriptional responses of nitrifying bacteria to paa and or h2o2 is not available paa is increasingly used as a disinfectant by the poultry processing industry mainly in chiller tanks as well as to disinfect processing equipment bauermeister et al 2008 chen and pavlostathis 2019 kataria and morey 2020 typical commercial paa solutions used in poultry processing contain 5 to 50 paa 33 to 50 acetic acid and 5 to 11 h2o2 w w it is noteworthy that paa solutions used in poultry processing have relatively low h2o2 content to avoid oxidation and darkening of the finished poultry carcasses greater than 1000 mg l paa was found in chiller tanks and over 25 mg l residual paa was detected in effluent wastewater at the end of the poultry processing plant daily operational shift chen and pavlostathis 2019 thus paa in poultry processing wastewater as part of the regular disinfection process and or in case of accidental spills can lead to severe upsets of biological wastewater treatment processes nitrogen and in particular ammonia is a poultry processing wastewater component that requires a high degree of removal before the final disposal of the treated wastewater as discharge effluent limits are becoming more stringent nitrogen removal has become an even more pressing issue for poultry processing facilities in order to comply with environmental regulations especially for poultry facilities with direct effluent discharge most poultry processing wastewater treatment systems use a combination of nitrification denitrification towards ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction leading to effective biological nitrogen removal bnr nitrification consists of two physiologically separate steps ammonia oxidation to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob rittmann and mccarty 2020 however microorganisms belonging to the genus nitrospira carry out complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate in a process called comammox van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 lehtovirta morley 2018 ammonia removal in recirculating aquaculture systems was significantly impacted by 2 to 3 mg l paa pedersen et al 2009 in addition 64 mg h2o2 l significantly decreased the ammonia removal rate by a biofilter in a commercial recirculating aquaculture system pedersen and pedersen 2012 nitrification in recirculating aquaculture biofilms was not affected by 1 1 mg paa l applied once per week but was significantly impacted when paa was applied two and four times per week suurnakki et al 2020 nitrification plays an important role in wastewater treatment especially in bnr systems both h2o2 and paa directly added to a mixed aerobic culture in batch reactors or in a continuous flow bnr system both fed with poultry effluent negatively affected chemical oxygen demand cod removal and nitrification chen et al 2021 chen and pavlostathis 2022 the impact on nitrification was predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition rather than to loss of cell viability and was not related to intracellular ros levels these previous studies assessed the short and long term effect of paa and h2o2 solutions on nitrification and denitrification in complex microbial communities as is the case in engineered biological treatment systems however given the low abundance of active nitrifying bacteria less than 8 in these complex microbial communities assessment of the effect of paa and h2o2 at the cellular level along with gene expression specific to the nitrifying bacteria was not possible the findings of these previous studies became the foundation and impetus of the current study for an in depth assessment of the effect of paa and h2o2 on nitrifying bacteria enriched from a control culture used in our previous studies although nitrification has been used extensively in aerobic wastewater treatment systems it is a very sensitive bioprocess significantly affected by low ph dissolved oxygen do levels temperature microbial density and many inhibitory compounds holmes et al 2018 however how paa impacts nitrifying bacteria has not been elucidated in particular information related to the effect of paa solution on aob and nob is not available therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of paa and h2o2 solutions on a nitrifying culture with focus on nitrification kinetics and inhibition as well as cellular level responses and gene expression to the best of our knowledge this is the first study on the comprehensive assessment of the effect of paa and h2o2 on nitrifying bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals peracetic acid 32 paa 45 acetic acid 6 h2o2 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the paa solution closely matches typical paa solutions used in poultry processing h2o2 30 w w was purchased from vwr pittsburgh pa usa paa and h2o2 working solutions were prepared fresh by dilution of the stock solutions and their paa and h2o2 concentration measured just before each use stock and working solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 nitrifying culture a 4 l aerobic nitrifying culture was developed using as inoculum mixed liquor obtained from a mixed heterotrophic nitrifying denitrifying stock culture fed with poultry processing wastewater effluent chen et al 2021 the fraction of heterotrophic bacteria aob and nob in the stock culture determined by selectively inhibiting aob and nob and then measuring oxygen uptake rates our varied as follows heterotrophs 92 to 96 aob 2 to 5 and nob 2 to 3 the nitrifying culture was maintained at room temperature 22 1 c aerated with pre humidified compressed air mixed magnetically and fed for 2 min with 30 g n l nh4cl every 3 h using a peristaltic pump controlled with an electronic timer the resulting ammonia loading rate was 120 mg n l d the ph of the culture was maintained at ca 7 3 by a ph controller connected to a 1 n nahco3 solution every 3 d the culture was settled for 1 h and then 3 l of supernatant was wasted and replaced with fresh culture medium every 6 d 1 l culture mixed liquor was wasted based on the above described culture maintenance the hydraulic and solids retention times hrt srt were 4 and 24 d respectively the composition of the culture medium is shown in table s1 supplemental material the enriched nitrifying culture was maintained for 10 months before used in batch bioassays described below ph do total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ammonia nitrite and nitrate were periodically measured the time trend of nitrogen species during a batch assay conducted with the enriched nitrifying culture is shown in fig s1 under steady state the culture ph was 7 3 0 1 the do was 7 5 0 4 mg l tss vss was 432 15 170 20 mg l ammonia or nitrite was not detected at the end of every 3 h feeding with nh4cl the relative abundance of viable aob nob and heterotrophs was ca 86 11 and 3 respectively based on our measurements it should be noted that although the culture feed did not include any organic compounds lysis products of dead nitrifying bacteria supported growth of heterotrophic bacteria albeit at a very low viable fraction compared to that of the nitrifying bacteria 2 3 batch nitrification assays two aerobic nitrification batch assays were conducted using mixed liquor from the enriched nitrifying culture right before feeding with nh4cl one assay consisting of six 500 ml glass aspiration bottles was set up with an initial paa h2o2 concentration of 0 0 0 2 0 03 0 5 0 07 1 0 14 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l respectively in order to distinguish and compare the effect of paa from that of h2o2 another assay consisting of six 500 ml glass aspiration bottles was set up with an initial h2o2 concentration of 0 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 3 mg l respectively all series in both assays were set up with 390 ml of enriched nitrifying culture 400 ml total liquid volume amended with 100 mg n l nh4cl and 1200 mg l nahco3 at the beginning of the incubation the bottle contents were aerated with pre humidified compressed air mixed magnetically and incubated at room temperature 22 1 c the do ph ammonia nitrite and nitrate were measured periodically throughout the incubation initial ammonia removal rates were calculated by linear regression of ammonia concentration vs incubation time data as nitrite is an intermediate produced and then oxidized to nitrate at 1 1 molar ratio initial nitrite removal rates were calculated as the initial nitrate production rates by linear regression of nitrate concentration vs incubation time data it should be noted that batch tests to evaluate the inhibitory effect of paa and h2o2 were not conducted with nitrite amendments nitrite was treated as an intermediate in ammonia oxidation as protein and ammonia are the main organic and inorganic nitrogen forms in poultry processing wastewater the biological treatment of which was the context of the study on the effect of paa and h2o2 on the nitrifying culture tss vss and live cell fraction of the test series for both assays were measured at 2 h and 60 h of incubation representing the initial and final biomass concentration and cell viability respectively the culture medium included several transition metals such as fe mn zn cu co ni table s1 thus activation of paa by transition metals and or other culture medium components must have formed reactive oxidative radicals species intracellular ros was measured at 2 h of incubation however the pure effect of paa vs that of ros could not be investigated separately our measurements including overall culture activity ourall ammonia oxidation ournh4 nitrite oxidation ourno2 and heterotrophic activity ourheter for both assays were conducted at 2 h of incubation text s1 total bacteria rna was extracted

following standard protocols as previously described chen et al 2021 for rna analysis culture samples 100 ml withdrawn from all test series amended with paa h2o2 at the end of 24 h incubation of the

s instructions details on rna extraction sequencing as well as bioinformatic and transcriptomic analysis are described in text s2 the transcriptomic and microbial community analyses were performed by cd genomics shirley ny 11967 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrification kinetics ammonia and nitrite removal rates were evaluated with the nitrifying culture in the absence of paa and h2o2 the initial ammonia and nitrite removal rates as a function of initial ammonia and nitrite concentration are shown in fig 1 the maximum substrate utilization rate k values were estimate standard error 9 5 0 2 and 6 3 0 1 mg n l h for ammonia and nitrite removal respectively the half saturation constant ks values were estimate standard error 3 8 0 8 mg nh4 n l and 13 1 0 7 mg no2 n l ks values ranging from 0 14 to 5 0 mg nh4 n l have been reported for ammonia oxidation to nitrite sin et al 2008 and values between 0 30 and 0 70 mg nh4 n l have been reported based on full scale plant performance tchobanoglous et al 2014 lower ks values ranging from 0 05 to 0 30 mg no2 n l have been reported for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate sin et al 2008 3 2 effect of h2o2 and paa on nitrification the ph in the h2o2 free control and the five series amended with h2o2 up to 3 mg l was 8 4 to 8 8 and 7 6 to 7 8 initially and at the end of the 60 h incubation respectively the do concentration varied from 7 4 to 7 8 mg l in all six series h2o2 was not detected in any series due to its fast decomposition ammonia oxidation by h2o2 at 3 mg l assessed in an abiotic batch test did not take place the initial ammonia removal rate varied from 10 4 to 10 5 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 63 8 to 68 0 mg n g vss h and the initial nitrate production rate varied from 15 5 to 17 3 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 98 9 to 112 8 mg n g vss h without any clear trend among all series table s2 thus ammonia and nitrite oxidation were not affected by h2o2 at the above stated initial h2o2 concentrations the ph in the paa free control and five series amended with paa solution up to 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 was 8 3 to 8 4 and 7 5 to 7 6 initially and at the end of the 60 h incubation respectively the do concentration varied from 7 4 to 7 8 mg l in all six series paa or h2o2 was not detected in any series due to their fast decomposition ammonia oxidation by the paa solution at 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 assessed in an abiotic batch test did not take place the initial ammonia removal rates in the series amended with 0 0 0 2 0 03 and 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 ranged from 10 2 to 10 8 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 59 8 to 70 7 mg n g vss h but decreased to as low as 3 8 mg n l h corresponding to 25 1 mg n g vss h as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased to 3 0 42 mg l fig s2a and table 1 representing a decrease of the initial ammonia removal rate by ca 64 compared to the control series thus paa h2o2 1 0 14 mg l negatively affected ammonia removal p 0 05 the initial nitrate production rates and thus the nitrite removal rates in the series amended with 0 0 and 0 2 0 03 mg l paa h2o2 ranged from 16 4 to 15 6 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 109 3 to 95 5 mg n g vss h but decreased to as low as 3 7 mg n l h corresponding to 20 7 mg n g vss h as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased to 3 0 42 mg l fig s2b and table 1 representing a decrease of the initial nitrate production rate by ca 42 compared to the control series p 0 05 thus paa h2o2 0 5 0 07 mg l negatively affected nitrite oxidation to nitrate based on the above discussed negligible h2o2 effect the negative effect of the paa solution on nitrification was predominantly attributed to paa alone and or in combination with h2o2 in a previous study paa h2o2 up to 20 2 8 mg l had a minor inhibitory effect on nitrification in a mixed heterotrophic autotrophic culture predominantly attributed to the fact that paa was fast decomposed by the high organic content of the wastewater fed to the culture as well as to the higher biomass concentration of active heterotrophs in the mixed culture combined with their high antioxidant capacity chen et al 2021 it should be emphasized that paa inhibition of nitrification and denitrification in mixed heterotrophic autotrophic cultures was reversed and both processes recovered quickly upon ending paa solution addition chen et al 2021 chen and pavlostathis 2022 schroeder et al 2015 investigated the impact of ozone produced oxidants opo in sea water on nitrification and indicated that opo from 0 05 to 0 6 mg l chlorine equivalent impaired pure ammonia and nitrite oxidizing species but had no adverse effects on the biofilter nitrification performance at opo concentrations up to 0 15 mg l chlorine equivalent even with continuous exposure the difference in the impact of opo was attributed to effective biofilm protection compared to paa opo at similar levels had a much higher impact on the nitrifying culture in the present study which is possibly due to the slow decay of opo in the culture half life greater than 1 h compared to the paa which decomposed in minutes after was added to the culture thus the duration of the impact by the opo was significantly greater than that of paa as we reported before paa and h2o2 decomposition rate is proportional to the organic matter level chen and pavlostathis 2019 thus it should be pointed out that the no adverse effect of paa and h2o2 concentrations on nitrification rates will very much depend on the wastewater organic matter level as well as the active nitrifying bacteria concentration nonlinear regression of the initial ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate data according to eq 4 resulted in maximum rate vmax values estimate standard error of 11 4 0 7 mg n l h for ammonia removal and 17 1 1 4 mg n l h for nitrate production fig 2 the inhibition coefficient ki values estimate standard error of paa for ammonia removal and nitrate production were 2 3 0 6 and 1 6 0 5 mg l paa respectively compared to the ki value of other inhibitors to nitrification the relatively low paa ki values suggest a high susceptibility of the nitrifying bacteria to paa for example the ki value of 2 propanone aniline chromium formaldehyde and methanol for nitrifiers was reported as 804 3 50 61 and 116 mg l respectively gheewala et al 2004 beg et al 1982 oslislo and lewandowski 1985 the ki value of benzalkonium chloride bac an antimicrobial agent commonly used in poultry processing for nitrifiers was 1 5 0 9 mg bac l which suggests a high susceptibility of nitrifying bacteria mainly ammonia oxidizers to bac yang et al 2015 our measurements text s1 table s3 of culture series amended with h2o2 up to 3 mg l showed that h2o2 did not affect the respiratory activity of the nitrifying bacteria however addition of paa solution had a profound negative effect on the respiratory activity of the nitrifying bacteria the impact was greater on ammonia oxidation than nitrite oxidation directly added paa h2o2 solution up to 3 0 42 mg l did not negatively affect the respiratory activity of the heterotrophic bacteria but instead had a positive effect attributed to acetic acid contained in the paa solution as well as that produced by paa decomposition 0 7 to 10 5 mg l total acetic acid based on the above discussed negligible h2o2 effect the negative effect of the paa solution on our was predominantly attributed to paa alone and or in combination with h2o2 the observed decrease in the respiratory activity of the series amended with paa h2o2 corresponds to the decrease in ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate as discussed above 3 3 effect of h2o2 and paa on cell viability and intracellular ros the mean tss and vss values in the h2o2 free control and the five batch assay series amended with h2o2 up to 3 mg l varied from 390 to 420 mg l and from 150 to 160 mg l respectively table s4 suggesting that addition of h2o2 at an initial concentration up to 3 mg l did not cause significant cell lysis at 2 h and 60 h of incubation the cell viability varied from ca 72 to 78 and from ca 82 to 87 respectively without any particular trend among all culture series amended with h2o2 table s4 at 2 h of incubation the relative intracellular ros of the six test culture series amended with h2o2 varied from 0 9 to 1 0 without any particular trend among all series table s4 thus addition of h2o2 up to an initial concentration of 3 mg l did not affect cell viability or intracellular ros in agreement with the non impacted nitrification rates discussed in section 3 2 above table s5 summarizes the tss vss cell viability and relative intracellular ros data of the paa h2o2 free control and the five batch assay series amended with up to 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 the mean initial and final vss concentrations at 2 and 60 h of incubation varied from 150 to 170 mg l and 190 to 210 mg l respectively without any clear trend among the six series indicating that addition of paa solution at an initial concentration up to 3 0 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 did not cause any cell lysis during the batch assay at 2 h of incubation the cell viability increased from ca 73 to 95 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased from 0 to 1 0 14 mg l while it decreased to ca 89 and 73 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was further increased to 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l respectively table s5 the increase of cell viability is attributed to the positive effect of acetic acid on the fast growing heterotrophs as observed in our previous study chen et al 2021 at the end of the 60 h incubation the cell viability had increased from ca 86 to 94 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased from 0 to 0 5 0 07 mg l while it decreased to ca 83 74 and 66 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was further increased to 1 0 14 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l respectively table s5 although the acetic acid positive effect concealed the negative effect of paa on cell viability the net viability increase in each series from the 2 h to the 60 h incubation indicates that the control had a significantly higher net increase of cell viability ca 13 than all paa h2o2 amended series ca 15 net decrease to 1 net increase of cell viability thus assuming acetic acid had no negative impact on the net cell viability increase throughout the incubation it is reasonable to assume that the observed decrease of net cell viability was attributed to the impact of paa the significantly net decrease of cell viability in the series amended with 1 0 14 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l initial paa h2o2 concentration also corresponds to the decreased ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate in these series as discussed in section 3 2 above at 2 h of incubation the relative intracellular ros in the six batch assay series decreased to 0 84 and 0 87 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased to 0 5 0 07 and 1 0 14 mg l while it increased to 1 01 and 1 16 as the paa h2o2 concentration was further increased to 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l table s5 the level of intracellular ros in the nitrifying culture upon the addition of paa solution is attributed to two contrasting factors a the activity of intracellular enzymes e g catalase peroxides and superoxidase and b extracellular ros diffusion into the cells the increase in intracellular ros with increased paa solution concentration is predominantly attributed to extracellular paa diffusion into the cells as well as other ros produced intracellularly such as oh most ros have very short half life 10 6 s for o2 and 10 9 s for oh dickinson and chang 2012 thus ros formed extracellularly will not last long enough to diffuse into the cell however paa diffuses into cells fast paa diffusion into gram negative e coli and gram positive enterococcus durans and staphylococcus epidermidis resulting in intracellular oxidative stress was demonstrated zhang et al 2020 however in the present study paa decomposed completely immediately upon addition to the culture even at the highest concentration of 3 mg l thus the change and impact of intracellular ros was very minor in this study 3 4 effect of h2o2 and paa on microbial community structure the number of operational taxonomic units otus was as follows control culture sample s0 839 paa h2o2 amended culture samples at 0 5 0 07 mg l s05p and at 3 0 42 mg l s3p 787 and 754 respectively h2o2 amended culture samples at 0 5 mg l s05h and at 3 mg l s3h 800 and 728 respectively compared to the paa and h2o2 free control culture the number of otus deceased by 6 2 and 10 1 in the paa h2o2 amended culture samples and by 4 6 and 13 2 in h2o2 amended culture samples respectively thus the richness of the culture was not significantly affected by the addition of paa or h2o2 solutions similar results were obtained in a recent study which assessed the long term effect of paa and h2o2 on the on aerobic degradation and nitrification in bioreactors fed with poultry processing wastewater chen et al 2021 fig 3 a shows the relative abundance of the top 11 abundant phyla in the five nitrifying culture samples at the end of the 24 h incubation proteobacteria 20 6 28 9 followed by bacteroidetes 2 4 6 0 were the most abundant phyla however the majority of classified phyla had very low abundance and over 62 were not classified based on principal component analysis pca at phylum level the microbial communities in the culture samples amended with paa and h2o2 solution shifted significantly to the left on pc1 axis and the shift increased with increasing paa and h2o2 concentration fig s3 the communities in the culture samples amended with paa or h2o2 solution shifted significantly down or up on pc2 respectively thus the paa and h2o2 solutions had a relatively similar effect on the microbial communities relative to the first principal component but a significantly different effect relative to the second principal component fig s3 bacterial genera with a relative abundance 0 3 are shown in fig 3b while those with a relative abundance 0 1 are listed in table s6 the major genera in the five nitrifying culture samples were nitrosospira and nitrosomonas fig 3b which are dominant aob in aerobic wastewater treatment systems the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was significantly lower in the four test culture samples ca 0 85 to 1 17 compared to the control ca 22 however the relative abundance of nitrosospira was significantly higher in the four test culture samples ca 16 9 to 24 1 compared to the control ca 0 76 thus the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased while nitrosospira was enriched by addition of paa and or h2o2 unlike the aob the relative abundance of the detected nob nitrobacter and nitrospira was very low the relative abundance of nitrobacter was 0 24 to 0 33 while that of nitrospira was very low ranging from 0 007 to 0 019 without a particular trend among the five samples table s6 the reason of the low abundance of detected nob could be the result of insufficient sequencing depth it is noteworthy that with the exception of nitrosomonas and nitrosospira the majority of the classified genera had very low abundance and over 62 were not classified as mentioned in section 2 2 above growth of heterotrophs on organic carbon resulting from cell lysis took place in the mixed culture however there were not any heterotrophic bacterial genera with significant relative abundance e g above 2 further showing that the culture was primarily enriched in nitrifying bacteria among the heterotrophic bacteria the following genera were detected at a relative abundance 0 4 table s6 niastella and pedobacter phylum bacteroidetes truepera phylum deinococcus thermus desulfovibrio and sandaracinus phylum proteobacteria and opitutus phylum verrucomicrobia 3 5 effect of h2o2 and paa on gene expression the effect of h2o2 and paa on the transcriptional responses of the nitrifying culture was evaluated in terms of the transcription levels of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism oxidase and oxidoreductase mediated reactions energy production and conversion cell membrane functionality and synthesis cell division and dna repair text s2 tables s7 to s12 the transcription level of groups of genes most relevant to this work is discussed below given that the fraction of live active heterotrophs in the paa and h2o2 free nitrifying culture was only 3 as discussed in section 2 2 above gene up and down regulation in the batch series amended with h2o2 or paa h2o2 is attributed to the nitrifying bacteria 3 5 1 nitrogen metabolism genes it is noteworthy that none of the genes encoding for ammonia monooxygenase amo subunits was detected in the five culture samples in spite the fact that nitrosomonas and nitrosospira were found in all culture samples as discussed above also the gene encoding for methane monooxygenase homologous to amo able to oxidize ammonia due to its broad substrate specificity cabello et al 2009 was not detected in any of the culture samples thus it is possible that amo transcripts were at a very low abundance and the read depth of the transcriptomic analysis was insufficient to capture low abundance transcripts possible involvement of another enzyme for the oxidation of ammonia is discussed in section 3 5 2 below the transcription level of a nitrite oxidoreductase nxra in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 0 5 mg l h2o2 and 3 mg l h2o2 decreased by ca 23 40 and 38 while increased by ca 25 in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 compared to the control the transcription level of another nitrite oxidoreductase nxrb was upregulated in the four culture series amended with paa h2o2 or h2o2 solution fig 4 table s7 cells under oxidative stress often need more energy to maintain cell membrane integrity and avoid error prone dna replication the possible reason for the observed upregulation of the nitrite oxidoreductase gene nxra is that the nitrifying bacteria increased their nitrification activity to produce energy and maintain their viability under acute oxidative stress however under mild oxidative stress without facing an energy deficiency the transcription pattern shifted to stress related gene expression such as those for catalase production and membrane biogenesis the transcription level of a nitrate nitrite response regulator k02479 in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 0 5 mg l h2o2 and 3 mg l h2o2 increased by ca 117 228 and 146 while decreased by ca 63 in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 fig 4 table s7 thus the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa had the opposite transcription pattern to that of the other three culture series these results agree with the observation that 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 significantly decreased the ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate as discussed in section 3 2 above the transcription level of a nitrogen regulatory protein k04751 increased by more than 439 in the culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution table s7 thus nitrogen regulatory proteins were upregulated under the effect of paa and h2o2 the hydroxylamine oxidase gene hao decreased by more than 93 in all four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution fig 4 hydroxylamine is unstable fast oxidized to nitrite in an oxidizing environment mainly by the combined action of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion o2 bors et al 1977 thus it is highly probable that to some degree hydroxylamine was oxidized to nitrite by paa and or h2o2 resulting in downregulation of the hydroxylamine oxidase gene it is noteworthy that more than half of the nitrogen metabolism related genes were upregulated fig 4 table s7 3 5 2 oxidase genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 3 and i genes were significantly upregulated in the four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution than in the control table s8 compared to the control the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene cox1 increased 144 234 191 and 126 times and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 gene cox3 increased 188 268 247 and 161 times in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 and 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 and 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively table s8 however the cytochrome c oxidase subunit iii genes coxc ctae decreased by more than 10 times in the four culture series amended with either h2o2 or paa h2o2 solution compared to the control fig 5 table s8 cytochrome c oxidase is the last enzyme in the cell membrane respiratory electron transport chain it receives an electron from each of four cytochrome c molecules and transfers them to one o2 molecule converting molecular oxygen to two molecules of water castresana et al 1994 as mentioned above none of the genes encoding for ammonia monooxygenase amo subunits was detected in the five culture samples is it possible that an oxidase as an alternative to amo was involved in ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine based on the membrane structure of common aob potential alternative to amo could be an enzyme that could transfer 2e from the quinol quinone pool and another 2e from ammonia to two oxygen atoms in o2 fig s4 cabello et al 2009 thus in the absence of amo it is reasonable to assume that cytochrome c oxidase oxidized ammonia to hydroxylamine based on the above described electron transport however such ammonia oxidation reaction has not been reported compared to the control the catalase peroxidase gene katg increased by 85 229 and 167 in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively while decreased by 16 in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 fig 5 table s8 the upregulation of katg also corresponds to the unimpacted nitrification activity of these three culture series the slight downregulation of katg in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 agrees with the observed nitrification inhibition thus it is likely that cells upregulated the catalase peroxidase gene as a defense to oxidative stress when the oxidants level was low while they were unable to upregulate this gene when the oxidants level was relatively high the transcription level of peroxidase pxd was significantly lower by 90 to 98 in the culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution compared to the control fig 5 table s8 thus cells may have upregulated one enzyme to protect themselves from peroxides and downregulated other peroxidases overall more oxidase genes were upregulated than downregulated 3 5 3 energy production and conversion table s10 summarizes the transcription level of 30 major genes involved in energy production and conversion overall 16 out of 30 energy related genes were upregulated and 14 were downregulated all atpase genes in the four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 were downregulated compared to the control including genes for atpase subunit alpha beta gamma a and b ribosome binding atpase a putative atpase table s10 atpases are a class of enzymes that catalyzes the conversion of atp into adenosine diphosphate adp and a free phosphate ion pi or the reverse reaction the dephosphorylation reaction releases free energy used to drive other biochemical reactions thus energy production in all four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 was diminished under the effect of paa and or h2o2 the flagellum specific atp synthase gene flii increased 143 and 124 times in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 and 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 respectively and 50 and 34 times in the culture series amended with 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively table s10 atp synthase is a protein that catalyzes the formation of atp using adp and pi thus energy storage increased significantly under the effect of paa and or h2o2 as cells tend to store rather than utilize energy under stress conditions the predominant upregulated genes were atp dependent clp protease atp binding subunits clpa clpb and clpx upregulation was greater in the culture series amended with paa h2o2 than in those amended with h2o2 table s10 proteases are a class of enzymes that catalyzes proteolysis which functions as a precise regulatory mechanism for a broad spectrum of cellular processes such as regulation of key metabolic enzymes and effective removal of terminally damaged polypeptides much of the directed protein turnover is performed by proteases which require atp porankiewicz et al 1999 thus upregulation of clpa clpb and clpx in the four culture series amended with either paa h2o2 or h2o2 may have been the result of damaged proteins caused by paa and or h2o2 that require removal three genes belonging to the atp binding cassette multidrug efflux pump k18890 k18893 and k18138 were significantly upregulated in the two culture series amended with paa h2o2 and slightly to moderately upregulated in the culture series amended with h2o2 table s10 therefore upregulation of the three multidrug efflux pump genes in the four culture series amended with either paa h2o2 or h2o2 indicates possible acquisition of resistance similar to our observation the only abc type drug efflux pump in salmonella macab was demonstrated to detoxify ros macab gene was induced upon exposure to h2o2 and was critical for the survival of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the presence of peroxides bogomolnaya et al 2013 in a recent study the gene acra encoding a multidrug efflux protein was not upregulated in e coli populations exposed to paa and h2o2 while it was upregulated with exposure to other biocides such as chlorophene benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine pereira et al 2020 3 5 4 cell membrane functionality and synthesis table s11 summarizes the transcription level of genes related to cell membrane functionality and synthesis some membrane bound proteins were upregulated and some downregulated without a particular pattern it is noteworthy that the hyperosmotically inducible periplasmic protein gene osmy k04065 was at least 76 times higher in the four culture series amended with either paa h2o2 or h2o2 than in the control table s11 based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database under k04065 https www genome jp entry ko k04065 a number of characterized nitrifying species belonging to genera nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrosospira nitrosoglobus and nitrospira carry the osmy gene however the exact reason for the above mentioned upregulation of the osmy gene is not known osmy in e coli was an effective carrier for the extracellular secretion of cellulases gupta et al 2013 thus upregulation of osmy may indicate that cells tended to export secreted proteins from the intracellular to the extracellular medium under the effect of paa and or h2o2 3 5 5 cell division and dna repair genes table s12 summarizes the transcription level of genes related to cell division and dna repair compared to the control the cell division protein gene zapa in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 and 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 was 25 and 50 times higher respectively and 4 and 8 times higher in the culture series amended with 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively table s12 some membrane bound proteins were upregulated and others downregulated the cell division protein gene zapd in the four culture series decreased by at least 13 times compared to the control dna repair proteins k03547 k03630 were up or down regulated in the culture series amended with paa h2o2 and or h2o2 solution without a particular pattern table s12 in another study the dna synthesis and repair gene nrdd was significantly upregulated upon exposure of e coli populations to ca 0 7 mg l paa pereira et al 2020 3 6 conclusions this study delineated the inhibitory levels of a paa solution and h2o2 to nitrifiers in terms of nitrification kinetics cellular level responses and gene expression h2o2 up to 3 mg l did not affect ammonia and nitrite oxidation in contrast paa solution at and above 1 0 14 mg l decreased both ammonia and nitrite oxidation the observed decrease in nitrification rates was predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition than to loss of nitrifiers noncompetitive enzyme inhibition described well the decrease in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation with increasing paa solution levels the relatively low paa inhibition coefficient values for ammonia oxidation 2 3 0 6 mg l paa and nitrite oxidation 1 6 0 5 mg l paa compared to reported values for other nitrification inhibitors suggest a high susceptibility of the nitrifying bacteria to paa solution with the exception of nitrosomonas and nitrosospira whose relative abundance decreased and increased low microbial community shifts were observed with increased paa h2o2 concentration most of nitrogen metabolism related genes were downregulated whereas many oxidase genes were upregulated the results of this study have significant implications for the design and operation of biological treatment systems for effective nitrogen removal from paa bearing wastewater given the observed inhibition of nitrification at relatively low paa levels protecting nitrification by placing it after fermentation and denitrification units as is typically the case of complete bnr systems is a viable mitigation strategy given the observed fast and complete paa decomposition in high strength wastewater streams such as poultry

15902,peracetic acid paa has been widely used as a disinfectant in many industries however information related to the potential inhibitory effect of paa solutions paa and h2o2 on biological wastewater treatment processes is very limited the work reported here assessed the effect of paa and h2o2 solutions on nitrification kinetics and inhibition cellular level responses and gene expression of a suspended growth nitrifying culture the initial ammonia removal and nitrate production rates significantly decreased at 1 0 14 to 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 h2o2 up to 3 mg l did not impact nitrification cell viability or related respiratory activities thus the impact of the paa solution is attributed to paa alone or in some combination with h2o2 nitrification inhibition by paa was predominantly related to enzyme inhibition rather than to loss of cell viability and or cell lysis paa and h2o2 negatively affected nitrosomonas but resulted in nitrosospira enrichment most nitrogen metabolism related genes e g hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and nitrite oxidoreductase genes as well as oxidase genes e g cytochrome c oxidase catalase peroxidase and peroxidase genes were upregulated in paa and h2o2 amended cultures major atpase genes were downregulated while atp synthase genes upregulated under the effect of paa and or h2o2 upregulation of atp dependent protease genes indicates protein damage predominantly caused by paa rather than h2o2 the transcriptional level of genes related to cell division and dna repair did not show a particular pattern thus cell division functionality and dna integrity were not significantly affected by paa or h2o2 the results of this study have significant implications in the design and operation of effective biological nitrogen removal systems for

dominguez henao et al 2018 commercially available paa solutions are quaternary equilibrium mixtures of paa ch3coooh acetic acid ch3cooh h2o2 and water the h2o2 and paa content of commercial solutions

amino acids tolleson et al 2012 which can inhibit cell growth and activity a comprehensive review was recently published with focus on paa initiated reactions with organic compounds of a range of structures kim and huang 2021 paa as an electrophile participates in highly selective reactions in particular reactions with organic compounds bearing electron donating groups especially sulfur bearing moieties kim and huang 2021 transition metals activate paa and h2o2 for example cobalt co ii and co iii activated paa resulting in the formation of acetyloxyl ch3c o o and acetylperoxyl ch3c o oo radicals which in turn led to fast degradation of organic compounds kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in addition cobalt induced activation of h2o2 led to selective ketonization oxidation and deoxygenation of various organic compounds tung and sawyer 1990 little information is available regarding the effect of paa at cellular molecular and transcriptional level as well as its inhibition mechanism collapse of cell structure after treatment of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with paa was reported attributed to paa damage of cell membrane by reacting with the phospholipid bilayer and or membrane proteins chino et al 2017 in another study free chlorine resulted in cell desiccation whereas paa caused holes in the center of the cells zhang et al 2019a the impact of paa on the functionality of a plasmid dna harboring two antibiotic resistance genes in escherichia coli top10 was significantly lower compared with that of chlorine attributed to faster oxidation of the plasmid dna by chlorine than by paa zhang et al 2019b few studies have explored the transcriptional responses of bacterial populations exposed to paa and or h2o2 mainly for single pathogenic species e g chang et al 2005 2006 small et al 2007 ceragioli et al 2010 wong et al 2018 pereira et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge information relative to the transcriptional responses of nitrifying bacteria to paa and or h2o2 is not available paa is increasingly used as a disinfectant by the poultry processing industry mainly in chiller tanks as well as to disinfect processing equipment bauermeister et al 2008 chen and pavlostathis 2019 kataria and morey 2020 typical commercial paa solutions used in poultry processing contain 5 to 50 paa 33 to 50 acetic acid and 5 to 11 h2o2 w w it is noteworthy that paa solutions used in poultry processing have relatively low h2o2 content to avoid oxidation and darkening of the finished poultry carcasses greater than 1000 mg l paa was found in chiller tanks and over 25 mg l residual paa was detected in effluent wastewater at the end of the poultry processing plant daily operational shift chen and pavlostathis 2019 thus paa in poultry processing wastewater as part of the regular disinfection process and or in case of accidental spills can lead to severe upsets of biological wastewater treatment processes nitrogen and in particular ammonia is a poultry processing wastewater component that requires a high degree of removal before the final disposal of the treated wastewater as discharge effluent limits are becoming more stringent nitrogen removal has become an even more pressing issue for poultry processing facilities in order to comply with environmental regulations especially for poultry facilities with direct effluent discharge most poultry processing wastewater treatment systems use a combination of nitrification denitrification towards ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction leading to effective biological nitrogen removal bnr nitrification consists of two physiologically separate steps ammonia oxidation to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob rittmann and mccarty 2020 however microorganisms belonging to the genus nitrospira carry out complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate in a process called comammox van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 lehtovirta morley 2018 ammonia removal in recirculating aquaculture systems was significantly impacted by 2 to 3 mg l paa pedersen et al 2009 in addition 64 mg h2o2 l significantly decreased the ammonia removal rate by a biofilter in a commercial recirculating aquaculture system pedersen and pedersen 2012 nitrification in recirculating aquaculture biofilms was not affected by 1 1 mg paa l applied once per week but was significantly impacted when paa was applied two and four times per week suurnakki et al 2020 nitrification plays an important role in wastewater treatment especially in bnr systems both h2o2 and paa directly added to a mixed aerobic culture in batch reactors or in a continuous flow bnr system both fed with poultry effluent negatively affected chemical oxygen demand cod removal and nitrification chen et al 2021 chen and pavlostathis 2022 the impact on nitrification was predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition rather than to loss of cell viability and was not related to intracellular ros levels these previous studies assessed the short and long term effect of paa and h2o2 solutions on nitrification and denitrification in complex microbial communities as is the case in engineered biological treatment systems however given the low abundance of active nitrifying bacteria less than 8 in these complex microbial communities assessment of the effect of paa and h2o2 at the cellular level along with gene expression specific to the nitrifying bacteria was not possible the findings of these previous studies became the foundation and impetus of the current study for an in depth assessment of the effect of paa and h2o2 on nitrifying bacteria enriched from a control culture used in our previous studies although nitrification has been used extensively in aerobic wastewater treatment systems it is a very sensitive bioprocess significantly affected by low ph dissolved oxygen do levels temperature microbial density and many inhibitory compounds holmes et al 2018 however how paa impacts nitrifying bacteria has not been elucidated in particular information related to the effect of paa solution on aob and nob is not available therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of paa and h2o2 solutions on a nitrifying culture with focus on nitrification kinetics and inhibition as well as cellular level responses and gene expression to the best of our knowledge this is the first study on the comprehensive assessment of the effect of paa and h2o2 on nitrifying bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals peracetic acid 32 paa 45 acetic acid 6 h2o2 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the paa solution closely matches typical paa solutions used in poultry processing h2o2 30 w w was purchased from vwr pittsburgh pa usa paa and h2o2 working solutions were prepared fresh by dilution of the stock solutions and their paa and h2o2 concentration measured just before each use stock and working solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 nitrifying culture a 4 l aerobic nitrifying culture was developed using as inoculum mixed liquor obtained from a mixed heterotrophic nitrifying denitrifying stock culture fed with poultry processing wastewater effluent chen et al 2021 the fraction of heterotrophic bacteria aob and nob in the stock culture determined by selectively inhibiting aob and nob and then measuring oxygen uptake rates our varied as follows heterotrophs 92 to 96 aob 2 to 5 and nob 2 to 3 the nitrifying culture was maintained at room temperature 22 1 c aerated with pre humidified compressed air mixed magnetically and fed for 2 min with 30 g n l nh4cl every 3 h using a peristaltic pump controlled with an electronic timer the resulting ammonia loading rate was 120 mg n l d the ph of the culture was maintained at ca 7 3 by a ph controller connected to a 1 n nahco3 solution every 3 d the culture was settled for 1 h and then 3 l of supernatant was wasted and replaced with fresh culture medium every 6 d 1 l culture mixed liquor was wasted based on the above described culture maintenance the hydraulic and solids retention times hrt srt were 4 and 24 d respectively the composition of the culture medium is shown in table s1 supplemental material the enriched nitrifying culture was maintained for 10 months before used in batch bioassays described below ph do total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ammonia nitrite and nitrate were periodically measured the time trend of nitrogen species during a batch assay conducted with the enriched nitrifying culture is shown in fig s1 under steady state the culture ph was 7 3 0 1 the do was 7 5 0 4 mg l tss vss was 432 15 170 20 mg l ammonia or nitrite was not detected at the end of every 3 h feeding with nh4cl the relative abundance of viable aob nob and heterotrophs was ca 86 11 and 3 respectively based on our measurements it should be noted that although the culture feed did not include any organic compounds lysis products of dead nitrifying bacteria supported growth of heterotrophic bacteria albeit at a very low viable fraction compared to that of the nitrifying bacteria 2 3 batch nitrification assays two aerobic nitrification batch assays were conducted using mixed liquor from the enriched nitrifying culture right before feeding with nh4cl one assay consisting of six 500 ml glass aspiration bottles was set up with an initial paa h2o2 concentration of 0 0 0 2 0 03 0 5 0 07 1 0 14 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l respectively in order to distinguish and compare the effect of paa from that of h2o2 another assay consisting of six 500 ml glass aspiration bottles was set up with an initial h2o2 concentration of 0 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 3 mg l respectively all series in both assays were set up with 390 ml of enriched nitrifying culture 400 ml total liquid volume amended with 100 mg n l nh4cl and 1200 mg l nahco3 at the beginning of the incubation the bottle contents were aerated with pre humidified compressed air mixed magnetically and incubated at room temperature 22 1 c the do ph ammonia nitrite and nitrate were measured periodically throughout the incubation initial ammonia removal rates were calculated by linear regression of ammonia concentration vs incubation time data as nitrite is an intermediate produced and then oxidized to nitrate at 1 1 molar ratio initial nitrite removal rates were calculated as the initial nitrate production rates by linear regression of nitrate concentration vs incubation time data it should be noted that batch tests to evaluate the inhibitory effect of paa and h2o2 were not conducted with nitrite amendments nitrite was treated as an intermediate in ammonia oxidation as protein and ammonia are the main organic and inorganic nitrogen forms in poultry processing wastewater the biological treatment of which was the context of the study on the effect of paa and h2o2 on the nitrifying culture tss vss and live cell fraction of the test series for both assays were measured at 2 h and 60 h of incubation representing the initial and final biomass concentration and cell viability respectively the culture medium included several transition metals such as fe mn zn cu co ni table s1 thus activation of paa by transition metals and or other culture medium components must have formed reactive oxidative radicals species intracellular ros was measured at 2 h of incubation however the pure effect of paa vs that of ros could not be investigated separately our measurements including overall culture activity ourall ammonia oxidation ournh4 nitrite oxidation ourno2 and heterotrophic activity ourheter for both assays were conducted at 2 h of incubation text s1 total bacteria rna was extracted purified and analyzed for samples withdrawn from all test series amended with paa h2o2 or h2o2 at 24 h of incubation 2 4 kinetic analysis nitrification is a two step process ammonia oxidation to

following standard protocols as previously described chen et al 2021 for rna analysis culture samples 100 ml withdrawn from all test series amended with paa h2o2 at the end of 24 h incubation of the

cd genomics shirley ny 11967 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrification kinetics ammonia and nitrite removal rates were evaluated with the nitrifying culture in the absence of paa and h2o2 the initial ammonia and nitrite removal rates as a function of initial ammonia and nitrite concentration are shown in fig 1 the maximum substrate utilization rate k values were estimate standard error 9 5 0 2 and 6 3 0 1 mg n l h for ammonia and nitrite removal respectively the half saturation constant ks values were estimate standard error 3 8 0 8 mg nh4 n l and 13 1 0 7 mg no2 n l ks values ranging from 0 14 to 5 0 mg nh4 n l have been reported for ammonia oxidation to nitrite sin et al 2008 and values between 0 30 and 0 70 mg nh4 n l have been reported based on full scale plant performance tchobanoglous et al 2014 lower ks values ranging from 0 05 to 0 30 mg no2 n l have been reported for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate sin et al 2008 3 2 effect of h2o2 and paa on nitrification the ph in the h2o2 free control and the five series amended with h2o2 up to 3 mg l was 8 4 to 8 8 and 7 6 to 7 8 initially and at the end of the 60 h incubation respectively the do concentration varied from 7 4 to 7 8 mg l in all six series h2o2 was not detected in any series due to its fast decomposition ammonia oxidation by h2o2 at 3 mg l assessed in an abiotic batch test did not take place the initial ammonia removal rate varied from 10 4 to 10 5 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 63 8 to 68 0 mg n g vss h and the initial nitrate production rate varied from 15 5 to 17 3 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 98 9 to 112 8 mg n g vss h without any clear trend among all series table s2 thus ammonia and nitrite oxidation were not affected by h2o2 at the above stated initial h2o2 concentrations the ph in the paa free control and five series amended with paa solution up to 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 was 8 3 to 8 4 and 7 5 to 7 6 initially and at the end of the 60 h incubation respectively the do concentration varied from 7 4 to 7 8 mg l in all six series paa or h2o2 was not detected in any series due to their fast decomposition ammonia oxidation by the paa solution at 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 assessed in an abiotic batch test did not take place the initial ammonia removal rates in the series amended with 0 0 0 2 0 03 and 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 ranged from 10 2 to 10 8 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 59 8 to 70 7 mg n g vss h but decreased to as low as 3 8 mg n l h corresponding to 25 1 mg n g vss h as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased to 3 0 42 mg l fig s2a and table 1 representing a decrease of the initial ammonia removal rate by ca 64 compared to the control series thus paa h2o2 1 0 14 mg l negatively affected ammonia removal p 0 05 the initial nitrate production rates and thus the nitrite removal rates in the series amended with 0 0 and 0 2 0 03 mg l paa h2o2 ranged from 16 4 to 15 6 mg n l h corresponding to initial specific rates of 109 3 to 95 5 mg n g vss h but decreased to as low as 3 7 mg n l h corresponding to 20 7 mg n g vss h as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased to 3 0 42 mg l fig s2b and table 1 representing a decrease of the initial nitrate production rate by ca 42 compared to the control series p 0 05 thus paa h2o2 0 5 0 07 mg l negatively affected nitrite oxidation to nitrate based on the above discussed negligible h2o2 effect the negative effect of the paa solution on nitrification was predominantly attributed to paa alone and or in combination with h2o2 in a previous study paa h2o2 up to 20 2 8 mg l had a minor inhibitory effect on nitrification in a mixed heterotrophic autotrophic culture predominantly attributed to the fact that paa was fast decomposed by the high organic content of the wastewater fed to the culture as well as to the higher biomass concentration of active heterotrophs in the mixed culture combined with their high antioxidant capacity chen et al 2021 it should be emphasized that paa inhibition of nitrification and denitrification in mixed heterotrophic autotrophic cultures was reversed and both processes recovered quickly upon ending paa solution addition chen et al 2021 chen and pavlostathis 2022 schroeder et al 2015 investigated the impact of ozone produced oxidants opo in sea water on nitrification and indicated that opo from 0 05 to 0 6 mg l chlorine equivalent impaired pure ammonia and nitrite oxidizing species but had no adverse effects on the biofilter nitrification performance at opo concentrations up to 0 15 mg l chlorine equivalent even with continuous exposure the difference in the impact of opo was attributed to effective biofilm protection compared to paa opo at similar levels had a much higher impact on the nitrifying culture in the present study which is possibly due to the slow decay of opo in the culture half life greater than 1 h compared to the paa which decomposed in minutes after was added to the culture thus the duration of the impact by the opo was significantly greater than that of paa as we reported before paa and h2o2 decomposition rate is proportional to the organic matter level chen and pavlostathis 2019 thus it should be pointed out that the no adverse effect of paa and h2o2 concentrations on nitrification rates will very much depend on the wastewater organic matter level as well as the active nitrifying bacteria concentration nonlinear regression of the initial ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate data according to eq 4 resulted in maximum rate vmax values estimate standard error of 11 4 0 7 mg n l h for ammonia removal and 17 1 1 4 mg n l h for nitrate production fig 2 the inhibition coefficient ki values estimate standard error of paa for ammonia removal and nitrate production were 2 3 0 6 and 1 6 0 5 mg l paa respectively compared to the ki value of other inhibitors to nitrification the relatively low paa ki values suggest a high susceptibility of the nitrifying bacteria to paa for example the ki value of 2 propanone aniline chromium formaldehyde and methanol for nitrifiers was reported as 804 3 50 61 and 116 mg l respectively gheewala et al 2004 beg et al 1982 oslislo and lewandowski 1985 the ki value of benzalkonium chloride bac an antimicrobial agent commonly used in poultry processing for nitrifiers was 1 5 0 9 mg bac l which suggests a high susceptibility of nitrifying bacteria mainly ammonia oxidizers to bac yang et al 2015 our measurements text s1 table s3 of culture series amended with h2o2 up to 3 mg l showed that h2o2 did not affect the respiratory activity of the nitrifying bacteria however addition of paa solution had a profound negative effect on the respiratory activity of the nitrifying bacteria the impact was greater on ammonia oxidation than nitrite oxidation directly added paa h2o2 solution up to 3 0 42 mg l did not negatively affect the respiratory activity of the heterotrophic bacteria but instead had a positive effect attributed to acetic acid contained in the paa solution as well as that produced by paa decomposition 0 7 to 10 5 mg l total acetic acid based on the above discussed negligible h2o2 effect the negative effect of the paa solution on our was predominantly attributed to paa alone and or in combination with h2o2 the observed decrease in the respiratory activity of the series amended with paa h2o2 corresponds to the decrease in ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate as discussed above 3 3 effect of h2o2 and paa on cell viability and intracellular ros the mean tss and vss values in the h2o2 free control and the five batch assay series amended with h2o2 up to 3 mg l varied from 390 to 420 mg l and from 150 to 160 mg l respectively table s4 suggesting that addition of h2o2 at an initial concentration up to 3 mg l did not cause significant cell lysis at 2 h and 60 h of incubation the cell viability varied from ca 72 to 78 and from ca 82 to 87 respectively without any particular trend among all culture series amended with h2o2 table s4 at 2 h of incubation the relative intracellular ros of the six test culture series amended with h2o2 varied from 0 9 to 1 0 without any particular trend among all series table s4 thus addition of h2o2 up to an initial concentration of 3 mg l did not affect cell viability or intracellular ros in agreement with the non impacted nitrification rates discussed in section 3 2 above table s5 summarizes the tss vss cell viability and relative intracellular ros data of the paa h2o2 free control and the five batch assay series amended with up to 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 the mean initial and final vss concentrations at 2 and 60 h of incubation varied from 150 to 170 mg l and 190 to 210 mg l respectively without any clear trend among the six series indicating that addition of paa solution at an initial concentration up to 3 0 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 did not cause any cell lysis during the batch assay at 2 h of incubation the cell viability increased from ca 73 to 95 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased from 0 to 1 0 14 mg l while it decreased to ca 89 and 73 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was further increased to 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l respectively table s5 the increase of cell viability is attributed to the positive effect of acetic acid on the fast growing heterotrophs as observed in our previous study chen et al 2021 at the end of the 60 h incubation the cell viability had increased from ca 86 to 94 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased from 0 to 0 5 0 07 mg l while it decreased to ca 83 74 and 66 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was further increased to 1 0 14 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l respectively table s5 although the acetic acid positive effect concealed the negative effect of paa on cell viability the net viability increase in each series from the 2 h to the 60 h incubation indicates that the control had a significantly higher net increase of cell viability ca 13 than all paa h2o2 amended series ca 15 net decrease to 1 net increase of cell viability thus assuming acetic acid had no negative impact on the net cell viability increase throughout the incubation it is reasonable to assume that the observed decrease of net cell viability was attributed to the impact of paa the significantly net decrease of cell viability in the series amended with 1 0 14 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l initial paa h2o2 concentration also corresponds to the decreased ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate in these series as discussed in section 3 2 above at 2 h of incubation the relative intracellular ros in the six batch assay series decreased to 0 84 and 0 87 as the initial paa h2o2 concentration was increased to 0 5 0 07 and 1 0 14 mg l while it increased to 1 01 and 1 16 as the paa h2o2 concentration was further increased to 2 0 28 and 3 0 42 mg l table s5 the level of intracellular ros in the nitrifying culture upon the addition of paa solution is attributed to two contrasting factors a the activity of intracellular enzymes e g catalase peroxides and superoxidase and b extracellular ros diffusion into the cells the increase in intracellular ros with increased paa solution concentration is predominantly attributed to extracellular paa diffusion into the cells as well as other ros produced intracellularly such as oh most ros have very short half life 10 6 s for o2 and 10 9 s for oh dickinson and chang 2012 thus ros formed extracellularly will not last long enough to diffuse into the cell however paa diffuses into cells fast paa diffusion into gram negative e coli and gram positive enterococcus durans and staphylococcus epidermidis resulting in intracellular oxidative stress was demonstrated zhang et al 2020 however in the present study paa decomposed completely immediately upon addition to the culture even at the highest concentration of 3 mg l thus the change and impact of intracellular ros was very minor in this study 3 4 effect of h2o2 and paa on microbial community structure the number of operational taxonomic units otus was as follows control culture sample s0 839 paa h2o2 amended culture samples at 0 5 0 07 mg l s05p and at 3 0 42 mg l s3p 787 and 754 respectively h2o2 amended culture samples at 0 5 mg l s05h and at 3 mg l s3h 800 and 728 respectively compared to the paa and h2o2 free control culture the number of otus deceased by 6 2 and 10 1 in the paa h2o2 amended culture samples and by 4 6 and 13 2 in h2o2 amended culture samples respectively thus the richness of the culture was not significantly affected by the addition of paa or h2o2 solutions similar results were obtained in a recent study which assessed the long term effect of paa and h2o2 on the on aerobic degradation and nitrification in bioreactors fed with poultry processing wastewater chen et al 2021 fig 3 a shows the relative abundance of the top 11 abundant phyla in the five nitrifying culture samples at the end of the 24 h incubation proteobacteria 20 6 28 9 followed by bacteroidetes 2 4 6 0 were the most abundant phyla however the majority of classified phyla had very low abundance and over 62 were not classified based on principal component analysis pca at phylum level the microbial communities in the culture samples amended with paa and h2o2 solution shifted significantly to the left on pc1 axis and the shift increased with increasing paa and h2o2 concentration fig s3 the communities in the culture samples amended with paa or h2o2 solution shifted significantly down or up on pc2 respectively thus the paa and h2o2 solutions had a relatively similar effect on the microbial communities relative to the first principal component but a significantly different effect relative to the second principal component fig s3 bacterial genera with a relative abundance 0 3 are shown in fig 3b while those with a relative abundance 0 1 are listed in table s6 the major genera in the five nitrifying culture samples were nitrosospira and nitrosomonas fig 3b which are dominant aob in aerobic wastewater treatment systems the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was significantly lower in the four test culture samples ca 0 85 to 1 17 compared to the control ca 22 however the relative abundance of nitrosospira was significantly higher in the four test culture samples ca 16 9 to 24 1 compared to the control ca 0 76 thus the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased while nitrosospira was enriched by addition of paa and or h2o2 unlike the aob the relative abundance of the detected nob nitrobacter and nitrospira was very low the relative abundance of nitrobacter was 0 24 to 0 33 while that of nitrospira was very low ranging from 0 007 to 0 019 without a particular trend among the five samples table s6 the reason of the low abundance of detected nob could be the result of insufficient sequencing depth it is noteworthy that with the exception of nitrosomonas and nitrosospira the majority of the classified genera had very low abundance and over 62 were not classified as mentioned in section 2 2 above growth of heterotrophs on organic carbon resulting from cell lysis took place in the mixed culture however there were not any heterotrophic bacterial genera with significant relative abundance e g above 2 further showing that the culture was primarily enriched in nitrifying bacteria among the heterotrophic bacteria the following genera were detected at a relative abundance 0 4 table s6 niastella and pedobacter phylum bacteroidetes truepera phylum deinococcus thermus desulfovibrio and sandaracinus phylum proteobacteria and opitutus phylum verrucomicrobia 3 5 effect of h2o2 and paa on gene expression the effect of h2o2 and paa on the transcriptional responses of the nitrifying culture was evaluated in terms of the transcription levels of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism oxidase and oxidoreductase mediated reactions energy production and conversion cell membrane functionality and synthesis cell division and dna repair text s2 tables s7 to s12 the transcription level of groups of genes most relevant to this work is discussed below given that the fraction of live active heterotrophs in the paa and h2o2 free nitrifying culture was only 3 as discussed in section 2 2 above gene up and down regulation in the batch series amended with h2o2 or paa h2o2 is attributed to the nitrifying bacteria 3 5 1 nitrogen metabolism genes it is noteworthy that none of the genes encoding for ammonia monooxygenase amo subunits was detected in the five culture samples in spite the fact that nitrosomonas and nitrosospira were found in all culture samples as discussed above also the gene encoding for methane monooxygenase homologous to amo able to oxidize ammonia due to its broad substrate specificity cabello et al 2009 was not detected in any of the culture samples thus it is possible that amo transcripts were at a very low abundance and the read depth of the transcriptomic analysis was insufficient to capture low abundance transcripts possible involvement of another enzyme for the oxidation of ammonia is discussed in section 3 5 2 below the transcription level of a nitrite oxidoreductase nxra in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 0 5 mg l h2o2 and 3 mg l h2o2 decreased by ca 23 40 and 38 while increased by ca 25 in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 compared to the control the transcription level of another nitrite oxidoreductase nxrb was upregulated in the four culture series amended with paa h2o2 or h2o2 solution fig 4 table s7 cells under oxidative stress often need more energy to maintain cell membrane integrity and avoid error prone dna replication the possible reason for the observed upregulation of the nitrite oxidoreductase gene nxra is that the nitrifying bacteria increased their nitrification activity to produce energy and maintain their viability under acute oxidative stress however under mild oxidative stress without facing an energy deficiency the transcription pattern shifted to stress related gene expression such as those for catalase production and membrane biogenesis the transcription level of a nitrate nitrite response regulator k02479 in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 0 5 mg l h2o2 and 3 mg l h2o2 increased by ca 117 228 and 146 while decreased by ca 63 in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 fig 4 table s7 thus the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa had the opposite transcription pattern to that of the other three culture series these results agree with the observation that 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 significantly decreased the ammonia removal rate and nitrate production rate as discussed in section 3 2 above the transcription level of a nitrogen regulatory protein k04751 increased by more than 439 in the culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution table s7 thus nitrogen regulatory proteins were upregulated under the effect of paa and h2o2 the hydroxylamine oxidase gene hao decreased by more than 93 in all four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution fig 4 hydroxylamine is unstable fast oxidized to nitrite in an oxidizing environment mainly by the combined action of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion o2 bors et al 1977 thus it is highly probable that to some degree hydroxylamine was oxidized to nitrite by paa and or h2o2 resulting in downregulation of the hydroxylamine oxidase gene it is noteworthy that more than half of the nitrogen metabolism related genes were upregulated fig 4 table s7 3 5 2 oxidase genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 3 and i genes were significantly upregulated in the four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution than in the control table s8 compared to the control the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene cox1 increased 144 234 191 and 126 times and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 gene cox3 increased 188 268 247 and 161 times in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 and 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 and 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively table s8 however the cytochrome c oxidase subunit iii genes coxc ctae decreased by more than 10 times in the four culture series amended with either h2o2 or paa h2o2 solution compared to the control fig 5 table s8 cytochrome c oxidase is the last enzyme in the cell membrane respiratory electron transport chain it receives an electron from each of four cytochrome c molecules and transfers them to one o2 molecule converting molecular oxygen to two molecules of water castresana et al 1994 as mentioned above none of the genes encoding for ammonia monooxygenase amo subunits was detected in the five culture samples is it possible that an oxidase as an alternative to amo was involved in ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine based on the membrane structure of common aob potential alternative to amo could be an enzyme that could transfer 2e from the quinol quinone pool and another 2e from ammonia to two oxygen atoms in o2 fig s4 cabello et al 2009 thus in the absence of amo it is reasonable to assume that cytochrome c oxidase oxidized ammonia to hydroxylamine based on the above described electron transport however such ammonia oxidation reaction has not been reported compared to the control the catalase peroxidase gene katg increased by 85 229 and 167 in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 mg l paa h2o2 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively while decreased by 16 in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 fig 5 table s8 the upregulation of katg also corresponds to the unimpacted nitrification activity of these three culture series the slight downregulation of katg in the culture series amended with 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 agrees with the observed nitrification inhibition thus it is likely that cells upregulated the catalase peroxidase gene as a defense to oxidative stress when the oxidants level was low while they were unable to upregulate this gene when the oxidants level was relatively high the transcription level of peroxidase pxd was significantly lower by 90 to 98 in the culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 solution compared to the control fig 5 table s8 thus cells may have upregulated one enzyme to protect themselves from peroxides and downregulated other peroxidases overall more oxidase genes were upregulated than downregulated 3 5 3 energy production and conversion table s10 summarizes the transcription level of 30 major genes involved in energy production and conversion overall 16 out of 30 energy related genes were upregulated and 14 were downregulated all atpase genes in the four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 were downregulated compared to the control including genes for atpase subunit alpha beta gamma a and b ribosome binding atpase a putative atpase table s10 atpases are a class of enzymes that catalyzes the conversion of atp into adenosine diphosphate adp and a free phosphate ion pi or the reverse reaction the dephosphorylation reaction releases free energy used to drive other biochemical reactions thus energy production in all four culture series amended with either paa or h2o2 was diminished under the effect of paa and or h2o2 the flagellum specific atp synthase gene flii increased 143 and 124 times in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 and 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 respectively and 50 and 34 times in the culture series amended with 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively table s10 atp synthase is a protein that catalyzes the formation of atp using adp and pi thus energy storage increased significantly under the effect of paa and or h2o2 as cells tend to store rather than utilize energy under stress conditions the predominant upregulated genes were atp dependent clp protease atp binding subunits clpa clpb and clpx upregulation was greater in the culture series amended with paa h2o2 than in those amended with h2o2 table s10 proteases are a class of enzymes that catalyzes proteolysis which functions as a precise regulatory mechanism for a broad spectrum of cellular processes such as regulation of key metabolic enzymes and effective removal of terminally damaged polypeptides much of the directed protein turnover is performed by proteases which require atp porankiewicz et al 1999 thus upregulation of clpa clpb and clpx in the four culture series amended with either paa h2o2 or h2o2 may have been the result of damaged proteins caused by paa and or h2o2 that require removal three genes belonging to the atp binding cassette multidrug efflux pump k18890 k18893 and k18138 were significantly upregulated in the two culture series amended with paa h2o2 and slightly to moderately upregulated in the culture series amended with h2o2 table s10 therefore upregulation of the three multidrug efflux pump genes in the four culture series amended with either paa h2o2 or h2o2 indicates possible acquisition of resistance similar to our observation the only abc type drug efflux pump in salmonella macab was demonstrated to detoxify ros macab gene was induced upon exposure to h2o2 and was critical for the survival of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in the presence of peroxides bogomolnaya et al 2013 in a recent study the gene acra encoding a multidrug efflux protein was not upregulated in e coli populations exposed to paa and h2o2 while it was upregulated with exposure to other biocides such as chlorophene benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine pereira et al 2020 3 5 4 cell membrane functionality and synthesis table s11 summarizes the transcription level of genes related to cell membrane functionality and synthesis some membrane bound proteins were upregulated and some downregulated without a particular pattern it is noteworthy that the hyperosmotically inducible periplasmic protein gene osmy k04065 was at least 76 times higher in the four culture series amended with either paa h2o2 or h2o2 than in the control table s11 based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database under k04065 https www genome jp entry ko k04065 a number of characterized nitrifying species belonging to genera nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrosospira nitrosoglobus and nitrospira carry the osmy gene however the exact reason for the above mentioned upregulation of the osmy gene is not known osmy in e coli was an effective carrier for the extracellular secretion of cellulases gupta et al 2013 thus upregulation of osmy may indicate that cells tended to export secreted proteins from the intracellular to the extracellular medium under the effect of paa and or h2o2 3 5 5 cell division and dna repair genes table s12 summarizes the transcription level of genes related to cell division and dna repair compared to the control the cell division protein gene zapa in the culture series amended with 0 5 0 07 and 3 0 42 mg l paa h2o2 was 25 and 50 times higher respectively and 4 and 8 times higher in the culture series amended with 0 5 and 3 mg l h2o2 respectively table s12 some membrane bound proteins were upregulated and others downregulated the cell division protein gene zapd in the four culture series decreased by at least 13 times compared to the control dna repair proteins k03547 k03630 were up or down regulated in the culture series amended with paa h2o2 and or h2o2 solution without a particular pattern table s12 in another study the dna synthesis and repair gene nrdd was significantly upregulated upon exposure of e coli populations to ca 0 7 mg l paa pereira et al 2020 3 6 conclusions this study delineated the inhibitory levels of a paa solution and h2o2 to nitrifiers in terms of nitrification kinetics cellular level responses and gene expression h2o2 up to 3 mg l did not affect ammonia and nitrite oxidation in contrast paa solution at and above 1 0 14 mg l decreased both ammonia and nitrite oxidation the observed decrease in nitrification rates was predominantly attributed to enzyme inhibition than to loss of nitrifiers noncompetitive enzyme inhibition described well the decrease in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation with increasing paa solution levels the relatively low paa inhibition coefficient values for ammonia oxidation 2 3 0 6 mg l paa and nitrite oxidation 1 6 0 5 mg l paa compared to reported values for other nitrification inhibitors suggest a high susceptibility of the nitrifying bacteria to paa solution with the exception of nitrosomonas and nitrosospira whose relative abundance decreased and increased low microbial community shifts were observed with increased paa h2o2 concentration most of nitrogen metabolism related genes were downregulated whereas many oxidase genes were upregulated the results of this study have significant implications for the design and operation of biological treatment systems for effective nitrogen removal from paa bearing wastewater given the observed inhibition of nitrification at relatively low paa levels protecting nitrification by placing it after fermentation and denitrification units as is typically the case of complete bnr systems is a viable mitigation strategy given the observed fast and complete paa decomposition in high strength wastewater streams such as poultry

15903,microplastics mps have worldwide accumulated in aquatic environments and coexisted with various water contaminants including perfluorinated compounds pfcs that are frequently detected the adverse effects of individual mps or pfcs on aquatic organisms have been extensively reported however the combined toxicity of mps and pfcs remains unknown this study evaluated the combined toxicity of mps pristine and aged polystyrene ps and a pfc ammonium perfluorooctanoate apfo to daphnia magna under different concentration ratios by three classic methods toxicity unit additive index and mixed toxicity index the adsorption kinetics of apfo on mps aggregation of mps in exposure medium mp gut fullness of daphnids intestinal histology and lipid peroxidation were analyzed to reveal the mechanism underlying the combined toxicity our results showed that the combined toxic modes varied with the concentration ratios of mps to apfo antagonism at 4 1 and 1 4 synergism at 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 and partial addition antagonism at 2 1 and 1 1 for pristine ps apfo antagonism at all ratios except partial addition antagonism at 3 1 and 1 3 for aged ps apfo which could be attributed to the alteration of mp aggregation and thus mp gut fullness in the daphnids the combined toxicity was further confirmed to occur in the daphnid s gut which was reflected in physiological and biochemical responses mediated by intestinal blockage observable intestinal damages under co exposures at μg l 1 levels indicated the risks from future long term exposure to mps and pfcs in aquatic environments this work demonstrates the necessity of assessing combined toxicity with different concentration ratios and provides new insights into the potential risks of mps in aquatic environments graphical

coastal and marine environments and up to 100 particles l 1 in freshwaters xu et al 2020 moreover mps can be ingested by a wide range of aquatic biota from plankton to mammal lusher 2015 causing physical harm such as internal abrasions and blockages wright et al 2013b or reduced overall food quality lusher 2015 which in turn may lead to depleted energy reserves wright et al 2013a suffocation and starvation wang et al 2018 in addition mps are normally associated with a cocktail of harmful chemicals including their ingredients byproducts produced during their manufacture and pollutants in water that accumulate on them when they become debris chen et al 2021 rochman 2015 these chemicals can be bioaccumulated browne et al 2008 wright et al 2013b and transferred through the food chain farrell and nelson 2013 posing threats to human health there are also a variety of other pollutants such as perfluorinated compounds pfcs that coexist with mps in aquatic environments as is well known pfcs are a large group of manufactured compounds that have been widely used to make products more resistant to stains grease and water cheremisinoff 2016 stahl et al 2011 these compounds are chemically stable and highly resistant to biodegradation due to the strength of their carbon fluorine bond and thus they tend to persist in the environment cheremisinoff 2016 stahl et al 2011

aggregation of the mps in medium and mp gut fullness of the daphnids were investigated to explain the combined toxicity of the two contaminants to further explore the mechanism of the combined toxicity analyses of intestinal histology and oxidative stress were also performed following co exposures to the two contaminants at both high and low concentrations this study for the first time comprehensively investigated the combined toxicity of mps and pfcs at different combined concentrations and the possible mechanisms involved this work provides a novel reference for the ecological and

apfo solutions used in the tests were prepared immediately before use by diluting the stocks with oecd 202 culture medium oecd 2004 2 2 characterization of the mps the surface morphologies of the pristine and aged ps particles were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan the surface functional groups of these mps were determined by raman spectroscopy horiba labram hr800 japan and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is 50 usa by scanning between 50 and 4000 cm 1 2 3 test organism daphnia magna was purchased from everbright algae species co ltd china and cultured in oecd 202 culture medium at 20 1 c with a 12 12 light dark cycle and an illumination intensity of 2000 200 lx the culture medium was renewed twice a week and the daphnids were fed daily with a suspension 5 105 cells ml 1 of the green alga scenedesmus obliquus obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china 2 4 mono exposures of d magna to pristine ps aged ps and apfo the exposures of d magna to the individual contaminants generally followed the oecd standard method oecd 2004 briefly 10 neonates 24 h old at the start of the experiment were exposed to 50 ml of test solution pristine ps aged ps or apfo for a period of 48 h on a bath oscillator sha b guangzhou shenhua biotechnology co ltd china at 150 rpm seven pristine or aged ps concentrations 0 0 1 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l 1 and six apfo concentrations 0 10 50 100 200 and 500 mg l 1 were tested with all treatments repeated three times independently during the exposures the culture conditions were the same as those during rearing except that the daphnids were not fed at 24 and 48 h the daphnids were characterized as healthy immobilized did not swim within 15 s after gentle agitation of the beaker or dead no heartbeat observed under a microscope and the results were recorded to calculate the median lethal concentration lc50 and median effective concentration ec50 oecd 2004 the validity of the tests was assured with a positive control test using k2cro7 in concentrations ranging from 0 2 5 mg l 1 and an immobilization or mortality rate in the controls below 10 at the end of the tests these criteria were also applied in the following combined toxicity tests 2 5 combined exposures of d magna to pristine ps apfo and aged ps apfo in this study the calculated ec50 values for the pristine ps aged ps and apfo were defined as their toxic units for the combined exposures the daphnids were exposed to 7 toxic unit ratios of mps pristine or aged ps to apfo 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 for 48 h seven combinations of concentrations for the pristine ps apfo or the aged ps apfo were set up for each of the 7 toxic unit ratios resulting in a total of 98 treatments table s1 three replicates were performed for each treatment the experimental conditions were consistent with those used for the single exposures mortality and immobilization were recorded for each treatment after 24 and 48 h and the lc50 and ec50 values at 48 h were then calculated in addition to the tu method the ai and the mti methods were also applied to assess the combined toxicity wang et al 2021b xu and nirmalakhandan 1998 the calculation details for the three methods are provided in the supplementary material 2 6 adsorption performance of apfo on pristine and aged ps we also studied the adsorption kinetics of apfo on pristine and aged ps the initial concentrations of the pristine ps aged ps and apfo were set at 10 10 and 100 mg l 1 respectively fifty milliliters of mixture i e pristine ps apfo or aged ps apfo was prepared in a 100 ml beaker the beakers were then sealed with parafilm and gently shaken at 150 rpm to bring the daphnids into full contact with the mps the experimental conditions were consistent with those applied in the toxicity tests three replicate beakers were sampled at 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 3 and 6 h the collected samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membranes millipore usa and the apfo concentrations in the filtrates were determined by liquid chromatography lc agilent lc 1100 usa with the limit of detection lod of 0 1 mg l 1 and the relative standard deviation rsd of 1 8 details for lc analysis are presented in the supplementary material 2 7 detecting mp aggregation and gut fullness of the daphnids the aggregation of mps in the medium and the mp gut fullness of the daphnids were detected while performing the co exposure experiments mp aggregates at the different toxic unit ratios were observed under an optical microscope nikon japan and their sizes were recorded every three hours at 24 h individual daphnids were rinsed in deionized water prior to a visual estimation of the percentage of gut fullness using depression slides and a stereomicroscope c psn nikon japan as described by gillis et al 2005 the actual estimate in each case was an interpolation between reference points 2 8 analyses of intestinal histology and lipid peroxidation lpo to analyze the intestinal histology and lpo in the daphnids two series of co exposure experiments of mps and apfo were conducted for 48 h at the randomly selected ratios which involved all the unique combined toxic modes identified one was a high concentration series with the apfo concentration fixed at half of its ec50 and mp concentrations set according to the selected toxic unit ratios table s2 the other was a low concentration series with the mp and apfo concentrations from the high concentration series reduced by two orders of magnitude making the exposure concentrations closer to environmental levels table s2 there were three replicates for each treatment with each containing 30 juvenile daphnids 4 7 d old at the end of these co exposure experiments daphnids were sampled from each replicate without depuration of the ingested mps for a histological analysis of the intestine the samples were fixed in bouin s solution sigma aldrich for 24 h dehydrated in a series of ethanol and xylene baths embedded in paraffin and horizontally sectioned 4 µm slice thickness by a pathology slicer shanghai leica instrument co ltd to around 75 of the body length of the daphnid the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin wuhan servicebio technology co ltd china and observed under a light microscope nikon eclipse e100 japan ten or more sections from each daphnid were examined to assess the abnormalities of the intestinal tissues for the lpo determination at least 20 daphnids were sampled from each replicate after 24 h of the exposure the samples were washed with ultrapure water 3 times and mixed with cell lysis buffer beyotime biotechnology shanghai china at a weight ratio of 1 9 the mixtures were then homogenized by an ultrasonic homogenizer scientz iid ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china 300 w at 4 c in an ice bath for 1 min with working and resting intervals of 5 s either the homogenates were collected to analyze their lpo levels spectrophotometrically using commercial kits a106 1 2 nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china following the manufacturer instructions 2 9 data analysis data are presented as the mean standard deviation sd the lc50 and ec50 values were derived by a logistic model using graphpad prism 9 2 0 graphpad software la jolla ca statistical comparison between the pristine and the aged ps in lc50 and ec50 values were performed by a t test in r v4 0 4 differences among treatments were analyzed by a one way analysis of variance with tukey s pairwise comparison tests spss 24 0 software differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface physicochemical properties of the mps the surface features of the mps were observed by sem both the pristine fig s1a and aged ps fig s1b were generally irregular stone like particles cracking and peeling appeared more often on the surfaces of the aged ps fig s1d than on the pristine ps fig s1c indicating that the uv induced aging likely caused the physical abrasion of the mps the raman fig s2a and ftir fig s2b results showed similar spectra between the pristine ps and the aged ps implying that uv induced aging had only a minor effect on the chemical composition of the mps typical ps functional groups including cc c c ch ch2 and aromatic ring modes were detected in both spectra the peak assignments are detailed in the supplementary material in addition biofilm was not discernable on the aged ps particles under sem fig s1 and the similar ftir spectra in the pristine and the aged ps also suggested few biofilms formed on the surface of the aged ps fig s2 this could be attributed to the pond water used for the aging of mps which had been filtered through the 0 45 μm polycarbonate membranes and was exposed to uv light and thus most microorganisms e g algae and bacteria that play critical roles in biofilm generation were removed 3 2 mono toxicity of pristine ps aged ps and apfo to d magna the mortality and immobilization of d magna during the 48 h single exposures to pristine ps aged ps and apfo increased with the exposure concentration fig s3 the 48 h lc50 values for the pristine ps aged ps and apfo were 56 75 56 18 and 226 70 mg l 1 respectively the 48 h ec50 values of the pristine ps and aged ps to d magna were 29 05 and 31 23 mg l 1 respectively which were close to each other and slightly lower than that 34 3 mg l 1 previously reported eltemsah and bøhn 2019 this could be related to the larger size and the irregular shape of the ps particles used in our study versus those 6 μm beads used in eltemsah and bøhn s experiments within d magna s food size spectrum the larger mps tended to cause more physical harm such as internal abrasions and blockages after ingestion by the organisms wright et al 2013b and irregular mps could further reduce the survival of d magna likely due to their longer retention time and greater interference in the digestive tract than mp beads an et al 2021 besides statistics showed no significant differences p 0 1 in both mortality and immobilization between the pristine and the aged ps suggesting these two mps had similar mono toxicity to d magna the 48 h ec50 of apfo to d magna was 156 9 mg l 1 which was significantly less than another reported value 480 mg l 1 colombo et al 2008 differences in the culture conditions e g food light dark cycle and calculation procedures might partly account for this variation 3 3 combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna the mortality and immobilization of d magna after 24 and 48 h exposures to pristine ps apfo and aged ps apfo at different toxic unit ratios are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively similar to the mono exposure results the mortality and immobilization rates increased with the exposure concentrations of the mixed contaminants showing a significant dose response effect paired ec50 values for the mps and apfo in d magna at the different toxic unit ratios were calculated for the combined toxicity assessment table s3 the combined toxic modes obtained are shown in table 1 for pristine ps apfo the combined toxic effects were assessed as antagonism at 4 1 and 1 4 synergism at 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 and partial addition antagonism at 2 1 and 1 1 table 1 for aged ps apfo antagonistic effects were indicated for all ratios except 3 1 and 1 3 at which partial addition antagonism was suggested currently few studies have comprehensively investigated the combined toxicity of mps and pfcs in aquatic organisms rainieri et al 2018 reported that the combined effect of low density polyethylene mps and their adsorbed mixture containing pfcs significantly altered the organ homeostasis of zebrafish relative to the mixture alone similarly differences in toxicity were observed between the combined and single exposures in the present study to our surprise the combined effects of the mps and apfo on d magna varied with changes in the concentration ratios table 1 this implies that a conventional combined toxicity assessment at a single or fixed concentration combination would not sufficiently reflect the multiple scenarios that can occur in the real environment 3 4 mechanisms underlying the combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna to reveal the mechanism underlying the combined toxicity of the mps and apfo to d magna we started from two possible ways in which apfo interacts with mps one was to consider the adsorption of apfo to mps which would mean that mps could alter the toxicity of apfo to d magna by changing the apfo concentrations in both the medium and daphnid another possibility was that apfo might affect the aggregation of mps thereby resizing the mps in the medium and in turn influencing their ingestion and egestion by the daphnids this would consequently vary the degree of intestinal blockage and thus the level of secondary physiological and biochemical responses in d magna both potential explanations were tested and are discussed in 3 4 1 to 3 4 4 below 3 4 1 adsorption of apfo to mps the 6 h adsorption kinetics of apfo on mps was investigated to determine its effect on the combined toxicity of the two contaminants to d magna the results showed that the apfo concentrations stayed constant in the presence of either pristine or aged ps fig s4 suggesting these mps have poor adsorption capacities for apfo this is the first report on apfo adsorption on mps while previous studies showed a wide range of uptake percentage from 0 to over 90 mostly below 50 in terms of different mps and other different pfcs ateia et al 2020 bakir et al 2014 llorca et al 2018 the weak adsorption of apfo by both pristine and aged ps particles found in this study implied that apfo adsorption to mps was unlikely to affect their combined toxicity 3 4 2 aggregation of mps in the medium the aggregation of mps in the medium was examined to learn its role in the combined toxic effects of mps and apfo to d magna initially t 0 h both pristine and aged ps particles were evenly distributed in the medium without significant aggregation observed fig s5 after 6 h the degree of aggregation at the different toxic unit ratios differed as suggested by the aggregate sizes for both mps fig 3 a b for the toxic unit ratio mps apfo range of 4 1 to 1 1 the aggregate sizes increased with the decrease in ratios reaching a maximum 180 μm for pristine ps and 150 μm for aged ps at 1 1 as the ratios decreased further from 1 1 to 1 4 the aggregates became smaller fig 3a b the factors affecting mp aggregation in aquatic environment have been reported to include physicochemical properties of mps size composition surface coating environmental conditions electrolyte concentration and valence ph dom surfactant light and other factors such as coexisting particles and physical process sun et al 2021 wang et al 2021c since the properties of the used mps were consistent and the combined exposures did not involve other particles or any changes of physical process apfo likely had a crucial effect on the mp aggregation by changing environmental conditions considering the negligible adsorption of apfo on mps the electrolytes i e the ammonium salts in the medium may play an important role in the mp aggregation possibly by influencing the surface charge of particles alimi et al 2018 or changing the ionic valence of the opposite charge to aggregates wang et al 2021a however the mechanism how ammonium salts exactly affect mp aggregation remains to be further identified the mp aggregates formed at 2 1 and 1 1 for pristine ps apfo fig 3a and at 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 for aged ps apfo fig 3b were beyond d magna s food size spectrum of 0 2 70 μm rosenkranz et al 2009 with our understanding of daphnia physiology these large aggregates could hardly enter the daphnid body to cause their effects ebert 2005 and consequently the combined toxicity was low partial addition antagonism for pristine ps apfo and antagonism for aged ps apfo table 1 at these ratios aggregates observed at 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 for pristine ps apfo and at 3 1 and 1 3 for aged ps apfo ranged from 30 to 50 μm fig 3a b while those observed at 4 1 and 1 4 for both pristine ps apfo and aged ps apfo were smaller than 30 μm fig 3a b previous studies have shown that d magna can readily ingest mps of various sizes within food size spectrum jemec et al 2016 ogonowski et al 2016 with the smaller mps clearing more rapidly than the larger ones aljaibachi and callaghan 2018 rosenkranz et al 2009 this helps to develop a hypothesis that both aggregates could be easily ingested by d magna but the aggregates ranging from 30 to 50 μm would be difficultly egested compared to those smaller than 30 μm accordingly aggregates ranging from 30 to 50 μm would be more accumulative in the daphnids leading to a higher risk of intestinal blockage and thus higher toxicity in contrast the aggregates below 30 μm would have a lower accumulation potential resulting in less intestinal blockage and finally lower toxicity along with our adsorption results that mps could hardly transfer apfo to the organism this hypothesis could reasonably explain how the mp aggregation related to the combined toxicity mode this hinted that the combined toxic effects of mps and apfo were closely related to the degree of mp accumulation that could lead to intestinal blockage which was further supported by the gut fullness data presented in 3 4 3 3 4 3 gut fullness of d magna with mps in this study the gut fullness of the daphnids was quantified as the percentage of gut length filled with mps as a measure of their accumulation after 24 h co exposures to mps and apfo at various toxic unit ratios the gut fullness of the daphnids was determined under an optical microscope generally the gut fullness with pristine ps was higher than that with aged ps for each toxic unit ratio fig 3c d this implies that the daphnids tended to eat more pristine ps than aged ps when both mps were at the same level in other words the pristine ps was more likely to cause intestinal blockage than the aged ps leading to the greater combined toxicity to d magna within the combined exposures pristine ps apfo or aged ps apfo the gut fullness nicely aligned with the combined toxicity and was consistent with our inferences from the mp aggregation results for pristine ps apfo fig 3c synergism occurred at the toxic unit ratios with higher gut fullness 47 at 3 1 52 at 1 2 and 51 at 1 3 while antagonism or partial addition antagonism was observed at those with less mp accumulation 27 35 for aged ps apfo fig 3d partial addition antagonism occurred at 3 1 and 1 3 with higher gut fullness of 42 and 38 respectively whereas only antagonism occurred at the other ratios with lower gut fullness 20 26 as discussed in 3 4 2 on mp aggregation aggregates ranging from 30 to 50 μm 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 for pristine ps apfo 3 1 and 1 3 for aged ps apfo fig 3a b would have a higher accumulation potential and thus a higher risk of intestinal blockage due to their relatively difficult elimination by d magna this was accordingly reflected by the higher gut fullness 47 52 for pristine ps apfo 38 42 for aged ps apfo at these ratios fig 3c d the aggregates over 70 μm that cannot be ingested by d magna 2 1 and 1 1 for pristine ps apfo 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 for aged ps apfo fig 3a b as well as those below 30 μm that can be easily eliminated 4 1 and 1 4 for both pristine and aged ps apfo fig 3a b were unlikely to cause mp accumulation this was corroborated by the lower gut fullness 27 35 for pristine ps apfo 20 26 for aged ps apfo at the corresponding ratios fig 3c d overall evident combined toxic effects were generally accompanied by higher gut fullness and larger aggregates within d magna s food size spectrum that favor mp accumulation indicating that intestinal blockage could be the primary cause of the combined toxicity 3 4 4 histological alterations in gut tissue and intestinal blockage mediated oxidative stress histological sectioning allows for the direct visualization of the combined toxic effects of mps and apfo on the daphnid s gut tissue at a microscopic scale in addition lpo can be used as an indicator of oxidative stress which has been reported as a primary effect of the accumulation of mps in aquatic organisms qiao et al 2019 silva et al 2021 in this study the intestinal histology and lpo were analyzed for two series of combined concentrations to further understand the combined toxicity mechanism of mps and apfo to d magna these results are shown in fig 4 a m as shown in the control fig 4k the intestinal tissues of d magna normally consist of simple columnar cuboidal epithelium cells with an apical cell surface modified as a regular border of microvilli throughout the inner ring of the intestine lyu et al 2021 for the high concentration series fig 4a e mp accumulation was clearly observed in the gut lumen and the microvilli could hardly be recognized indicating a certain degree of damage at the toxic unit of 1 2 for pristine ps apfo fig 4b for which the corresponding combined toxic mode was synergism the epithelial cells were severely degenerated and the accumulated mps appeared to tangle up the intestinal contents by contrast at 2 1 for pristine ps apfo fig 4a and at 3 1 for aged ps apfo fig 4d for which the modes were assessed as partial addition antagonism although the epithelial cell boundaries were indistinct the outer ring of the intestine was as smooth as that of the control fig 4k with plentiful mps in the gut lumen compared to these results when antagonism was the identified mode at 1 4 for both pristine and aged ps apfo fig 4c 4e the mps were scattered in the gut lumen the epithelial cells could be individually distinguished and the intestinal wall was as thin as that of the control fig 4k thus the histological results for the high concentration series were generally consistent with the identified combined toxic modes with the exception of the aged ps apfo at 1 4 fig 4j for the low concentration series the intestinal damages appeared milder with the microvilli well recognized fig 4f i different degrees of local swellings in the epithelial cells were seen in all treatments however no significant pattern was observed between the damages and the modes fig 4f j nevertheless the presence of intestinal damages at the low concentration series μg l 1 levels strongly implies that the risks from future long term exposure to mps and apfo in aquatic environments cannot be ignored because peroxidative damage to unsaturated fatty acids typically occurs during oxidative stress pandey et al 2003 lpo has been used to indicate oxidative damage in various organisms including d magna lv et al 2018 sayeed et al 2003 in our study the lpo levels are presented as the ratio of the actual lpo concentrations of the treatments to that of the control consistent with the histological results for the high concentration series the highest lpo level was observed at 1 2 fig 4l where the highest gut fullness and synergism had been identified for pristine ps apfo fig 3c table 1 moreover within the combinations the lpo levels decreased when the identified toxic mode was tempered and the gut fullness lowered for instance for pristine ps apfo the lpo levels fig 4l as well as the intestinal damage fig 4a c and gut fullness fig 3c followed the toxic mode order of synergism partial addition antagonism antagonism a synergistic increase in oxidative stress was also observed under the combined exposure of mps and benzophenone 3 in d magna which could be attributed to the enhanced accumulation of benzophenone 3 by mps na et al 2021 in contrast our result hinted that mp accumulation could induce oxidative stress which reportedly works by increasing reactive oxygen species jeong et al 2016 or disrupting energy metabolism kim et al 2019 studies in nematodes have found that the ingestion and accumulation of nano scaled mps can cause oxidative stress and intestinal injury at ug l 1 levels lei et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 similarly oxidative stress and intestinal injury were also detected for the low concentration series at the ug l 1 levels in this study the lpo levels for the low concentration series fig 4m under the different mp and apfo co exposures tended to be comparable p 0 1 with the exception of aged ps apfo at 1 4 where the intestinal damage was correspondingly more severe fig 4j this again supports that the combined toxicity of mps and apfo at low exposure concentrations could pose environmental risks by disturbing the important roles of zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems harris et al 2012 overall the results for the intestinal histology and lpo levels at high exposure concentrations corresponded well with the identified combined toxic modes and the degree of gut fullness this provides further evidence that the combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna is closely related to intestinal blockage which leads to secondary physiological and biochemical responses the correspondence was insignificant for the co exposures of mps and apfo at low concentrations even so intestinal damage did occur implying that the risks from long term exposure to mps and pfcs at environmental concentrations should receive careful attention 4 conclusions and implications in this study the combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna was evaluated under various toxic unit ratios by three classic methods tu ai and mti the results showed that the combined toxic modes of the mps and apfo to d magna involved synergism antagonism and partial addition which varied with the changes of the co exposure concentration ratios we further found that apfo could alter mp aggregation and lead to varying degrees of gut fullness which played a critical role in diverging combined toxicity particularly larger mp aggregates within d magna s food size spectrum tended to accumulate in the gut and cause greater toxicity than those smaller or beyond the food size spectrum this raises a new point to better understand the mechanism of combined toxicity in future studies that close attention should be paid to changes to individual contaminants that can be induced by their interactions our findings at the high exposure concentrations suggest that the combined toxicity of mps and apfo occurs in the daphnid s gut and is expressed as physiological and biochemical responses mediated by intestinal blockage in fact numerous studies have reported that the accumulation of mps can cause blockages inducing biological effects in the intestines of aquatic organisms however to what degree the intestinal blockages induce the biological effects remains unclear this study preliminarily related intestinal histology with the percentage of gut length filled with mps quantifying the mediation of biological effects by intestinal blockage to some extent our observations of intestinal damages at low exposure concentrations led us to call for attention to the risks from future long term exposure to mps and pfcs in aquatic environments especially given the continuous global production and application of plastics moreover population survival community structure and ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems under different combined toxic effects are worth further in depth studies this work demonstrates the necessity of assessing combined toxicity under different concentration ratios and

15903,microplastics mps have worldwide accumulated in aquatic environments and coexisted with various water contaminants including perfluorinated compounds pfcs that are frequently detected the adverse effects of individual mps or pfcs on aquatic organisms have been extensively reported however the combined toxicity of mps and pfcs remains unknown this study evaluated the combined toxicity of mps pristine and aged polystyrene ps and a pfc ammonium perfluorooctanoate apfo to daphnia magna under different concentration ratios by three classic methods toxicity unit additive index and mixed toxicity index the adsorption kinetics of apfo on mps aggregation of mps in exposure medium mp gut fullness of daphnids intestinal histology and lipid peroxidation were analyzed to reveal the mechanism underlying the combined toxicity our results showed that the combined toxic modes varied with the concentration ratios of mps to apfo antagonism at 4 1 and 1 4 synergism at 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 and partial addition antagonism at 2 1 and 1 1 for pristine ps apfo antagonism at all ratios except partial addition antagonism at 3 1 and 1 3 for aged ps apfo which could be attributed to the alteration of mp aggregation and thus mp gut fullness in the daphnids the combined toxicity was further confirmed to occur in the daphnid s gut which was reflected in physiological and biochemical responses mediated by intestinal blockage observable intestinal damages under co exposures at μg l 1 levels indicated the risks from future long term exposure to mps and pfcs in aquatic environments

and starvation wang et al 2018 in addition mps are normally associated with a cocktail of harmful chemicals including their ingredients byproducts produced during their manufacture and pollutants in water that accumulate on them when they become debris chen et al 2021 rochman 2015 these chemicals can be bioaccumulated browne et al 2008 wright et al 2013b and transferred through the food chain farrell and nelson 2013 posing threats to human health there are also a variety of other pollutants such as perfluorinated compounds pfcs that coexist with mps in aquatic environments as is well known pfcs are a large group of manufactured compounds that have been widely used to make products more resistant to stains grease and water cheremisinoff 2016 stahl et al 2011 these compounds are

health risk assessment of co exposure to mps and their coexisting contaminants in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of mp suspensions and apfo solutions pristine ps

pristine and aged ps particles were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan the surface functional groups of these mps were determined by raman spectroscopy horiba labram hr800 japan and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is 50 usa by scanning between 50 and 4000 cm 1 2 3 test organism daphnia magna was purchased from everbright algae species co ltd china and cultured in oecd 202 culture medium at 20 1 c with a 12 12 light dark cycle and an illumination intensity of 2000 200 lx the culture medium was renewed twice a week and the daphnids were fed daily with a suspension 5 105 cells ml 1 of the green alga scenedesmus obliquus obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china 2 4 mono exposures of d magna to pristine ps aged ps and apfo the exposures of d magna to the individual contaminants generally followed the oecd standard method oecd 2004 briefly 10 neonates 24 h old at the start of the experiment were exposed to 50 ml of test solution pristine ps aged ps or apfo for a period of 48 h on a bath oscillator sha b guangzhou shenhua biotechnology co ltd china at 150 rpm seven pristine or aged ps concentrations 0 0 1 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg l 1 and six apfo concentrations 0 10 50 100 200 and 500 mg l 1 were tested with all treatments repeated three times independently during the exposures the culture conditions were the same as those during rearing except that the daphnids were not fed at 24 and 48 h the daphnids were characterized as healthy immobilized did not swim within 15 s after gentle agitation of the beaker or dead no heartbeat observed under a microscope and the results were recorded to calculate the median lethal concentration lc50 and median effective concentration ec50 oecd 2004 the validity of the tests was assured with a positive control test using k2cro7 in concentrations ranging from 0 2 5 mg l 1 and an immobilization or mortality rate in the controls below 10 at the end of the tests these criteria were also applied in the following combined toxicity tests 2 5 combined exposures of d magna to pristine ps apfo and aged ps apfo in this study the calculated ec50 values for the pristine ps aged ps and apfo were defined as their toxic units for the combined exposures the daphnids were exposed to 7 toxic unit ratios of mps pristine or aged ps to apfo 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 for 48 h seven combinations of concentrations for the pristine ps apfo or the aged ps apfo were set up for each of the 7 toxic unit ratios resulting in a total of 98 treatments table s1 three replicates were performed for each treatment the experimental conditions were consistent with those used for the single exposures mortality and immobilization were recorded for each treatment after 24 and 48 h and the lc50 and ec50 values at 48 h were then calculated in addition to the tu method the ai and the mti methods were also applied to assess the combined toxicity wang et al 2021b xu and nirmalakhandan 1998 the calculation details for the three methods are provided in the supplementary material 2 6 adsorption performance of apfo on pristine and aged ps we also studied the adsorption kinetics of apfo on pristine and aged ps the initial concentrations of the pristine ps aged ps and apfo were set at 10 10 and 100 mg l 1 respectively fifty milliliters of mixture i e pristine ps apfo or aged ps apfo was prepared in a 100 ml beaker the beakers were then sealed with parafilm and gently shaken at 150 rpm to bring the daphnids into full contact with the mps the experimental conditions were consistent with those applied in the toxicity tests three replicate beakers were sampled at 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 3 and 6 h the collected samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membranes millipore usa and the apfo concentrations in the filtrates were determined by liquid chromatography lc agilent lc 1100 usa with the limit of detection lod of 0 1 mg l 1 and the relative standard deviation rsd of 1 8 details for lc analysis are presented in the supplementary material 2 7 detecting mp aggregation and gut fullness of the daphnids the aggregation of mps in the medium and the mp gut fullness of the daphnids were detected while performing the co exposure experiments mp aggregates at the different toxic unit ratios were observed under an optical microscope nikon japan and their sizes were recorded every three hours at 24 h individual daphnids were rinsed in deionized water prior to a visual estimation of the percentage of gut fullness using depression slides and a stereomicroscope c psn nikon japan as described by gillis et al 2005 the actual estimate in each case was an interpolation between reference points 2 8 analyses of intestinal histology and lipid peroxidation lpo to analyze the intestinal histology and lpo in the daphnids two series of co exposure experiments of mps and apfo were conducted for 48 h at the randomly selected ratios which involved all the unique combined toxic modes identified one was a high concentration series with the apfo concentration fixed at half of its ec50 and mp concentrations set according to the selected toxic unit ratios table s2 the other was a low concentration series with the mp and apfo concentrations from the high concentration series reduced by two orders of magnitude making the exposure concentrations closer to environmental levels table s2 there were three replicates for each treatment with each containing 30 juvenile daphnids 4 7 d old at the end of these co exposure experiments daphnids were sampled from each replicate without depuration of the ingested mps for a histological analysis of the intestine the samples were fixed in bouin s solution sigma aldrich for 24 h dehydrated in a series of ethanol and xylene baths embedded in paraffin and horizontally sectioned 4 µm slice thickness by a pathology slicer shanghai leica instrument co ltd to around 75 of the body length of the daphnid the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin wuhan servicebio technology co ltd china and observed under a light microscope nikon eclipse e100 japan ten or more sections from each daphnid were examined to assess the abnormalities of the intestinal tissues for the lpo determination at least 20 daphnids were sampled from each replicate after 24 h of the exposure the samples were washed with ultrapure water 3 times and mixed with cell lysis buffer beyotime biotechnology shanghai china at a weight ratio of 1 9 the mixtures were then homogenized by an ultrasonic homogenizer scientz iid ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china 300 w at 4 c in an ice bath for 1 min with working and resting intervals of 5 s either the homogenates were collected to analyze their lpo levels spectrophotometrically using commercial kits a106 1 2 nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china following the manufacturer instructions 2 9 data analysis data are presented as the mean standard deviation sd the lc50 and ec50 values were derived by a logistic model using graphpad prism 9 2 0 graphpad software la jolla ca statistical comparison between the pristine and the aged ps in lc50 and ec50 values were performed by a t test in r v4 0 4 differences among treatments were analyzed by a one way analysis of variance with tukey s pairwise comparison tests spss 24 0 software differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface physicochemical properties of the mps the surface features of the mps were observed by sem both the pristine fig s1a and aged ps fig s1b were generally irregular stone like particles cracking and peeling appeared more often on the surfaces of the aged ps fig s1d than on the pristine ps fig s1c indicating that the uv induced aging likely caused the physical abrasion of the mps the raman fig s2a and ftir fig s2b results showed similar spectra between the pristine ps and the aged ps implying that uv induced aging had only a minor effect on the chemical composition of the mps typical ps functional groups including cc c c ch ch2 and aromatic ring modes were detected in both spectra the peak assignments are detailed in the supplementary material in addition biofilm was not discernable on the aged ps particles under sem fig s1 and the similar ftir spectra in the pristine and the aged ps also suggested few biofilms formed on the surface of the aged ps fig s2 this could be attributed to the pond water used for the aging of mps which had been filtered through the 0 45 μm polycarbonate membranes and was exposed to uv light and thus most microorganisms e g algae and bacteria that play critical roles in biofilm generation were removed 3 2 mono toxicity of pristine ps aged ps and apfo to d magna the mortality and immobilization of d magna during the 48 h single exposures to pristine ps aged ps and apfo increased with the exposure concentration fig s3 the 48 h lc50 values for the pristine ps aged ps and apfo were 56 75 56 18 and 226 70 mg l 1 respectively the 48 h ec50 values of the pristine ps and aged ps to d magna were 29 05 and 31 23 mg l 1 respectively which were close to each other and slightly lower than that 34 3 mg l 1 previously reported eltemsah and bøhn 2019 this could be related to the larger size and the irregular shape of the ps particles used in our study versus those 6 μm beads used in eltemsah and bøhn s experiments within d magna s food size spectrum the larger mps tended to cause more physical harm such as internal abrasions and blockages after ingestion by the organisms wright et al 2013b and irregular mps could further reduce the survival of d magna likely due to their longer retention time and greater interference in the digestive tract than mp beads an et al 2021 besides statistics showed no significant differences p 0 1 in both mortality and immobilization between the pristine and the aged ps suggesting these two mps had similar mono toxicity to d magna the 48 h ec50 of apfo to d magna was 156 9 mg l 1 which was significantly less than another reported value 480 mg l 1 colombo et al 2008 differences in the culture conditions e g food light dark cycle and calculation procedures might partly account for this variation 3 3 combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna the mortality and immobilization of d magna after 24 and 48 h exposures to pristine ps apfo and aged ps apfo at different toxic unit ratios are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively similar to the mono exposure results the mortality and immobilization rates increased with the exposure concentrations of the mixed contaminants showing a significant dose response effect paired ec50 values for the mps and apfo in d magna at the different toxic unit ratios were calculated for the combined toxicity assessment table s3 the combined toxic modes obtained are shown in table 1 for pristine ps apfo the combined toxic effects were assessed as antagonism at 4 1 and 1 4 synergism at 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 and partial addition antagonism at 2 1 and 1 1 table 1 for aged ps apfo antagonistic effects were indicated for all ratios except 3 1 and 1 3 at which partial addition antagonism was suggested currently few studies have comprehensively investigated the combined toxicity of mps and pfcs in aquatic organisms rainieri et al 2018 reported that the combined effect of low density polyethylene mps and their adsorbed mixture containing pfcs significantly altered the organ homeostasis of zebrafish relative to the mixture alone similarly differences in toxicity were observed between the combined and single exposures in the present study to our surprise the combined effects of the mps and apfo on d magna varied with changes in the concentration ratios table 1 this implies that a conventional combined toxicity assessment at a single or fixed concentration combination would not sufficiently reflect the multiple scenarios that can occur in the real environment 3 4 mechanisms underlying the combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna to reveal the mechanism underlying the combined toxicity of the mps and apfo to d magna we started from two possible ways in which apfo interacts with mps one was to consider the adsorption of apfo to mps which would mean that mps could alter the toxicity of apfo to d magna by changing the apfo concentrations in both the medium and daphnid another possibility was that apfo might affect the aggregation of mps thereby resizing the mps in the medium and in turn influencing their ingestion and egestion by the daphnids this would consequently vary the degree of intestinal blockage and thus the level of secondary physiological and biochemical responses in d magna both potential explanations were tested and are discussed in 3 4 1 to 3 4 4 below 3 4 1 adsorption of apfo to mps the 6 h adsorption kinetics of apfo on mps was investigated to determine its effect on the combined toxicity of the two contaminants to d magna the results showed that the apfo concentrations stayed constant in the presence of either pristine or aged ps fig s4 suggesting these mps have poor adsorption capacities for apfo this is the first report on apfo adsorption on mps while previous studies showed a wide range of uptake percentage from 0 to over 90 mostly below 50 in terms of different mps and other different pfcs ateia et al 2020 bakir et al 2014 llorca et al 2018 the weak adsorption of apfo by both pristine and aged ps particles found in this study implied that apfo adsorption to mps was unlikely to affect their combined toxicity 3 4 2 aggregation of mps in the medium the aggregation of mps in the medium was examined to learn its role in the combined toxic effects of mps and apfo to d magna initially t 0 h both pristine and aged ps particles were evenly distributed in the medium without significant aggregation observed fig s5 after 6 h the degree of aggregation at the different toxic unit ratios differed as suggested by the aggregate sizes for both mps fig 3 a b for the toxic unit ratio mps apfo range of 4 1 to 1 1 the aggregate sizes increased with the decrease in ratios reaching a maximum 180 μm for pristine ps and 150 μm for aged ps at 1 1 as the ratios decreased further from 1 1 to 1 4 the aggregates became smaller fig 3a b the factors affecting mp aggregation in aquatic environment have been reported to include physicochemical properties of mps size composition surface coating environmental conditions electrolyte concentration and valence ph dom surfactant light and other factors such as coexisting particles and physical process sun et al 2021 wang et al 2021c since the properties of the used mps were consistent and the combined exposures did not involve other particles or any changes of physical process apfo likely had a crucial effect on the mp aggregation by changing environmental conditions considering the negligible adsorption of apfo on mps the electrolytes i e the ammonium salts in the medium may play an important role in the mp aggregation possibly by influencing the surface charge of particles alimi et al 2018 or changing the ionic valence of the opposite charge to aggregates wang et al 2021a however the mechanism how ammonium salts exactly affect mp aggregation remains to be further identified the mp aggregates formed at 2 1 and 1 1 for pristine ps apfo fig 3a and at 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 for aged ps apfo fig 3b were beyond d magna s food size spectrum of 0 2 70 μm rosenkranz et al 2009 with our understanding of daphnia physiology these large aggregates could hardly enter the daphnid body to cause their effects ebert 2005 and consequently the combined toxicity was low partial addition antagonism for pristine ps apfo and antagonism for aged ps apfo table 1 at these ratios aggregates observed at 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 for pristine ps apfo and at 3 1 and 1 3 for aged ps apfo ranged from 30 to 50 μm fig 3a b while those observed at 4 1 and 1 4 for both pristine ps apfo and aged ps apfo were smaller than 30 μm fig 3a b previous studies have shown that d magna can readily ingest mps of various sizes within food size spectrum jemec et al 2016 ogonowski et al 2016 with the smaller mps clearing more rapidly than the larger ones aljaibachi and callaghan 2018 rosenkranz et al 2009 this helps to develop a hypothesis that both aggregates could be easily ingested by d magna but the aggregates ranging from 30 to 50 μm would be difficultly egested compared to those smaller than 30 μm accordingly aggregates ranging from 30 to 50 μm would be more accumulative in the daphnids leading to a higher risk of intestinal blockage and thus higher toxicity in contrast the aggregates below 30 μm would have a lower accumulation potential resulting in less intestinal blockage and finally lower toxicity along with our adsorption results that mps could hardly transfer apfo to the organism this hypothesis could reasonably explain how the mp aggregation related to the combined toxicity mode this hinted that the combined toxic effects of mps and apfo were closely related to the degree of mp accumulation that could lead to intestinal blockage which was further supported by the gut fullness data presented in 3 4 3 3 4 3 gut fullness of d magna with mps in this study the gut fullness of the daphnids was quantified as the percentage of gut length filled with mps as a measure of their accumulation after 24 h co exposures to mps and apfo at various toxic unit ratios the gut fullness of the daphnids was determined under an optical microscope generally the gut fullness with pristine ps was higher than that with aged ps for each toxic unit ratio fig 3c d this implies that the daphnids tended to eat more pristine ps than aged ps when both mps were at the same level in other words the pristine ps was more likely to cause intestinal blockage than the aged ps leading to the greater combined toxicity to d magna within the combined exposures pristine ps apfo or aged ps apfo the gut fullness nicely aligned with the combined toxicity and was consistent with our inferences from the mp aggregation results for pristine ps apfo fig 3c synergism occurred at the toxic unit ratios with higher gut fullness 47 at 3 1 52 at 1 2 and 51 at 1 3 while antagonism or partial addition antagonism was observed at those with less mp accumulation 27 35 for aged ps apfo fig 3d partial addition antagonism occurred at 3 1 and 1 3 with higher gut fullness of 42 and 38 respectively whereas only antagonism occurred at the other ratios with lower gut fullness 20 26 as discussed in 3 4 2 on mp aggregation aggregates ranging from 30 to 50 μm 3 1 1 2 and 1 3 for pristine ps apfo 3 1 and 1 3 for aged ps apfo fig 3a b would have a higher accumulation potential and thus a higher risk of intestinal blockage due to their relatively difficult elimination by d magna this was accordingly reflected by the higher gut fullness 47 52 for pristine ps apfo 38 42 for aged ps apfo at these ratios fig 3c d the aggregates over 70 μm that cannot be ingested by d magna 2 1 and 1 1 for pristine ps apfo 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 for aged ps apfo fig 3a b as well as those below 30 μm that can be easily eliminated 4 1 and 1 4 for both pristine and aged ps apfo fig 3a b were unlikely to cause mp accumulation this was corroborated by the lower gut fullness 27 35 for pristine ps apfo 20 26 for aged ps apfo at the corresponding ratios fig 3c d overall evident combined toxic effects were generally accompanied by higher gut fullness and larger aggregates within d magna s food size spectrum that favor mp accumulation indicating that intestinal blockage could be the primary cause of the combined toxicity 3 4 4 histological alterations in gut tissue and intestinal blockage mediated oxidative stress histological sectioning allows for the direct visualization of the combined toxic effects of mps and apfo on the daphnid s gut tissue at a microscopic scale in addition lpo can be used as an indicator of oxidative stress which has been reported as a primary effect of the accumulation of mps in aquatic organisms qiao et al 2019 silva et al 2021 in this study the intestinal histology and lpo were analyzed for two series of combined concentrations to further understand the combined toxicity mechanism of mps and apfo to d magna these results are shown in fig 4 a m as shown in the control fig 4k the intestinal tissues of d magna normally consist of simple columnar cuboidal epithelium cells with an apical cell surface modified as a regular border of microvilli throughout the inner ring of the intestine lyu et al 2021 for the high concentration series fig 4a e mp accumulation was clearly observed in the gut lumen and the microvilli could hardly be recognized indicating a certain degree of damage at the toxic unit of 1 2 for pristine ps apfo fig 4b for which the corresponding combined toxic mode was synergism the epithelial cells were severely degenerated and the accumulated mps appeared to tangle up the intestinal contents by contrast at 2 1 for pristine ps apfo fig 4a and at 3 1 for aged ps apfo fig 4d for which the modes were assessed as partial addition antagonism although the epithelial cell boundaries were indistinct the outer ring of the intestine was as smooth as that of the control fig 4k with plentiful mps in the gut lumen compared to these results when antagonism was the identified mode at 1 4 for both pristine and aged ps apfo fig 4c 4e the mps were scattered in the gut lumen the epithelial cells could be individually distinguished and the intestinal wall was as thin as that of the control fig 4k thus the histological results for the high concentration series were generally consistent with the identified combined toxic modes with the exception of the aged ps apfo at 1 4 fig 4j for the low concentration series the intestinal damages appeared milder with the microvilli well recognized fig 4f i different degrees of local swellings in the epithelial cells were seen in all treatments however no significant pattern was observed between the damages and the modes fig 4f j nevertheless the presence of intestinal damages at the low concentration series μg l 1 levels strongly implies that the risks from future long term exposure to mps and apfo in aquatic environments cannot be ignored because peroxidative damage to unsaturated fatty acids typically occurs during oxidative stress pandey et al 2003 lpo has been used to indicate oxidative damage in various organisms including d magna lv et al 2018 sayeed et al 2003 in our study the lpo levels are presented as the ratio of the actual lpo concentrations of the treatments to that of the control consistent with the histological results for the high concentration series the highest lpo level was observed at 1 2 fig 4l where the highest gut fullness and synergism had been identified for pristine ps apfo fig 3c table 1 moreover within the combinations the lpo levels decreased when the identified toxic mode was tempered and the gut fullness lowered for instance for pristine ps apfo the lpo levels fig 4l as well as the intestinal damage fig 4a c and gut fullness fig 3c followed the toxic mode order of synergism partial addition antagonism antagonism a synergistic increase in oxidative stress was also observed under the combined exposure of mps and benzophenone 3 in d magna which could be attributed to the enhanced accumulation of benzophenone 3 by mps na et al 2021 in contrast our result hinted that mp accumulation could induce oxidative stress which reportedly works by increasing reactive oxygen species jeong et al 2016 or disrupting energy metabolism kim et al 2019 studies in nematodes have found that the ingestion and accumulation of nano scaled mps can cause oxidative stress and intestinal injury at ug l 1 levels lei et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 similarly oxidative stress and intestinal injury were also detected for the low concentration series at the ug l 1 levels in this study the lpo levels for the low concentration series fig 4m under the different mp and apfo co exposures tended to be comparable p 0 1 with the exception of aged ps apfo at 1 4 where the intestinal damage was correspondingly more severe fig 4j this again supports that the combined toxicity of mps and apfo at low exposure concentrations could pose environmental risks by disturbing the important roles of zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems harris et al 2012 overall the results for the intestinal histology and lpo levels at high exposure concentrations corresponded well with the identified combined toxic modes and the degree of gut fullness this provides further evidence that the combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna is closely related to intestinal blockage which leads to secondary physiological and biochemical responses the correspondence was insignificant for the co exposures of mps and apfo at low concentrations even so intestinal damage did occur implying that the risks from long term exposure to mps and pfcs at environmental concentrations should receive careful attention 4 conclusions and implications in this study the combined toxicity of mps and apfo to d magna was evaluated under various toxic unit ratios by three classic methods tu ai and mti the results showed that the combined toxic modes of the mps and apfo to d magna involved synergism antagonism and partial addition which varied with the changes of the co exposure concentration ratios we further found that apfo could alter mp aggregation and lead to varying degrees of gut fullness which played a critical role in diverging combined toxicity particularly larger mp aggregates within d magna s food size spectrum tended to accumulate in the gut and cause greater toxicity than those smaller or beyond the food size spectrum this raises a new point to better understand the mechanism of combined toxicity in future studies that close attention should be paid to changes to individual contaminants that can be induced by their interactions our findings at the high exposure concentrations suggest that the combined toxicity of mps and apfo occurs in the daphnid s gut and is expressed as physiological and biochemical responses mediated by intestinal blockage in fact numerous studies have reported that the accumulation of mps can cause blockages inducing biological effects in the intestines of aquatic organisms however to what degree the intestinal blockages induce the biological effects remains unclear this study preliminarily related intestinal histology with the percentage of gut length filled with mps quantifying the mediation of biological effects by intestinal blockage to some extent our observations of intestinal damages at low exposure concentrations led us to call for attention to the risks from future long term exposure to mps and pfcs in aquatic environments especially given the continuous global production and application of plastics moreover population survival community structure and ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems under different combined toxic effects are worth further in depth studies this work demonstrates the necessity of assessing combined toxicity under different concentration ratios and

herein gordonia sp td 4 a dnra driven sulfide oxidizing bacterium was used to elucidate the effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria on the durability of nitrate mediated souring control the results revealed that nitrate amendment combined with bio augmentation with td 4 after souring could effectively control souring and enhance the durability of nitrate mediated souring control while nitrate amendment before souring failed to persistently control souring nitrate amendment before and after souring resulted in different evolution dynamics of nitrate reducing bacteria denitrifying

practical and effective to enhance the potency of nitrate mediated souring control however remains to be investigated due to the complexity of interactions between nrb and srb in co culture systems agrawal et al 2012 han et al 2020 kraft et al 2014 wang et al 2021 furthermore the key driven factors that contribute to the short potency of nitrate mediated souring control resulting from the interactions between srb and nrb remain undiscovered our previous study isolated a nitrate reducing bacterium gordonia sp td 4 to demulsify emulsified pw qi et al 2021 2022a td 4 can reduce nitrate only via the dnra process fig s1 the genome data also indicated that the genome of td 4 contains a gene coding for sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr which can oxidize sulfide to polysulfide chains fig s2 shuman and hanson 2016 the addition of the viable bacterial cells of td 4 into emulsified alkaline surfactant polymer asp flooding pw resulted in the demulsification of emulsified asp flooding pw qi et al 2021 2022a 2022b this procedure i e bio demulsification transforms the microbial community structures and functions in pw through bio augmentation herrero and stuckey 2015 pandey et al 2020 however whether or not this procedure benefits nitrate mediated souring control still needs to be determined herein we focused on the effects of bio augmentation with dnra driven sob gordonia sp td 4 combined with nitrate injection before and after souring on the durability of nitrate mediated souring control the concentration profiles of nitrate nitrite and sulfide were linked to the composition and functions of microbial communities to elucidate the key factors that determined the long term potency of nitrate mediate souring control the adapting mechanisms of the predominant srb contributing to the resumption of accumulation of sulfide in nitrate amended environments were also investigated based on comparative and functional genomics analysis the findings were innovatively applied to simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control of emulsified and sour produced water from the petroleum industry the results provide novel perspectives and revolutionary strategies for the treatment of anaerobic bio sour fluids especially those from the petroleum industry 2 methods and materials 2 1 continuous experiments in co culture conditions the existence of sulfide may affect the competition between microbes which further influences the souring control therefore the effects of bio augmentation with td 4 on the nitrate mediated souring control before and after souring were investigated respectively in five anaerobic reactors table 1 two anaerobic serum bottles effective volume of 1 l reactor 1 and reactor 2 containing 800 ml of baar s medium more information can be obtained in supporting information were used to examine the effects of bio augmentation of td 4 on nitrate mediated souring control after souring the serum bottles were sterilized in an autoclave 115 c 30 min when the temperature decreased to approximately 90 c the serum bottles were vacuumed immediately and the headspace was filled with sterile n2 to avoid direct contact with air subsequently these two bottles were inoculated with 5 ml of srb contained microbial consortium with od600 1 0 and incubated at 170 rpm and 35 c for 5 d until souring was established one of the bottles was bio augmented with td 4 and amended with nitrate 415 mg n l while another bottle was amended with nitrate 415 mg n l only the volatile suspended solids vss concentration of td 4 after bio augmentation was 0 17 0 02 g vss l the bottles were continuously incubated at 170 rpm and 35 c for several days the operating statuses of reactors were monitored closely by sampling without replacement the samples were separately stored in two sterilized centrifugal tubes one was stored at 80 c for high throughput sequencing while the other was immediately used for chemical analysis when investigating the effects of bio augmentation of td 4 on the nitrate mediated souring control before souring the experiments were also conducted with two anaerobic serum bottles effective volume of 1 l reactor 3 and reactor 4 containing 800 ml of nitrate 415 mg n l amended baar s medium respectively both td 4 5 ml of inoculant with od600 1 0 and srb contained microbial consortium 5 ml of inoculant with od600 1 0 were inoculated to reactor 3 while reactor 4 was only inoculated with srb contained microbial consortium 5 ml of inoculant with od600 1 0 the serum bottles were sterilized in an autoclave 115 c 30 min when the temperature decreased to approximately 90 c the serum bottles were vacuumed immediately and the headspace was filled with sterile n2 the reactors were stirred magnetically 170 rpm in a heated water bath 35 c and operated continuously for several days the operation statuses of reactors were monitored closely by sampling without replacement the samples were separately stored in two sterilized centrifugal tubes one was stored at 80 c for high throughput sequencing while the other was immediately used for chemical analysis reactor 5 without amendment of nitrate and bio augmentation was operated as control these reactors were continuously operated for at least 13 days when the accumulation of sulfide resumed after the exhaustion of nitrate and nitrite the reactors were shut down by considering the operating status of these reactors during the whole operation period samples from specific periods were selected for time series high throughput sequencing to determine the evolution of microbial communities the details of grouping and sampling times for high throughput sequencing were shown in table 1 2 2 high throughput sequencing time series table 1 sludge samples from continuous operation of co culture systems were used for high throughput sequencing dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction pcr were performed as described elsewhere zhang et al 2020 the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using primers 515f 806r the pcr products were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform the raw sequences collected were deposited in nbci under accession number prjna792215 the raw sequences were analyzed using the qiime2 platform v2021 11 bolyen et al 2019 the adapters in raw sequences were removed by the cutadapt plug in qiime2 the sequence quality control was processed by the dada2 plug in qiime2 and high quality feature amplicon sequence variants asvs sequences with a mean length of 270 bp were collected the pre trained naive bayes classifier silva 138 99 otus from 515f 806r region of sequences provided by qiime2 was used for taxonomic analyses with a confidence threshold of 70 top 20 dominant assigned genera were reported and other genera with a relatively low abundance unassigned genera and uncultured genera were classified as others 2 3 functional analysis of bacterial community the putative functions of the bacterial community were predicted by picrust2 v2 4 1 based on the feature sequences and the feature table generated from the dada2 plugin in qiime2 douglas et al 2020 specifically the epa ng method was used to place sequences into the reference tree the output putative functions of the bacterial community were reported in the format of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos and the kegg pathway the resultant kos and pathway tables were rarefied using the r package vegan v2 5 7 all hits of kos associated with denitrification and dnra were retained for functional composition and functional trait analyses due to the limitation of picrust2 douglas et al 2020 comparative and functional genomics analyses were used to deduce the potential functions kos table s1 of the dominant genus of nr sob table s2 and srb table s3 the genome data of a specific genus was retrieved in ncbi genome database that was available before december 1 2021 and the protein coding gene sequences of all the species were downloaded for kegg assignment duplicate data were removed from the downloaded results based on the taxonomy id kos and kegg pathway annotations were based on the database of eggnog 5 0 huerta cepas et al 2019 python library eggnog mapper v2 1 3 was used to process the annotations and seed orthologs were searched by diamond in sensitive mode the dataset of the resultant annotations can be available on mendeley data qi 2022 the resultant annotations were orderly retrieved to evaluate the gene functions associated with denitrification dnra and sulfide oxidation briefly the kos numbers shown in table s1 were used to match the annotation results the gene numbers hit during matching were reported 2 4 other analytical procedures and methods batch experiments investigating the effects of dissolved sulfide and undissolved sulfide on td 4 were detailed in supporting information si analytical procedures of chemical compounds including the concentration of dissolved sulfide undissolved sulfide nitrate nitrite and crude oil concentration were also stated in si one way analysis of variance anova analysis and student s t test were performed in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of bio augmentation with td 4 on nitrate mediated souring control 3 1 1 effects of sulfide on td 4 under pure culture conditions nitrate and ammonia nitrogen were utilized as sole nitrogen sources respectively to simulate nitrate reducing conditions and non nitrate reducing conditions and to investigate the effects of dissolved sulfide on td 4 in pure culture conditions the batch experiments showed that td 4 could effectively remove sulfide under anaerobic nitrate reducing conditions fig 1 a when the influent concentration of sulfide increased to 650 mg s l the removal efficiency was still higher than 35 fig 1a however when ammonia was utilized as a sole nitrogen source sulfide could not be removed fig 1b these results suggested that bio demulsifying bacterium td 4 was a dnra driven sulfide oxidizing bacterium the high tolerance of td 4 to sulfide concentrations was consistent with reports that sulfide favor sob and dnra bacteria over heterotrophic dnb dolfing and hubert 2017 murphy et al 2020 an interesting phenomenon was that the culture medium turned black in the following hours after the injection of sulfide indicating existed fe3 was reduced to fe2 and black undissolved sulfide precipitations fes were formed the formed sulfide precipitations could also be oxidized by td 4 since the black color of the medium ultimately faded further experiments demonstrated that the oxidation of sulfide by td 4 could be a carbon sources independent process and the oxidizing rate of dissolved sulfide 10 13 mg s l h was approximately two times higher than undissolved sulfide 4 94 mg s l h fig s3 td 4 preferred sulfide as electronic donors and the heterotrophic nitrate reduction of td 4 did not occur when sulfide existed fig s4 similar results were also reported in which heterotrophic reduction of nitrate occurred only after the depletion of sulfide an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 3 1 2 feasibility of bio augmentation under co culture conditions before and after souring bio augmentation with pure cultures often fails to perform as expected due to the interactions between microbes ascribed to the complexity of microbial communities herrero and stuckey 2015 to further investigate the feasibility of bio augmentation with td 4 on nitrate mediated souring control bio augmentation combined with nitrate amendment table 1 was performed in co culture conditions before and after souring respectively the results revealed that nitrate amendment after souring could control souring fig 2 a while nitrate amendment before souring failed to persistently control souring fig 2d time dependent concentration profiles of sulfide showed that bio augmentation with td 4 combined with nitrate amendment after souring reactor 1 resulted in durability in nitrate mediated souring control which was manifested by the immediate cessation of sulfide accumulation and long term exhaustion of sulfide fig 2a in contrast the control group reactor 2 only amended with nitrate after souring responded slowly to nitrate amendment and sulfide was continuously accumulated for 2 d fig 2a in addition the sulfide was not exhausted during the whole period fig 2a continuous accumulation of sulfide after nitrate amendment might be attributable to the low abundance and activity of nrb murphy et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 in reactor 1 sulfide concentrations decreased linearly during the initial 1 5 d 5 0 d 6 5 d after nitrate injection fig 2a the removal rate of sulfide was as high as 10 16 mg s l h which was consistent with the oxidation rate of dissolved sulfide of td 4 fig s3a the specific sulfide removal rate reached 60 60 10 08 mg s g vss h during the following days from 6 5 d to 9 0 d the sulfide removal rate was diminished and the highest sulfide removal rate was only approximately 2 14 mg s l h fig 2a the oxidation of undissolved sulfide fes might account for the retarded oxidizing rate of sulfide fig s3b when undissolved sulfide fes was exhausted the color of reactor 1 turned orange yellow fig s5 indicating that polysulfide was formed nanda et al 2021 bio augmentation with td 4 combined with nitrate amendment after souring exhibited durability in nitrate mediated souring control since the accumulation of sulfide did not recover during the next 9 5 d from 9 5 d to 19 0 d fig 2a in reactor 2 sulfide concentrations began to steadily decrease after 2 25 d of nitrate amendment fig 2a the sulfide concentration decreased to 33 70 mg s l on day 14 0 fig 2a and then gradually recovered after the depletion of nitrate and nitrite on day 15 0 fig 2b and c reactor 3 and reactor 4 that were amended with nitrate before souring failed to control souring persistently and sulfide accumulated since day 4 fig 2d sulfide in reactor 3 sharply accumulated since day 8 while sulfide in reactor 4 did not unrestrained accumulate but reached a plateau period fig 2d a dynamic balance of generation and consumption of sulfide seemed to be achieved even though nitrate and nitrite have been depleted more interestingly the reactor 5 without nitrate amendment and bio augmentation showed a decrease in sulfide concentrations after a peak fig 2f complex microbial electrosynthetic processes might be responsible for nitrate independent sulfide oxidation blázquez et al 2016 luo et al 2019 marshall et al 2017 besides trace amounts of oxygen might be utilized by sob to oxidize sulfide fang et al 2020 overall sulfide oxidation accompanied nitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation and the resumption of sulfide accumulation was found after the exhaustion of nitrate nitrite fig 2b and c dramatic decrease in nitrate concentrations were identified in four nitrate amended reactors fig 2b e the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 1 resulted in a marked accumulation of nitrite from 70 05 mg n l to 388 25 mg n l while the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 2 did not result in the accumulation of nitrite fig 2c the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 1 was found after the exhaustion of sulfide on day 9 whereas the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 2 was identified after the exhaustion of dissolved sulfide on day 13 fig 2a this might be ascribed to the resumption of heterotrophic nitrate reducing activity of nrb after the depletion of dissolved sulfide an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 accumulated nitrite in reactor 1 was gradually reduced since day 9 5 and dramatically reduced from 325 5 mg n l to 0 since day 14 fig 2c the activity of heterotrophic dnra of td 4 might account for the gradual reduction of nitrite whereas the sharp reduction of nitrite was attributed to the activity of heterotrophic dnb fig 3 a kraft et al 2014 nitrate in reactors amended with nitrate before souring was consumed quickly within 3 days during which transient accumulation of nitrite was recorded fig 2e the accumulation of sulfide was unsurprisingly restored when nitrate and nitrite were depleted these results indicated the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control was associated with the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite and bio augmentation combined with nitrate amendment after souring could enhance the long term potency in nitrate mediated souring control 3 2 effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria on the shaping of microbial community structures 3 2 1 effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria after souring prior to nitrate amendment the microbial communities were dominated by typical fermentation genera such as bacteroides 18 0 28 0 romboutsia 12 0 32 0 and clostridium sensu stricto 4 1 14 2 fig 3 zeybek et al 2020 the dominant srb genera before nitrate amendment were desulfomicrobium 0 6 1 8 desulfobulbus 0 1 0 9 and desulfovibrio 0 5 0 9 when souring was established on day 5 bio augmentation with gordonia sp td 4 changed the microbial structures which manifested as an increase in the relative abundance of td 4 from 0 to 25 5 fig 3 td 4 became the dominant genus but this competitive advantage over thioclava lasted less than 8 d fig 3 the relative abundance of td 4 showed a decreased trend with the exhaustion of sulfide since day 9 and the abundance of td 4 was only 8 6 on day 21 bio augmentation with td 4 resulted in the enrichment of thioclava since day 7 especially after the exhaustion of sulfide on day 9 the abundance of thioclava increased to 13 3 on day 9 and then to 49 6 on day 21 in contrast the control reactor which was only amended with nitrate resulted in the enrichment of pseudomonas fig 3 thioclava was also enriched to 8 7 on day 14 when the sulfide concentration was lowest in reactor 2 the enrichment of pseudomonas was responsible for sulfide oxidation in reactor 2 zhang et al 2020 2018 the prevalence of thioclava and pseudomonas after the exhaustion of sulfide showed a high correlation with the rapid consumption of nitrate and nitrite fig 2b and c in both nitrate amended reactors after souring the predominant srb fig 3b desulfobacterota phylum fig s6 including desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus and desulfovibrio maintained a high fraction indicating that nitrate mediated souring control after souring did not possess lethal effects on srb unique adaptation mechanisms of srb in nitrate amended environments might be responsible for the responsive resumption of sulfide accumulation after the exhaustion of nitrate nitrite gieg et al 2011 jurelevicius et al 2021 kamarisima et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 this result also highlighted the crucial role of the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite on the durability of nitrate mediated souring control an et al 2010 fan et al 2020 qi et al 2021 3 2 2 effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria before souring nitrate amendment before souring resulted in a different evolution dynamic of microbial communities fig 3a on the one hand bio augmentation with td 4 before souring did not perform as expected td 4 failed to be the dominant bacteria and its relative abundance was less than 0 2 during the whole operating period fig 3a on the other hand pseudomonas constituted the dominant genus in both reactors fig 3a the complex interactions between microbes might be responsible for this phenomenon herrero and stuckey 2015 pseudomonas was a typical genus of heterotrophic dnb zhang et al 2020 without the inhibition of sulfide on heterotrophic dnb murphy et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 the competition for nitrate and nitrite between heterotrophic dnb and dnra bacteria and the long generation time of dnra bacteria might account for the failure of the prevalence of td 4 kraft et al 2014 the high heterotrophic denitrifying activity of pseudomonas was responsible for the dramatic consumption of nitrate and nitrite which resulted in the transiency of nitrate mediated souring control fig 2d e although without the amendment of nitrate the relative abundance of so called sob including thioclava luo et al 2019 and sulfurospirillum berg et al 2019 exhibited a growing tendency over time in reactor 4 and reactor 5 respectively fig 3a the relative abundance of thioclava increased from 3 0 on day 5 to 4 3 on day 14 in reactor 4 while the relative abundance of sulfurospirillum was even as high as 7 2 in reactor 5 on day 13 sulfurospirillum can use many kinds of electronic acceptors including fe3 berg et al 2019 co2 marshall et al 2017 and trace amounts of o2 marshall et al 2017 to oxidize sulfide the existence of potential electroactive microbes including trichococcus saheb alam et al 2019 sulfurospirillum blázquez et al 2016 marshall et al 2017 thioclava luo et al 2019 indicated that nitrate independent sulfide oxidation might be due to the microbial electrosynthetic processes more details should be investigated in the future 3 3 potential mechanisms responsible for the durability of nitrate mediated souring control 3 3 1 heterotrophic denitrification determined the durability of nitrate mediated souring control the success of nitrate mediated souring control relied on the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite the nitrate reducing activity after the depletion of dissolved sulfide seemed to determine the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite since the sulfide driven autotrophic nitrate reduction could not quickly reduce nitrate and nitrite fig 2 and the heterotrophic nitrate reduction did not occur before the depletion of sulfide fig s4b an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 the heterotrophic nitrate reduction after the depletion of sulfide might contribute to the rapid consumption of nitrate and nitrite the predicted function of microbial communities showed that enormous amounts of denitrification associated genes were enriched in reactors amended with nitrate before souring fig 4 a and the denitrification pathway was also enriched correspondingly fig 4c this result suggested that nitrate amendment before souring resulted in the enrichment of heterotrophic dnb which in turn quickly consumed nitrate and nitrite fig 2e and decreased the potency of nitrate mediated souring control indeed heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria represented by pseudomonas zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 thrived and became the predominant genera in these reactors fig 3a a similar result was also found in reactor 2 since day 9 fig 4a it should be noted that reactor 2 reactor 3 and reactor 4 also enriched dnra associated kos fig 4b this might be because the genome of pseudomonas usually contains two sets of nitrate reduction pathways dnra and denitrification dnra activity was mainly performed during the existence of sulfide while denitrifying activity was mainly performed after the depletion of sulfide murphy et al 2020 pandey et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 a rapid decline in nitrate was found in four reactors respectively fig 2b e the results of picrust2 however did not show enrichment of a high abundance of denitrification associated genes in reactor 1 fig 4a the prosperity of thioclava after the exhaustion of dissolved sulfide was proposed to be responsible for the dramatic declines of nitrate in reactor 1 fig 3a indeed the comparative and functional genomics analysis of all published genome data of thioclava table s2 confirmed this assumption fig 5 the results showed that denitrification specific genes e g nitrite reductase nirks and nitric oxide reductase norbc widely harbored in the genome of thioclava fig 5 without the inhibition of sulfide on norbc murphy et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 the shorter generation times as well as the higher rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction of dnb compared to dnra bacteria kraft et al 2014 constituted the main reasons for the gradual decrease in the relative abundance of td 4 and the increase in the relative abundance of thioclava after the exhaustion of dissolved sulfide fig 3a these results not only formally indicated that heterotrophic denitrification decreased the durability of nitrate mediated souring control but also further suggested that continuous injection of a high dosage of nitrate was less beneficial for long term souring control callbeck et al 2011 gassara et al 2015 grigoryan et al 2009 prajapat et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 continuous injection of nitrate likely resulted in the prevalence of denitrifying bacteria especially when dissolved sulfide was exhausted high activity of heterotrophic denitrification resulted in the failure in nitrate breakthrough which might constitute the main reasons why some oil reservoirs failed in nitrate mediated souring control callbeck et al 2011 grigoryan et al 2009 voordouw et al 2009 competition for electronic donors between heterotrophic nrb and srb was proposed as a basic mechanism in nitrate mediated souring control dolfing and hubert 2017 gassara et al 2015 gieg et al 2011 heterotrophic nitrate reduction however only occurred after the depletion of sulfide fig s4b an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 theoretically the richness of available carbon sources in oil reservoir fluids could provide abundant organic electronic donors for microbes including heterotrophic nrb and srb agrawal et al 2012 nowak et al 2018 okpala and voordouw 2018 therefore souring control by the competition of heterotrophic nrb with srb for available carbon sources may have limited applicability especially in oil reservoirs that are rich in carbon sources available for microbes agrawal et al 2012 lambo et al 2008 long term souring control was expected to be achieved by prolonging the retention of nitrate and nitrite in oil reservoir fluids an et al 2010 fan et al 2020 gieg et al 2011 qi et al 2021 the persistence of nitrate and nitrite to a great extent relied on the interactions between denitrification and dnra dnra possesses a lower reducing rate of nitrate and nitrite compared to denitrification kraft et al 2014 which can improve the durability of nitrate mediated souring control qi et al 2021 bio augmentation with dnra will compensate for the disadvantages of the long generation time of dnra bacteria kraft et al 2014 and further enhance the durability of nitrate mediated souring control a continuous dose of nitrate however will promote the abundance and the heterotrophic denitrifying activity of heterotrophic dnb fig 4 especially after the exhaustion of sulfide which in turn results in a decrease in the durability of nitrate mediated souring control pulsed injection of low concentrations of nitrate therefore is an ideal method in souring control callbeck et al 2011 voordouw et al 2009 since it can keep a relatively low concentration of sulfide in the reservoir fluid and a low concentration of sulfide maintains the competitive advantage of dnra bacteria over heterotrophic dnb 3 3 2 autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrate nitrite reducing ability endowed srb with unique niche adaptation mechanisms the relative abundance of predominant srb fig 3b desulfobacterota phylum fig s6 including desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfobulbus maintained a high fraction during nitrate amendment post souring which constituted a key reason why sulfide accumulation resumed rapidly after the exhaustion of nitrite fig 2a kamarisima et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 the reduction of sulfur and polysulfide might be another key reason responsible for the quick resumption of sulfide accumulation comparative genome analysis was then used to assess the potential response of the predominant srb genus table s3 to nitrate and nitrite complete dnra pathway including genes of nari nirb nrfh and nrfa was identified in all six species of desulfomicrobium seven species a total of nine of desulfobulbus and 59 species a total of 67 of desulfovibrio fig s7 the genome of some species of desulfovibrio also contained denitrification specific genes e g nirk and norb interestingly numerous species of desulfovibrio possess the homologous gene of sqr fig s7 which can catalyze the oxidation of sulfide to polysulfide chain shuman and hanson 2016 these results illuminated the uncharacterized metabolic abilities of srb in which autotrophic as well as heterotrophic nitrate and nitrite reduction including dnra and denitrification are broadly distributed in the predominant genus of srb these potential adaptation mechanisms allow the niche expansion of srb in nitrate amended environments kamarisima et al 2018 korte et al 2015 which prompts us to make updated decisions toward nitrate mediated souring control considering suitable amounts of sulfide benefit for heterotrophic dnb inhibition controlling the concentration of sulfide at a relatively low level should be the optimal strategy for nitrate mediated souring control therefore dynamically regulating rather than obliterating the activity of sulfate reduction is more beneficial and realistic which in turn further underscores the importance of long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control by pulsed injection of nitrate combined with bio augmentation with dnra driven sob not only can the activity of sulfate reduction and heterotrophic denitrification be regulated but also the potency of nitrate mediated souring control can be extended 3 4 application in simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control td 4 was originally isolated to demulsify the emulsified asp flooding pw from the petroleum industry qi et al 2021 the procedure of bio demulsification huang et al 2014 qi et al 2021 2022a transforms the microbial communities and functions through bio augmentation herrero and stuckey 2015 consequently during the process of bio demulsification sulfide oxidation driven by td 4 should be logically functional the bio demulsifying mechanisms of td 4 and the distribution of bacterial cells of td 4 in asp flooding pw are mediated by carbon sources water soluble and oil soluble carbon sources qi et al 2021 2022b we tested the effects of two bio demulsifying mechanisms involved demulsifying procedures that mediated by sodium acetate naac and paraffin oil on the nitrate mediated souring control the results demonstrated that simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control could be achieved fig 6 both two kinds of carbon sources mediated bio demulsifying procedures could effectively separate the emulsified crude oil from asp flooding pw fig 6a and the crude oil removal efficiency could reach 93 43 only the naac mediated bio demulsifying procedure fig 6c however could effectively control souring oxidizing sulfide fig 6b the mean concentration of total sulfide post demulsification 24 h decreased from 79 03 mg s l to 15 94 mg s l and the sulfide removal efficiency was as high as 79 83 in contrast the paraffin mediated bio demulsifying procedure only resulted in a slight decrease in sulfide concentration and the sulfide removal efficiency was only 15 59 this discrepancy was due to the distribution of bio demulsifying bacteria in asp flooding pw during demulsification qi et al 2021 2022b the development of the multifunctionality of bio demulsifiers provided a new decision making strategy to reduce the production costs of bio demulsifiers qi et al 2022a 2022b which was expected to speed up the application of bio demulsification the simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control of emulsified and sour pw fig 6c proposed in this study for the first time showed good compatibility with the sequencing batch settlement process which is widely used in oilfields for oil water separation deng et al 2005 without altering or increasing the constructions of the oil water separation process bio augmentation with dnra driven sob possessing bio demulsifying ability combined with pulsed injection of nitrate can not only improve the efficiency of oil water separation but also enhance the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control 4 conclusions nitrate amendment combined with bio augmentation with dnra driven sob after souring could effectively control souring and enhance the durability of nitrate mediated souring control continuous injection of a high concentration of nitrate may be less beneficial for souring control since denitrifying bacteria will be enriched especially after the depletion of sulfide and heterotrophic denitrifying activity will in turn decrease the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrate nitrite reduction endowed srb with unique niche adaptation mechanisms in nitrate amended environments dynamically regulating rather than obliterating the activity of sulfate reduction seemed to be more beneficial and realistic pulsed injection of nitrate combined with bio augmentation with dnra driven sob was proposed to be a potential method to regulate the interactions between srb and nrb and increase the durability of nitrate mediated souring control these findings were innovatively applied to simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control of produced water from the petroleum industry which has good adaptability to the current process and is expected to achieve a balance between cost and benefit declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural

results revealed that nitrate amendment combined with bio augmentation with td 4 after souring could effectively control souring and enhance the durability of nitrate mediated souring control while nitrate amendment before souring failed to persistently control souring nitrate amendment before and after souring resulted in different evolution dynamics of nitrate reducing bacteria denitrifying bacteria were enriched in reactors amended with nitrate before souring or in dissolved sulfide exhausted reactors amended with nitrate after souring the heterotrophic denitrifying activity of

2020 nitrate mediated souring control however continuously relies on the dosages of nitrate nitrite and exhaustion of nitrate nitrite will produce a rapid resumption of sulfide accumulation agrawal et al 2012 an et al 2010 jurelevicius et al 2021 prajapat et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control and the adaptation of srb to nitrate amended environments seem to determine the success of nitrate mediated souring control considering the competitive roles of nrb inoculation of competitive microbial strains bio augmentation as an antagonist has been proposed for souring control fan et al 2020 hubert and voordouw 2007 zhao et al 2016 among all the putative candidates of competitive nrb nr sob should the best candidate hubert and voordouw 2007 dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium dnra hubert and voordouw 2007 li et al 2020 song et al 2013 wang et al 2021 and denitrification zhang et al 2020 2018 are two potential pathways of nr sob to reduce nitrate the potential roles of dnra rather than denitrification in nitrate mediated souring control were highlighted in recent literature dolfing and hubert 2017 jahanbani veshareh and nick 2019 marietou et al 2020 dnra bacteria were widely reported to inhabit environments with high c no3 ratios and sulfide rich environments murphy et al 2020 van den berg et al 2015 wang et al 2021 sour oil reservoirs seem to provide the requisite conditions for the enrichment of dnra bacteria the process of dnra consumes more electron donors compared to complete denitrification when reducing the equivalent amounts of nitrate dolfing and hubert 2017 kraft et al 2014 pandey et al 2020 which implied that dnra bacteria possess more competitiveness over srb compared to heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria dnb moreover the lower reducing rates of nitrate and nitrite in dnra compared to denitrification can prolong the retention of nitrate and nitrite during souring control kraft et al 2014 which can enhance the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control qi et al 2021 however the long generation time of dnra bacteria compared to dnb weaken its advantage in souring control kraft et al 2014 in theory bio augmentation with dnra driven sob can augment the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control whether bio augmentation with dnra driven sob is practical and effective to enhance the potency of nitrate mediated souring control however remains to be investigated due to the complexity of interactions between nrb and srb in co culture systems agrawal et al 2012 han et al 2020 kraft et al 2014 wang et al 2021 furthermore the key driven factors that contribute to the short potency of nitrate mediated souring control resulting from the interactions between srb and nrb remain undiscovered our previous study isolated a nitrate reducing bacterium gordonia sp td 4 to demulsify emulsified pw qi et al 2021 2022a td 4 can reduce nitrate only via the dnra process fig s1 the genome data also indicated that the genome of td 4 contains a gene coding for sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr which can oxidize sulfide to polysulfide chains fig s2 shuman and hanson 2016 the addition of the viable bacterial cells of td 4 into emulsified alkaline surfactant polymer asp flooding pw resulted in the demulsification of emulsified asp flooding pw qi et al 2021 2022a 2022b this procedure i e bio demulsification transforms the microbial community structures and functions in pw through bio augmentation herrero and stuckey 2015 pandey et al 2020 however whether or not this procedure benefits nitrate mediated souring control still needs to be determined herein we focused on the effects of bio augmentation with dnra driven sob gordonia sp td 4 combined with nitrate injection before and after souring on the durability of nitrate mediated souring control the concentration profiles of nitrate nitrite and sulfide were linked to the composition and functions of microbial communities to elucidate the key factors that determined the long term potency of nitrate mediate souring control the adapting mechanisms of the predominant srb contributing to the resumption of accumulation of sulfide in nitrate amended environments were also investigated based on comparative and functional genomics analysis the findings were innovatively applied to simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control of emulsified and sour produced water from the petroleum industry the results provide novel perspectives and revolutionary strategies for the treatment of anaerobic bio sour fluids especially those from the petroleum industry 2 methods and materials 2 1 continuous experiments in co culture conditions the existence of sulfide may affect the competition between microbes which further influences the souring control therefore the effects of bio augmentation with td 4 on the nitrate mediated souring control before and after souring were investigated respectively in five anaerobic reactors table 1 two anaerobic serum bottles effective volume of 1 l reactor 1 and reactor 2 containing 800 ml of baar s medium more information can be obtained in supporting information were used to examine the effects of bio augmentation of td 4 on nitrate mediated souring control after souring the serum bottles were sterilized in an autoclave 115 c 30 min when the temperature decreased to approximately 90 c the serum bottles were vacuumed immediately and the headspace was filled with sterile n2 to avoid direct contact with air subsequently these two bottles were inoculated with 5 ml of srb contained microbial consortium with od600 1 0 and incubated at 170 rpm and 35 c for 5 d until souring was established one of the bottles was bio augmented with td 4 and amended with nitrate 415 mg n l while another bottle was amended with nitrate 415 mg n l only the volatile suspended solids vss concentration of td 4 after bio augmentation was 0 17 0 02 g vss l the bottles were continuously incubated at 170 rpm and 35 c for several days the operating statuses of reactors were monitored closely by sampling without replacement the samples were separately stored in two sterilized centrifugal tubes one was stored at 80 c for high throughput sequencing while the other was immediately used for chemical analysis when investigating the effects of bio augmentation of td 4 on the nitrate mediated souring control before souring the experiments were also conducted with two anaerobic serum bottles effective volume of 1 l reactor 3 and reactor 4 containing 800 ml of nitrate 415 mg n l amended baar s medium respectively both td 4 5 ml of inoculant with od600 1 0 and srb contained microbial consortium 5 ml of inoculant with od600 1 0 were inoculated to reactor 3 while reactor 4 was only inoculated with srb contained microbial consortium 5 ml of inoculant with od600 1 0 the serum bottles were sterilized in an autoclave 115 c 30 min when the temperature decreased to approximately 90 c the serum bottles were vacuumed immediately and the headspace was filled with sterile n2 the reactors were stirred magnetically 170 rpm in a heated water bath 35 c and operated continuously for several days the operation statuses of reactors were monitored closely by sampling without replacement the samples were separately stored in two sterilized centrifugal tubes one was stored at 80 c for high throughput sequencing while the other was immediately used for chemical analysis reactor 5 without amendment of nitrate and bio augmentation was operated as control these reactors were continuously operated for at least 13 days when the accumulation of sulfide resumed after the exhaustion of nitrate and nitrite the reactors were shut down by considering the operating status of these reactors during the whole operation period samples from specific periods were selected for time series high throughput sequencing to determine the evolution of microbial communities the details of grouping and sampling times for high throughput sequencing were shown in table 1 2 2 high throughput sequencing time series table 1 sludge samples from continuous operation of co culture systems were used for high throughput sequencing dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction pcr were performed as described elsewhere zhang et al 2020 the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using primers 515f 806r the pcr products were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform the raw sequences collected were deposited in nbci under accession number prjna792215 the raw sequences were analyzed using the qiime2 platform v2021 11 bolyen et al 2019 the adapters in raw sequences were removed by the cutadapt plug in qiime2 the sequence quality control was processed by the dada2 plug in qiime2 and high quality feature amplicon sequence variants asvs sequences with a mean length of 270 bp were collected the pre trained naive bayes classifier silva 138 99 otus from 515f 806r region of sequences provided by qiime2 was used for taxonomic analyses with a confidence threshold of 70 top 20 dominant assigned genera were reported and other genera with a relatively low abundance unassigned genera and uncultured genera were classified as others 2 3 functional analysis of bacterial community the putative functions of the bacterial community were predicted by picrust2 v2 4 1 based on the feature sequences and the feature table generated from the dada2 plugin in qiime2 douglas et al 2020 specifically the epa ng method was used to place sequences into the reference tree the output putative functions of the bacterial community were reported in the format of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos and the kegg pathway the resultant kos and pathway tables were rarefied using the r package vegan v2 5 7 all hits of kos associated with denitrification and dnra were retained for functional composition and functional trait analyses due to the limitation of picrust2 douglas et al 2020 comparative and functional genomics analyses were used to deduce the potential functions kos table s1 of the dominant genus of nr sob table s2 and srb table s3 the genome data of a specific genus was retrieved in ncbi genome database that was available before december 1 2021 and the protein coding gene sequences of all the species were downloaded for kegg assignment duplicate data were removed from the downloaded results based on the taxonomy id kos and kegg pathway annotations were based on the database of eggnog 5 0 huerta cepas et al 2019 python library eggnog mapper v2 1 3 was used to process the annotations and seed orthologs were searched by diamond in sensitive mode the dataset of the resultant annotations can be available on mendeley data qi 2022 the resultant annotations were orderly retrieved to evaluate the gene functions associated with denitrification dnra and sulfide oxidation briefly the kos numbers shown in table s1 were used to match the annotation results the gene numbers hit during matching were reported 2 4 other analytical procedures and methods batch experiments investigating the effects of dissolved sulfide and undissolved sulfide on td 4 were detailed in supporting information si analytical procedures of chemical compounds including the concentration of dissolved sulfide undissolved sulfide nitrate nitrite and crude oil concentration were also stated in si one way analysis of variance anova analysis and student s t test were performed in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of bio augmentation with td 4 on nitrate mediated souring control 3 1 1 effects of sulfide on td 4 under pure culture conditions nitrate and ammonia nitrogen were utilized as sole nitrogen sources respectively to simulate nitrate reducing conditions and non nitrate reducing conditions and to investigate the effects of dissolved sulfide on td 4 in pure culture conditions the batch experiments showed that td 4 could effectively remove sulfide under anaerobic nitrate reducing conditions fig 1 a when the influent concentration of sulfide increased to 650 mg s l the removal efficiency was still higher than 35 fig 1a however when ammonia was utilized as a sole nitrogen source sulfide could not be removed fig 1b these results suggested that bio demulsifying bacterium td 4 was a dnra driven sulfide oxidizing bacterium the high tolerance of td 4 to sulfide concentrations was consistent with reports that sulfide favor sob and dnra bacteria over heterotrophic dnb dolfing and hubert 2017 murphy et al 2020 an interesting phenomenon was that the culture medium turned black in the following hours after the injection of sulfide indicating existed fe3 was reduced to fe2 and black undissolved sulfide precipitations fes were formed the formed sulfide precipitations could also be oxidized by td 4 since the black color of the medium ultimately faded further experiments demonstrated that the oxidation of sulfide by td 4 could be a carbon sources independent process and the oxidizing rate of dissolved sulfide 10 13 mg s l h was approximately two times higher than undissolved sulfide 4 94 mg s l h fig s3 td 4 preferred sulfide as electronic donors and the heterotrophic nitrate reduction of td 4 did not occur when sulfide existed fig s4 similar results were also reported in which heterotrophic reduction of nitrate occurred only after the depletion of sulfide an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 3 1 2 feasibility of bio augmentation under co culture conditions before and after souring bio augmentation with pure cultures often fails to perform as expected due to the interactions between microbes ascribed to the complexity of microbial communities herrero and stuckey 2015 to further investigate the feasibility of bio augmentation with td 4 on nitrate mediated souring control bio augmentation combined with nitrate amendment table 1 was performed in co culture conditions before and after souring respectively the results revealed that nitrate amendment after souring could control souring fig 2 a while nitrate amendment before souring failed to persistently control souring fig 2d time dependent concentration profiles of sulfide showed that bio augmentation with td 4 combined with nitrate amendment after souring reactor 1 resulted in durability in nitrate mediated souring control which was manifested by the immediate cessation of sulfide accumulation and long term exhaustion of sulfide fig 2a in contrast the control group reactor 2 only amended with nitrate after souring responded slowly to nitrate amendment and sulfide was continuously accumulated for 2 d fig 2a in addition the sulfide was not exhausted during the whole period fig 2a continuous accumulation of sulfide after nitrate amendment might be attributable to the low abundance and activity of nrb murphy et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 in reactor 1 sulfide concentrations decreased linearly during the initial 1 5 d 5 0 d 6 5 d after nitrate injection fig 2a the removal rate of sulfide was as high as 10 16 mg s l h which was consistent with the oxidation rate of dissolved sulfide of td 4 fig s3a the specific sulfide removal rate reached 60 60 10 08 mg s g vss h during the following days from 6 5 d to 9 0 d the sulfide removal rate was diminished and the highest sulfide removal rate was only approximately 2 14 mg s l h fig 2a the oxidation of undissolved sulfide fes might account for the retarded oxidizing rate of sulfide fig s3b when undissolved sulfide fes was exhausted the color of reactor 1 turned orange yellow fig s5 indicating that polysulfide was formed nanda et al 2021 bio augmentation with td 4 combined with nitrate amendment after souring exhibited durability in nitrate mediated souring control since the accumulation of sulfide did not recover during the next 9 5 d from 9 5 d to 19 0 d fig 2a in reactor 2 sulfide concentrations began to steadily decrease after 2 25 d of nitrate amendment fig 2a the sulfide concentration decreased to 33 70 mg s l on day 14 0 fig 2a and then gradually recovered after the depletion of nitrate and nitrite on day 15 0 fig 2b and c reactor 3 and reactor 4 that were amended with nitrate before souring failed to control souring persistently and sulfide accumulated since day 4 fig 2d sulfide in reactor 3 sharply accumulated since day 8 while sulfide in reactor 4 did not unrestrained accumulate but reached a plateau period fig 2d a dynamic balance of generation and consumption of sulfide seemed to be achieved even though nitrate and nitrite have been depleted more interestingly the reactor 5 without nitrate amendment and bio augmentation showed a decrease in sulfide concentrations after a peak fig 2f complex microbial electrosynthetic processes might be responsible for nitrate independent sulfide oxidation blázquez et al 2016 luo et al 2019 marshall et al 2017 besides trace amounts of oxygen might be utilized by sob to oxidize sulfide fang et al 2020 overall sulfide oxidation accompanied nitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation and the resumption of sulfide accumulation was found after the exhaustion of nitrate nitrite fig 2b and c dramatic decrease in nitrate concentrations were identified in four nitrate amended reactors fig 2b e the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 1 resulted in a marked accumulation of nitrite from 70 05 mg n l to 388 25 mg n l while the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 2 did not result in the accumulation of nitrite fig 2c the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 1 was found after the exhaustion of sulfide on day 9 whereas the sharp decline of nitrate in reactor 2 was identified after the exhaustion of dissolved sulfide on day 13 fig 2a this might be ascribed to the resumption of heterotrophic nitrate reducing activity of nrb after the depletion of dissolved sulfide an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 accumulated nitrite in reactor 1 was gradually reduced since day 9 5 and dramatically reduced from 325 5 mg n l to 0 since day 14 fig 2c the activity of heterotrophic dnra of td 4 might account for the gradual reduction of nitrite whereas the sharp reduction of nitrite was attributed to the activity of heterotrophic dnb fig 3 a kraft et al 2014 nitrate in reactors amended with nitrate before souring was consumed quickly within 3 days during which transient accumulation of nitrite was recorded fig 2e the accumulation of sulfide was unsurprisingly restored when nitrate and nitrite were depleted these results indicated the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control was associated with the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite and bio augmentation combined with nitrate amendment after souring could enhance the long term potency in nitrate mediated souring control 3 2 effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria on the shaping of microbial community structures 3 2 1 effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria after souring prior to nitrate amendment the microbial communities were dominated by typical fermentation genera such as bacteroides 18 0 28 0 romboutsia 12 0 32 0 and clostridium sensu stricto 4 1 14 2 fig 3 zeybek et al 2020 the dominant srb genera before nitrate amendment were desulfomicrobium 0 6 1 8 desulfobulbus 0 1 0 9 and desulfovibrio 0 5 0 9 when souring was established on day 5 bio augmentation with gordonia sp td 4 changed the microbial structures which manifested as an increase in the relative abundance of td 4 from 0 to 25 5 fig 3 td 4 became the dominant genus but this competitive advantage over thioclava lasted less than 8 d fig 3 the relative abundance of td 4 showed a decreased trend with the exhaustion of sulfide since day 9 and the abundance of td 4 was only 8 6 on day 21 bio augmentation with td 4 resulted in the enrichment of thioclava since day 7 especially after the exhaustion of sulfide on day 9 the abundance of thioclava increased to 13 3 on day 9 and then to 49 6 on day 21 in contrast the control reactor which was only amended with nitrate resulted in the enrichment of pseudomonas fig 3 thioclava was also enriched to 8 7 on day 14 when the sulfide concentration was lowest in reactor 2 the enrichment of pseudomonas was responsible for sulfide oxidation in reactor 2 zhang et al 2020 2018 the prevalence of thioclava and pseudomonas after the exhaustion of sulfide showed a high correlation with the rapid consumption of nitrate and nitrite fig 2b and c in both nitrate amended reactors after souring the predominant srb fig 3b desulfobacterota phylum fig s6 including desulfomicrobium desulfobulbus and desulfovibrio maintained a high fraction indicating that nitrate mediated souring control after souring did not possess lethal effects on srb unique adaptation mechanisms of srb in nitrate amended environments might be responsible for the responsive resumption of sulfide accumulation after the exhaustion of nitrate nitrite gieg et al 2011 jurelevicius et al 2021 kamarisima et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 this result also highlighted the crucial role of the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite on the durability of nitrate mediated souring control an et al 2010 fan et al 2020 qi et al 2021 3 2 2 effects of bio augmentation with dnra bacteria before souring nitrate amendment before souring resulted in a different evolution dynamic of microbial communities fig 3a on the one hand bio augmentation with td 4 before souring did not perform as expected td 4 failed to be the dominant bacteria and its relative abundance was less than 0 2 during the whole operating period fig 3a on the other hand pseudomonas constituted the dominant genus in both reactors fig 3a the complex interactions between microbes might be responsible for this phenomenon herrero and stuckey 2015 pseudomonas was a typical genus of heterotrophic dnb zhang et al 2020 without the inhibition of sulfide on heterotrophic dnb murphy et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 the competition for nitrate and nitrite between heterotrophic dnb and dnra bacteria and the long generation time of dnra bacteria might account for the failure of the prevalence of td 4 kraft et al 2014 the high heterotrophic denitrifying activity of pseudomonas was responsible for the dramatic consumption of nitrate and nitrite which resulted in the transiency of nitrate mediated souring control fig 2d e although without the amendment of nitrate the relative abundance of so called sob including thioclava luo et al 2019 and sulfurospirillum berg et al 2019 exhibited a growing tendency over time in reactor 4 and reactor 5 respectively fig 3a the relative abundance of thioclava increased from 3 0 on day 5 to 4 3 on day 14 in reactor 4 while the relative abundance of sulfurospirillum was even as high as 7 2 in reactor 5 on day 13 sulfurospirillum can use many kinds of electronic acceptors including fe3 berg et al 2019 co2 marshall et al 2017 and trace amounts of o2 marshall et al 2017 to oxidize sulfide the existence of potential electroactive microbes including trichococcus saheb alam et al 2019 sulfurospirillum blázquez et al 2016 marshall et al 2017 thioclava luo et al 2019 indicated that nitrate independent sulfide oxidation might be due to the microbial electrosynthetic processes more details should be investigated in the future 3 3 potential mechanisms responsible for the durability of nitrate mediated souring control 3 3 1 heterotrophic denitrification determined the durability of nitrate mediated souring control the success of nitrate mediated souring control relied on the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite the nitrate reducing activity after the depletion of dissolved sulfide seemed to determine the persistent existence of nitrate and nitrite since the sulfide driven autotrophic nitrate reduction could not quickly reduce nitrate and nitrite fig 2 and the heterotrophic nitrate reduction did not occur before the depletion of sulfide fig s4b an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 the heterotrophic nitrate reduction after the depletion of sulfide might contribute to the rapid consumption of nitrate and nitrite the predicted function of microbial communities showed that enormous amounts of denitrification associated genes were enriched in reactors amended with nitrate before souring fig 4 a and the denitrification pathway was also enriched correspondingly fig 4c this result suggested that nitrate amendment before souring resulted in the enrichment of heterotrophic dnb which in turn quickly consumed nitrate and nitrite fig 2e and decreased the potency of nitrate mediated souring control indeed heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria represented by pseudomonas zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 thrived and became the predominant genera in these reactors fig 3a a similar result was also found in reactor 2 since day 9 fig 4a it should be noted that reactor 2 reactor 3 and reactor 4 also enriched dnra associated kos fig 4b this might be because the genome of pseudomonas usually contains two sets of nitrate reduction pathways dnra and denitrification dnra activity was mainly performed during the existence of sulfide while denitrifying activity was mainly performed after the depletion of sulfide murphy et al 2020 pandey et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 a rapid decline in nitrate was found in four reactors respectively fig 2b e the results of picrust2 however did not show enrichment of a high abundance of denitrification associated genes in reactor 1 fig 4a the prosperity of thioclava after the exhaustion of dissolved sulfide was proposed to be responsible for the dramatic declines of nitrate in reactor 1 fig 3a indeed the comparative and functional genomics analysis of all published genome data of thioclava table s2 confirmed this assumption fig 5 the results showed that denitrification specific genes e g nitrite reductase nirks and nitric oxide reductase norbc widely harbored in the genome of thioclava fig 5 without the inhibition of sulfide on norbc murphy et al 2020 tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 the shorter generation times as well as the higher rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction of dnb compared to dnra bacteria kraft et al 2014 constituted the main reasons for the gradual decrease in the relative abundance of td 4 and the increase in the relative abundance of thioclava after the exhaustion of dissolved sulfide fig 3a these results not only formally indicated that heterotrophic denitrification decreased the durability of nitrate mediated souring control but also further suggested that continuous injection of a high dosage of nitrate was less beneficial for long term souring control callbeck et al 2011 gassara et al 2015 grigoryan et al 2009 prajapat et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 continuous injection of nitrate likely resulted in the prevalence of denitrifying bacteria especially when dissolved sulfide was exhausted high activity of heterotrophic denitrification resulted in the failure in nitrate breakthrough which might constitute the main reasons why some oil reservoirs failed in nitrate mediated souring control callbeck et al 2011 grigoryan et al 2009 voordouw et al 2009 competition for electronic donors between heterotrophic nrb and srb was proposed as a basic mechanism in nitrate mediated souring control dolfing and hubert 2017 gassara et al 2015 gieg et al 2011 heterotrophic nitrate reduction however only occurred after the depletion of sulfide fig s4b an et al 2010 lambo et al 2008 theoretically the richness of available carbon sources in oil reservoir fluids could provide abundant organic electronic donors for microbes including heterotrophic nrb and srb agrawal et al 2012 nowak et al 2018 okpala and voordouw 2018 therefore souring control by the competition of heterotrophic nrb with srb for available carbon sources may have limited applicability especially in oil reservoirs that are rich in carbon sources available for microbes agrawal et al 2012 lambo et al 2008 long term souring control was expected to be achieved by prolonging the retention of nitrate and nitrite in oil reservoir fluids an et al 2010 fan et al 2020 gieg et al 2011 qi et al 2021 the persistence of nitrate and nitrite to a great extent relied on the interactions between denitrification and dnra dnra possesses a lower reducing rate of nitrate and nitrite compared to denitrification kraft et al 2014 which can improve the durability of nitrate mediated souring control qi et al 2021 bio augmentation with dnra will compensate for the disadvantages of the long generation time of dnra bacteria kraft et al 2014 and further enhance the durability of nitrate mediated souring control a continuous dose of nitrate however will promote the abundance and the heterotrophic denitrifying activity of heterotrophic dnb fig 4 especially after the exhaustion of sulfide which in turn results in a decrease in the durability of nitrate mediated souring control pulsed injection of low concentrations of nitrate therefore is an ideal method in souring control callbeck et al 2011 voordouw et al 2009 since it can keep a relatively low concentration of sulfide in the reservoir fluid and a low concentration of sulfide maintains the competitive advantage of dnra bacteria over heterotrophic dnb 3 3 2 autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrate nitrite reducing ability endowed srb with unique niche adaptation mechanisms the relative abundance of predominant srb fig 3b desulfobacterota phylum fig s6 including desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfobulbus maintained a high fraction during nitrate amendment post souring which constituted a key reason why sulfide accumulation resumed rapidly after the exhaustion of nitrite fig 2a kamarisima et al 2018 voordouw et al 2009 the reduction of sulfur and polysulfide might be another key reason responsible for the quick resumption of sulfide accumulation comparative genome analysis was then used to assess the potential response of the predominant srb genus table s3 to nitrate and nitrite complete dnra pathway including genes of nari nirb nrfh and nrfa was identified in all six species of desulfomicrobium seven species a total of nine of desulfobulbus and 59 species a total of 67 of desulfovibrio fig s7 the genome of some species of desulfovibrio also contained denitrification specific genes e g nirk and norb interestingly numerous species of desulfovibrio possess the homologous gene of sqr fig s7 which can catalyze the oxidation of sulfide to polysulfide chain shuman and hanson 2016 these results illuminated the uncharacterized metabolic abilities of srb in which autotrophic as well as heterotrophic nitrate and nitrite reduction including dnra and denitrification are broadly distributed in the predominant genus of srb these potential adaptation mechanisms allow the niche expansion of srb in nitrate amended environments kamarisima et al 2018 korte et al 2015 which prompts us to make updated decisions toward nitrate mediated souring control considering suitable amounts of sulfide benefit for heterotrophic dnb inhibition controlling the concentration of sulfide at a relatively low level should be the optimal strategy for nitrate mediated souring control therefore dynamically regulating rather than obliterating the activity of sulfate reduction is more beneficial and realistic which in turn further underscores the importance of long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control by pulsed injection of nitrate combined with bio augmentation with dnra driven sob not only can the activity of sulfate reduction and heterotrophic denitrification be regulated but also the potency of nitrate mediated souring control can be extended 3 4 application in simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control td 4 was originally isolated to demulsify the emulsified asp flooding pw from the petroleum industry qi et al 2021 the procedure of bio demulsification huang et al 2014 qi et al 2021 2022a transforms the microbial communities and functions through bio augmentation herrero and stuckey 2015 consequently during the process of bio demulsification sulfide oxidation driven by td 4 should be logically functional the bio demulsifying mechanisms of td 4 and the distribution of bacterial cells of td 4 in asp flooding pw are mediated by carbon sources water soluble and oil soluble carbon sources qi et al 2021 2022b we tested the effects of two bio demulsifying mechanisms involved demulsifying procedures that mediated by sodium acetate naac and paraffin oil on the nitrate mediated souring control the results demonstrated that simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control could be achieved fig 6 both two kinds of carbon sources mediated bio demulsifying procedures could effectively separate the emulsified crude oil from asp flooding pw fig 6a and the crude oil removal efficiency could reach 93 43 only the naac mediated bio demulsifying procedure fig 6c however could effectively control souring oxidizing sulfide fig 6b the mean concentration of total sulfide post demulsification 24 h decreased from 79 03 mg s l to 15 94 mg s l and the sulfide removal efficiency was as high as 79 83 in contrast the paraffin mediated bio demulsifying procedure only resulted in a slight decrease in sulfide concentration and the sulfide removal efficiency was only 15 59 this discrepancy was due to the distribution of bio demulsifying bacteria in asp flooding pw during demulsification qi et al 2021 2022b the development of the multifunctionality of bio demulsifiers provided a new decision making strategy to reduce the production costs of bio demulsifiers qi et al 2022a 2022b which was expected to speed up the application of bio demulsification the simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control of emulsified and sour pw fig 6c proposed in this study for the first time showed good compatibility with the sequencing batch settlement process which is widely used in oilfields for oil water separation deng et al 2005 without altering or increasing the constructions of the oil water separation process bio augmentation with dnra driven sob possessing bio demulsifying ability combined with pulsed injection of nitrate can not only improve the efficiency of oil water separation but also enhance the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control 4 conclusions nitrate amendment combined with bio augmentation with dnra driven sob after souring could effectively control souring and enhance the durability of nitrate mediated souring control continuous injection of a high concentration of nitrate may be less beneficial for souring control since denitrifying bacteria will be enriched especially after the depletion of sulfide and heterotrophic denitrifying activity will in turn decrease the long term potency of nitrate mediated souring control autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrate nitrite reduction endowed srb with unique niche adaptation mechanisms in nitrate amended environments dynamically regulating rather than obliterating the activity of sulfate reduction seemed to be more beneficial and realistic pulsed injection of nitrate combined with bio augmentation with dnra driven sob was proposed to be a potential method to regulate the interactions between srb and nrb and increase the durability of nitrate mediated souring control these findings were innovatively applied to simultaneous bio demulsification and souring control of produced water from the petroleum industry which has good adaptability to the current process and is expected to achieve a balance between cost and benefit declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural
