experimental data keywords water entry hollow cylinder cavity evolution jet flow deep closure 1 introduction water entry is one of complicated events including cavity evolution multiphase flow and impact etc which exists extensively not only in natural fields such as the basilisk lizard walking on water glasheen and mcmahon 1996 stones skipping clanet et al 2004 and diving sports but also in practical fields such as bouncing bomb and aerial torpedo truscott 2009 g pan and k yang 2014 even some special application involved in seaplane landing von karman 1929 aerospace structures recovery from the sea seddon and moatamedi 2006 and airdropping sonobuoy liu and wang 2011 etc therefore it attracts many researchers to study these problems the investigations on the water entry of solid objects begin at the end of the 19th century worthington 1882 captured those phenomena experimentally such as air entraining cavity and water splash during the vertical water entry of rigid spheres with the use of single spark photography later further study about the effects of extensive parameters including vertical entry velocity wang and guedes soares 2014 atmospheric pressure gilbarg and anderson 1948 may 1952 marston et al 2016 and surface characteristics aristoff and bush 2009 on the entraining cavity evolution and resistance coefficients were carried out progressively afterwards the entry structures and conditions of objects are expanded to enrich such phenomena the water entry of cylindrical projectiles with different nose shapes guo 2012 he 2012 disks bergmann et al 2009 spinning spheres truscott and techet 2009 are also studied truscott et al 2014 summarized the research results of many studies including both the entraining cavity of low speed bodies and the supercavitation of high speed projectiles the water entry of hollow cylinder has not been investigated directly however flow fields characteristics of objects with a hole or an intake duct have also been investigated such as the semi closed cylinder lu et al 2016 high speed crafts with artificial air cavity edward and wukowitz 1968 ou et al 2010 cucinotta et al 2017 the underwater vehicle with ventilation jiang et al 2018 etc compared to solid objects the water entry and motion of hollow structures in water can lead to more complicated flow fields which need better understanding tseitlin 1959 first proposed that the solution of the plane problem of a flow past two flat plates can be extended to flow past the disc with a hole deinekin 1994 numerically solved the problem of axisymmetric flow past a ducting cavitator savchenko 2012 studied experimentally the resistance characteristics of a disc cavitation with different apertures using a water tunnel and obtained the relationship between the drag coefficient and the added mass on the other hand gokcay et al 2004 confirmed the concept of artificial air cavity for high speed craft based on the tank testing method an experimental study of air ventilated cavities using a simplified hull model has been carried out by matveev et al 2009 some investigations have been conducted on the field of water entry lyu et al 2015 experimentally investigated the displacements and trajectories of both the solid and hollow cylinders after their horizontally falling into a water flow they found that the trajectories of the hollow cylinder collapse easily at the initial stage of submerging in water this present work is carried out based on the application background of using hollow projectiles to hit underwater objects as we know that the hollow projectiles have strong penetration ability and low flow resistance in the air huang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 however there are no investigations directly published on the flow evolution of the water entry of a hollow projectile its fundamental pattern of the cavity evolution and ballistic trajectories need to be revealed clearly which is also important for understanding the slamming of high speed crafts with holes therefore in this paper the vertical water entry of a hollow cylinder with a low entry speed is firstly studied to reveal the fundamental flow characteristics which is important for future study on such phenomenon with different entry conditions this paper is organized as follows section 1 is the introduction the experimental setup is provided briefly in

experimental setup the experimental system is illustrated in fig 1 which is mainly composed of a water tank a high speed camera a lifting bracket a launch platform a lighting system and a computer the water tank 1 0 m 0 7 m 1 0 m is made of smooth glass with high transparency the launch platform with an electromagnet to attract the hollow projectile is fixed above the water tank when the electric current is cut off the hollow projectile falls with an equal initial speed and its entry speed v 0 can be adjusted by modifying the height of the platform the cavity evolution is captured by a high speed phantom camera and the software is used to handle the images and some data processing the frame rate is chosen as 2000fps with the image resolution of 1280 800 pixels and the exposure time is 20 μs due to the high frame rate and the short exposure time two 2600 w spotlights are placed behind and beside the tank to ensure the clarity of captured images as shown in fig 2 the hollow cylinder of the present experiment is made of steel astm1045 with a density ratio of ρ s ρ w 7 85 where ρ s is the density of the hollow cylinder and ρ w is the density of water its geometric parameters are shown in table 1 the tap water with a temperature of 15 c is used in the experiment and the water depth is 0 8 m to calibrate the real size in the images an accurate coordinate paper is posted on the tank background as the reference frame to measure the position coordinates of the hollow cylinder the edge detection algorithm based on the sobel operator in matlab is used to obtain the hollow cylinder location in fig 1 a where the origin of ordinate x and the trigger time are taken to be the water entry location and the water entry impacting time respectively the displacement of the hollow cylinder can be translated by the pixel coordinate of images based on the calibration the velocity of the cylinder could be represented by the average velocity of two sequential images obtained by the high speed camera similarly the acceleration which is defined as a v t v 0 t can be calculated in this work the hollow cylinder entered the water with the entry velocity of v 0 2 84 m s and the froude number is f r v 0 g d c 7 14 where d c d c d 2 d 2 16 1 mm is the characteristic length based on both the inner and outer diameter the hollow cylinder is released at the same height for six times and the averaged data are used for discussion which ensures the phenomenon reproducibility and the measuring accuracy the maximum measurement error is estimated to be less than 5 3 numerical method 3 1 computational equations and turbulence model the vof model in the form of reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are employed for describing the vertical water entry cavities the continuity equation of the mixture flow is 1 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 where ρ m 1 α water ρ a α water ρ w represents the mixture density ρ a and ρ w refer to the air and water density respectively the momentum equations are 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j ρ m g i p x i x j μ m μ t u i x j u j x i where g i represents the gravity acceleration in x i coordinate p is the mixture pressure μ m μ m 1 α water μ air α water μ water denotes the mixture dynamic viscosity coefficient and μ t refers to the turbulent viscosity the two equation k ε turbulence model is used to close the viscous equation and the turbulent kinetic transport equation k is given as 3 ρ m k t ρ m k u i x i x i μ μ t σ k k x i g k g b ρ m ε y m s k the transport equation of the dissipation rate of energy of the turbulent flow ε is written as 4 ρ m ε t ρ m ε u i x i x i μ μ t σ ε ε x i ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε k c 3 ε g b s ε where c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 η s k ε s 2 s i j s i j in these k ε equations g k μ t s 2 and g b β g i μ t p

the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation incompressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate c 2 and c 1ε are constants σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers of k and ε respectively in this work c 2 1 9 c 1ε 1 44 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 are the default values meanwhile no extra source terms of s k and s ε are defined the above time dependent governing equations are discretized by the finite volume method and the simple scheme is used to solve the pressure velocity coupling algorithms the second order upwind scheme is applied for discretizing the convection terms and the central differenced for the diffusion term of the momentum equations the presto scheme is adopted for the pressure interpolation the geo reconstruct scheme is employed for solving the transport equation for the volume fractions 3 2 computational domain and grid generation in this work an axisymmetric two dimension plane is chosen as the computational domain for the simulation the entire domain size is 15d 45d and is shown in fig 3 the stationary wall is chosen for both side and bottom boundary the top boundary is set as pressure inlet the operating pressure p 0 is taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure 101325pa the hollow cylinder falls at the height of 1 25d with the initial velocity of 2 707 m s to obtain the vertical water entry speed of 2 84 m s the origin of x coordinate and starting time are taken to be the center of entry location and the impact moment the water depth is 30d the structured mesh is created for the whole domain as shown in fig 4 a the area around the hollow cylinder and the interface of two phase flow are refined to improve the numerical accuracy and is shown in fig 4 b the dynamic layer method is used to update the mesh when the grid size h i is compressed or stretched to a certain value the mesh splits or collapses following the layering rules of eqs 5 and 6 which is defined as 5 h i 1 α s h ideal 6 h i α c h ideal where h ideal is the ideal cell height α s is the layer split factor and α c is the layer collapse factor in this work α s 0 1 α c 0 04 a mesh dependency study has been conducted and four different grid levels with correspondingly coarse 0 5 million medium 0 7 million fine 0 9 million and finer 1 2 million grid are examined their predicted depths x versus time are shown in fig 5 a computer workstation with 16 processors is used to perform the whole simulations the time step is set up as 5 10 6s to ensure the convergence of the simulations and it takes about 168 hours in addition iterations are also required to make the solution converge at each time step as shown in fig 5 the differences of entry depths mainly come from later times considering both the accuracy and the computational resource cost in the present simulation the grid number of 0 9 million is applied in the present work and its non dimensional distance y satisfies y 25 as shown in fig 6 4 results and discussions 4 1 numerical validations to validate the numerical method the numerical results are compared directly with corresponding experimental results the high speed images of the water entry process of a hollow cylinder with vertical entry velocity v 0 2 84 m s are shown in fig 7 a corresponding numerical results are shown in fig 7 b due to the opacity of hollow cylinder the flow within the hollow cannot be observed it is clear that both experimental and numerical flow results agree well with each other and some special phenomena of hollow cylinder including the generation of jet its top bubble evolution and the annular wake cavity can also be seen clearly and will be discussed later following the discussions of may 1952 and truscott et al 2014 the water entry cavity evolution of a hollow cylinder can also be divided into four distinct stages the impact stage the open cavity stage with jets growth the pinch off stage and the sailing stage with cavity attached the initial splash caused by the impact is almost symmetrical and the through hole jet induced by the hollow forms fig 7 b t 5 15 ms the cavity closure occurs at about t 65 ms and the values of the pinch off depth for experiment and simulation are 2 66d fig 7 a and 2 52d fig 7 b respectively their maximum diameters of the attached cavity are 1 21d fig 7 a and 1 27d fig 7 b respectively moreover comparisons of the experimental measurements and the numerical parameters of the depth x the velocity v and acceleration a are shown in fig 8 which show that the numerical results have the same trend and almost the same values of corresponding experimental results for the depth and velocity shown in fig 8 a b the experimental values are a little larger than that of the numerical results these may be caused by the pixel resolution of the photos of the experiments however the maximum errors of them are only 5 38 and 8 68 which is acceptable in addition fig 8 c also shows the same varying trends of acceleration and the maximum error occurs at the impact time t 0 ms and the pinch off time t 65 ms due to the high data saltation which cannot be captured accurately in the experimental measurement therefore we can see that the numerical predictions of the entry water of the hollow cylinder are compatible with the corresponding experimental measurements 4 2 flow characteristics of the entry cavity evolution to illustrate the characteristics of flow fields of the entry cavity evolution distributions of flow velocity contours and streamlines are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 the left half of each image refers to the velocity contours while the right denotes the streamlines the impact the open cavity t 0 35 ms and the transitional period t 40 ms are exposed in fig 9 and fig 10 displays the pinch off and the sailing stage with cavity attached from 60 ms to 85 ms when the hollow cylinder impacts with the water interface it transfers kinetic energy and makes water move fig 9 a then the interface shape is modified and a cavity forms the flow in front of the cylinder head is divided into two regions the surrounding and the pierced regions t 5 ms fig 9 b and fig 7 the surrounding flow around the interface forms a transparent and smooth water curtain around the cylinder over the free surface which is like a splashed crown the subsurface flow keeps expanding to form an axisymmetric cone cavity that wraps the cylinder meanwhile due to the low pressure of cavity surrounding air is entrained into it and the velocity becomes high near the splash crown fig 9 c on the other hand the pierced flow moves upward along the inner wall of the hollow to form a through hole cone jet with a bubble attached at its top which is the special phenomenon for the water entry of a hollow cylinder t 25 ms fig 7 a b and fig 9 e f the open cavity stage includes the expansion extension and shrink of the entry cavity after the formation of a splashed crown and the through hole jet the entry cavity keeps expanding and satisfies the principle of independence of cavity expansion on the other hand the expansion lets the internal pressure of cavity low and entrains surrounding air when the expanding speed of cavity wall becomes zero t 35 ms fig 9 d it moves inwards and leads to the formation of a vortex outside the cavity wall fig 9 e f during the shrink process of the cavity a deep closure occurs at about t 65 ms fig 10 b fig 7 however the pinch off of the hollow cylinder cavity appears along the circumference of the through hole jet which is different with the traditional deep closure of a solid cylinder with cavity shrinking and collapsing to a point may 1952 he 2012 truscott et al 2014 meanwhile the cavity is separated into two parts one is connected to the atmosphere and jet and it keeps moving up to the interface the other is attached to the cylinder and moves downward fig 7 and fig 10 a c during the early pinch off the maximum speed of the air within these two cavities can be several times larger than the water entry speed after the cavity closure the extrusive through hole jet keeps moving up toward the surface with the cavity attached at its bottom and when the cavity is close to the free surface a secondary hollow jet generates at the bottom t 75 ms fig 10 d and its diameter is equal to that of the cylinder this is also different from the worthington jet mckown 2011 formed by the cavity closure of the typical solid bodies the secondary jet has the shape of a hollow thin cylinder and its moving speed increases gradually and then decreases under the action of gravity t 95 ms fig 7 b and fig 10 e in addition the downward cavity shrinks t 70 ms fig 10 c and the cylinder starts its free fall sailing in the sailing stage the downward cavity is attached to the cylinder its flow streamlines just like magnetic field lines fig 10 d that move steadily along with the attached cavity due to the water being pushed away at the head and move back around the tail of the cylinder at the same time the downward cavity breaks into two portions head and tail at t 65 ms fig 10 b e and fig 7 the head portion includes both external and internal bubbles while the tail one is attached to the cylinder bottom and is separated from the head bubble the wake cavity keeps shedding and a series of small bubbles are observed within the wake flow at t 85 ms fig 10 d and fig 7 b to further investigate the flow characteristics of the sailing stage the vorticity contours ω z v y x v x y 2 left half and the mixture volume fraction with embedded streamlines right half of the numerical results and comparison of the experimental photograph at t 95 ms are presented in fig 11 as we can see that both experimental and numerical cavity diameters have the same maximum value of 1 29d however their head cavity lengths are somewhat different 2 28d and 2 18d respectively and the same with that of their lengths of wake cavity they are 0 59d and 0 56d respectively but the discrepancies between them are only 4 39 and 5 08 which are totally acceptable from fig 11 the attached head cavity and its pattern along with the outer and inner wall of the cylinder can be observed clearly fig 11 b fig 11 c shows the zooming in of the internal cavity where some droplets are observed to stick along both sides of the cylinder based on the streamlines distribution we deduce that the droplets are induced by the immersion of the backflow fig 12 shows the head cavity evolution and bubbles generating process the head cavity is unstable fig 12 the internal cavity forms when the head cavity touches the inner wall at t 55 ms fig 12 b and it is a typical mixing layer under the action kelvin helmholtz instability its interface becomes instable and rolls into small eddies with air included and bubbbles separating from the wall in fact the external cavity is just like the internal one and their shedding bubbles will merge with wake cavity to form the wake flow after generated the bubble moves up toward the tail and its shape keeps changing during the moving process fig 12 c e due to the random disturbances the location of the first rolled bubble i is not fixed and it fluctuates with the evolution of the head cavity the variations of both internal and external locations can be found in fig 13 it is clear that the fluctuating frequency of internal cavity is almost three times larger than that of external one and its cavity size is smaller therefore it is more instable 4 3 evolution of the through hole jet to investigate the through hole jet characteristics the contours of air volume fraction at the early stage of water entry are shown in fig 14 it is clear that the jet is induced by the hollow and it includes a top bubble and the liquid column which is similar to the cavitation flow in the orifice ramamurthi and nandakumar 1999 as shown in fig 14 a and h when the cylinder impacts the water surface the high pressure region occurs at the impact area and transfers the kinetic energy from the hollow cylinder to the water at the same time an area with inward oblique high pressure gradient forms near the inner cylinder wall which makes the flow obtain high oblique upward velocity therefore a through hole jet with concave head forms inside the hollow fig 14 b with time goes on the head edge of the through hole jet will collide at the axis due to their high oblique velocity the air around the head center is encircled by the rolled edge and a bubble is generated fig 14 c at the same time the collision of head edge induces two new small jet flows with opposite direction one of them moves upward and turns into the head of the through hole jet and the other moves downward it passes through the bubble impacts and merges with the through hole jet the bubble along with the through hole jet keeps moving upward and at about t 15 ms fig 14 d the jet moves out of the water surface the bubble in the head of through hole jet can also be seen by corresponding experimental images fig 14 g and fig 7 a both the numerical and the experimental displacements x of the through hole jet are shown in fig 15 based on the numerical results the evolution of upward jet can be divided into three stages jet formation bubble formation and jet stretch the jet formation is caused by the impact of the cylinder with water and its upper speed is not very large then the bubble is formed due to the rolling up of head edge and lasts from 10 to 15 ms at this time its moving speed is the largest due to the generation of the small upward jet the free jet stretch stage lasts very long and its upward speed is almost constant at t 48 ms the experimental data are taken from t 18 ms since the through hole jet can only be visualized when the jet moves out of the hollow cylinder it is clear that the numerical displacement has the same rising trend as that of the experiment however the experimental results are a little smaller since the fact that there are some droplets keep separating from the jet tip in the experiments and have not been counted in 4 4 moving characteristics of the hollow cylinder the main parameters of the moving hollow cylinder during water entry are shown in fig 16 18 which mainly include the velocity v acceleration a and drag coefficient c d the velocity v and the acceleration a are obtained from the numerical results directly the drag coefficient is defined as 7 c d f 0 5ρ w v 2 a and the total resistance is defined as 8 f mg ma where a ld c 2 is the characteristic area of the hollow cylinder and l 1 is the unit length based on the 2d simulation the variation of the cylinder velocity can be observed in fig 16 and there are two saltation points with sharp modifications of the gradient at the entry and deep closure points the velocity modification can also be divided into three stages the free fall stage the open cavity stage and the free sailing stage corresponding stages can also be clearly seen in fig 17 the two saltation points both have high acceleration gradients but one is negative and the other is positive which means that the water entry impact produces a great drag on the cylinder and it is on the contrary for the deep closure of the cavity except that the acceleration remains almost constant during the free sailing stage except that there are some fluctuations caused by the shedding bubbles and vortices the variation of the drag coefficient during the water entry process can be seen in fig 18 except for the large water impact force t 0 ms and cavity closure thrust t 65 ms the cylinder drag is almost constant however the zoom in picture of force shows that there are some small fluctuations which can be explained by fig 19 the contours of air volume fraction and the second invariant q q 1 2 v x x 2 v y y 2 v y x v x y of the wake flow t 140 ms are both shown in the upper and down side of fig 19 respectively it is clear that there are vortices and small bubbles keep shedding away from the cylinder tail which make the local pressure of cylinder fluctuate and induce the variation of cylinder drag as shown in figs 17 18 there is a large thrust generated during the deep closure of the cavity the reason can be found in both in fig 20 and fig 21 which illustrates the distributions of the pressure contours of the flow fields left half and the pressure variation line along the cylinder axis during the pinch off process usually the high pressure location appears at the cylinder head fig 20 a g however when the pinch off occurs two opposite jets form the upper one is the cause of a secondary hollow jet as shown in fig 7 g while the lower one moves downward and acts at the cylinder bottom that makes the pressure in this area raise quickly fig 20 c and fig 21 t 65 ms which acts actually a large thrust on the cylinder and accelerates it abruptly 5 conclusions in this paper the vertical water entry of a low speed hollow cylinder is studied both of our numerical and experimental results agree well with each other the process of the whole water entry including the flow characteristics the evolution of the through hole jet and the moving features of the hollow cylinder etc are captured the main findings of this work are concluded as follows 1 the water entry of hollow cylinder can also be divided in to four stages just like the entry process of solid bodies the impact the open cavity the deep closure and the free sailing stage however for the hollow cylinder the through hole jet forms due to the hollow at the impact stage and the deep closure of the cavity occurs along the circumference of the through hole jet the secondary jet which is generated during the pinch off has the shape of a hollow thin cylinder moreover during the sailing stage the cylinder head cavity includes both external and internal portions and the internal cavity is more instable and its length fluctuates along the cylinder inner wall all of above phenomena distinguish the water entry process of a hollow cylinder from the usual entry process of solid bodies 2 the through hole jet induced by the hollow structure contains a bubble on its head which is attributed to the rolling up of its head edge the air is encircled during their collision process at the same time there are two small jets generated one moves upward and becomes the head of the through hole jet and the other moves downward and across the bubble it merges with the through hole jet 3 the moving characteristics of the hollow cylinder during the whol water entry process are determined by two stages the entry impact and deep closure however they have opposite effects on the cylinder moving the impact of water produces a large drag on the cylinder and makes it transfer large kinetic energy to water therefore its velocity decreases quickly during the deep closure there is a large thrust generated due to the formation of a downward jet which induces a big acceleration of the cylinder

discretized by the finite volume method and the simple scheme is used to solve the pressure velocity coupling algorithms the second order upwind scheme is applied for discretizing the convection terms and the central differenced for the diffusion term of the momentum equations the presto scheme is adopted for the pressure interpolation the geo reconstruct scheme is employed for solving the transport equation for the volume fractions 3 2 computational domain and grid generation in this work an axisymmetric two dimension plane is chosen as the computational domain for the simulation the entire domain size is 15d 45d and is shown in fig 3 the stationary wall is chosen for both side and bottom boundary the top boundary is set as pressure inlet the operating pressure p 0 is taken to be the standard atmospheric pressure 101325pa the hollow cylinder falls at the height of 1 25d with the initial velocity of 2 707 m s to obtain the vertical water entry speed of 2 84 m s the origin of x coordinate and starting time are taken to be the center of entry location and the impact moment the water depth is 30d the structured mesh is created for the whole domain as shown in fig 4 a the area around the hollow cylinder and the interface of two phase flow are refined to improve the numerical accuracy and is shown in fig 4 b the dynamic layer method is used to update the mesh when the grid size h i is compressed or stretched to a certain value the mesh splits or collapses following the layering rules of eqs 5 and 6 which is defined as 5 h i 1 α s h ideal 6 h i α c h ideal where h ideal is the ideal cell height α s is the layer split factor and α c is the layer collapse factor in this work α s 0 1 α c 0 04 a mesh dependency study has been conducted and four different grid levels with correspondingly coarse 0 5 million medium 0 7 million fine 0 9 million and finer 1 2 million grid are examined their predicted depths x versus time are shown in fig 5 a computer workstation with 16 processors is used to perform the whole simulations the time step is set up as 5 10 6s to ensure the convergence of the simulations and it takes about 168 hours in addition iterations are also required to make the solution converge at each time step as shown in fig 5 the differences of entry depths mainly come from later times considering both the accuracy and the computational resource cost in the present simulation the grid number of 0 9 million is applied in the present work and its non dimensional distance y satisfies y 25 as shown in fig 6 4 results and discussions 4 1 numerical validations to validate the numerical method the numerical results are compared directly with corresponding experimental results the high speed images of the water entry process of a hollow cylinder with vertical entry velocity v 0 2 84 m s are shown in fig 7 a corresponding numerical results are shown in fig 7 b due to the opacity of hollow cylinder the flow within the hollow cannot be observed it is clear that both experimental and numerical flow results agree well with each other and some special phenomena of hollow cylinder including the generation of jet its top bubble evolution and the annular wake cavity can also be seen clearly and will be discussed later following the discussions of may 1952 and truscott et al 2014 the water entry cavity evolution of a hollow cylinder can also be divided into four distinct stages the impact stage the open cavity stage with jets growth the pinch off stage and the sailing stage with cavity attached the initial splash caused by the impact is almost symmetrical and the through hole jet induced by the hollow forms fig 7 b t 5 15 ms the cavity closure occurs at about t 65 ms and the values of the pinch off depth for experiment and simulation are 2 66d fig 7 a and 2 52d fig 7 b respectively their maximum diameters of the attached cavity are 1 21d fig 7 a and 1 27d fig 7 b respectively moreover comparisons of the experimental measurements and the numerical parameters of the depth x the velocity v and acceleration a are shown in fig 8 which show that the numerical results have the same trend and almost the same values of corresponding experimental results for the depth and velocity shown in fig 8 a b the experimental values are a little larger than that of the numerical results these may be caused by the pixel resolution of the photos of the experiments however the maximum errors of them are only 5 38 and 8 68 which is acceptable in addition fig 8 c also shows the same varying trends of acceleration and the maximum error occurs at the impact time t 0 ms and the pinch off time t 65 ms due to the high data saltation which cannot be captured accurately in the experimental measurement therefore we can see that the numerical predictions of the entry water of the hollow cylinder are compatible with the corresponding experimental measurements 4 2 flow characteristics of the entry cavity evolution to illustrate the characteristics of flow fields of the entry cavity evolution distributions of flow velocity contours and streamlines are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 the left half of each image refers to the velocity contours while the right denotes the streamlines the impact the open cavity t 0 35 ms and the transitional period t 40 ms are exposed in fig 9 and fig 10 displays the pinch off and the sailing stage with cavity attached from 60 ms to 85 ms when the hollow cylinder impacts with the water interface it transfers kinetic energy and makes water move fig 9 a then the interface shape is modified and a cavity forms the flow in front of the cylinder head is divided into two regions the surrounding and the pierced regions t 5 ms fig 9 b and fig 7 the surrounding flow around the interface forms a transparent and smooth water curtain around the cylinder over the free surface which is like a splashed crown the subsurface flow keeps expanding to form an axisymmetric cone cavity that wraps the cylinder meanwhile due to the low pressure of cavity surrounding air is entrained into it and the velocity becomes high near the splash crown fig 9 c on the other hand the pierced flow moves upward along the inner wall of the hollow to form a through hole cone jet with a bubble attached at its top which is the special phenomenon for the water entry of a hollow cylinder t 25 ms fig 7 a b and fig 9 e f the open cavity stage includes the expansion extension and shrink of the entry cavity after the formation of a splashed crown and the through hole jet the entry cavity keeps expanding and satisfies the principle of independence of cavity expansion on the other hand the expansion lets the internal pressure of cavity low and entrains surrounding air when the expanding speed of cavity wall becomes zero t 35 ms fig 9 d it moves inwards and leads to the formation of a vortex outside the cavity wall fig 9 e f during the shrink process of the cavity a deep closure occurs at about t 65 ms fig 10 b fig 7 however the pinch off of the hollow cylinder cavity appears along the circumference of the through hole jet which is different with the traditional deep closure of a solid cylinder with cavity shrinking and collapsing to a point may 1952 he 2012 truscott et al 2014 meanwhile the cavity is separated into two parts one is connected to the atmosphere and jet and it keeps moving up to the interface the other is attached to the cylinder and moves downward fig 7 and fig 10 a c during the early pinch off the maximum speed of the air within these two cavities can be several times larger than the water entry speed after the cavity closure the extrusive through hole jet keeps moving up toward the surface with the cavity attached at its bottom and when the cavity is close to the free surface a secondary hollow jet generates at the bottom t 75 ms fig 10 d and its diameter is equal to that of the cylinder this is also different from the worthington jet mckown 2011 formed by the cavity closure of the typical solid bodies the secondary jet has the shape of a hollow thin cylinder and its moving speed increases gradually and then decreases under the action of gravity t 95 ms fig 7 b and fig 10 e in addition the downward cavity shrinks t 70 ms fig 10 c and the cylinder starts its free fall sailing in the sailing stage the downward cavity is attached to the cylinder its flow streamlines just like magnetic field lines fig 10 d that move steadily along with the attached cavity due to the water being pushed away at the head and move back around the tail of the cylinder at the same time the downward cavity breaks into two portions head and tail at t 65 ms fig 10 b e and fig 7 the head portion includes both external and internal bubbles while the tail one is attached to the cylinder bottom and is separated from the head bubble the wake cavity keeps shedding and a series of small bubbles are observed within the wake flow at t 85 ms fig 10 d and fig 7 b to further investigate the flow characteristics of the sailing stage the vorticity contours ω z v y x v x y 2 left half and the mixture volume fraction with embedded streamlines right half of the numerical results and comparison of the experimental photograph at t 95 ms are presented in fig 11 as we can see that both experimental and numerical cavity diameters have the same maximum value of 1 29d however their head cavity lengths are somewhat different 2 28d and 2 18d respectively and the same with that of their lengths of wake cavity they are 0 59d and 0 56d respectively but the discrepancies between them are only 4 39 and 5 08 which are totally acceptable from fig 11 the attached head cavity and its pattern along with the outer and inner wall of the cylinder can be observed clearly fig 11 b fig 11 c shows the zooming in of the internal cavity where some droplets are observed to stick along both sides of the cylinder based on the streamlines distribution we deduce that the droplets are induced by the immersion of the backflow fig 12 shows the head cavity evolution and bubbles generating process the head cavity is unstable fig 12 the internal cavity forms when the head cavity touches the inner wall at t 55 ms fig 12 b and it is a typical mixing layer under the action kelvin helmholtz instability its interface becomes instable and rolls into small eddies with air included and bubbbles separating from the wall in fact the external cavity is just like the internal one and their shedding bubbles will merge with wake cavity to form the wake flow after generated the bubble moves up toward the tail and its shape keeps changing during the moving process fig 12 c e due to the random disturbances the location of the first rolled bubble i is not fixed and it fluctuates with the evolution of the head cavity the variations of both internal and external locations can be found in fig 13 it is clear that the fluctuating frequency of internal cavity is almost three times larger than that of external one and its cavity size is smaller therefore it is more instable 4 3 evolution of the through hole jet to investigate the through hole jet characteristics the contours of air volume fraction at the early stage of water entry are shown in fig 14 it is clear that the jet is induced by the hollow and it includes a top bubble and the liquid column which is similar to the cavitation flow in the orifice ramamurthi and nandakumar 1999 as shown in fig 14 a and h when the cylinder impacts the water surface the high pressure region occurs at the impact area and transfers the kinetic energy from the hollow cylinder to the water at the same time an area with inward oblique high pressure gradient forms near the inner cylinder wall which makes the flow obtain high oblique upward velocity therefore a through hole jet with concave head forms inside the hollow fig 14 b with time goes on the head edge of the through hole jet will collide at the axis due to their high oblique velocity the air around the head center is encircled by the rolled edge and a bubble is generated fig 14 c at the same time the collision of head edge induces two new small jet flows with opposite direction one of them moves upward and turns into the head of the through hole jet and the other moves downward it passes through the bubble impacts and merges with the through hole jet the bubble along with the through hole jet keeps moving upward and at about t 15 ms fig 14 d the jet moves out of the water surface the bubble in the head of through hole jet can also be seen by corresponding experimental images fig 14 g and fig 7 a both the numerical and the experimental displacements x of the through hole jet are shown in fig 15 based on the numerical results the evolution of upward jet can be divided into three stages jet formation bubble formation and jet stretch the jet formation is caused by the impact of the cylinder with water and its upper speed is not very large then the bubble is formed due to the rolling up of head edge and lasts from 10 to 15 ms at this time its moving speed is the largest due to the generation of the small upward jet the free jet stretch stage lasts very long and its upward speed is almost constant at t 48 ms the experimental data are taken from t 18 ms since the through hole jet can only be visualized when the jet moves out of the hollow cylinder it is clear that the numerical displacement has the same rising trend as that of the experiment however the experimental results are a little smaller since the fact that there are some droplets keep separating from the jet tip in the experiments and have not been counted in 4 4 moving characteristics of the hollow cylinder the main parameters of the moving hollow cylinder during water entry are shown in fig 16 18 which mainly include the velocity v acceleration a and drag coefficient c d the velocity v and the acceleration a are obtained from the numerical results directly the drag coefficient is defined as 7 c d f 0 5ρ w v 2 a and the total resistance is defined as 8 f mg ma where a ld c 2 is the characteristic area of the hollow cylinder and l 1 is the unit length based on the 2d simulation the variation of the cylinder velocity can be observed in fig 16 and there are two saltation points with sharp modifications of the gradient at the entry and deep closure points the velocity modification can also be divided into three stages the free fall stage the open cavity stage and the free sailing stage corresponding stages can also be clearly seen in fig 17 the two saltation points both have high acceleration gradients but one is negative and the other is positive which means that the water entry impact produces a great drag on the cylinder and it is on the contrary for the deep closure of the cavity except that the acceleration remains almost constant during the free sailing stage except that there are some fluctuations caused by the shedding bubbles and vortices the variation of the drag coefficient during the water entry process can be seen in fig 18 except for the large water impact force t 0 ms and cavity closure thrust t 65 ms the cylinder drag is almost constant however the zoom in picture of force shows that there are some small fluctuations which can be explained by fig 19 the contours of air volume fraction and the second invariant q q 1 2 v x x 2 v y y 2 v y x v x y of the wake flow t 140 ms are both shown in the upper and down side of fig 19 respectively it is clear that there are vortices and small bubbles keep shedding away from the cylinder tail which make the local pressure of cylinder fluctuate and induce the variation of cylinder drag as shown in figs 17 18 there is a large thrust generated during the deep closure of the cavity the reason can be found in both in fig 20 and fig 21 which illustrates the distributions of the pressure contours of the flow fields left half and the pressure variation line along the cylinder axis during the pinch off process usually the high pressure location appears at the cylinder head fig 20 a g however when the pinch off occurs two opposite jets form the upper one is the cause of a secondary hollow jet as shown in fig 7 g while the lower one moves downward and acts at the cylinder bottom that makes the pressure in this area raise quickly fig 20 c and fig 21 t 65 ms which acts actually a large thrust on the cylinder and accelerates it abruptly 5 conclusions in this paper the vertical water entry of a low speed hollow cylinder is studied both of our numerical and experimental results agree well with each other the process of the whole water entry including the flow characteristics the evolution of the through hole jet and the moving features of the hollow cylinder etc are captured the main findings of this work are concluded as follows 1 the water entry of hollow cylinder can also be divided in to four stages just like the entry process of solid bodies the impact the open cavity the deep closure and the free sailing stage however for the hollow cylinder the through hole jet forms due to the hollow at the impact stage and the deep closure of the cavity occurs along the circumference of the through hole jet the secondary jet which is generated during the pinch off has the shape of a hollow thin cylinder moreover during the sailing stage the cylinder head cavity includes both external and internal portions and the internal cavity is more instable and its length fluctuates along the cylinder inner wall all of above phenomena distinguish the water entry process of a hollow cylinder from the usual entry process of solid bodies 2 the through hole jet induced by the hollow structure contains a bubble on its head which is attributed to the rolling up of its head edge the air is encircled during their collision process at the same time there are two small jets generated one moves upward and becomes the head of the through hole jet and the other moves downward and across the bubble it merges with the through hole jet 3 the moving characteristics of the hollow cylinder during the whol water entry process are determined by two stages the entry impact and deep closure however they have opposite effects on the cylinder moving the impact of water produces a large drag on the cylinder and makes it transfer large kinetic energy to water therefore its velocity decreases quickly during the deep closure there is a large thrust generated due to the formation of a downward jet which induces a big acceleration of the cylinder

22446,the conventional approaches for determination of pullout capacity factors of anchor foundation are restricted for only cohesionless or cohesive soils these approaches are incompetent for the estimation of the anchor capacity in soils that have both cohesion and frictional resistance a common scenario of native soils in this study a rigorous nonlinear finite element fe analysis is carried out to evaluate the pullout capacity factors nc nq and nγ of strip anchor based on the contribution of cohesion c surcharge q and self weight γ of soil before conducting detail parametric studies the numerical outcomes of current finite element studies are validated with the existing experimental and numerical results numerical results reveal that nc changes from nonlinear to linear fashion with the increase of friction angle for altering anchor orientation from horizontal to vertical while a reversible nature is found for nq and nγ the results of these analyses are provided as design equations for the convenience of design engineers as a function of anchor embedment depth h b friction angle φ and the inclination angle β finally a roughness modification factor nc nq and nγ for the vertical anchor is proposed keywords plate anchor finite element method pullout resistance cohesive frictional soil 1 introduction plate anchors are light structural members employed to withstand uplift forces for conditions where immediate breakaway occurs they are commonly used in transmission tower sheet piles retaining walls deepwater offshore developments and airport hangars over the last 50 years numerous experimental and numerical investigations were carried out by several researchers to evaluate the pullout capacity of plate anchor experimental studies include i conventional 1 g laboratory model tests das 1978 neely et al 1973 rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 yu et al 2015 and ii centrifuge model tests dickin 1988 dickin and laman 2007 while numerical studies include i lower bound limit analysis merifield et al 2003 meyerhof 1973 ii upper bound limit analysis jesmani et al 2012a sahoo and kumar 2012a merifield and sloan 2006 murray and geddes 1987 and iii finite element method rowe and davis 1982a song et al 2008 the pullout capacity of the anchor is mainly influenced by anchor geometry embedded ratio soil anchor interfaces and local soil conditions several researchers investigated the effect of anchor geometry on the pullout capacity of plate anchor and recommended shape factors for design hanna et al 2011 meyerhof 1973 sutherland et al 1983 kumar and kouzer 2008 studied the effect of embedment ratio and friction angle on the pullout capacity of plate anchor in sand and found that the uplift capacity increases with an increase in the embedment ratio and the frictional angle das and seeley 1975 investigated the effect of anchor inclination and embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of plate anchor in sand subjected to horizontal pull hanna et al 2014 conducted both experimental and analytical investigation on the pullout capacity factor n q and n γ of shallow strip inclined plate anchor in sand and recommended a design methodology for the practicing engineers bhattacharya and kumar 2014 and murray and geddes 1987 also performed limit analysis to predict the pullout resistance of an inclined plate anchor in sand merifield et al 2005 investigated the pullout capacity of inclined plate anchor placed in a purely cohesive soil and observed that pullout capacity gradually increases when the orientation of the plate changed from horizontal to vertical for a particular embedment ratio and frictional angle moreover the literature reveals that most studies are conducted to evaluate the pullout capacity factor in either for dry sand c 0 or for saturated clay φ 0 according to the authors knowledge limited information is available that estimate the pullout capacity of plate anchor in c φ soil for example kumar and naskar 2012 studied on the vertical uplift capacity of a group of two axial anchors in a c φ soil using the lower bound finite element limit analysis and showed the variation of the uplift capacity factors f c and f γ with the change in embedment ratio and vertical spacing in this study an extensive elastoplastic finite element analysis is carried out to investigate the pullout behavior of plate anchor in the cohesive frictional soil c φ soil for a wide range of geometric and material combinations for this purpose the anchor with different orientations are buried at various embedment depth d and displacement based analysis is carried out to determine the ultimate pullout load additionally the effect of inclination and frictional angle of soil on the pullout capacity factors nc nq and nγ are determined separately by applying the method of superposition and the limitation of this method is also investigated finally the numerical results are presented as a form of design equation in order to estimate the pullout capacity factors directly and a roughness correction factor fδ is introduced for both horizontal and vertical anchor 2 problem definition a typical layout of a strip anchor of width b and thickness t is placed beneath a horizontal ground with a uniform surcharge of q 18 kn m2 at the top surface as shown in fig 1 to investigate the pullout capacity the anchor is placed in a wide range of embedment ratio h b 1 to 10 and inclination angles β 0 90 the ultimate pullout capacity q u of the anchor is computed for the immediate breakaway vented condition i e anchor interface separates immediately upon developing tension between the anchor and surrounding soil for analysis purpose the friction angles are varied from 0 to 40 and the pullout capacity factors n c n q and n γ are calculated as follows by applying the principle of superposition 1 q u c n c q n q γ h n γ the pullout capacity factor n c n q and n γ are computed by considering i c 0 but q 0 and γ 0 ii c 0 but q 0 and γ 0 and iii c 0 but q 0 and γ 0 which signifies the corroboration of the superposition principle the assumption is not absolutely precise due to the nonlinearity of governing problem with the yield criterion however erickson and drescher 2002 zhu and michalowski 2005 and sahoo and kumar 2012b showed that the assumption can be used for solving different stability problems in foundation and anchor because the load obtained from the superposition method is smaller than the true failure load the anchor pullout capacity factors nc nq and nγ in dimensionless form can be calculated as follow 2 n c q u c 3 n q q u q 4 n γ q u γ h 3 finite element model an extensive elastoplastic finite element fe analysis is carried out using abaqus to determine the ultimate pullout load of the strip anchor in c φ soil this program is useful for analyzing material nonlinearity failure phenomena and stability problems the present numerical analysis is conducted on isotropic and homogeneous soil with associative mohr coulomb yield criterion which is defined by the cohesion value c angle of internal friction φ and dilatancy angle ψ the unit weight γ poisson s ratio υ and young s modulus e of soil are taken as 18 kn m3 0 3 and 15 mpa respectively during the analysis the anchor is modeled as a rigid body with young s modulus of 107 times that of soil and poisson s ratio of 0 15 andersenh et al 2003 the anchor is made contact with the soil domain which displaced progressively along the pullout direction the interface between the anchor plate and soil domain are defined by tangential behavior and normal behavior in tangential behavior a penalty friction formulation is used with a friction coefficient of 0 4 while in normal behavior hard contact is defined for pressure overclosure jesmani et al 2012b roy et al 2006 and separation after contact is also allowed in tangential contact the shear stress between the soil and anchor is defined by specifying maximum shear stress τmax is equivalent to ατ where τ is shear stress and α is the coefficient of friction generally tangential contact was modeled as fully smooth to fully rough by defining the friction coefficient 0 to 1 elkhatib and randolph 2005 the soil nodes start sliding along the anchor plate when the shear stress between the soil and anchor exceeds τmax present research primary focuses on the behavior of an anchor in between of completely rough or smooth interface conditions for this reason the interface friction is assumed to be 0 4 throughout the analysis and horizontal displacements at the contact nodes of soil anchor is released a typical 2 d mesh of horizontal anchor of width b 1 m and embedment depth of 3 m i e h b 3 is shown in fig 2 dimensions of soil domain are selected by several trials so that the stress and displacement gradients at boundaries would decrease and become zero consequently the soil domain is extended horizontally 30b for h b 6 and 20b for h b 6 and vertically 10b for all embedment ratio h b zero displacement boundary conditions are applied to prevent out of plane displacements of the vertical boundaries and the base of the mesh is fixed in all three coordinate directions six nodded modified triangular elements are used during the analysis and detailed mesh convergence studies are performed in order to achieve the most accurate results in fem analysis mesh size density plays a significant role in the accuracy of results the optimum mesh size is selected in such a way that yield accurate fem results while saving as much computing time as possible the uplift capacity factors n c for different finite element mesh at an embedment ratio of 3 are summarized in table 1 it is noticed that n c value decreases gradually with the decrease of mesh size up to 0 05b and thereafter it is found nearly constant for the further decreases of the mesh size however the number of elements increased significantly which drastically increased the computation time for example the value of n c decreased by about 8 6 for a decrease of mesh size 0 2 to 0 05 m i e 0 2b 0 05b which attributed an increase of element number of 2177 6225 in addition for the further decreased in element size 0 05b 0 02b the n c value decreased below 1 where the number of the element increases to 18872 therefore mesh 3 with a minimum element size of b 20 i e 0 05b is treated adequately fine in term of accuracy and is adapted for all subsequent analyses chen et al 2013 the pullout capacity is also influenced by the anchor thickness t b and increases above the exact solution of 11 42 for an infinitely thin plate rowe 1978 elkhatib and randolph 2005 found that the limiting value of uplift capacity factor of weightless soil n c was 11 62 and 11 93 for rough strip anchors with t b 0 05 and 0 14 respectively bransby and o neill 1999 also showed that the relative increase of n c with the increase of anchor thickness hence the anchor thickness is chosen as t 1 20b throughout the analysis and a uniform displacement is applied to all nodal points of the anchor a displacement based analys is carried out and the uplift pressure is then calculated by summing the nodal forces along the pullout direction divided by the anchor width 4 validation of model before conducting a detailed parametric study the numerical results for both horizontal and vertical anchor is validated against published results as shown in fig 3 the current fe outcomes fig 3 a and b are compared with existing laboratory test data das 1980 and rowe and davis 1982a analytical solutions merifield et al 2001 and fe results rowe and davis 1982a yu et al 2011 although the experimental and fe results of rowe and davis are close for embedment ratio h b 3 the fe result underestimates the true pullout capacity and almost constant at large embedment ratio h b 3 this is due to soil stiffness and truncation criterion where the pullout capacity was taken at a displacement as 15 20 of anchor width rather than the ultimate pullout for large embedment ratio again the experimental studies of das 1980 compare well with the current fe studies especially for lower embedment ratios but deviates at higher embedment ratios it is for the dependencies of pullout capacity on soil stiffness for large h b ratios since large displacements are required for ultimate collapse this trend is also noticed in rowe and davis experimental investigation from fig 3 a and b it can be seen that the n c for both horizontal and vertical anchor matches reasonably with the numerical solution obtained by yu et al 2011 and merifield et al 2001 the overall fashion of present studies is similar to the analytical solution of merifield et al 2001 and found in between the bound solutions based on rigid plasticity infinite stiffness ratio the cohesion pullout factor is closer to the upper bound solution up to an embodiment ratio of 3 then deviates and maximum differences are found 6 6 for horizontal anchor and 6 3 for the vertical anchor note that for deeply embedded anchor the current fe results are a little lower than the upper bound solutions the lower bound solution of smith 1998 and upper bound solution of merifield and sloan 2006 in fig 4 a are shown for the analogy with the current finite element studies for embedment ratios 2 4 and 6 for the horizontal anchor as expected present numerical results plot above the lower bound solution of smith and estimate slightly higher capacity than the upper bound solution of merifield and sloan 2006 however the maximum variation lies within 6 at a shallow depth and at higher depth it is hard to figure out fig 4a also exhibits the limit equilibrium solution of murray and geddes 1987 for h b 2 4 and 6 murray and geddes s solution overestimate the actual pullout capacity because of the assumption regarding the shape of the failure surface and the average orientation of the frictional resistance upper bound solution of merifield and sloan 2006 for the perfectly rough and smooth anchor is shown for resemblance with the present finite element studies in fig 4b as expected the soil weight pullout factor nγ lies in between the upper bound solution of two extreme conditions perfectly smooth and perfectly rough earlier studies rowe and davis 1982b merifield and sloan 2006 revealed that the effect of roughness on pullout capacity of the horizontal anchor is negligible but significant when the anchor is vertical since the current study is conducted by assuming the interface friction coefficient as 0 4 for this reason the numerical solution differs significantly from a perfectly rough interface condition for φ 40 and reasonably agreed at a low friction angle 5 numerical results generally the superposition method simplifies the calculation and induces error on the safe side to the ultimate pullout capacity in this study the uplift capacity factor nc nq nγ as a result of cohesion surcharge and soil weight are calculated separately for together horizontal and vertical anchor by using the method of superposition and total capacities c 0 q 0 and γ 0 are also determined directly from abaqus as shown in table 2 as anticipated the results obtained from eq 1 always estimate lower pullout capacity than directly from the abaqus the error is found to be increased with the friction angle and embedment ratios for friction angle of 40 the direct solution estimates approximately 13 higher pullout capacity than the superposition method however minimum errors are found 1 6 for friction angle 10 these are consistent with the previous study for example the results critical slip field method of zhu et al 2003 with the existing conventional superposition method showed an error of less than 10 on the conservative side bolton and lau 1993 also mentioned superposition assumptions induced an error of not more than 20 and always on the safe side davis and booker 1971 also confirmed that the superposition method indicates an error on the safe side at a margin of no more than 30 for the limiting case on no body force and no surcharge the errors are due to the nonlinear behavior of soil in the plastic range and failure mechanism of weightless soil is not applicable for weight soil therefore it is seen that the error for superposition method is always on the safe side but it could be unsafe when the back analyzed shear strength is used for calculating design load of a foundation on same soil but for different loading conditions sun et al 2013 5 1 cohesion pullout factor in this section the validated models are used to estimate the ultimate pullout of strip anchor where γ 0 q 0 and c 0 for friction angles ranging from 0 to 40 at an interval of 5 in this case three different values of cohesion are examined such as 10 30 and 50 kpa the ultimate pullout capacity for all value of cohesion is computed for a horizontal anchor at h b 3 and φ 0 in all cases nc is found 4 77 which suggest that the pullout capacity in dimensionless form is independent of cohesion the variation of a cohesion pullout factor n c as a function of friction angle φ embedment ratio h b and anchor rotation angle β is presented in fig 5 a e from fig 5a and b it is visible that at h b 4 n c increases gradually with friction angle up to 20 and after that friction angle does not show any significant effect on the other hand a similar tendency is attended at h b 6 and 8 after φ 30 this type of variation is also noticed by rowe and davis 1982b and sahoo and kumar 2013 however for anchor with higher rotation angle fig 5d and e n c increase gradually with the increase of φ and h b and found maximum when the anchor is fully vertical β 90 from the fig 5 a e it is also visible that the cohesion pullout factor varies nonlinearly with the friction angle when β 0 and alters from nonlinear to linear fashion when β 90 for correspondence the pullout capacity factor attained in current finite element studies is set side by side in fig 5f with the result of rowe and davis 1982b by the displacement based elastoplastic finite element method and merifield 2002 by the lower bound finite element limit analysis as expected the pullout capacity is found higher than the merifield solution for all h b ratios however the solution of rowe and davis underestimate the actual capacity because the limit load was not based on the ultimate shear failure the pullout capacity factor due to cohesion is calculated for a wide range of embedment ratios i e 1 to 10 anchor inclination angle ranging from 0 to 90 and the internal friction angles ranging from 0 to 40 the results presented in fig 5 a e can be best approximated as following 5 y a f q 1 φ β h b f q 2 φ β the mathematical form can be used to fit results where the function f q1 and f q2 must be found such that the fit is optimal the following expression best fits with the current finite element results 6 n c 1 13 φ β 3 φ 2 6 8 1 22 φ β 0 5 β 3 62 1 80 0 6 h b 0 61 1 44 1 67 φ 0 31 β 2 where φ the friction angle in radians β inclination angle of anchor in radians and h b embedment ratios 5 2 surcharge bpullout factor the variation of pullout factor n q due to the contribution of surcharge pressure as a function of friction angle embedment and the rotation angle is shown in fig 6 a e it is found that for a given h b the pullout factors increase almost linearly with friction angle for the horizontal anchor β 0 as shown in fig 6a these linear behaviors are apparent for a horizontal anchor in all embedment ratios but the trend changes from linear to nonlinear with the increase of anchor rotation and found nonlinear at β 90 for an analogy the surcharge pullout factor obtained in contemporary finite element analysis is compared with the upper bound solution of murray and geddes 1987 and sahoo and kumar 2012b respectively as shown in fig 6f it is noticed that the pullout factor n q is found lower compared to the results of murray and geddes 1987 and sahoo and kumar 2012b the current analyses are carried out for surcharge q 18 kn m2 rotation angle ranging from 0 to 90 and friction angle ranging from 10 to 40 the following equation can be best fitted for the numerical results shown in fig 6 a e 7 n q φ β 3 7 φ 0 3 0 6 φ β 0 4 β 1 9 h b 1 01 0 1 φ 0 2 β 1 3 5 3 soil weight pullout factor in order to figure out the effect of the weight of the soil on pullout capacity it is necessary to set c 0 q 0 and γ 0 but for purely frictional material convergence problems are raised consequently a small amount of cohesion i e c γb 0 25 10 3 for φ up to 25 and 0 5 for φ 25 is assumed in order to avoid divergence of numerical solutions zhu and michalowski 2005 the influence of cohesion is then removed by subtracting cn c having estimated n c in the first series of calculation islam et al 2017 therefore the modified pullout capacity factor nγ are calculated from 8 n γ q u c n c γ h the variation of soil weight pullout factor n γ with friction angle for different embedment ratios and base rotation is shown in fig 7 for horizontal anchor the anchor pullout factor n γ varies almost linearly with the friction angle these linear variations are found in all embedment ratios for rotation angle 0 and 22 5 and some embedment ratios for 45 but do not exist at a rotation angle of 67 5 and 90 hence it can be said that nγ changes from linear to nonlinear fashion with the increase of anchor orientation from horizontal to vertical and also analogous to the variation of nq another noteworthy feature is that for a given h b the n γ increased far more significantly for a vertical anchor in comparison to horizontal anchor which is also identical with the result found by merifield and sloan 2006 and bhattacharya and kumar 2014 this is due to the work done by the soil weight during the deformation process in horizontal anchor the soil above the anchor only contributes to the pullout capacity but in case of vertical anchor both the soil at top and front of the anchor contributes to the pullout capacity the extent of the failure surface reflects the amount of work against the soil weight this is why at larger φ the extent of failure mechanism for the horizontal anchor is lower than the vertical anchor again a severe stress concentration occurs at the bottom edge of vertical anchor for the shake of earth pressure therefore the contact between the anchor and soil becomes tighten which increase the pullout resistance for these reasons vertical anchor illustrates greater pullout capacity than the horizontal anchor the numerical results showed in fig 7 a e can be fitted as follow 9 n γ φ β 3 φ 0 32 0 69 φ β 0 9 β 2 8 h b 1 1 0 3 β 1 35 equations 6 7 and 9 are expressed as a function of three independent variables such as friction angle φ the inclination angle of anchor β and embedment ratio h b while soil dilatancy and anchor roughness are not considered in these equations despite of this uncertainties these equations are valid for determining the pullout capacity factors nc nq and n γ for φ 0 40 β 0 90 and h b 1 to 10 the influence of these three parameters φ β and h b are also assessed and their contributions on the pullout capacity factors are estimates using monte carlo simulation because monte carlo simulations is widely used over the last decades to evaluate the safety of foundations by assessing the certain level of reliability identified numerically by reliability index or probabilistic failure the percent contribution of these independent variables sivakumar babu et al 2006 ji et al 2019 2018 pereira and caldeira 2011 the probabilistic monte carlo analysis is carried out using the excel spreadsheet with 1 million simulations in order to produce a reliable result from these analyses it is found that in eq 6 h b φ and β contributes 76 16 and 8 respectively in eq 7 h b φ and β contributes 50 43 and 7 respectively and in eq 9 h b φ and β contributes 48 42 and 10 respectively therefore it can be reported that the pullout capacity of plate anchors are significantly influenced by the embedment ratio and soil frictional angle while the effect of anchor rotation is not very significant 5 4 comparison with experimental studies murray and geddes 1987 1989 performed chamber testing program on very dense sand φ 43 6 and medium dense sand φ 36 for square circular and rectangular anchor of width or diameter were 50 8 mm they determined the pullout capacity of horizontal anchor for aspect ratios l b of 1 2 5 and 10 their results indicate that an anchor with aspect ratios of l b 10 and l b 5 gives almost identical result the pullout capacity of horizontal strip anchor in current finite element studies for friction angle of 40 is compared with the experimental result of murry and geddes as shown in fig 8 a it is visible that the present fem result estimates lower value than these experimental results and small differences are found up to h b 5 and the difference increases with the increase of h b ratios dickin 1988 also conducted a number of centrifugal tests on medium and dense sand for rectangular anchor with aspect ratios l b 1 2 5 and 8 among the laboratory test results the pullout capacities of anchor in dense sand φ 43 6 are shown in fig 8a and the current numerical results compare well with the dickin centrifugal test in practical it is difficult to conduct an experiment at friction angle exactly 30 and 35 for this reason fe results of friction angle 30 and 35 are compared with experimental studies of das and seeley 1975 at friction angle of 31 rowe 1978 at friction angle of 33 respectively again the numerical results for friction angle 35 and 40 are compared with the recent experimental studies of liu et al 2013 for friction angle 34 and 43 the current fem results for φ 35 and 40 showed good agreement with the experimental results the pullout capacities of das and seeley are higher than the present numerical studies as well as rowe s studies this is may be due to the shape of the anchor and dilatation angle rowe s experimental studies predict lower pullout capacities at friction angle 33 as compared to current fem studies at friction angle 35 these capacities are matches partially with the pullout at fraction angle 30 of this study and higher differences are found at h b 2 these divergences may be attributed to the lower dilatation angle in rowe s study ψ 4 10 or may be due to truncation criterion another possible reason for these discrepancies between experimental and numerical result is that the extrapolation of results from small scale laboratory test to large scale field test always overestimates the actual capacities dickin 1988 considering the limitation of available experimental outcomes it is tough to conclude whether the scale effect alone is responsible for these discrepancies limited experimental studies were performed to estimate the pullout capacity of vertical anchor subjected to different rotation neely et al 1973 conducted a small scale test having l b ratios 1 2 and 5 for friction angle 38 5 at an embedment ratio 1 through 5 although the fe result estimates a higher capacity than neely s result the overall agreement is inspiring in neely s study an alternative criterion was used to determine the failure load because the load displacement curve appears that it is still increasing when the test is finished again akinmusuru 1978 reported results for aspect ratio 1 and 10 at φ 35 akinmusuru s results exhibit higher pullout load than the present numerical studies even from neely et al 1973 studies also hoshiya and mandal 1984 conducted the test of anchor in a sand chamber of 300 mm 400 mm in size at an embedment ratio ranging from 2 to 6 due to the insufficient size of this chamber the ultimate pullout load is affected by the boundary condition consequently their results exhibit higher pullout load there are a lot of discrepancies observed between the current fe study and experimental results these are due to the uncertainty of soil properties anchor roughness in the laboratory test and complex nature of vertical anchor 5 5 soil failure mechanism the failure mechanisms of horizontal vertical and inclined β 45 anchors attended for material properties i e γ 18 kn m2 and c 10 kpa are depicted by the resultant displacement vectors and line contours in fig 9 a c for φ 0 two types of failure could be occurred depending upon the embedment depth one is for the shallow anchor h b 4 and another is for the deep anchor h b 4 for horizontal anchor at relatively shallow embedment failure occurs together with the upward movement of the rigid column above the anchor and lateral deformation these deformation starts at the anchor edge and propagates to the surface the formation of the rigid column above the anchor is due to locking of the material above the anchor when it is pulled upward when the anchor is pulled the rigid column moves upward and pushes the surrounding soil laterally in an outward direction into the soil mass and results in the formation of a plastic shearing zone on both sides of the anchor for a relatively deep anchor this soil locking phenomenon is not observed and the material change from elastic state to a plastic state at ultimate failure the failure mainly occurred due to the formation of a localized zone of compression and lateral deformation above the anchor for this reason surface deformation decreases with the increase of embedment depth and increases with the friction angle at a particular embedment depth this lateral shearing phenomenon is consistent with merifield and sloan 2006 and liu et al 2013 for clay soil φ 0 at h b 4 plastic shearing or flow is occurred at all sides of anchor and failure occurred fully locally this is mainly due to the effect of the overburden ratio γh c when γh c 7 at h b 4 the soil remains in contact with the bottom of anchor plate despite choosing immediate breakaway condition this type of phenomenon is also observed for all base rotation of anchor it is also remembered that overburden ratio 7 is not a threshold value it could be different for different embedment ratios merifield et al 2001 yu et al 2011 chen et al 2013 fig 9c indicates the failure mechanism of a vertical anchor at different embedment ratios and friction angle the failure surface generates at the bottom of the anchor and propagates as a curve indicating that the ruptured soil mass has undergone a rotary motion failure can be characterized by the formation of a passive failure zone at top and front of the anchor by paralleling all the diagrams in fig 9c it is reasonable to conclude that for a given embedment depth the lateral extent of surface deformation at front and top of the anchor increases with the rise of friction angle 5 6 the effect of anchor roughness the result explained in the above sections is based on the assumption that the soil anchor interface conditions lie in between of perfectly rough or perfectly smooth for this reason the interface friction is assumed to be 0 4 through the analysis and horizontal displacements at the contact nodes of soil anchor are free to move for the sake of determining the influence of roughness on anchor pullout capacity the explicit case of perfectly rough interface condition is analyzed where the anchor soil contact nodes are restrained to move in horizontal directions to measure the effect of roughness a correction factor is calculated separately for nc nq and nγ which are as follow 10 roughness correction factor f δ n n where n the pullout capacity factors for perfectly rough condition and n the pullout capacity factor for the current interface condition the finite element result suggests that the significance of roughness on the pullout capacity of vertical anchor the roughness correction factor for φ 20 30 and 40 decrease nonlinearly with the increase of embedment ratios as shown in fig 10 a c the effect of roughness is found tremendous for nγ as a comparison to nc and nq changing interface from the current condition to perfectly rough can lead to increase the pullout capacity 68 64 and 89 for nc nq and nγ respectively for friction angle φ 40 from the fig 10 it is clear that fδ increases with the increase of friction angle and decrease with the embedment ratios and found minimum for h b 10 at φ 20 the rate of change in roughness is found maximum in between the embedment ratio 1 and 4 for all friction angles in conclusion roughness can affect the pullout capacity enormously when the anchor is embedded at shallow depth up to h b 4 and minimal when largely embedded h b 4 the pullout capacity factor nγ of a vertical perfectly rough anchor at h b 3 for friction angle φ 30 is about 37 higher than the present fe analysis this value is lower than the 50 and 39 increase given by the lower bound and upper bound solutions of merifield and sloan 2006 for the same case h b 3 and β 90 and also smaller than the 67 increase given by rowe and davis 1982b however merifield and sloan and rowe and davis did not give a comprehensive analysis of the effect of anchor roughness one possible explanation is the contribution of developing shear stress at the anchor soil interface on pullout capacity of vertical anchor this is because when the anchor pullout occurs a significant upward movement of soil in contact with the anchor follows at an angle to the soil anchor interface however for perfectly rough anchor the soil in contact is locked down and no slippage occurs at the contact domain for this reason significant shear stress is developed on the contact surface of soil anchor which contributes to increasing the pullout capacity finally the following equation can be best fitted for the numerical results of the vertical anchor as shown in fig 10 11 f δ c n c n c φ 0 5 b h 0 18 0 46 12 f δ q n q n q 1 43 φ 0 67 b h 0 19 φ 13 f δ γ n γ n γ 1 83 φ 0 6 b h 0 22 φ the contribution of roughness on the pullout capacity of the horizontal anchor is almost negligible for all embedment ratios and friction angle as shown in fig 10 fδ increases with the increase of friction angle and decrease with the embedment ratios and found a maximum of about 4 04 for h b 1 at φ 40 the pullout capacity of the horizontal anchor is not considerably affected by the anchor roughness due to the symmetry of the soil flow mechanism that prevents the development of significant shear stresses at the anchor clay interface 6 conclusion a rigorous finite element investigation is carried out to calculate the pullout capacity of strip anchor in c φ soil analyses are carried out to determine the effect of cohesion surcharge pressure and unit weight of soil on pullout factor of the anchor consideration is given to the effect of soil friction angle anchor inclination and anchor embedment ratio on anchor pullout capacity factors n c n q and n γ these factors are calculated individually and presented as a design equation so that the practitioner can use in resolving various practical design problems the following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this paper a the anchor inclination has a noticeable influence on pullout capacity factors n c n q and n γ these factors increase continuously with the increase of anchor inclination angle β with the horizontal and found maximum for vertical anchor and minimum for the horizontal anchor at a given embedment ratio the rate of increment of these factors is found more significant for a vertical anchor as compared to the horizontal anchor this complex nature of the vertical anchor behavior is may be due to the lack of symmetry of anchor b the cohesion pullout factor nc changes from nonlinear to linear fashion with the increase of friction angle for altering anchor orientation from horizontal to vertical while a reversible nature is found for nq and nγ c at a given embedment ratio anchor pullout capacity factors increase continuously with the friction angle and inclination angle but the pullout factor n c increases up to a certain value after which the effect of increment of soil friction angle is insignificant which is in contrast with the trend of n γ and n q d for horizontal anchor at relatively shallow embedment the soil locking phenomenon is observed for all friction angles on the other hand for a relatively deep anchor failure mainly occurred due to the formation of a localized zone of compression and lateral deformation above the anchor for vertical anchor the failure surface is found curve due to the rotary motion of the soil mass additionally the passive failure zone at the bottom and top of the anchor being deeper and wider due to the increase of friction angles for a given embedment ratio the lateral extent of surface deformation increases with the increase of friction angle for all orientations of the anchor e the effect of roughness on the pullout capacity is found significant for vertical anchor where an asymmetrical soil flow mechanism is formed and negligible for horizontal anchor where the symmetrical soil flow mechanism is formed at the same time the effect of anchor roughness increases with the increase of friction angle and decrease with the embedment ratios 
22446,the conventional approaches for determination of pullout capacity factors of anchor foundation are restricted for only cohesionless or cohesive soils these approaches are incompetent for the estimation of the anchor capacity in soils that have both cohesion and frictional resistance a common scenario of native soils in this study a rigorous nonlinear finite element fe analysis is carried out to evaluate the pullout capacity factors nc nq and nγ of strip anchor based on the contribution of cohesion c surcharge q and self weight γ of soil before conducting detail parametric studies the numerical outcomes of current finite element studies are validated with the existing experimental and numerical results numerical results reveal that nc changes from nonlinear to linear fashion with the increase of friction angle for altering anchor orientation from horizontal to vertical while a reversible nature is found for nq and nγ the results of these analyses are provided as design equations for the convenience of design engineers as a function of anchor embedment depth h b friction angle φ and the inclination angle β finally a roughness modification factor nc nq and nγ for the vertical anchor is proposed keywords plate anchor finite element method pullout resistance cohesive frictional soil 1 introduction plate anchors are light structural members employed to withstand uplift forces for conditions where immediate breakaway occurs they are commonly used in transmission tower sheet piles retaining walls deepwater offshore developments and airport hangars over the last 50 years numerous experimental and numerical investigations were carried out by several researchers to evaluate the pullout capacity of plate anchor experimental studies include i conventional 1 g laboratory model tests das 1978 neely et al 1973 rokonuzzaman and sakai 2012 yu et al 2015 and ii centrifuge model tests dickin 1988 dickin and laman 2007 while numerical studies include i lower bound limit analysis merifield et al 2003 meyerhof 1973 ii upper bound limit analysis jesmani et al 2012a sahoo and kumar 2012a merifield and sloan 2006 murray and geddes 1987 and iii finite element method rowe and davis 1982a song et al 2008 the pullout capacity of the anchor is mainly influenced by anchor geometry embedded ratio soil anchor interfaces and local soil conditions several researchers investigated the effect of anchor geometry on the pullout capacity of plate anchor and recommended shape factors for design hanna et al 2011 meyerhof 1973 sutherland et al 1983 kumar and kouzer 2008 studied the effect of embedment ratio and friction angle on the pullout capacity of plate anchor in sand and found that the uplift capacity increases with an increase in the embedment ratio and the frictional angle das and seeley 1975 investigated the effect of anchor inclination and embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of plate anchor in sand subjected to horizontal pull hanna et al 2014 conducted both experimental and analytical investigation on the pullout capacity factor n q and n γ of shallow strip inclined plate anchor in sand and recommended a design methodology for the practicing engineers bhattacharya and kumar 2014 and murray and geddes 1987 also performed limit analysis to predict the pullout resistance of an inclined plate anchor in sand merifield et al 2005 investigated the pullout capacity of inclined plate anchor placed in a purely cohesive soil and observed that pullout capacity gradually increases when the orientation of the plate changed from horizontal to vertical for a particular embedment ratio and frictional angle moreover the literature reveals that most studies are conducted to evaluate the pullout capacity factor in either for dry sand c 0 or for saturated clay φ 0 according to the authors knowledge limited information is available that estimate the pullout capacity of plate anchor in c φ soil for example kumar and naskar 2012 studied on the vertical uplift capacity of a group of two axial anchors in a c φ soil using the lower bound finite element limit analysis and showed the variation of the uplift capacity factors f c and f γ with the change in embedment ratio and vertical spacing in this study an extensive elastoplastic finite element analysis is carried out to investigate the pullout behavior of plate anchor in the cohesive frictional soil c φ soil for a wide range of geometric and material combinations for this purpose the anchor with different orientations are buried at various embedment depth d and displacement based analysis is carried out to determine the ultimate pullout load additionally the effect of inclination and frictional angle of soil on the pullout capacity factors nc nq and nγ are determined separately by applying the method of superposition and the limitation of this method is also investigated finally the numerical results are presented as a form of design equation in order to estimate the pullout capacity factors directly and a roughness correction factor fδ is introduced for both horizontal and vertical anchor 2 problem definition a typical layout of a strip anchor of width b and thickness t is placed beneath a horizontal ground with a uniform surcharge of q 18 kn m2 at the top surface as shown in fig 1 to investigate the pullout capacity the anchor is placed in a wide range of embedment ratio h b 1 to 10 and inclination angles β 0 90 the ultimate pullout capacity q u of the anchor is computed for the immediate breakaway vented condition i e anchor interface separates immediately upon developing tension between the anchor and surrounding soil for analysis purpose the friction angles are varied from 0 to 40 and the pullout capacity factors n c n q and n γ are calculated as follows by applying the principle of superposition 1 q u c n c q n q γ h n γ the pullout capacity factor n c n q and n γ are computed by considering i c 0 but q 0 and γ 0 ii c 0 but q 0 and γ 0 and iii c 0 but q 0 and γ 0 which signifies the corroboration of the superposition principle the assumption is not absolutely precise due to the nonlinearity of governing problem with the yield criterion however erickson and drescher 2002 zhu and michalowski 2005 and sahoo and kumar 2012b showed that the assumption can be used for solving different stability problems in foundation and anchor because the load obtained from the superposition method is smaller than the true failure load the anchor pullout capacity factors nc nq and nγ in dimensionless form can be calculated as follow 2 n c q u c 3 n q q u q 4 n γ q u γ h 3 finite element model an extensive elastoplastic finite element fe analysis is carried out using abaqus to determine the ultimate pullout load of the strip anchor in c φ soil this program is useful for analyzing material nonlinearity failure phenomena and stability problems the present numerical analysis is conducted on isotropic and homogeneous soil with associative mohr coulomb yield criterion which is defined by the cohesion value c angle of internal friction φ and dilatancy angle ψ the unit weight γ poisson s ratio υ and young s modulus e of soil are taken as 18 kn m3 0 3 and 15 mpa respectively during the analysis the anchor is modeled as a rigid body with young s modulus of 107 times that of soil and poisson s ratio of 0 15 andersenh et al 2003 the anchor is made contact with the soil domain which displaced progressively along the pullout direction the interface between the anchor plate and soil domain are defined by tangential behavior and normal behavior in tangential behavior a penalty friction formulation is used with a friction coefficient of 0 4 while in normal behavior hard contact is defined for pressure overclosure jesmani et al 2012b roy et al 2006 and separation after contact is also allowed in tangential contact the shear stress between the soil and anchor is defined by specifying maximum shear stress τmax is equivalent to ατ where τ is shear stress and α is the coefficient of friction generally tangential contact was modeled as fully smooth to fully rough by defining the friction coefficient 0 to 1 elkhatib and randolph 2005 the soil nodes start sliding along the anchor plate when the shear stress between the soil and anchor exceeds τmax present research primary focuses on the behavior of an anchor in between of completely rough or smooth interface conditions for this reason the interface friction is assumed to be 0 4 throughout the analysis and horizontal displacements at the contact nodes of soil anchor is released a typical 2 d mesh of horizontal anchor of width b 1 m and embedment depth of 3 m i e h b 3 is shown in fig 2 dimensions of soil domain are selected by several trials so that the stress and displacement gradients at boundaries would decrease and become zero consequently the soil domain is extended horizontally 30b for h b 6 and 20b for h b 6 and vertically 10b for all embedment ratio h b zero displacement boundary conditions are applied to prevent out of plane displacements of the vertical boundaries and the base of the mesh is fixed in all three coordinate directions six nodded modified triangular elements are used during the analysis and detailed mesh convergence studies are performed in order to achieve the most accurate results in fem analysis mesh size density plays a significant role in the accuracy of results the optimum mesh size is selected in such a way that yield accurate fem results while saving as much computing time as possible the uplift capacity factors n c for different finite element mesh at an embedment ratio of 3 are summarized in table 1 it is noticed that n c value decreases gradually with the decrease of mesh size up to 0 05b and thereafter it is found nearly constant for the further decreases of the mesh size however the number of elements increased significantly which drastically increased the computation time for example the value of n c decreased by about 8 6 for a decrease of mesh size 0 2 to 0 05 m i e 0 2b 0 05b which attributed an increase of element number of 2177 6225 in addition for the further decreased in element size 0 05b 0 02b the n c value decreased below 1 where the number of the element increases to 18872 therefore mesh 3 with a minimum element size of b 20 i e 0 05b is treated adequately fine in term of accuracy and is adapted for all subsequent analyses chen et al 2013 the pullout capacity is also influenced by the anchor thickness t b and increases above the exact solution of 11 42 for an infinitely thin plate rowe 1978 elkhatib and randolph 2005 found that the limiting value of uplift capacity factor of weightless soil n c was 11 62 and 11 93 for rough strip anchors with t b 0 05 and 0 14 respectively bransby and o neill 1999 also showed that the relative increase of n c with the increase of anchor thickness hence the anchor thickness is chosen as t 1 20b throughout the analysis and a uniform displacement is applied to all nodal points of the anchor a displacement based analys is carried out and the uplift pressure is then calculated by summing the nodal forces along the pullout direction divided by the anchor width 4 validation of model before conducting a detailed parametric study the numerical results for both horizontal and vertical anchor is validated against published results as shown in fig 3 the current fe outcomes fig 3 a and b are compared with existing laboratory test data das 1980 and rowe and davis 1982a analytical solutions merifield et al 2001 and fe results rowe and davis 1982a yu et al 2011 although the experimental and fe results of rowe and davis are close for embedment ratio h b 3 the fe result underestimates the true pullout capacity and almost constant at large embedment ratio h b 3 this is due to soil stiffness and truncation criterion where the pullout capacity was taken at a displacement as 15 20 of anchor width rather than the ultimate pullout for large embedment ratio again the experimental studies of das 1980 compare well with the current fe studies especially for lower embedment ratios but deviates at higher embedment ratios it is for the dependencies of pullout capacity on soil stiffness for large h b ratios since large displacements are required for ultimate collapse this trend is also noticed in rowe and davis experimental investigation from fig 3 a and b it can be seen that the n c for both horizontal and vertical anchor matches reasonably with the numerical solution obtained by yu et al 2011 and merifield et al 2001 the overall fashion of present studies is similar to the analytical solution of merifield et al 2001 and found in between the bound solutions based on rigid plasticity infinite stiffness ratio the cohesion pullout factor is closer to the upper bound solution up to an embodiment ratio of 3 then deviates and maximum differences are found 6 6 for horizontal anchor and 6 3 for the vertical anchor note that for deeply embedded anchor the current fe results are a little lower than the upper bound solutions the lower bound solution of smith 1998 and upper bound solution of merifield and sloan 2006 in fig 4 a are shown for the analogy with the current finite element studies for embedment ratios 2 4 and 6 for the horizontal anchor as expected present numerical results plot above the lower bound solution of smith and estimate slightly higher capacity than the upper bound solution of merifield and sloan 2006 however the maximum variation lies within 6 at a shallow depth and at higher depth it is hard to figure out fig 4a also exhibits the limit equilibrium solution of murray and geddes 1987 for h b 2 4 and 6 murray and geddes s solution overestimate the actual pullout capacity because of the assumption regarding the shape of the failure surface and the average orientation of the frictional resistance upper bound solution of merifield and sloan 2006 for the perfectly rough and smooth anchor is shown for resemblance with the present finite element studies in fig 4b as expected the soil weight pullout factor nγ lies in between the upper bound solution of two extreme conditions perfectly smooth and perfectly rough earlier studies rowe and davis 1982b merifield and sloan 2006 revealed that the effect of roughness on pullout capacity of the horizontal anchor is negligible but significant when the anchor is vertical since the current study is conducted by assuming the interface friction coefficient as 0 4 for this reason the numerical solution differs significantly from a perfectly rough interface condition for φ 40 and reasonably agreed at a low friction angle 5 numerical results generally the superposition method simplifies the calculation and induces error on the safe side to the ultimate pullout capacity in this study the uplift capacity factor nc nq nγ as a result of cohesion surcharge and soil weight are calculated separately for together horizontal and vertical anchor by using the method of superposition and total capacities c 0 q 0 and γ 0 are also determined directly from abaqus as shown in table 2 as anticipated the results obtained from eq 1 always estimate lower pullout capacity than directly from the abaqus the error is found to be increased with the friction angle and embedment ratios for friction angle of 40 the direct solution estimates approximately 13 higher pullout capacity than the superposition method however minimum errors are found 1 6 for friction angle 10 these are consistent with the previous study for example the results critical slip field method of zhu et al 2003 with the existing conventional superposition method showed an error of less than 10 on the conservative side bolton and lau 1993 also mentioned superposition assumptions induced an error of not more than 20 and always on the safe side davis and booker 1971 also confirmed that the superposition method indicates an error on the safe side at a margin of no more than 30 for the limiting case on no body force and no surcharge the errors are due to the nonlinear behavior of soil in the plastic range and failure mechanism of weightless soil is not applicable for weight soil therefore it is seen that the error for superposition method is always on the safe side but it could be unsafe when the back analyzed shear strength is used for calculating design load of a foundation on same soil but for different loading conditions sun et al 2013 5 1 cohesion pullout factor in this section the validated models are used to estimate the ultimate pullout of strip anchor where γ 0 q 0 and c 0 for friction angles ranging from 0 to 40 at an interval of 5 in this case three different values of cohesion are examined such as 10 30 and 50 kpa the ultimate pullout capacity for all value of cohesion is computed for a horizontal anchor at h b 3 and φ 0 in all cases nc is found 4 77 which suggest that the pullout capacity in dimensionless form is independent of cohesion the variation of a cohesion pullout factor n c as a function of friction angle φ embedment ratio h b and anchor rotation angle β is presented in fig 5 a e from fig 5a and b it is visible that at h b 4 n c increases gradually with friction angle up to 20 and after that friction angle does not show any significant effect on the other hand a similar tendency is attended at h b 6 and 8 after φ 30 this type of variation is also noticed by rowe and davis 1982b and sahoo and kumar 2013 however for anchor with higher rotation angle fig 5d and e n c increase gradually with the increase of φ and h b and found maximum when the anchor is fully vertical β 90 from the fig 5 a e it is also visible that the cohesion pullout factor varies nonlinearly with the friction angle when β 0 and alters from nonlinear to linear fashion when β 90 for correspondence the pullout capacity factor attained in current finite element studies is set side by side in fig 5f with the result of rowe and davis 1982b by the displacement based elastoplastic finite element method and merifield 2002 by the lower bound finite element limit analysis as expected the pullout capacity is found higher than the merifield solution for all h b ratios however the solution of rowe and davis underestimate the actual capacity because the limit load was not based on the ultimate shear failure the pullout capacity factor due to cohesion is calculated for a wide range of embedment ratios i e 1 to 10 anchor inclination angle ranging from 0 to 90 and the internal friction angles ranging from 0 to 40 the results presented in fig 5 a e can be best approximated as following 5 y a f q 1 φ β h b f q 2 φ β the mathematical form can be used to fit results where the function f q1 and f q2 must be found such that the fit is optimal the following expression best fits with the current finite element results 6 n c 1 13 φ β 3 φ 2 6 8 1 22 φ β 0 5 β 3 62 1 80 0 6 h b 0 61 1 44 1 67 φ 0 31 β 2 where φ the friction angle in radians β inclination angle of anchor in radians and h b embedment ratios 5 2 surcharge bpullout factor the variation of pullout factor n q due to the contribution of surcharge pressure as a function of friction angle embedment and the rotation angle is shown in fig 6 a e it is found that for a given h b the pullout factors increase almost linearly with friction angle for the horizontal anchor β 0 as shown in fig 6a these linear behaviors are apparent for a horizontal anchor in all embedment ratios but the trend changes from linear to nonlinear with the increase of anchor rotation and found nonlinear at β 90 for an analogy the surcharge pullout factor obtained in contemporary finite element analysis is compared with the upper bound solution of murray and geddes 1987 and sahoo and kumar 2012b respectively as shown in fig 6f it is noticed that the pullout factor n q is found lower compared to the results of murray and geddes 1987 and sahoo and kumar 2012b the current analyses are carried out for surcharge q 18 kn m2 rotation angle ranging from 0 to 90 and friction angle ranging from 10 to 40 the following equation can be best fitted for the numerical results shown in fig 6 a e 7 n q φ β 3 7 φ 0 3 0 6 φ β 0 4 β 1 9 h b 1 01 0 1 φ 0 2 β 1 3 5 3 soil weight pullout factor in order to figure out the effect of the weight of the soil on pullout capacity it is necessary to set c 0 q 0 and γ 0 but for purely frictional material convergence problems are raised consequently a small amount of cohesion i e c γb 0 25 10 3 for φ up to 25 and 0 5 for φ 25 is assumed in order to avoid divergence of numerical solutions zhu and michalowski 2005 the influence of cohesion is then removed by subtracting cn c having estimated n c in the first series of calculation islam et al 2017 therefore the modified pullout capacity factor nγ are calculated from 8 n γ q u c n c γ h the variation of soil weight pullout factor n γ with friction angle for different embedment ratios and base rotation is shown in fig 7 for horizontal anchor the anchor pullout factor n γ varies almost linearly with the friction angle these linear variations are found in all embedment ratios for rotation angle 0 and 22 5 and some embedment ratios for 45 but do not exist at a rotation angle of 67 5 and 90 hence it can be said that nγ changes from linear to nonlinear fashion with the increase of anchor orientation from horizontal to vertical and also analogous to the variation of nq another noteworthy feature is that for a given h b the n γ increased far more significantly for a vertical anchor in comparison to horizontal anchor which is also identical with the result found by merifield and sloan 2006 and bhattacharya and kumar 2014 this is due to the work done by the soil weight during the deformation process in horizontal anchor the soil above the anchor only contributes to the pullout capacity but in case of vertical anchor both the soil at top and front of the anchor contributes to the pullout capacity the extent of the failure surface reflects the amount of work against the soil weight this is why at larger φ the extent of failure mechanism for the horizontal anchor is lower than the vertical anchor again a severe stress concentration occurs at the bottom edge of vertical anchor for the shake of earth pressure therefore the contact between the anchor and soil becomes tighten which increase the pullout resistance for these reasons vertical anchor illustrates greater pullout capacity than the horizontal anchor the numerical results showed in fig 7 a e can be fitted as follow 9 n γ φ β 3 φ 0 32 0 69 φ β 0 9 β 2 8 h b 1 1 0 3 β 1 35 equations 6 7 and 9 are expressed as a function of three independent variables such as friction angle φ the inclination angle of anchor β and embedment ratio h b while soil dilatancy and anchor roughness are not considered in these equations despite of this uncertainties these equations are valid for determining the pullout capacity factors nc nq and n γ for φ 0 40 β 0 90 and h b 1 to 10 the influence of these three parameters φ β and h b are also assessed and their contributions on the pullout capacity factors are estimates using monte carlo simulation because monte carlo simulations is widely used over the last decades to evaluate the safety of foundations by assessing the certain level of reliability identified numerically by reliability index or probabilistic failure the percent contribution of these independent variables sivakumar babu et al 2006 ji et al 2019 2018 pereira and caldeira 2011 the probabilistic monte carlo analysis is carried out using the excel spreadsheet with 1 million simulations in order to produce a reliable result from these analyses it is found that in eq 6 h b φ and β contributes 76 16 and 8 respectively in eq 7 h b φ and β contributes 50 43 and 7 respectively and in eq 9 h b φ and β contributes 48 42 and 10 respectively therefore it can be reported that the pullout capacity of plate anchors are significantly influenced by the embedment ratio and soil frictional angle while the effect of anchor rotation is not very significant 5 4 comparison with experimental studies murray and geddes 1987 1989 performed chamber testing program on very dense sand φ 43 6 and medium dense sand φ 36 for square circular and rectangular anchor of width or diameter were 50 8 mm they determined the pullout capacity of horizontal anchor for aspect ratios l b of 1 2 5 and 10 their results indicate that an anchor with aspect ratios of l b 10 and l b 5 gives almost identical result the pullout capacity of horizontal strip anchor in current finite element studies for friction angle of 40 is compared with the experimental result of murry and geddes as shown in fig 8 a it is visible that the present fem result estimates lower value than these experimental results and small differences are found up to h b 5 and the difference increases with the increase of h b ratios dickin 1988 also conducted a number of centrifugal tests on medium and dense sand for rectangular anchor with aspect ratios l b 1 2 5 and 8 among the laboratory test results the pullout capacities of anchor in dense sand φ 43 6 are shown in fig 8a and the current numerical results compare well with the dickin centrifugal test in practical it is difficult to conduct an experiment at friction angle exactly 30 and 35 for this reason fe results of friction angle 30 and 35 are compared with experimental studies of das and seeley 1975 at friction angle of 31 rowe 1978 at friction angle of 33 respectively again the numerical results for friction angle 35 and 40 are compared with the recent experimental studies of liu et al 2013 for friction angle 34 and 43 the current fem results for φ 35 and 40 showed good agreement with the experimental results the pullout capacities of das and seeley are higher than the present numerical studies as well as rowe s studies this is may be due to the shape of the anchor and dilatation angle rowe s experimental studies predict lower pullout capacities at friction angle 33 as compared to current fem studies at friction angle 35 these capacities are matches partially with the pullout at fraction angle 30 of this study and higher differences are found at h b 2 these divergences may be attributed to the lower dilatation angle in rowe s study ψ 4 10 or may be due to truncation criterion another possible reason for these discrepancies between experimental and numerical result is that the extrapolation of results from small scale laboratory test to large scale field test always overestimates the actual capacities dickin 1988 considering the limitation of available experimental outcomes it is tough to conclude whether the scale effect alone is responsible for these discrepancies limited experimental studies were performed to estimate the pullout capacity of vertical anchor subjected to different rotation neely et al 1973 conducted a small scale test having l b ratios 1 2 and 5 for friction angle 38 5 at an embedment ratio 1 through 5 although the fe result estimates a higher capacity than neely s result the overall agreement is inspiring in neely s study an alternative criterion was used to determine the failure load because the load displacement curve appears that it is still increasing when the test is finished again akinmusuru 1978 reported results for aspect ratio 1 and 10 at φ 35 akinmusuru s results exhibit higher pullout load than the present numerical studies even from neely et al 1973 studies also hoshiya and mandal 1984 conducted the test of anchor in a sand chamber of 300 mm 400 mm in size at an embedment ratio ranging from 2 to 6 due to the insufficient size of this chamber the ultimate pullout load is affected by the boundary condition consequently their results exhibit higher pullout load there are a lot of discrepancies observed between the current fe study and experimental results these are due to the uncertainty of soil properties anchor roughness in the laboratory test and complex nature of vertical anchor 5 5 soil failure mechanism the failure mechanisms of horizontal vertical and inclined β 45 anchors attended for material properties i e γ 18 kn m2 and c 10 kpa are depicted by the resultant displacement vectors and line contours in fig 9 a c for φ 0 two types of failure could be occurred depending upon the embedment depth one is for the shallow anchor h b 4 and another is for the deep anchor h b 4 for horizontal anchor at relatively shallow embedment failure occurs together with the upward movement of the rigid column above the anchor and lateral deformation these deformation starts at the anchor edge and propagates to the surface the formation of the rigid column above the anchor is due to locking of the material above the anchor when it is pulled upward when the anchor is pulled the rigid column moves upward and pushes the surrounding soil laterally in an outward direction into the soil mass and results in the formation of a plastic shearing zone on both sides of the anchor for a relatively deep anchor this soil locking phenomenon is not observed and the material change from elastic state to a plastic state at ultimate failure the failure mainly occurred due to the formation of a localized zone of compression and lateral deformation above the anchor for this reason surface deformation decreases with the increase of embedment depth and increases with the friction angle at a particular embedment depth this lateral shearing phenomenon is consistent with merifield and sloan 2006 and liu et al 2013 for clay soil φ 0 at h b 4 plastic shearing or flow is occurred at all sides of anchor and failure occurred fully locally this is mainly due to the effect of the overburden ratio γh c when γh c 7 at h b 4 the soil remains in contact with the bottom of anchor plate despite choosing immediate breakaway condition this type of phenomenon is also observed for all base rotation of anchor it is also remembered that overburden ratio 7 is not a threshold value it could be different for different embedment ratios merifield et al 2001 yu et al 2011 chen et al 2013 fig 9c indicates the failure mechanism of a vertical anchor at different embedment ratios and friction angle the failure surface generates at the bottom of the anchor and propagates as a curve indicating that the ruptured soil mass has undergone a rotary motion failure can be characterized by the formation of a passive failure zone at top and front of the anchor by paralleling all the diagrams in fig 9c it is reasonable to conclude that for a given embedment depth the lateral extent of surface deformation at front and top of the anchor increases with the rise of friction angle 5 6 the effect of anchor roughness the result explained in the above sections is based on the assumption that the soil anchor interface conditions lie in between of perfectly rough or perfectly smooth for this reason the interface friction is assumed to be 0 4 through the analysis and horizontal displacements at the contact nodes of soil anchor are free to move for the sake of determining the influence of roughness on anchor pullout capacity the explicit case of perfectly rough interface condition is analyzed where the anchor soil contact nodes are restrained to move in horizontal directions to measure the effect of roughness a correction factor is calculated separately for nc nq and nγ which are as follow 10 roughness correction factor f δ n n where n the pullout capacity factors for perfectly rough condition and n the pullout capacity factor for the current interface condition the finite element result suggests that the significance of roughness on the pullout capacity of vertical anchor the roughness correction factor for φ 20 30 and 40 decrease nonlinearly with the increase of embedment ratios as shown in fig 10 a c the effect of roughness is found tremendous for nγ as a comparison to nc and nq changing interface from the current condition to perfectly rough can lead to increase the pullout capacity 68 64 and 89 for nc nq and nγ respectively for friction angle φ 40 from the fig 10 it is clear that fδ increases with the increase of friction angle and decrease with the embedment ratios and found minimum for h b 10 at φ 20 the rate of change in roughness is found maximum in between the embedment ratio 1 and 4 for all friction angles in conclusion roughness can affect the pullout capacity enormously when the anchor is embedded at shallow depth up to h b 4 and minimal when largely embedded h b 4 the pullout capacity factor nγ of a vertical perfectly rough anchor at h b 3 for friction angle φ 30 is about 37 higher than the present fe analysis this value is lower than the 50 and 39 increase given by the lower bound and upper bound solutions of merifield and sloan 2006 for the same case h b 3 and β 90 and also smaller than the 67 increase given by rowe and davis 1982b however merifield and sloan and rowe and davis did not give a comprehensive analysis of the effect of anchor roughness one possible explanation is the contribution of developing shear stress at the anchor soil interface on pullout capacity of vertical anchor this is because when the anchor pullout occurs a significant upward movement of soil in contact with the anchor follows at an angle to the soil anchor interface however for perfectly rough anchor the soil in contact is locked down and no slippage occurs at the contact domain for this reason significant shear stress is developed on the contact surface of soil anchor which contributes to increasing the pullout capacity finally the following equation can be best fitted for the numerical results of the vertical anchor as shown in fig 10 11 f δ c n c n c φ 0 5 b h 0 18 0 46 12 f δ q n q n q 1 43 φ 0 67 b h 0 19 φ 13 f δ γ n γ n γ 1 83 φ 0 6 b h 0 22 φ the contribution of roughness on the pullout capacity of the horizontal anchor is almost negligible for all embedment ratios and friction angle as shown in fig 10 fδ increases with the increase of friction angle and decrease with the embedment ratios and found a maximum of about 4 04 for h b 1 at φ 40 the pullout capacity of the horizontal anchor is not considerably affected by the anchor roughness due to the symmetry of the soil flow mechanism that prevents the development of significant shear stresses at the anchor clay interface 6 conclusion a rigorous finite element investigation is carried out to calculate the pullout capacity of strip anchor in c φ soil analyses are carried out to determine the effect of cohesion surcharge pressure and unit weight of soil on pullout factor of the anchor consideration is given to the effect of soil friction angle anchor inclination and anchor embedment ratio on anchor pullout capacity factors n c n q and n γ these factors are calculated individually and presented as a design equation so that the practitioner can use in resolving various practical design problems the following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this paper a the anchor inclination has a noticeable influence on pullout capacity factors n c n q and n γ these factors increase continuously with the increase of anchor inclination angle β with the horizontal and found maximum for vertical anchor and minimum for the horizontal anchor at a given embedment ratio the rate of increment of these factors is found more significant for a vertical anchor as compared to the horizontal anchor this complex nature of the vertical anchor behavior is may be due to the lack of symmetry of anchor b the cohesion pullout factor nc changes from nonlinear to linear fashion with the increase of friction angle for altering anchor orientation from horizontal to vertical while a reversible nature is found for nq and nγ c at a given embedment ratio anchor pullout capacity factors increase continuously with the friction angle and inclination angle but the pullout factor n c increases up to a certain value after which the effect of increment of soil friction angle is insignificant which is in contrast with the trend of n γ and n q d for horizontal anchor at relatively shallow embedment the soil locking phenomenon is observed for all friction angles on the other hand for a relatively deep anchor failure mainly occurred due to the formation of a localized zone of compression and lateral deformation above the anchor for vertical anchor the failure surface is found curve due to the rotary motion of the soil mass additionally the passive failure zone at the bottom and top of the anchor being deeper and wider due to the increase of friction angles for a given embedment ratio the lateral extent of surface deformation increases with the increase of friction angle for all orientations of the anchor e the effect of roughness on the pullout capacity is found significant for vertical anchor where an asymmetrical soil flow mechanism is formed and negligible for horizontal anchor where the symmetrical soil flow mechanism is formed at the same time the effect of anchor roughness increases with the increase of friction angle and decrease with the embedment ratios 
22447,when detecting the wall crack interferences caused by wall effect will significantly increase the difficulty of controlling auv this paper focuses on observing and compensating for interferences in the design of the controller the optimal weight distribution algorithm is proposed to obtain the desired real time optimal heading which ensures that the auv can achieve autonomous following of the wall by adjusting the heading the backstepping sliding mode controller based on a slow time varying adaptive disturbance observer ado is proposed which can effectively observe and compensate for the interference during auv near wall following results show that the tracking error of the proposed controller can be greatly reduced compared with the pid controller and the tracking error is significantly reduced compared with the conventional sliding mode controller the proposed controller can converge fast with small overshoot and stable control effect the ado provides strong robustness against interference such as wall effect thus auvs can stably perform near wall following tasks and capture clear videos keywords autonomous underwater vehicle wall following disturbance observer backstepping sliding mode control 1 introduction water conveyance tunnels are an important transportation route for urban domestic water if these tunnels are used for a long time then cracks and even landslides can occur therefore the tunnels must be regularly checked usually these tunnels are a closed environment and the water pressure in them is high the wall crack can only be detected via manual inspection after draining the water in the tunnel this method is not only inefficient but also affects urban water use the usage of auvs can effectively solve the tunnel detection problem by using an auv real time videos are recorded by mounted cameras and the cracks on the walls are then detected from the playback of the video after the auv is recovered auvs can independently recognize the angle change of the wall and achieve near wall following using mounted ranging sonars in accordance with the preset distance and route in recent years many scholars have conducted research on the tracking control problem of auvs calvo proposed a control scheme constituted by a lyapunov based navigation block and a pi controller to track underwater pipeline and cables calvo et al 2009 the overall performance of the proposed control design was analyzed by simulations where common perturbations were considered the prototype auv was used to test the tracking capability on the basis of los theory however an error was found in the tracking process unnikrishnan proposed an active feedback controller for internal inspection of pipelines unnikrishnan et al 2009 computer vision techniques were used to estimate the relative position and orientation of the vehicle a conical laser was projected on the pipe wall and ccd cameras were used to acquire the image the simulation experiments showed the ability of the control however implementing a large number of conical lasers in existing water conveyance tunnels is difficult karras designed a model based sonar servoing control scheme for wall following karras et al 2013 a multibeam imaging sonar was used for the pose estimation of the vehicle and wave creation mechanism was enabled to simulate wave interference in the tank the control scheme performed good stability and convergence properties kim estimated the hydrodynamic coefficient of snuuv i and proposed a model based control algorithm for wall following control kim and choi 2007 the simulation program demonstrated that the auv could follow the wall with sufficient accuracy using the proposed controller while considering the sensor noise as white noise yu proposed a simplified robust feedback controller to guide an auv to track subsea cables in the presence of sensor noise and ocean currents yu et al 2018 the negative effects of magnetic noise were reduced by integrating the estimation of the horizontal offset into the los guidance law the numerical studies illustrated the subsea cable tracking capability of the controller wan addressed a depth control method based on the active disturbance rejection control adrc and fuzzy control wan et al 2015 the simulation results illustrated that the proposed controller could achieve the certain goal in the disturbance and had a certain inhibitory effect on the overshoot and shock caused by the environment zhang proposed an adaptive nonlinear second order sliding mode path following control zhang et al 2018 an adaptive tuning law was selected to estimate the upper bound of disturbance the lake experiments illustrated that the controller responded with faster convergence and smaller overshoot compared with a linear controller and pid second order sliding mode surface the aforementioned studies focused on the influence of model parameter perturbation ocean currents and sensor noise in studying the disturbance in tracking control the simulation condition was set to a broad water area or the experiment was performed in a broad water area as a result the auv was far from the wall or the sea floor thus the influence of the wall effect on the control of auv was ignored ground effect due to the presence of an external surface is the change of fluid field around the body bhattacharyya et al 2015 it depends on the shape geometry and the characteristic gap ratio a body moving near the vicinity of an external surface experiences lift suction or can even be self stabilized liu used computational fluid dynamics cfd to forecast the interaction performance between auv and submarine pipeline liu et al 2015 a suction perpendicular to the pipeline was observed between the auv and the pipeline due to wall effect when auv was close to the pipeline chen studied the hydrodynamic changes of a dish shaped auv for hovering near the seabed and landing on the sea bottom chen and yan 2017 the simulation results showed the linear relationship between the added masses of the auv and the bottom clearance the increase of added masses would reduce the mobility but improve the stability thereby affecting the maneuverability of the auv when the auv is close to the wall an unavoidable wall effect that affects the hydrodynamic characteristics of the auv will occur thereby affecting the maneuverability of the auv in this study when the auv is performing tunnel wall inspection the distance between the auv and the wall must be stable at approximately 0 6 m while maintaining the stability of the heading to ensure the clarity of the video captured by cameras however if the auv is close to the wall then the wall effect will influence the maneuverability of the auv at the same time the nonlinearity and dead zone problems of the thrusters flow disturbance and other issues will also affect the maneuverability of the auv karras et al 2013 kim and choi 2007 currently auv that can perform long distance 2 km following and detection tasks autonomously in water conveyance tunnel under pressure are unavailable due to the particularity and difficulty of near wall following only few studies have reported the influence of wall effect on auv maneuverability when following the wall at a close range however an accurate numerical model cannot be established for the interference due to the complexity of the underwater environment and the parameter perturbation of the auv model and the uncertainty and randomness of the interference aguiar and pascoal 2007 therefore a new controller that can observe the interference terms and fully consider the characteristics of the wall inspection task should be designed for the near wall following problem in tunnel inspection to ensure the safety of the auv and the video quality of the camera in view of the aforementioned problems the data obtained by the ranging sonars are used in this study to transform the wall following problem into the heading control problem moreover a backstepping sliding mode controller based on a slow time varying adaptive disturbance observer bsmcstado is proposed for the heading control the ado zhang et al 2015 can effectively observe and compensate the interference terms and realize the close range autonomous following and crack observation of the wall for the safety of the auv the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 establishes the kinematic and dynamic model of auv and introduces the difficulties in the control scheme section 3 proposes the dynamic calculation algorithm of the desired heading angle and the bsmcstado to realize the control of the heading the stability and convergence properties of the proposed control scheme are analytically guaranteed by using lyapunov s second method the simulation results are used to verify the observation effect of ado on interference terms the superiority of the proposed control scheme is verified by experiments in section 4 finally section 5 draws the conclusions 2 problem statement 2 1 analysis of wall effect the water conveyance tunnel inspection auv auv t fig 1 in this study is equipped with five circumferential cameras for shooting the walls the auv t is equipped with a rear propeller two vertical tunnel thrusters and two horizontal tunnel thrusters thus it can perform the movement of sway surge and yaw in the horizontal plane and sway and yaw in the case of turning off the rear propeller furthermore it obtains good maneuverability for wall following the ranging sonars fig 2 are mounted on the top bottom left and right positions of the bow and stern to measure the distance of the auv from the surrounding walls the model of the sonars is dyw 50 200 nb with a range of 0 6 120 m at 200 khz their half power angle is 7 5 when the channel width is less than 0 6 m the stability and accuracy of the sonars will decrease rapidly due to the interference caused by echo however the pool test showed that the ranging sonars could work with satisfactory accuracy in the range of 0 2 20 m when they work in polling mode the sonars of auv t work in polling mode so that the accuracy of sonar data can be guaranteed when following the wall the main parameters of the auv are shown in table 1 based on the ittc and sname s offer the submarine motion is described through a 6 dof body coordinate frame of reference fig 3 in which the origin is located at the center of gravity with the positive directions along the x y and z axes which denote forward starboard and vertically downward respectively the 6 dof auv kinematic and dynamic equations are as tanakitkorn et al 2018 1 η j η v 2 m v c v v d v v g η d τ where v u v w p q r t η x y z ϕ θ ψ t τ is a vector of external forces and moments d is the external disturbance force and moment j η is a transformation matrix is the rigid body inertia matrix c v is a matrix of rigid body coriolis and centripetal forces d v is a damping matrix and g η is a vector of generalized gravitational and buoyancy forces mahapatra and subudhi 2018 in this study the gravity of the auv is equal to the buoyancy the auv has three symmetry planes center buttock waterplane and midship section if we set m as the mass of the auv u v r as the linear velocities x u y v n r as the speed coefficient x u y v n r as the inertial coefficient x u u y v v n r r as the second order speed coefficient and f x f y f n as the external disturbance force and moment the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated by cfd numerical simulation calculations when the heave z motion pitch θ and roll φ angles of the auv are ignored the horizontal motion model can be expressed as 3 m x u 0 0 0 m y v 0 0 0 i z n r u v r 0 0 y v m v 0 0 m x u u m y v v x u m u 0 u v r x u x u u u 0 0 0 y v y v v v 0 0 0 n r n r r r u v r f x f y f n τ as shown in fig 4 the auv t performs the voyage observation in the tunnel if the distance between the auv and the wall is adjusted by the traverse movement then the heading of the auv will be seriously disturbed and the video cannot be collected clearly therefore in this study the distance between the auv and the wall is changed by adjusting the heading of the auv to ensure the stability of the heading assume that the distance between the auv center and the wall is h and the ratio of the distance from the wall to the diameter of the auv is e e h d bhattacharyya et al 2015 on the basis of the international pool test the boundary effect should be considered when e 2 most auvs sail in the deep sea which is similar to an infinitely deep and wide environment however the auv t is approximately 0 6 m e 1 5 away from the wall during the inspection process thus the interference of the boundary effect should be considered the numerical simulation test of the plane motion mechanism of the auv is performed on the basis of cfd theory fig 5 the auv t is symmetric with respect to the x o y axis and the x o z axis thus the hydrodynamic coefficients are the same in the horizontal and vertical planes pure sway and pure shake tests are used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients under infinite deep water and near wall conditions therefore sway and yaw tests are used to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients under infinite deep water and near wall conditions integral dynamic mesh technology is used to improve the computational efficiency in infinite deep waters and overlapping grid technology is used in near wall waters the numerical calculation results are shown in fig 6 the absolute values of the dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients in the infinite wide and deep waters are larger than those in waters near the wall of the viscous hydrodynamic coefficients the rotational derivatives y r and n r in the infinite wide and deep water is approximately thrice the near wall water of the inertia hydrodynamic coefficients y r and n r in the infinite wide and deep water is approximately 16 and 7 times those in the near wall water respectively however the reduction of the hydrodynamic coefficients such as the rotational derivative will reduce the motion stability of the auv and adversely affect the maneuverability of the yaw ψ motion therefore the influence of the wall effect cannot be ignored in designing the controller studies have shown that pressure difference occurs between the left and right sides of the auv when it is close to the wall and the pressure difference between the midship and the fore aft will be different when the distance is closer to the wall the pressure difference will eventually appear as the suction of the wall to the auv thereby affecting the stability of the heading therefore the interference of the wall effect should be fully considered in designing the controller furthermore the controller should be able to observe and compensate for it the influence of the wall effect on auv is further verified by a pool test the near wall straight course test where the auv performs directional navigation is conducted in the pool the auv is adjusted to keep parallel with the wall the current heading is set as the desired heading angle and the desired speed is set to 0 8 m s as shown in fig 7 the auv is initially parallel to the wall direction after sailing for 60 s on the surface the auv travels from position a to b the real time heading angle of the auv and the distance from the wall are measured under the difference of the initial distance from the wall some results are shown in figs 8 11 under the test conditions the heading of auv is constantly stable with an amplitude of less than 3 when the initial distance between the auv and the wall is approximately 1 m the wall effect will be generated between the auv and the wall and a suction will occur between the auv and the wall in this manner the auv slowly approaches the wall thereby resulting in the distance from the wall becoming increasingly shorter with the heading of the auv unchanging finally the distance stabilizes at approximately 0 3 m the shorter the initial distance between the auv and the wall is the faster the stable distance of 0 3 m comes when the initial distance is 1 m the speed of the auv near the wall is approximately 0 0116 m s the speed is approximately 0 0115 m s when the initial distance is 0 8 m the speed is approximately 0 0085 m s when the initial distance is 0 6 m when the initial distance is longer than 1 m the wall effect has minimal effect on the auv which can be neglected the distance between the auv and the wall remains unchanged in the case of a stable heading the test results show that the influence of the wall effect on the auv is related to the distance from the wall to the auv under the test conditions the wall effect is the strongest when the distance is approximately 0 8 m by contrast the wall effect will be weakened when the distance is decreased or increased the wall effect is not negligible when the distance to the wall is between 0 3 m and 1 m the results of other scholars combined with cfd numerical simulation calculations and pool tests can fully demonstrate that when the auv performs near wall following tasks the change in hydrodynamic coefficient caused by the wall effect will cause a certain suction between the auv and the wall which has a non negligible influence on the maneuverability of the auv thus the interference should be fully considered in designing the controller it should also be observed and compensated to ensure the stability of the heading in near wall following tasks 2 2 linearization of the thruster the yaw motion of the auv t is driven by the torque generated by the two horizontal tunnel thrusters however the thrusters have dead zones and the positive and negative rotation efficiency is different as a result the output thrust of the propeller can fail to achieve the expected output effect of the controller cui et al 2016 ropars et al 2015 in this study the open water test of the propeller is conducted in a circulating water tank fig 12 the thrust curves of the horizontal tunnel propellers obtained at different flow rates are shown in fig 13 the thrust of the thruster is nonlinear with the voltage when the flow rate is increased the thruster efficiency is affected the quadratic fitting relationship between voltage and thrust when the flow rate is 1 m s is

considerably reduce the computational pressure of the embedded computer without reducing the fitting accuracy assuming that the turning moment of the controller s output is m and the distance between the bow and stern horizontal thrusters from the auv center is l thr the desired output of the bow and stern thrusters should be 7 f f r o n t f b a c k m 2 l t h r in this chapter we analyzed the necessity of observing and compensating for interferences caused by wall effect it is the motivation of designing the wall following controller on the other hand we stated the linearization the thrusters due to its negative effect on the controller 3 auv wall following controller design different from conventional path following the sailing route of auv is limited to the tunnel when following the wall in the tunnel auv always sails along the tunnel in its surge motion the yaw motion and sway motion the change of distance between auv and the wall control is considered in this paper the control of distance is achieved by adjusting the desired heading angle the optimal heading angle is obtained by ranging sonars however the accuracy of the ranging sonar is affected by the distance and data redundancy exists the optimal weight allocation algorithm is used to obtain the real time desired heading angle given the high precision of the heading control in the operation process this study proposes the bsmcstado which can observe and compensate for disturbances such as model parameter perturbation water flow and wall effect 3 1 dynamic calculation of desired heading angle the tracking mode of auv t is to maintain a specified distance from the wall when the wall has a curve wall following is achieved by adjusting the desired heading angle the angles of the walls are unknown as such the desired heading angle to be tracked is also unknown and the traditional path tracking algorithm cannot complete the following task to solve this problem an algorithm is proposed to obtain the real time desired heading angle on the basis of ranging sonar data the auv t is equipped with multiple sets of sonar therefore the obtained heading angle is redundant the optimal weight distribution algorithm is used for data fusion to obtain the optimal heading angle the process is shown in fig 14 the auv t obtains the distance from the four ranging sonars mounted on it assuming that the heading angle given by the fog fiber optic gyroscope at the current moment is ψ 0 the data measured by the left front left rear right front right rear are d lf d lb d rf and d rb respectively fig 15 the distance between the front and rear sonars is l the rolling angle is φ and the longitudinal speed is v in the position in the figure the angle between the auv and the wall obtained according to the left sonars is δ ψ l arctan d l f d l b cos ϕ l and the angle between the auv and the wall obtained according to the right sonars is δ ψ r arctan d r f d r b cos ϕ l conventional data fusion uses the weighted average method and the assignment of weights will considerably affect the accuracy of the data in this study the optimal weight distribution algorithm gao et al 2011 is proposed the data error of the ranging sonar increases with the distance from the wall by conducting the pool test the error probability model of the angle calculated by one side of the sonar is obtained in different distance ranges thereby completing the data fusion of the angle information assume that the data of the left side ranging sonars has a mean value of d l d l f d l b 2 and the data of the right side ranging sonars has a mean value of d r d r f d r b 2 the angle obtained at this distance obeys the normal distribution n μ l σ l 2 and n μ r σ r 2 where μ l μ r are the expected values and σ l σ r are the mean square deviation at a certain distance range indicating the accuracy of the sonars at this distance range the value of which is obtained by the pool test let the angle weights calculated by the left and right side sonars be ω l ω r ω l ω r 1 then the angle data after fusion can be expressed as follows 8 δ ψ ω l δ ψ l ω r δ ψ r on the basis of the multivariate statistical theory the accuracy of the data after fusion is 9 σ ω l 2 σ l 2 ω r 2 σ r 2 the smaller the value of σ the higher the accuracy of the data after fusion under the premise that σ l σ r are constant σ is only related to the distribution of the weight ω l ω r at a certain distance range if the sonars do not change the lagrange multiplier approach is used to solve the multivariate extremum problem under constraint conditions the correction function is then introduced as follows 10 y ω l 2 σ l 2 ω r 2 σ r 2 ε ω l ω r 1 the partial derivative is determined as 11 y ω l 2 ω l σ l 2 ε y ω r 2 ω r σ r 2 ε when y ω l y ω r 0 y is the smallest which can be solved as follows 12 ω l ε 2 σ l 2 ω r ε 2 σ r 2 thus 13 ε 2 1 σ l 2 1 σ r 2 the weight can be solved by substituting it into 12 as shown as follows 14 ω l 1 σ l 2 1 σ l 2 1 σ r 2 ω r 1 σ r 2 1 σ l 2 1 σ r 2 the accuracy of the data after fusion can be expressed as follows 15 σ ω l 2 σ l 2 ω r 2 σ r 2 1 σ l 2 σ r 2 by conducting the pool test the corresponding σ l σ r in different distance intervals can be obtained simultaneously the weight can be dynamically adjusted in accordance with the distance of the auv from the wall the weight is constantly the optimal value the angle δ ψ between the auv and the wall at this time is 16 δ ψ ω l δ ψ l ω r δ ψ r ω l arctan d l f d l b cos ϕ l ω r arctan d r f d r b cos ϕ l the distance between the auv and the right wall is 17 d r 1 2 d r f d r b cos δ ψ cos ϕ the distance between the auv and the left wall is 18 d l 1 2 d l f d l b cos δ ψ cos ϕ the desired heading angle is 19 ψ d ψ 0 δ ψ ψ 0 ω l arctan d l f d l b cos ϕ l ω r arctan d r f d r b cos ϕ l after obtaining the real time desired heading angle the wall following problem can be converted into the heading control problem so we can focus on the design of heading controller 3 2 heading controller based on ado the adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller bsmc is designed as shown in fig 16 equation 3 is expanded as follows 20 i z n r r x u y v u v n r n r r r r f n τ n where τ n is the torque produced by the differential of the two horizontal tunnel thrusters hence 21 r

is the current heading angle assume that x 1d is the desired output of the system desired heading angle then the error is defined as 24 z 1 x 1 x 1 d the lyapunov function is defined as 25 v 1 1 2 z 1

31 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 from equations 23 and 30 the following is obtained 32 z 2 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d the lyapunov function is defined as 33 v 2 v 1 1 2 s 2 where s is the sliding surface function which can be expressed as follows 34 s k 2 z 1 z 2 k 2 0 from equations 31 and 32 the following are obtained 35 s k 2 z 1 z 2 k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d 36 v 2 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d v 1 is a positive definite thus v 2 is also a positive definite the adaptive term is used to estimate the interference assuming that the estimated value is f ˆ 1 the estimated error is 37 f 1 f f ˆ 1 assuming that the interference term changes slowly f 0 thus 38 f 1 f f ˆ ˆ 1 f ˆ ˆ 1 the lyapunov function is defined as 39 v 3 v 2 f 1 2 2 λ λ 0 40 v 3 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2

in the boundary layer to reduce the chattering generated when the sliding mode is rapidly switched simulink is used to model and verify the proposed scheme some principal dimensions of auv t are shown in table 1 n r 1 2 k g m n r r 20 k g m x u 76 k g s x u u 104 k g m x u 28 k g assume that the desired heading angle in the tracking control is sin t the disturbance in the tracking control is 2 sin 0 8 t by performing simulation tests several times the values of control parameters were adjusted again and again finally the parameters are set as k 1 0 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 0 5 the prediction results for the interference terms are shown in fig 17 the interference can be predicted by the adaptive term however the prediction of the interference has a certain delay and a large error because the auv is close to the wall the wall effect has a considerable influence on it and disturbances caused by water flow disturbances occur the adaptive sliding mode controller has limited resistance to such external disturbances therefore the nonlinear disturbance observer is added into the controller a compensation amount equivalent to the interference is introduced into the controller to improve the control accuracy the controller structure is shown in fig 18 when the auv performs wall following its surrounding environment water flow and its own state will not change for a short time therefore the hydrodynamic coefficient error caused by the model uncertainty and water flow disturbance will not change in a short time hence this error can be regarded as slow time varying interference the observer can be designed as chen et al 2017 51 f ˆ ˆ 2 p 1 x 2 x ˆ 2 52 x ˆ ˆ 2 f ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 where f ˆ 2 is the estimated value of the interference term f x ˆ 2 is the estimated value of x 2 and p 1 10000 j 1 p 2 200 j 2 j 1 j 2 0 let the estimation error of x ˆ 2 be x 2 that is x 2 x 2 x ˆ 2 assuming that f 2 is the interference estimation error that is f 2 f f ˆ 2 then according to f x 2 f x 2 b τ and f ˆ 2 x ˆ ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 we have 53 f 2 x 2 x ˆ ˆ 2 p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 x 2 p 2 x 2 stability analysis is then performed lyapunov function is again defined as 54 v 4 1 2 p 1 f 2 2 1 2 x 2 2 thus 55 v 4 1 p 1 f 2 f 2 x 2 x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f f ˆ ˆ 2 x 2 x 2 x ˆ ˆ 2 substituting equations 51 and 52 into equation 55 yields 56 v 4 1 p 1 f 2 f 1 p 1 f 2 f ˆ ˆ 2 x 2 x 2 f ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f 1 p 1 f 2 p 1 x 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 b τ f f ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f f 2 x 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f f ˆ 2 p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f f 2 x 2 f 2 x ˆ 2 f 2 x 2 p 2 x 2 2 1 p 1 f 2 f p 2 x 2 2 the interference f is a slow time varying signal thus f is small when p 1 takes a large value the following can be considered 57 f p 1 0 thus 58 v 4 p 2 x 2 2 0 when v 0 x 2 0 x 2 0 and f 2 0 on the basis of the lasalle invariance theorem when t f 2 0 therefore effective observation and compensation of system interference can be performed using the disturbance observer the lyapunov function is defined as 59 v 5 v 2 v 4 v 5 is a positive definite taking the derivative of v 5 yields 60 v 5 v 2 v 4 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d p 2 x 2 2 on the

yields 62 v 5 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s s f s f ˆ 2 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s s f 2 f 2 0 thus 63 v 5 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s from the preceding equations it can be proven to be a non negative definite therefore the system is globally asymptotically stable the parameter is set to j 1 0 8 j 2 1 the remaining simulation conditions are the same as above the observation result of the interference term is shown in fig 19 the adaptive term can predict the model parameter perturbation well moreover the disturbance observer can observe external disturbances such as wall effect and water flow the adaptive term and the disturbance observer are merged into an ado to improve the observation accuracy of the interference such that the control system has good adaptability and robustness to the disturbance in the wall following the system structure is shown in fig 20 let f ˆ be the estimation of the disturbance f obtained by the ado as shown as follows 64 f ˆ f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 the lyapunov function is defined as 65 v v 3 v 4 v is evidently a positive definite and its derivative is taken as follows 66 v z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ x 2 d s f 1 f ˆ 1 f 1 f ˆ ˆ 1 λ s f 2 thus the output of the controller is 67 τ 1 b k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 x 2 d k 3 s k 4 s a t s f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 equations 43 and 67 are substituted into equation 66 which yields 68 v z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s the above equation can be proven to be a non negative definite therefore the system is globally asymptotically stable the observations of the disturbance are shown in fig 21 the observation errors of the ado and the disturbance observer are shown in fig 22 the ado has larger observation error than the disturbance observer before the system enters a steady state however when the system is stable the observation error of the ado is smaller which is more suitable for the observation task of the auv t when working in the tunnel for a long time the control effect of the bsmcstado is shown in fig 23 and fig 24 the auv can accurately and quickly track the desired heading and the tracking error can be converged in a short time by adding the saturation function the control input curve becomes smooth without mutation thereby greatly suppressing the chattering problem of the sliding mode control simultaneously the controller obtains good robust stability 4 experimental verification in order to verify the algorithm we proposed some experiments were did the verification test for the effectiveness of the optimal weight distribution algorithm and the heading control test were conducted in the test pool the wall following control test was conducted in an open channel 4 1 pool test the test is conducted in the test pool of harbin engineering university in march 2018 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme see fig 25 the test is performed under hydrostatic conditions with a wall length of 50 m the test is performed in the pool to verify the effectiveness of the optimal weight distribution algorithm used for sonar data fusion the angle between the auv and the wall are kept at 10 the distance between the auv and the left wall is 0 6 m the distance from the right wall is 19 m and the auv remains static the angles obtained by the weighted average algorithm and the optimal weight distribution algorithm are shown in fig 26 the mean square deviation of the angle obtained by the traditional weighted average algorithm is 0 368 meanwhile the mean square deviation is 0 174 when the optimal weight distribution algorithm is adopted the angle data are accurate after adopting the optimal weight distribution algorithm and the data fluctuation caused by the sonar error is reduced the parameters of the pid controller are k p 1 1 k i 0 03 k d 1 3 the data of the heading control test conducted in the pool are shown in fig 27 from the figure the proposed sliding mode controller can achieve good control of the heading the absolute value of the maximum heading angle error after reaching the steady state is less than 3 after changing the desired heading angle several times the auv can still reach the steady state quickly in comparison with the pid controller the proposed controller effectively observes and compensates the disturbance term moreover the constringency of the proposed controller is rapid and the control deviation is smaller than those of the pid controller the tracking error is also greatly reduced in comparison with the conventional sliding mode controller without a disturbance observer the tracking error is significantly reduced the bsmcstado has stable output and small chattering thereby ensuring the stable operation of the auv fig 28 4 2 field test the wall following control test was conducted in an open channel in hangzhou city zhejiang province china in april 2018 fig 29 the length of the wall in the test site is approximately 300 m with obvious turning the site is located near the drainage station and water flow disturbance occurs with a flow rate of approximately 0 3 m s in the experiment the distance of the following is fixed at 0 6 m and the relative speed of the auv is 0 8 m s through performing pool test and field test several times the appropriate parameters are set as k 1 1 k 2 5 5 k 3 2 k 4 0 7 λ 1 the change of the desired and actual headings and the change of the desired and actual distances in the wall following task when the parameters j 1 j 2 of disturbance observer take different values are shown in figs 30 34 average and var s are calculated on the basis of the actual distance the desired real time heading is obtained from equation 19 on the basis of the data of ranging sonars when the auv is in motion the accuracy of the ranging sonar is low at the same time the data have a delay and a large jitter exits in the desired heading data the value of the disturbance observer s parameter will have a certain influence on the tracking effect of the auv when j 1 0 9 j 2 0 8 the disturbance observer can effectively observe the interference term to ensure that the auv can follow the wall smoothly and stably in the case of unstable desired heading furthermore the absolute value of the maximum tracking error in the test is less than 0 2 m the model uncertainty wall effect water flow and other disturbances observed by the ado in the wall following test conducted in the pool and hangzhou are shown in fig 35 the ado observes that the interference value in the open channel is approximately 50 larger than the interference value in the pool and the interference is complicated this result is observed because the pool is a still water environment and has no water flow interference the ado then achieves effective observation of the interference the shooting effect of the cameras is shown in fig 36 from the figure the auv can follow the wall at a fixed distance using the proposed controller it can also clearly shoot the wall to meet the observation requirements 5 conclusion to achieve near wall following autonomously in the presence of external disturbances such as wall effect this study includes the following aspects 1 the desired real time optimal heading based on the ranging sonar data is obtained by the optimal weight distribution algorithm which ensures that the auv can achieve autonomous following of the wall by adjusting the heading 2 for the nonlinearity and dead zone problem of the propeller the linear fitting method is adopted for reducing the computational complexity considerably to ensure the fitting accuracy 3 to solve interference problems such as wall effect in near wall following a bsmcstado is proposed to realize effective observation of disturbances the simulation experiments show that in comparison with the conventional adaptive term the proposed ado can considerably improve the accuracy of the disturbance estimation the observation error is approximately 30 smaller than the conventional disturbance observer and it shows better robustness against unsteady disturbance the experiments show that the proposed controller converges quickly the overshoot is small and the control effect is stable in comparison with the pid controller the tracking error can be greatly reduced and the tracking error is also significantly reduced compared with the conventional sliding mode controller the ado observes that the disturbance in the open channel is approximately 50 larger than in the pool and the disturbance is complicated the ado achieves effective observation of the disturbance and exhibits strong robustness against disturbances such as wall effect thereby ensuring that the auv t can stably perform near wall following and capture clear video to meet the actual observational needs of the tunnel walls acknowledgements this work was supported by national natural science foundation of chinanational natural science foundation of

22447,when detecting the wall crack interferences caused by wall effect will significantly increase the difficulty of controlling auv this paper focuses on observing and compensating for interferences in the design of the controller the optimal weight distribution algorithm is proposed to obtain the desired real time optimal heading which ensures that the auv can achieve autonomous following of the wall by adjusting the heading the backstepping sliding mode controller based on a slow time varying adaptive disturbance observer ado is proposed which can effectively observe and compensate for the

against interference such as wall effect thus auvs can stably perform near wall following tasks and capture clear videos keywords autonomous underwater vehicle wall following disturbance observer backstepping sliding mode control 1 introduction water conveyance tunnels are an important transportation route for urban domestic water if these tunnels are used for a long time then cracks and even landslides can occur therefore the tunnels must be regularly checked usually these tunnels are a closed environment and the water pressure in them is high the wall crack can only be detected via manual inspection after draining the water in the tunnel this method is not only inefficient but also affects urban water use the usage of auvs can effectively solve the tunnel detection problem by using an auv real time videos are recorded by mounted cameras and the cracks on the walls are then detected from the playback of the video after the auv is recovered auvs can independently recognize the angle change of the wall and achieve near wall following using mounted ranging sonars in accordance with the preset distance and route in recent years many scholars have conducted research on the tracking control problem of auvs calvo proposed a control scheme constituted by a lyapunov based navigation block and a pi controller to track underwater pipeline and cables calvo et al 2009 the

2018 an adaptive tuning law was selected to estimate the upper bound of disturbance the lake experiments illustrated that the controller responded with faster convergence and smaller overshoot compared with a linear controller and pid second order sliding mode surface the aforementioned studies focused on the influence of model parameter perturbation ocean currents and sensor noise in studying the disturbance in tracking control the simulation condition was set to a broad water area or the experiment was performed in a broad water area as a result the auv was far from the wall or the sea floor thus the influence of the wall effect on the control of auv was ignored ground effect due to the presence of an external surface is the change of fluid field around the body bhattacharyya et al 2015 it depends on the shape geometry and the characteristic gap ratio a body moving near the vicinity of an external surface experiences lift suction or can even be self stabilized liu used computational fluid dynamics cfd to forecast the interaction performance between auv and submarine pipeline liu et al 2015 a suction perpendicular to the pipeline was observed between the auv and the pipeline due to wall effect when auv was close to the pipeline chen studied the hydrodynamic changes of a dish shaped auv for hovering near the seabed and landing on the sea bottom chen and yan 2017 the simulation results showed the linear relationship between the added masses of the auv and the bottom clearance the increase of added masses would reduce the mobility but improve the stability thereby affecting the maneuverability of the auv when the auv is close to the wall an unavoidable wall effect that affects the hydrodynamic characteristics of the auv will occur thereby affecting the maneuverability of the auv in this study when the auv is performing tunnel wall inspection the distance between the auv and the wall must be stable at approximately 0 6 m while maintaining the stability of the heading to ensure the clarity of the video captured by cameras however if the auv is close to the wall then the wall effect will influence the maneuverability of the auv at the same time the nonlinearity and dead zone problems of the thrusters flow disturbance and other issues will also affect the maneuverability of the auv karras et al 2013 kim and choi 2007 currently auv that can perform long distance 2 km following and detection tasks autonomously in water conveyance tunnel under pressure are unavailable due to the particularity and difficulty of near wall following only few studies have reported the influence of wall effect on auv maneuverability when following the wall at a close range however an accurate numerical model cannot be established for the interference due to the complexity of the underwater environment and the parameter perturbation of the auv model and the uncertainty and randomness of the interference aguiar and pascoal 2007 therefore a new controller that can observe the interference terms and fully consider the characteristics of the wall inspection task should be designed for the near wall following problem in tunnel inspection to ensure the safety of the auv and the video quality of the camera in view of the aforementioned problems the data obtained by the ranging sonars are used in this study to transform the wall following problem into the heading control problem moreover a backstepping sliding mode controller based on a slow time varying adaptive disturbance observer bsmcstado is proposed for the heading control the ado zhang et al 2015 can effectively observe and compensate the interference terms and realize the close range autonomous following and crack observation of the wall for the safety of the auv the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 establishes the kinematic and dynamic model of auv and introduces the difficulties in the control scheme section 3 proposes the dynamic calculation algorithm of the desired heading angle and the bsmcstado to realize the control of the heading the stability and convergence properties of the proposed control scheme are analytically guaranteed by using lyapunov s second method the simulation results are used to verify the observation effect of ado on interference terms the superiority of the proposed control scheme is verified by experiments in section 4 finally section 5 draws the conclusions 2 problem statement 2 1 analysis of wall effect the water conveyance tunnel inspection auv auv t fig 1 in this study is equipped with five circumferential cameras for shooting the walls the auv t is equipped with a rear propeller two vertical tunnel thrusters and two horizontal tunnel thrusters thus it can perform the movement of sway surge and yaw in the horizontal plane and sway and yaw in the case of turning off the rear propeller furthermore it obtains good maneuverability for wall following the ranging sonars fig 2 are mounted on the top bottom left and right positions of the bow and stern to measure the distance of the auv from the surrounding walls the model of the sonars is dyw 50 200 nb with a range of 0 6 120 m at 200 khz their half power angle is 7 5 when the channel width is less than 0 6 m the stability and accuracy of the sonars will decrease rapidly due to the interference caused by echo however the pool test showed that the ranging sonars could work with satisfactory accuracy in the range of 0 2 20 m when they work in polling mode the sonars of auv t work in polling mode so that the accuracy of sonar data can be guaranteed when following the wall the main parameters of the auv are shown in table 1 based on the ittc and sname s offer the submarine motion is described through a 6 dof body coordinate frame of reference fig 3 in which the origin is located at the center of gravity with the positive directions along the x y and z axes which denote forward starboard and vertically downward respectively the 6 dof auv kinematic and dynamic equations are as tanakitkorn et al 2018 1 η j η v 2 m v c v v d v v g η d τ where v u v w p q r t η x y z ϕ θ ψ t τ is a vector of external forces and moments d is the external disturbance force and moment j η is a transformation matrix is the rigid body inertia matrix c v is a matrix of rigid body coriolis and centripetal forces d v is a damping matrix and g η is a vector of generalized gravitational and buoyancy forces mahapatra and subudhi 2018 in this study the gravity of the auv is equal to the buoyancy the auv has three symmetry planes center buttock waterplane and midship section if we set m as the mass of the auv u v r as the linear velocities x u y v n r as the speed coefficient x u y v n r as the inertial coefficient x u u y v v n r r as the second order speed coefficient and f x f y f n as the external disturbance force and moment the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated by cfd numerical simulation calculations when the heave z motion pitch θ and roll φ angles of the auv are ignored the horizontal motion model can be expressed as 3 m x u 0 0 0 m y v 0 0 0 i z n r u v r 0 0 y v m v 0 0 m x u u m y v v x u m u 0 u v r x u x u u u 0 0 0 y v y v v v 0 0 0 n r n r r r u v r f x f y f n τ as shown in fig 4 the auv t performs the voyage observation in the tunnel if the distance between the auv and the wall is adjusted by the traverse movement then the heading of the auv will be seriously disturbed and the video cannot be collected clearly therefore in this study the distance between the auv and the wall is changed by adjusting the heading of the auv to ensure the stability of the heading assume that the distance between the auv center and the wall is h and the ratio of the distance from the wall to the diameter of the auv is e e h d bhattacharyya et al 2015 on the basis of the international pool test the boundary effect should be considered when e 2 most auvs sail in the deep sea which is similar to an infinitely deep and wide environment however the auv t is approximately 0 6 m e 1 5 away from the wall during the inspection process thus the interference of the boundary effect should be considered the numerical simulation test of the plane motion mechanism of the auv is performed on the basis of cfd theory fig 5 the auv t is symmetric with respect to the x o y axis and the x o z axis thus the hydrodynamic coefficients are the same in the horizontal and vertical planes pure sway and pure shake tests are used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients under infinite deep water and near wall conditions therefore sway and yaw tests are used to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients under infinite deep water and near wall conditions integral dynamic mesh technology is used to improve the computational efficiency in infinite deep waters and overlapping grid technology is used in near wall waters the numerical calculation results are shown in fig 6 the absolute values of the dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients in the infinite wide and deep waters are larger than those in waters near the wall of the viscous hydrodynamic coefficients the rotational derivatives y r and n r in the infinite wide and deep water is approximately thrice the near wall water of the inertia hydrodynamic coefficients y r and n r in the infinite wide and deep water is approximately 16 and 7 times those in the near wall water respectively however the reduction of the hydrodynamic coefficients such as the rotational derivative will reduce the motion stability of the auv and adversely affect the maneuverability of the yaw ψ motion therefore the influence of the wall effect cannot be ignored in designing the controller studies have shown that pressure difference occurs between the left and right sides of the auv when it is close to the wall and the pressure difference between the midship and the fore aft will be different when the distance is closer to the wall the pressure difference will eventually appear as the suction of the wall to the auv thereby affecting the stability of the heading therefore the interference of the wall effect should be fully considered in designing the controller furthermore the controller should be able to observe and compensate for it the influence of the wall effect on auv is further verified by a pool test the near wall straight course test where the auv performs directional navigation is conducted in the pool the auv is adjusted to keep parallel with the wall the current heading is set as the desired heading angle and the desired speed is set to 0 8 m s as shown in fig 7 the auv is initially parallel to the wall direction after sailing for 60 s on the surface the auv travels from position a to b the real time heading angle of the auv and the distance from the wall are measured under the difference of the initial distance from the wall some results are shown in figs 8 11 under the test conditions the heading of auv is constantly stable with an amplitude of less than 3 when the initial distance between the auv and the wall is approximately 1 m the wall effect will be generated between the auv and the wall and a suction will occur between the auv and the wall in this manner the auv slowly approaches the wall thereby resulting in the distance from the wall becoming increasingly shorter with the heading of the auv unchanging finally the distance stabilizes at approximately 0 3 m the shorter the initial distance between the auv and the wall is the faster the stable distance of 0 3 m comes when the initial distance is 1 m the speed of the auv near the wall is approximately 0 0116 m s the speed is approximately 0 0115 m s when the initial distance is 0 8 m the speed is approximately 0 0085 m s when the initial distance is 0 6 m when the initial distance is longer than 1 m the wall effect has minimal effect on the auv which can be neglected the distance between the auv and the wall remains unchanged in the case of a stable heading the test results show that the influence of the wall effect on the auv is related to the distance from the wall to the auv under the test conditions the wall effect is the strongest when the distance is approximately 0 8 m by contrast the wall effect will be weakened when the distance is decreased or increased the wall effect is not negligible when the distance to the wall is between 0 3 m and 1 m the results of other scholars combined with cfd numerical simulation calculations and pool tests can fully demonstrate that when the auv performs near wall following tasks the change in hydrodynamic coefficient caused by the wall effect will cause a certain suction between the auv and the wall which has a non negligible influence on the maneuverability of the auv thus the interference should be fully considered in designing the controller it should also be observed and compensated to ensure the stability of the heading in near wall following tasks 2 2 linearization of the thruster the yaw motion of the auv t is driven by the torque generated by the two horizontal tunnel thrusters however the thrusters have dead zones and the positive and negative rotation efficiency is different as a result the output thrust of the propeller can fail to achieve the expected output effect of the controller cui et al 2016 ropars et al 2015 in this study the open water test of the propeller is conducted in a circulating water tank fig 12 the thrust curves of the horizontal tunnel propellers obtained at different flow rates are shown in fig 13 the thrust of the thruster is nonlinear with the voltage when the flow rate is increased the thruster efficiency is affected the quadratic fitting relationship between voltage and thrust when the flow rate is 1 m s is

considerably reduce the computational pressure of the embedded computer without reducing the fitting accuracy assuming that the turning moment of the controller s output is m and the distance between the bow and stern horizontal thrusters from the auv center is l thr the desired output of the bow and stern thrusters should be 7 f f r o n t f b a c k m 2 l t h r in this chapter we analyzed the necessity of observing and compensating for interferences caused by wall effect it is the motivation of designing the wall following controller on the other hand we stated the linearization the thrusters due to its negative effect on the controller 3 auv wall following controller design different from conventional path following the sailing route of auv is limited to the tunnel when following the wall in the tunnel auv always sails along the tunnel in its surge motion the yaw motion and sway motion the change of distance between auv and the wall control is considered in this paper the control of distance is achieved by adjusting the desired heading angle the optimal heading angle is obtained by ranging sonars however the accuracy of the ranging sonar is affected by the distance and data redundancy exists the optimal weight allocation algorithm is used to obtain the real time desired heading angle given the high precision of the heading control in the operation process this study proposes the bsmcstado which can observe and compensate for disturbances such as model parameter perturbation water flow and wall effect 3 1 dynamic calculation of desired heading angle the tracking mode of auv t is to maintain a specified distance from the wall when the wall has a curve wall following is achieved by adjusting the desired heading angle the angles of the walls are unknown as such the desired heading angle to be tracked is also unknown and the traditional path tracking algorithm cannot complete the following task to solve this problem an algorithm is proposed to obtain the real time desired heading angle on the basis of ranging sonar data the auv t is equipped with multiple sets of sonar therefore the obtained heading angle is redundant the optimal weight distribution algorithm is used for data fusion to obtain the optimal heading angle the process is shown in fig 14 the auv t obtains the distance from the four ranging sonars mounted on it assuming that the heading angle given by the fog fiber optic gyroscope at the current moment is ψ 0 the data measured by the left front left rear right front right rear are d lf d lb d rf and d rb respectively fig 15 the distance between the front and rear sonars is l the rolling angle is φ and the longitudinal speed is v in the position in the figure the angle between the auv and the wall obtained according to the left sonars is δ ψ l arctan d l f d l b cos ϕ l and the angle between the auv and the wall obtained according to the right sonars is δ ψ r arctan d r f d r b cos ϕ l conventional data fusion uses the weighted average method and the assignment of weights will considerably affect the accuracy of the data in this study the optimal weight distribution algorithm gao et al 2011 is proposed the data error of the ranging sonar increases with the distance from the wall by conducting the pool test the error probability model of the angle calculated by one side of the sonar is obtained in different distance ranges thereby completing the data fusion of the angle information assume that the data of the left side ranging sonars has a mean value of d l d l f d l b 2 and the data of the right side ranging sonars has a mean value of d r d r f d r b 2 the angle obtained at this distance obeys the normal distribution n μ l σ l 2 and n μ r σ r 2 where μ l μ r are the expected values and σ l σ r are the mean square deviation at a certain distance range indicating the accuracy of the sonars at this distance range the value of which is obtained by the pool test let the angle weights calculated by the left and right side sonars be ω l ω r ω l ω r 1 then the angle data after fusion can be expressed as follows 8 δ ψ ω l δ ψ l ω r δ ψ r on the basis of the multivariate statistical theory the accuracy of the data after fusion is 9 σ ω l 2 σ l 2 ω r 2 σ r 2 the smaller the value of σ the higher the accuracy of the data after fusion under the premise that σ l σ r are constant σ is only related to the distribution of the weight ω l ω r at a certain distance range if the sonars do not change the lagrange multiplier approach is used to solve the multivariate extremum problem under constraint conditions the correction function is then introduced as follows 10 y ω l 2 σ l 2 ω r 2 σ r 2 ε ω l ω r 1 the partial derivative is determined as 11 y ω l 2 ω l σ l 2 ε y ω r 2 ω r σ r 2 ε when y ω l y ω r 0 y is the smallest which can be solved as follows 12 ω l ε 2 σ l 2 ω r ε 2 σ r 2 thus 13 ε 2 1 σ l 2 1 σ r 2 the weight can be solved by substituting it into 12 as shown as follows 14 ω l 1 σ l 2 1 σ l 2 1 σ r 2 ω r 1 σ r 2 1 σ l 2 1 σ r 2 the accuracy of the data after fusion can be expressed as follows 15 σ ω l 2 σ l 2 ω r 2 σ r 2 1 σ l 2 σ r 2 by conducting the pool test the corresponding σ l σ r in different distance intervals can be obtained simultaneously the weight can be dynamically adjusted in accordance with the distance of the auv from the wall the weight is constantly the optimal value the angle δ ψ between the auv and the wall at this time is 16 δ ψ ω l δ ψ l ω r δ ψ r ω l arctan d l f d l b cos ϕ l ω r arctan d r f d r b cos ϕ l the distance between the auv and the right wall is 17 d r 1 2 d r f d r b cos δ ψ cos ϕ the distance between the auv and the left wall is 18 d l 1 2 d l f d l b cos δ ψ cos ϕ the desired heading angle is 19 ψ d ψ 0 δ ψ ψ 0 ω l arctan d l f d l b cos ϕ l ω r arctan d r f d r b cos ϕ l after obtaining the real time desired heading angle the wall following problem can be converted into the heading control problem so we can focus on the design of heading controller 3 2 heading controller based on ado the adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller bsmc is designed as shown in fig 16 equation 3 is expanded as follows 20 i z n r r x u y v u v n r n r r r r f n τ n where τ n is the torque produced by the differential of the two horizontal tunnel thrusters hence 21 r τ n i z n r x u y v u v f n i z n r n r n r r r r i z n r let b 1 i z n r g r n r n r r r i z n r and d x u y v u v f n i z n r the kinematic and dynamic models of the auv are joe et al 2014 22 ψ r r g r r b τ n d let x 2 r x 1 ψ τ τ n f x 2 g x 2 x 2 g r r f d thus 23 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b τ f the backstepping method is used to derive the heading controller chen et al 2015 in the above equation x 1 is the current heading angle assume that x 1d is the desired output of the system desired heading angle then the error is defined as 24 z 1 x 1 x 1 d the lyapunov function is defined as 25 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 thus 26 v 1 z 1 z 1 from equations 23 and 24 the following is obtained 27 z 1 x 1 x 1 d x 2 x 1 d substituting equation 27 into equation 26 yields 28 v 1 z 1 x 2 x 1 d evidently v 1 is a positive definite the virtual control variable is defined as 29 x 2 d x 1 d k 1 z 1 k 1 0 where x 2d is the expected value of x 2 the error of the virtual control variable is defined as 30 z 2 x 2 x 2 d thus 31 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 from equations 23 and 30 the following is obtained 32 z 2 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d the lyapunov function is defined as 33 v 2 v 1 1 2 s 2 where s is the sliding surface function which can be expressed as follows 34 s k 2 z 1 z 2 k 2 0 from equations 31 and 32 the following are obtained 35 s k 2 z 1 z 2 k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d 36 v 2 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d v 1 is a positive definite thus v 2 is also a positive definite the adaptive term is used to estimate the interference assuming that the estimated value is f ˆ 1 the estimated error is 37 f 1 f f ˆ 1 assuming that the interference term changes slowly f 0 thus 38 f 1 f f ˆ ˆ 1 f ˆ ˆ 1 the lyapunov function is defined as 39 v 3 v 2 f 1 2 2 λ λ 0 40 v 3 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ x 2 d s f 1 f ˆ 1 f 1 f ˆ ˆ 1 λ on the basis of lyapunov s second law τ should be designed such that v 3 is a negative definite let 41 τ 1 b k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 x 2 d k 3 s k 4 sgn s f ˆ 1 where k 3 0 k 4 0 substituting equation 41 into equation 40 yields 42 v 3 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 sgn s s f ˆ 1 s f 1 f ˆ 1 f 1 f ˆ ˆ 1 λ let the adaptive law be 43 f ˆ ˆ 1 λ s then 44 v 3 z 1 z 2 k

value of k 1 k 2 k 3 q 0 thus q is a positive definite matrix v 3 0 is a negative definite and v 3 is a positive definite furthermore the system is globally asymptotically stable to suppress the chattering of the sliding mode controller a saturation function is used instead of the symbol function in control law 41 then 49 τ 1 b k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 x 2 d k 3 s k 4 s a t s f ˆ where 50 s a t s 1 s δ s δ s δ 1 s δ where δ is the boundary layer outside the boundary layer switching control is adopted to make the system state quickly move to the sliding mode then feedback control is adopted in the boundary layer to reduce the chattering generated when the sliding mode is rapidly switched simulink is used to model and verify the proposed scheme some principal dimensions of auv t are shown in table 1 n r 1 2 k g m n r r 20 k g m x u 76 k g s x u u 104 k g m x u 28 k g assume that the desired heading angle in the tracking control is sin t the disturbance in the tracking control is 2 sin 0 8 t by performing simulation tests several times the values of control parameters were adjusted again and again finally the parameters are set as k 1 0 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 0 5 the prediction results for the interference terms are shown in fig 17 the interference can be predicted by the adaptive term however the prediction of the interference has a certain delay and a large error because the auv is close to the wall the wall effect has a considerable influence on it and disturbances caused by water flow disturbances occur the adaptive sliding mode controller has limited resistance to such external disturbances therefore the nonlinear disturbance observer is added into the controller a compensation amount equivalent to the interference is introduced into the controller to improve the control accuracy the controller structure is shown in fig 18 when the auv performs wall following its surrounding environment water flow and its own state will not change for a short time therefore the hydrodynamic coefficient error caused by the model uncertainty and water flow disturbance will not change in a short time hence this error can be regarded as slow time varying interference the observer can be designed as chen et al 2017 51 f ˆ ˆ 2 p 1 x 2 x ˆ 2 52 x ˆ ˆ 2 f ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 where f ˆ 2 is the estimated value of the interference term f x ˆ 2 is the estimated value of x 2 and p 1 10000 j 1 p 2 200 j 2 j 1 j 2 0 let the estimation error of x ˆ 2 be x 2 that is x 2 x 2 x ˆ 2 assuming that f 2 is the interference estimation error that is f 2 f f ˆ 2 then according to f x 2 f x 2 b τ and f ˆ 2 x ˆ ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 we have 53 f 2 x 2 x ˆ ˆ 2 p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 x 2 p 2 x 2 stability analysis is then performed lyapunov function is again defined as 54 v 4 1 2 p 1 f 2 2 1 2 x 2 2 thus 55 v 4 1 p 1 f 2 f 2 x 2 x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f f ˆ ˆ 2 x 2 x 2 x ˆ ˆ 2 substituting equations 51 and 52 into equation 55 yields 56 v 4 1 p 1 f 2 f 1 p 1 f 2 f ˆ ˆ 2 x 2 x 2 f ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f 1 p 1 f 2 p 1 x 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 b τ f f ˆ 2 b τ p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f f 2 x 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 f f ˆ 2 p 2 x ˆ 2 x 2 1 p 1 f 2 f f 2 x 2 f 2 x ˆ 2 f 2 x 2 p 2 x 2 2 1 p 1 f 2 f p 2 x 2 2 the interference f is a slow time varying signal thus f is small when p 1 takes a large value the following can be considered 57 f p 1 0 thus 58 v 4 p 2 x 2 2 0 when v 0 x 2 0 x 2 0 and f 2 0 on the basis of the lasalle invariance theorem when t f 2 0 therefore effective observation and compensation of system interference can be performed using the disturbance observer the lyapunov function is defined as 59 v 5 v 2 v 4 v 5 is a positive definite taking the derivative of v 5 yields 60 v 5 v 2 v 4 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ f x 2 d p 2 x 2 2 on the basis of lyapunov s second law τ should be designed such that v 5 is a negative definite let 61 τ 1 b k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 x 2 d k 3 s k 4 s a t s f ˆ 2 substituting equation 61 into equation 60 yields 62 v 5 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s s f s f ˆ 2 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s s f 2 f 2 0 thus 63 v 5 z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s from the preceding equations it can be proven to be a non negative definite therefore the system is globally asymptotically stable the parameter is set to j 1 0 8 j 2 1 the remaining simulation conditions are the same as above the observation result of the interference term is shown in fig 19 the adaptive term can predict the model parameter perturbation well moreover the disturbance observer can observe external disturbances such as wall effect and water flow the adaptive term and the disturbance observer are merged into an ado to improve the observation accuracy of the interference such that the control system has good adaptability and robustness to the disturbance in the wall following the system structure is shown in fig 20 let f ˆ be the estimation of the disturbance f obtained by the ado as shown as follows 64 f ˆ f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 the lyapunov function is defined as 65 v v 3 v 4 v is evidently a positive definite and its derivative is taken as follows 66 v z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 s k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 b τ x 2 d s f 1 f ˆ 1 f 1 f ˆ ˆ 1 λ s f 2 thus the output of the controller is 67 τ 1 b k 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 f x 2 x 2 d k 3 s k 4 s a t s f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 equations 43 and 67 are substituted into equation 66 which yields 68 v z 1 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 3 s 2 s k 4 s a t s the above equation can be proven to be a non negative definite therefore the system is globally asymptotically stable the observations of the disturbance are shown in fig 21 the observation errors of the ado and the disturbance observer are shown in fig 22 the ado has larger observation error than the disturbance observer before the system enters a steady state however when the system is stable the observation error of the ado is smaller which is more suitable for the observation task of the auv t when working in the tunnel for a long time the control effect of the bsmcstado is shown in fig 23 and fig 24 the auv can accurately and quickly track the desired heading and the tracking error can be converged in a short time by adding the saturation function the control input curve becomes smooth without mutation thereby greatly suppressing the chattering problem of the sliding mode control simultaneously the controller obtains good robust stability 4 experimental verification in order to verify the algorithm we proposed some experiments were did the verification test for the effectiveness of the optimal weight distribution algorithm and the heading control test were conducted in the test pool the wall following control test was conducted in an open channel 4 1 pool test the test is conducted in the test pool of harbin engineering university in march 2018 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme see fig 25 the test is performed under hydrostatic conditions with a wall length of 50 m the test is performed in the pool to verify the effectiveness of the optimal weight distribution algorithm used for sonar data fusion the angle between the auv and the wall are kept at 10 the distance between the auv and the left wall is 0 6 m the distance from the right wall is 19 m and the auv remains static the angles obtained by the weighted average algorithm and the optimal weight distribution algorithm are shown in fig 26 the mean square deviation of the angle obtained by the traditional weighted average algorithm is 0 368 meanwhile the mean square deviation is 0 174 when the optimal weight distribution algorithm is adopted the angle data are accurate after adopting the optimal weight distribution algorithm and the data fluctuation caused by the sonar error is reduced the parameters of the pid controller are k p 1 1 k i 0 03 k d 1 3 the data of the heading control test conducted in the pool are shown in fig 27 from the figure the proposed sliding mode controller can achieve good control of the heading the absolute value of the maximum heading angle error after reaching the steady state is less than 3 after changing the desired heading angle several times the auv can still reach the steady state quickly in comparison with the pid controller the proposed controller effectively observes and compensates the disturbance term moreover the constringency of the proposed controller is rapid and the control deviation is smaller than those of the pid controller the tracking error is also greatly reduced in comparison with the conventional sliding mode controller without a disturbance observer the tracking error is significantly reduced the bsmcstado has stable output and small chattering thereby ensuring the stable operation of the auv fig 28 4 2 field test the wall following control test was conducted in an open channel in hangzhou city zhejiang province china in april 2018 fig 29 the length of the wall in the test site is approximately 300 m with obvious turning the site is located near the drainage station and water flow disturbance occurs with a flow rate of approximately 0 3 m s in the experiment the distance of the following is fixed at 0 6 m and the relative speed of the auv is 0 8 m s through performing pool test and field test several times the appropriate parameters are set as k 1 1 k 2 5 5 k 3 2 k 4 0 7 λ 1 the change of the desired and actual headings and the change of the desired and actual distances in the wall following task when the parameters j 1 j 2 of disturbance observer take different values are shown in figs 30 34 average and var s are calculated on the basis of the actual distance the desired real time heading is obtained from equation 19 on the basis of the data of ranging sonars when the auv is in motion the accuracy of the ranging sonar is low at the same time the data have a delay and a large jitter exits in the desired heading data the value of the disturbance observer s parameter will have a certain influence on the tracking effect of the auv when j 1 0 9 j 2 0 8 the disturbance observer can effectively observe the interference term to ensure that the auv can follow the wall smoothly and stably in the case of unstable desired heading furthermore the absolute value of the maximum tracking error in the test is less than 0 2 m the model uncertainty wall effect water flow and other disturbances observed by the ado in the wall following test conducted in the pool and hangzhou are shown in fig 35 the ado observes that the interference value in the open channel is approximately 50 larger than the interference value in the pool and the interference is complicated this result is observed because the pool is a still water environment and has no water flow interference the ado then achieves effective observation of the interference the shooting effect of the cameras is shown in fig 36 from the figure the auv can follow the wall at a fixed distance using the proposed controller it can also clearly shoot the wall to meet the observation requirements 5 conclusion to achieve near wall following autonomously in the presence of external disturbances such as wall effect this study includes the following aspects 1 the desired real time optimal heading based on the ranging sonar data is obtained by the optimal weight distribution algorithm which ensures that the auv can achieve autonomous following of the wall by adjusting the heading 2 for the nonlinearity and dead zone problem of the propeller the linear fitting method is adopted for reducing the computational complexity considerably to ensure the fitting accuracy 3 to solve interference problems such as wall effect in near wall following a bsmcstado is proposed to realize effective observation of disturbances the simulation experiments show that in comparison with the conventional adaptive term the proposed ado can considerably improve the accuracy of the disturbance estimation the observation error is approximately 30 smaller than the conventional disturbance observer and it shows better robustness against unsteady disturbance the experiments show that the proposed controller converges quickly the overshoot is small and the control effect is stable in comparison with the pid controller the tracking error can be greatly reduced and the tracking error is also significantly reduced compared with the conventional sliding mode controller the ado observes that the disturbance in the open channel is approximately 50 larger than in the pool and the disturbance is complicated the ado achieves effective observation of the disturbance and exhibits strong robustness against disturbances such as wall effect thereby ensuring that the auv t can stably perform near wall following and capture

22448,in order to decrease the dynamic response of cylindrical fpso a novel anti motion structures with taper angle is proposed according to the computational fluid dynamics approach the influence of different taper angles and pore diameters are numerically studied in present work to investigate both viscous damping and vortex shedding performance of heave and pitch motions dynamic mesh method and user defined functions are adopted after a series of validation and convergence test works the numerical models of the cylindrical fpso with different taper anti motion structure is established and the damping coefficients are calculated via these models besides the vortex shedding performance is documented by vorticity graphs results show that the heave damping coefficient decreases with the increasing taper angle on the other hand less pitch damping coefficients are found when the smaller pore diameter is adopted an interesting finding is that pores on the anti motion structure do benefit to increase the damping performance but the diameter should not exceed a limit keywords cylindrical fpso anti motion structure damping coefficient vortex shedding cfd nomenclature x y z a

and offloading systems fpsos which are modified by oil tankers cylindrical fpsos cost less on construction and maintenance because of their simple structures however owing to their large water plane area and small heave damping cylindrical fpsos have great heave oscillation in waves on one hand giant oscillation may decrease the production efficiency and affect the structure safety on the other hand large heave motion has a negative effect on mooring and riser systems it will increase the cycling loads on the slender structures and decrease its fatigue life therefore how to control their oscillations in waves has become a significant issue in the design of cylindrical fpsos many technologies have been applied to improve heave performance one of the most innovative methods is changing the shape of fpso in order to keep its natural period away from the wave period wang et al 2016 2018 proposed a sandglass type fpso due to its smaller water plane area the natural oscillation period is increased to avoid the wave period nevertheless wang et al 2017 noticed that a large pitch of this fpso was caused by the small water plane area as well as the low metacentric height they adopted dynamic positioning system to overcome this shortage another variant non ship fpso is the fillet inverted quadrangular frustum pyramid shaped fpso iqfp which is proposed by wang et al wang et al 2012 wang 2014 the unique shape and optimized mooring system can improve its hydrodynamic performance besides iqfps can be arranged adjacent to each other like a honeycomb so as to increase the oil production efficiency based on classic cylindrical fpso zhao et al 2016 proposed a conceptual multi cylinder fpso for the marginal oil fields in south china sea similarly a four column fdpso is presented by gu et al 2017 2018a according to both experimental and numerical studies the novel structures are proven to be adaptable for deep water area adding anti motion structures is also a popular method to decrease the oscillation of offshore platforms heave plate as a kind of anti motion structures is widely applied to spar platforms subbulakshmi et al subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 studied its effect on heave damping of a spar by computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and found that heave damping increased with scaling ratio and diameter ratio shen et al 2012 studied the influence of heave plate with different opening rates on spar platform according to the numerical simulations they found that the hydrodynamic performance of heave plate after being tapered was better for fpsos both experimental and numerical hydrodynamic investigations on a non ship shaped fpso were carried out by vijayalakshmi et al vijayalakshmi and panneerselvam 2012 with different damping plates they found that the heave and pitch responses decreased linearly as the damping plate width increased van t veer et al van t veer and fathi 2011 focused on roll damping and employed 3d cfd simulations to show the fluid behavior around the fpso appendages it is shown that the fpso submerged riser balcony on one side of the vessel contributes to the roll damping through similar physics as the bilge keel does according to previous researches anti motion structure can effectively improve the hydrodynamic performance of offshore platforms moreover the construction and substitution are convenient so that the cost can be reduced and the life can be prolonged however study of anti motion structure of cylindrical fpso is not sufficient and the vortex generation mechanism of it especially variant structure is not clarified different from deforming cylindrical fpso to change the natural period anti motion structures improve the hydrodynamic performances with fluid body interaction in which the viscosity of water plays an important role as a result the potential flow theory is insufficient for hydrodynamic analysis of floating bodies with anti motion structures nowadays model tests and cfd simulations are two main approaches to study this viscous damping issue zhang et al zhang and ishihara 2018 used large eddy simulations with volume of fluid method to predict the hydrodynamic load on a forced oscillation model with multiple plates guarniz avalos et al avalos and wanderley 2018 developed a computational code which is used for calculating the forced roll oscillation of fpso with different bilge keels types based on the 2d navier stokes equations the generated vortices influence on the pressure distribution is shown in their work kwon et al 2017 studied a box shaped fpso both experimentally and numerically based on 6dof cfd simulation results show that decay coefficient considerably increases when the bilge keel height increases from 600 mm to 800 mm generally as the cfd approach is more economical and flexible than conducting experiments cfd method is more feasible for studying the hydrodynamic performance of the buoys with different type anti motion structures especially in the design stage in present work the hydrodynamic performance of a cylindrical fpso with anti motion structure is mainly investigated results of different scaling factors are compared the viscous damping effect of different taper angles and pore diameters is studied by cfd method which is validated by the experimental results moreover the vortex generation mechanism is shown by vorticity graph in the following sections the simulation scheme is firstly described including the design of the anti motion structure and the cylindrical fpso models afterwards the simulation method is shown as well as the feasibility of our numerical model then the sea condition is illustrated and the numerical results including the damping coefficient and vorticity contours are displayed finally conclusions are drawn indicating the characteristic of anti motion structure of cylindrical fpso 2 simulation scheme 2 1 anti motion structure the scheme of cylindrical fpso with anti motion structure is shown in fig 1 the anti motion structure is tapered with taper angle while pores are distributed on the periphery in order to prevent seawater from seeping into the fpso waterproof plates are set inside the structure the main parameters of the cylindrical fpso are displayed in table 1 2 2 anti motion structure models cfd method is used to establish different simulation models the main body of cylindrical fpso and the external diameter of anti motion structure are kept constant when changing the taper angle from 0 to 25 and the pore diameter from 0 to 600 mm the external diameter is 96 m detailed parameters of each model are shown in table 2 anti motion structures with different pore diameters are numbered from p1 to p5 and those with different taper angles are numbered from t1 to t5 model p4 is totally the same as model t4 to keep the displacement remaining the same the draft of t1 to t5 are computed and listed in table 2 while the pore diameter is far smaller than the dimension of the floating structure both the draft and the displacement the same are assumed among the models from p1 to p5 3 numerical model 3 1 hydrodynamic coefficients according to the approach proposed by guarniz avalos et al avalos and wanderley 2018 the hydrodynamic coefficients are acquired from cfd simulation results the motion can be in heave or pitch and the rotation axis of pitch oscillations is y axis assuming that the body is oscillating harmonically the displacement a velocity a and acceleration a of the structure are written as 1 a a sin ω t a a ω cos ω t a a ω 2 sin ω t where the motion amplitude of the structure is a the frequency of wave is ω the load f which is applied on the structure can be written as 2 f f 0 sin ω t φ where f can be obtained in the cfd calculation results f 0 is the load amplitude φ is the phase angle the numerical code calculates the hydrodynamic load f at each time step assuming a linear damping coefficient the hydrodynamic load meets the equation 3 μ a λ a c a f 0 where μ is the added mass or added inertia λ is the hydrodynamic damping and c is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient if the body is a fully submerged plate c 0 hereby the damping coefficient λ can be written as 4 λ f 0 sin φ a ω as the load amplitude f 0 as well as phase angle φ can be obtained according to the cfd simulation thus the damping coefficient can be determined 3 2 simulation setup the hydrodynamic performance results of the novel structure are obtained by solving the urans equations according to the cfd model the flow was assumed incompressible and the k epsilon model adds the following transport equations to the continuity and momentum equations santo et al 2019 5 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j μ μ t σ k k x j 2 μ t s 2 ρ ε t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε k 2 μ t s 2 c 2 ρ ε 2 k in the equations u i is the averaged cartesian components of velocity vector ρ represents the density of the fluid k and ε are respectively the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate s is the modulus of the rate of strain tensor and σ k σ ε c 1 and c 2 are constants respectively set equal to 1 1 3 1 44 and 1 92 μ t represents the turbulent viscosity which is defined as μ t c μ ρ k 2 ε with c μ equal to 0 09 the vof method is used to capture the free surface by using volume fraction equation volume fraction of phase p and q in a cell are defined as α p and α q respectively and the equation can be written as luent 14 0 teory g 2011 6 1 ρ q t α q ρ q α q ρ q v q s α q p 1 n m p q m q p where m q p is the mass transfer from phase q to phase p and m p q is the mass transfer from phase p to phase q ρ p and ρ q are respectively the density of p and q s α q is the mass source these equations are solved by a software ansys fluent and user defined functions udf are compiled to the model to control the motion of fpso with the aid of dynamic mesh methods specifically both spring based smoothing method and local remeshing method are adopted the discrete equation is established by pressure implicit split operator piso scheme time step is relevant in the unsteady simulation an error in the time step value could ill condition the output simulations mancini et al 2018 gokce and kinaci 2018 in this simulation time step is 0 01s which is in accordance with the guidelines of ittc procedures and guide 2011 the size of the computational domain is 800 m 800 m 600 m scaling factor 1 1 and the whole domain and grids around the model are displayed in fig 2 it is illustrated in fig 2 a that at the bnning of the simulation field below the static water plane is set to water phase while the upper field is set to air phase in addition according to fig 2 b the whole domain is divided into three subdomains including the rigid part orange the deformation part red and the static part green grids in the rigid part move with the structure to capture the flow accurately the deformation part is responsible for deformation of the dynamic mesh methods grids in the static part are established to avoid wall effect these subdomains are connected with each other by the interface boundary hereby the body motion of the floater could be taken into account considering the boundaries of the flow the top side of the domain is set as pressure outlet while other sides are set as symmetry boundary on the other hand the wall boundary is applied on the structure surface 3 3 mesh sensitivity analysis model meshing is completed by pre processor icem for the full scale model maximum element sizes are 7 m 9 m and 15 m corresponding to the rigid part the deformation part and the static part respectively for those elements on the wall of the body the mesh size is 2 m grids around the static water plane are relatively refined to capture the shape of the free surface as shown in fig 2 b moreover 4 prism layers are created around the body and pores to capture the flow their thickness varies with adjacent grid the total grid number is about 5 million but it changes slightly with different models regarding the verification of the mesh model in the present work three different mesh strates are adopted for model t1 these models include a normal mesh with 3 15 million grid points a fine mesh with 4 22 million grid points and a meticulous mesh with 6 million grid points around the pores the maximum element size of each model is 0 5 m 0 3 m and 0 15 m respectively see fig 3 moreover number of grids in these pores is approximately 8 20 and 50 results under the same motion amplitudes are shown in fig 4 according to the time histories it can be seen that the results show a good agreement among the three models but small differences still exist when the wave loads reach the maximum and minimum table 3 shows the damping convergence and the estimated time cost of calculating the three mesh strates simulations are all carried out in the same hardware environment and the average time cost per step after converging is considered it is shown that the heave damping coefficients of the three different mesh configurations have the biggest difference of 0 7 and that of pitch damping coefficients is 2 0 on the other hand normal mesh cost the similar time with the fine mesh however the meticulous mesh cost much more time according to the sensitivity tests it shows that the fine mesh model provides easy access to the numerical calculations it provides a fair balance between computational resources and accuracy hence in the following simulations the fine mesh model is adopted 3 4 feasibility of numerical model the simulation is based on the a hundred year return sea state in the south china sea and the jonswap spectrum is adopted zhao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 the significant wave height is 13 7 m and the wave period is 15 5s in the cfd simulations a forced motion amplitude should be defined in the udf file ramalingam et al 2017 used the panel method to analyze the wave body interaction so that the heave and pitch rao response amplitude operator were obtained then based on the raos motion amplitudes can be further calculated by spectral analysis according to the approach the motion amplitudes of fpso in waves are pre calculated numerically see table 4 the fpso under investigation is similar to the spar platforms which have the configuration of disk cylinder as a result the non dimensional characteristic parameter which represents the amplitude can be defined as tao and cai 2004 7 k c π a r where r is the diameter of the anti motion structure so that kc keulegan carpenter number of the studied fpso is 0 38 on the other hand different from spar platforms the cylindrical fpso is a shallow draft structure with s r 0 4 whereas s means the submergence of the anti motion structure hence a full scale model of a 0 pore diameter and 0 taper angle anti motion structure is established based on the mentioned cfd scheme results near the kc of 0 38 are compared with the experiments of wadhwa et al wadhwa and thiagarajan 2009 for comparison the frequencies are both set to 1 0 hz while the thickness to diameter ratio and the submergence ratio are the same the nondimensional form of damping coefficient is defined as follows 8 c b λ ω m a where λ is the damping coefficient which is calculated from eq 4 and m a is the added mass in an unbounded fluid for heave plates it can be calculated from sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 9 m a 8 3 ρ r 3 in addition for the cylinder and disk configurations it can be obtained according to tao et al 2007 10 m a ρ 12 2 d d 3 3 π d d 2 g π 3 g 3 3 π d c 2 g whereas g 1 π d d 2 d c 2 ρ is the density of water d d and d c are the diameters of heave plate and cylinder diameter respectively so the c b of the anti motion structure and anti motion structure main body models can be compared together with the experimental results as shown in fig 5 it is shown that the numerical results of only an anti motion structure are accordant to that of experiments on the other hand all the damping ratios are generally linear with kc and with the relatively large kc the configuration of anti motion structure main body have more damping it is mainly caused by the effect of the moon pool whose edge will cause extra vortices moreover it should be noticed that the moon pool will slightly increase the added mass of a cylinder liu et al 2016 thus the m a calculated from eq 8 is smaller in conclusion the numerical scheme is suitable for further simulation 4 results 4 1 scaling factor effect it is usually recognized that reynolds number may have influence on viscous damping performance as well as the vortex shedding phenomenon roddier et al 2009 the different scale factor will lead to the issue of different reynolds numbers besides a suitable scale factor will also improve both accuracy and database size of numerical model from this aspect four different scaling model t1 which are 1 1 1 25 1 50 and 1 75 are adopted to perform this convergence test the heave motion and pitch motion of these models are simulated both heave and pitch damping for each model see fig 6 are all transformed into the prototype model to make the comparison more valuable and reasonable according to the damping results lying in fig 6 we find that results of heave damping among all models are close to each other as well as pitch damping although small differences still exist which are 3 3 for heave and 4 1 for pitch respectively besides it is generally seen that the damping decreases slightly with smaller scaling factors except the case in which the scale factor is 1 50 and the motion is heave in general all these results indicate that the damping results are less sensitive to scaling factor so that the parameter has little impact on the following simulations in order to match the future experiments conducted in the wave tanks the 1 50 model is adopted in the following cfd based simulations 4 2 influence of taper angle different shapes of anti motion structures will affect the hydrodynamic performance of fpso in terms of the cylindrical fpso studied in our work taper angle is an important factor to be considered in this section the effect of taper angle on damping performance of fpso is examined fig 7 a shows the relation between heave damping coefficient and taper angle it is seen that the heave damping decreases with the increasing of taper angle this phenomenon is caused by the fact that the intensity of the vortex generation decreases when the taper angle is larger and it will be detailed discussed in the following paragraphs the figure shows that the damping coefficient decreases by 12 0 for every ten degrees increase of the taper angle specifically it will reduce sharply when the taper angle reaches 25 hereby it indicates that the taper angle significantly affects the heave damping of cylindrical fpso on the other hand the influence on pitch damping in fig 7 b is obviously different from heave that is to say the pitch damping coefficient increases with the taper angle however this influence is too slight to distinguish the damping values which means that the coefficient increases by 2 6 for every ten degree increasing taper angle according to both results of heave and pitch damping 20 is more suitable for the taper angle of the anti motion structure actually vortex shedding plays an important role in adding the damping coefficient thus affecting the hydrodynamic performance of the floating body guilmineau and queutey 2002 to understand the reason of results in fig 7 a the vortex shedding performance around the anti motion structure is investigated in this subsection in this study shapes of the anti motion structures are complicated and the vortex shedding phenomenon include vortices both from corners and pores therefore it is hard to make quantitative analysis such as calculating the strouhal numbers as a result the distribution of vortices around the floating structures are displayed in the following parts for analysis the vorticity distributions of zero taper angle model t1 and 25 taper angle model t5 are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the vorticity contour diagrams are plotted to show the vortices distributions where red denote positive vorticities and blue means negative due to the symmetry half of the anti motion structure and the flow field are displayed as well as the position of the fpso indicated in figs 8 and 9 the figures are in frames equally spaced over one full cycle of heave in the cycle the platform firstly rises up from the mean position then goes down and continue to finish this full cycle according to fig 8 a it is illustrated that as the fpso rises up a dominant negative vortex is created and two vortices are generated from the upper edges of the pore when the fpso reaches the highest displacement in fig 8 b the flow starts to separate from the anti motion structure surface and causes the vortex shedding then as the fpso descends shown in fig 8 c d e and f a dominant positive vortex is created while some small vortices appear besides the edges of the pore the vortex shedding regulation of the dominant vortex is accordant with that in the study of garrido et al garrido mendoza et al 2015 moreover in fig 8 f we found that the flow vorticity around the pore is equal to that around the other positions on the anti motion structure even though the vortices are smaller these phenomena indicate that a perforated structure can generate vortices under the help of interaction between water and structure these vortices can thus help to increase the damping coefficient of the fpso that is the reason why the pores on anti motion structure can make a positive effect on the hydrodynamic performance moreover since small vortices are induced besides the edges of pore adding more edges on the anti motion structure may have the same positive influence however comparing with fig 8 it is seen that the vortex shedding performance of taper anti motion structure in fig 9 slightly distinguishes from that of plane structure of model t1 in fig 9 a as the fpso ascents a dominant negative vortex is generated which is the same as model t1 the created vortex is smaller than that in fig 8 a because of the impact of taper angle in figs 8 e and fig 9 e it is evident that the vortex shedding of model t5 finishes earlier than that of model t1 we can conclude that the great taper angle makes the intensity of the vortex generation decrease so that the damping coefficient will decrease relatively on the other hand from fig 9 it shows that pores on tapered anti motion structure still play an important role and the vorticity around the pore edges is still equal to that in other places the regulation of vortex shedding of these two models are generally the same but the model with smaller taper angle has a more durable vortex shedding phenomenon hereby the taper has a negative effect on damping of the cylindrical fpso 4 3 influence of pore diameter pore diameter is also a significant factor that influences the hydrodynamic performance of fpso in this subsection the damping coefficient of models with different pore diameters are studied while the vorticity graphs are shown in fig 10 the influence of pore diameter is illustrated results in fig 10 a show that the heave damping coefficient increases with the increase of pore diameter except the case with 600 mm however the increase is too small to make sense as the heave damping coefficient increases by 1 2 for every 50 mm increase of the pore diameter on the other hand fig 10 b shows that the pitch damping coefficient of the case with 450 mm is larger than 0 mm the phenomenon is caused by the small vortices which are induced by the pores as is shown in figs 8 and 9 then the coefficient decreases sharply with the increase of pore diameter the pitch damping coefficient decreases for every 50 mm increase of the pore diameter it means that pore diameter has a great influence on the hydrodynamic performance of fpso with pitch motion the phenomenon in fig 10 b is interesting to be discussed as the difference between 450 mm pore diameter and 600 mm pore diameter is indistinctive in vorticity graphs a large pore model of 1400 mm pore diameter is simulated for comparison fig 11 and fig 12 show the vorticity distributions of 450 mm pore diameter model p2 and large pore diameter model respectively like the vorticity graphs in figs 8 and 9 according to fig 11 we see that a dominant negative vortex is firstly generated when the fpso rotates anticlockwise then the clockwise rotation induces a dominant positive vortex the phenomenon is similar with that in heave motion however the difference between pitch and heave is that vortices will shed towards the inner side of fpso when the structure rotates furthermore it can be found in fig 11 e that the vortices beside the pore disrupt the dominant vortex the results of vortex shedding around the structure with large pore in fig 12 is accordant with those in fig 11 it shows that with a larger pore diameter the vortices generated beside the pore are stronger and they will also impact the dominant vortex on the contrary the results in fig 10 b shows that the damping coefficient of larger pore is much smaller than others actually although the shedding phenomenon is more evident the dominant vortex is disrupted greatly moreover as shown in fig 12 e the finish time of the dominant vortex shedding is 0 625 t during the clockwise rotation it is earlier than that of model p2 which is 0 75 t according to fig 11 f due to the bigger vortices around the pore the dominant vortex shedding is accelerated as the dominant vortex shedding plays a determinant role in the damping performance this is the reason why the pitch damping of model p5 is smaller at this point the pitch damping decreases with the increasing pore diameter 4 4 comparison of hydrodynamic performance of different models comparison of hydrodynamic performance of different models is shown in fig 13 as model t4 is totally the same as model p4 the results of t4 could refer to those of p4 heave motion plays a more important role in the daily work of cylindrical structures gu et al 2018b so that more attention should be paid to the heave damping coefficient in the figure it indicates that model t1 t3 have large heave damping coefficients while its pitch damping coefficients are relatively well that is to say when the pore diameter is 550 mm and taper angle is in the range from 0 to 20 the hydrodynamic performance of cylindrical fpso will be better the heave damping coefficient of t1 increases greatly while that of t5 decreases sharply and those from p1 to p5 remains almost same this phenomenon shows that heave motion is more easily affected by the taper angle than pore diameter contrarily it can be found that pore diameter has a large influence on pitch damping hereby during these simulation works of the anti motion structures two regulations can be found one is that taper angle should not surpass 20 otherwise the heave damping coefficient will decrease sharply the other is that pores on anti motion structure are good at improving both heave and pitch performance of cylindrical fpso however it must be admitted that the most proper pore size and taper size is case dependent 5 conclusion and discussion forced oscillation of cylindrical fpso with anti motion structure is simulated by cfd method to study the influence of taper angle and pore diameter on its hydrodynamic performance including viscous damping and the vortex shedding it includes a sensitivity analysis of scaling factors an illustration of the vortex generation mechanism and a comparison between different models based on the method and model the sensitivity of scaling factor is found to be relatively small so that scaling factor counts less on the following simulations and a fixed scaling factor is chosen to continue the study on the whole the heave and pitch motion both decrease slightly with the decrease of scaling factor hydrodynamic performance of cylindrical fpso is sensitive to both pore diameter and taper angle the heave damping coefficient decreases with the increase of taper angle and contrarily increases with the increase of pore diameter between 400 mm and 550 mm meanwhile 600 mm diameter pore is too large to induce stronger dominant vortices so that the heave damping coefficient decreases relatively on the other hand pitch damping increases with taper angle and decreases with pore diameter furthermore it should be mentioned that opening pores on the anti motion structure has a positive effect on both heave and pitch damping moreover heave damping is more sensitive to taper angle while pitch damping is more sensitive to pore diameter when the fpso rises or rotates anticlockwise a dominant negative vortex will be generated from the anti motion structure contrarily a dominant positive vortex appears during the descent or clockwise rotation in heave motion the taper angle will decrease the intensity of vortex generation thus decrease the heave damping on the other hand vortices will be induced by pores but they will disrupt the vortex shedding of the dominant vortex in pitch motion the bigger the pore diameter is the more evident the effect is besides adding pores on anti motion structures can induce vortices thus benefit the damping however the pore diameter should be properly designed to prevent it from affecting the dominant vortex although our simulations are conducted by using a specific design as an example the results may have much broader implications according to the comparison between different models the proper taper angle and pore diameter for this cylindrical fpso is pointed out according to the simulations besides although it is known that adding pores is an effective way to improve the heave and pitch damping of fpso the pore diameter should not exceed a limit which is case dependent it is necessary to point out that although scaling factor has an insignificant effect on the current qualitative analysis the errors between different scaling factors cannot be neglected when making quantitative analysis an experimental study may be necessary for further design of the novel anti motion structure yu et al 2017 on the other hand this study mainly focuses on the damping of anti motion structures further detailed hydrodynamic analysis such as natural oscillation period and amplitude of wave response may be carried out according to faltinsen et al faltinsen 2014 moreover in present work the jonswap spectrum is directly adopted to simulate the 100 yr sea state based on the metocean data without tuning progress although it is a common way to perform the simulations of the platforms in south china sea zhao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 we may make some fine tuning on the spectrum to improve the accuracy and adaptability of jonswap spectrum when we use it to reproduce the 100 yr or other sea states in south china sea quantitative analysis of the vortex shedding phenomenon is also interesting for further study the model can be simplified so that vortex shedding phenomenon from the corners and pores can be quantified separately like the study of carberry et al 2001 besides results show that edges of structure impact greatly on the vortex generation a detailed study of vortex generation mechanism could be carried out thus the anti motion structure proposed could be optimized zhang and ishihara 2018 in reality the damping coefficient of anti motion structure may be impacted also by other factors such as the surface roughness influence of mooring system and the coupling effect of different degrees of freedom dof to analyze the damping of anti motion structure more completely further simulations under more dof are needed such as the works of mancini et al 2018 and li et al li and zhang 2016 li and liu 2018 acknowledgements the authors would also like to

22448,in order to decrease the dynamic response of cylindrical fpso a novel anti motion structures with taper angle is proposed according to the computational fluid dynamics approach the influence of different taper angles and pore diameters are numerically studied in present work to investigate both viscous damping and vortex shedding performance of heave and pitch motions dynamic mesh method and user defined functions are adopted after a series of validation and convergence test works the numerical models of the cylindrical fpso with different taper anti motion structure is established and the damping coefficients are calculated via these models besides the vortex shedding performance is documented by vorticity graphs results show that the heave damping coefficient decreases with the increasing taper angle on the other hand less pitch damping coefficients are found when the smaller pore diameter is adopted an interesting finding is that pores on the anti motion structure do benefit to increase the damping performance but the diameter should not exceed a limit keywords cylindrical fpso anti motion structure damping coefficient vortex shedding cfd nomenclature x y z a

and offloading systems fpsos which are modified by oil tankers cylindrical fpsos cost less on construction and maintenance because of their simple structures however owing to their large water plane area and small heave damping cylindrical fpsos have great heave oscillation in waves on one hand giant oscillation may decrease the production efficiency and affect the structure safety on the other hand large heave motion has a negative effect on mooring and riser systems it will increase the cycling loads on the slender structures and decrease its fatigue life therefore how to control their oscillations in waves has become a significant issue in the design of cylindrical fpsos many technologies have been applied to improve heave performance one of the most innovative methods is changing the shape of fpso in order to keep its natural period away from the wave period wang et al 2016 2018 proposed a sandglass type fpso due to its smaller water plane area the natural oscillation period is increased to avoid the wave period nevertheless wang et al 2017 noticed that a large pitch of this fpso was caused by the small water plane area as well as the low metacentric height they adopted dynamic positioning system to overcome this shortage another variant non ship fpso is the fillet inverted quadrangular frustum pyramid shaped fpso iqfp which is proposed by wang et al wang et al 2012 wang 2014 the unique shape and optimized mooring system can improve its hydrodynamic performance besides iqfps can be arranged adjacent to each other like a honeycomb so as to increase the oil production efficiency based on classic cylindrical fpso zhao et al 2016 proposed a conceptual multi cylinder fpso for the marginal oil fields in south china sea similarly a four column fdpso is presented by gu et al 2017 2018a according to both experimental and numerical studies the novel structures are proven to be adaptable for deep water area adding anti motion structures is also a popular method to decrease the oscillation of offshore platforms heave plate as a kind of anti motion structures is widely applied to spar platforms subbulakshmi et al subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 studied its effect on heave damping of a spar by computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and found that heave damping increased with scaling ratio and diameter ratio shen et al 2012 studied the influence of heave plate with different opening rates on spar platform according to the numerical simulations they found that the hydrodynamic performance of heave plate after being tapered was better for fpsos both experimental and numerical hydrodynamic investigations on a non ship shaped fpso were carried out by vijayalakshmi et al vijayalakshmi and panneerselvam 2012 with different damping plates they found that the heave and pitch responses decreased linearly as the damping plate width increased van t veer et al van t veer and fathi 2011 focused on roll damping and employed 3d cfd simulations to show the fluid behavior around the fpso appendages it is shown that the fpso submerged riser balcony on one side of the vessel contributes to the roll damping through similar physics as the bilge keel does according to previous researches anti motion structure can effectively improve the hydrodynamic performance of offshore platforms moreover the construction and substitution are convenient so that the cost can be reduced and the life can be prolonged however study of anti motion structure of cylindrical fpso is not sufficient and the vortex generation mechanism of it especially variant structure is not clarified different from deforming cylindrical fpso to change the natural period anti motion structures improve the hydrodynamic performances with fluid body interaction in which the viscosity of water plays an important role as a result the potential flow theory is insufficient for hydrodynamic analysis of floating bodies with anti motion structures nowadays model tests and cfd simulations are two main approaches to study this viscous damping issue zhang et al zhang and ishihara 2018 used large eddy simulations with volume of fluid method to predict the hydrodynamic load on a forced oscillation model with multiple plates guarniz avalos et al avalos and wanderley 2018 developed a computational code which is used for calculating the forced roll oscillation of fpso with different bilge keels types based on the 2d navier stokes equations the generated vortices influence on the pressure distribution is shown in their work kwon et al 2017 studied a box shaped fpso both experimentally and numerically based on 6dof cfd simulation results show that decay coefficient considerably increases when the bilge keel height increases from 600 mm to 800 mm generally as the cfd approach is more economical and flexible than conducting experiments cfd method is more feasible for studying the hydrodynamic performance of the buoys with different type anti motion structures especially in the design stage in present work the hydrodynamic performance of a cylindrical fpso with anti motion structure is mainly investigated results of different scaling factors are compared the viscous damping effect of different taper angles and pore diameters is studied by cfd method which is validated by the experimental results moreover the vortex generation mechanism is shown by vorticity graph in the following sections the simulation scheme is firstly described including the design of the anti motion structure and the cylindrical fpso models afterwards the simulation method is shown as well as the feasibility of our numerical model then the sea condition is illustrated and the numerical results including the damping coefficient and vorticity contours are displayed finally conclusions are drawn indicating the characteristic of anti motion structure of cylindrical fpso 2 simulation scheme 2 1 anti motion structure the scheme of cylindrical fpso with anti motion structure is shown in fig 1 the anti motion structure is tapered with taper angle while pores are distributed on the periphery in order to prevent seawater from seeping into the fpso waterproof plates are set inside the structure the main parameters of the cylindrical fpso are displayed in table 1 2 2 anti motion structure models cfd method is used to establish different simulation models the main body of cylindrical fpso and the external diameter of anti motion structure are kept constant when changing the taper angle from 0 to 25 and the pore diameter from 0 to 600 mm the external diameter is 96 m detailed parameters of each model are shown in table 2 anti motion structures with different pore diameters are numbered from p1 to p5 and those with different taper angles are numbered from t1 to t5 model p4 is totally the same as model t4 to keep the displacement remaining the same the draft of t1 to t5 are computed and listed in table 2 while the pore diameter is far smaller than the dimension of the floating structure both the draft and the displacement the same are assumed among the models from p1 to p5 3 numerical model 3 1 hydrodynamic coefficients according to the approach proposed by guarniz avalos et al avalos and wanderley 2018 the hydrodynamic coefficients are acquired from cfd simulation results the motion can be in heave or pitch and the rotation axis of pitch oscillations is y axis assuming that the body is oscillating harmonically the displacement a velocity a and acceleration a of the structure are written as 1 a a sin ω t a a ω cos ω t a a ω 2 sin ω t where the motion amplitude of the structure is a the frequency of wave is ω the load f which is applied on the structure can be written as 2 f f 0 sin ω t φ where f can be obtained in the cfd calculation results f 0 is the load amplitude φ is the phase angle the numerical code calculates the hydrodynamic load f at each time step assuming a linear damping coefficient the hydrodynamic load meets the equation 3 μ a λ a c a f 0 where μ is the added mass or added inertia λ is the hydrodynamic damping and c is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient if the body is a fully submerged plate c 0 hereby the damping coefficient λ can be written as 4 λ f 0 sin φ a ω as the load amplitude f 0 as well as phase angle φ can be obtained according to the cfd simulation thus the damping coefficient can be determined 3 2 simulation setup the hydrodynamic performance results of the novel structure are obtained by solving the urans equations according to the cfd model the flow was assumed incompressible and the k epsilon model adds the following transport equations to the continuity and momentum equations santo et al 2019 5 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j μ μ t σ k k x j 2 μ t s 2 ρ ε t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε k 2 μ t s 2 c 2 ρ ε 2 k in the equations u i is the averaged cartesian components of velocity vector ρ represents the density of the fluid k and ε are respectively the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate s is the modulus of the rate of strain tensor and σ k σ ε c 1 and c 2 are constants respectively set equal to 1 1 3 1 44 and 1 92 μ t represents the turbulent viscosity which is defined as μ t c μ ρ k 2 ε with c μ equal to 0 09 the vof method is used to capture the free surface by using volume fraction equation volume fraction of phase p and q in a cell are defined as α p and α q respectively and the equation can be written as luent 14 0 teory g 2011 6 1 ρ q t α q ρ q α q ρ q v q s α q p 1 n m p q m q p where m q p is the mass transfer from phase q to phase p and m p q is the mass transfer from phase p to phase q ρ p and ρ q are respectively the density of p and q s α q is the mass source these equations are solved by a software ansys fluent and user defined functions udf are compiled to the model to control the motion of fpso with the aid of dynamic mesh methods specifically both spring based smoothing method and local remeshing method are adopted the discrete equation is established by pressure implicit split operator piso scheme time step is relevant in the unsteady simulation an error in the time step value could ill condition the output simulations mancini et al 2018 gokce and kinaci 2018 in this simulation time step is 0 01s which is in accordance with the guidelines of ittc procedures and guide 2011 the size of the computational domain is 800 m 800 m 600 m scaling factor 1 1 and the whole domain and grids around the model are displayed in fig 2 it is illustrated in fig 2 a that at the bnning of the simulation field below the static water plane is set to water phase while the upper field is set to air phase in addition according to fig 2 b the whole domain is divided into three subdomains including the rigid part orange the deformation part red and the static part green grids in the rigid part move with the structure to capture the flow accurately the deformation part is responsible for deformation of the dynamic mesh methods grids in the static part are established to avoid wall effect these subdomains are connected with each other by the interface boundary hereby the body motion of the floater could be taken into account considering the boundaries of the flow the top side of the domain is set as pressure outlet while other sides are set as symmetry boundary on the other hand the wall boundary is applied on the structure surface 3 3 mesh sensitivity analysis model meshing is completed by pre processor icem for the full scale model maximum element sizes are 7 m 9 m and 15 m corresponding to the rigid part the deformation part and the static part respectively for those elements on the wall of the body the mesh size is 2 m grids around the static water plane are relatively refined to capture the shape of the free surface as shown in fig 2 b moreover 4 prism layers are created around the body and pores to capture the flow their thickness varies with adjacent grid the total grid number is about 5 million but it changes slightly with different models regarding the verification of the mesh model in the present work three different mesh strates are adopted for model t1 these models include a normal mesh with 3 15 million grid points a fine mesh with 4 22 million grid points and a meticulous mesh with 6 million grid points around the pores the maximum element size of each model is 0 5 m 0 3 m and 0 15 m respectively see fig 3 moreover number of grids in these pores is approximately 8 20 and 50 results under the same motion amplitudes are shown in fig 4 according to the time histories it can be seen that the results show a good agreement among the three models but small differences still exist when the wave loads reach the maximum and minimum table 3 shows the damping convergence and the estimated time cost of calculating the three mesh strates simulations are all carried out in the same hardware environment and the average time cost per step after converging is considered it is shown that the heave damping coefficients of the three different mesh configurations have the biggest difference of 0 7 and that of pitch damping coefficients is 2 0 on the other hand normal mesh cost the similar time with the fine mesh however the meticulous mesh cost much more time according to the sensitivity tests it shows that the fine mesh model provides easy access to the numerical calculations it provides a fair balance between computational resources and accuracy hence in the following simulations the fine mesh model is adopted 3 4 feasibility of numerical model the simulation is based on the a hundred year return sea state in the south china sea and the jonswap spectrum is adopted zhao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 the significant wave height is 13 7 m and the wave period is 15 5s in the cfd simulations a forced motion amplitude should be defined in the udf file ramalingam et al 2017 used the panel method to analyze the wave body interaction so that the heave and pitch rao response amplitude operator were obtained then based on the raos motion amplitudes can be further calculated by spectral analysis according to the approach the motion amplitudes of fpso in waves are pre calculated numerically see table 4 the fpso under investigation is similar to the spar platforms which have the configuration of disk cylinder as a result the non dimensional characteristic parameter which represents the amplitude can be defined as tao and cai 2004 7 k c π a r where r is the diameter of the anti motion structure so that kc keulegan carpenter number of the studied fpso is 0 38 on the other hand different from spar platforms the cylindrical fpso is a shallow draft structure with s r 0 4 whereas s means the submergence of the anti motion structure hence a full scale model of a 0 pore diameter and 0 taper angle anti motion structure is established based on the mentioned cfd scheme results near the kc of 0 38 are compared with the experiments of wadhwa et al wadhwa and thiagarajan 2009 for comparison the frequencies are both set to 1 0 hz while the thickness to diameter ratio and the submergence ratio are the same the nondimensional form of damping coefficient is defined as follows 8 c b λ ω m a where λ is the damping coefficient which is calculated from eq 4 and m a is the added mass in an unbounded fluid for heave plates it can be calculated from sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 9 m a 8 3 ρ r 3 in addition for the cylinder and disk configurations it can be obtained according to tao et al 2007 10 m a ρ 12 2 d d 3 3 π d d 2 g π 3 g 3 3 π d c 2 g whereas g 1 π d d 2 d c 2 ρ is the density of water d d and d c are the diameters of heave plate and cylinder diameter respectively so the c b of the anti motion structure and anti motion structure main body models can be compared together with the experimental results as shown in fig 5 it is shown that the numerical results of only an anti motion structure are accordant to that of experiments on the other hand all the damping ratios are generally linear with kc and with the relatively large kc the configuration of anti motion structure main body have more damping it is mainly caused by the effect of the moon pool whose edge will cause extra vortices moreover it should be noticed that the moon pool will slightly increase the added mass of a cylinder liu et al 2016 thus the m a calculated from eq 8 is smaller in conclusion the numerical scheme is suitable for further simulation 4 results 4 1 scaling factor effect it is usually recognized that reynolds number may have influence on viscous damping performance as well as the vortex shedding phenomenon roddier et al 2009 the different scale factor will lead to the issue of different reynolds numbers besides a suitable scale factor will also improve both accuracy and database size of numerical model from this aspect four different scaling model t1 which are 1 1 1 25 1 50 and 1 75 are adopted to perform this convergence test the heave motion and pitch motion of these models are simulated both heave and pitch damping for each model see fig 6 are all transformed into the prototype model to make the comparison more valuable and reasonable according to the damping results lying in fig 6 we find that results of heave damping among all models are close to each other as well as pitch damping although small differences still exist which are 3 3 for heave and 4 1 for pitch respectively besides it is generally seen that the damping decreases slightly with smaller scaling factors except the case in which the scale factor is 1 50 and the motion is heave in general all these results indicate that the damping results are less sensitive to scaling factor so that the parameter has little impact on the following simulations in order to match the future experiments conducted in the wave tanks the 1 50 model is adopted in the following cfd based simulations 4 2 influence of taper angle different shapes of anti motion structures will affect the hydrodynamic performance of fpso in terms of the cylindrical fpso studied in our work taper angle is an important factor to be considered in this section the effect of taper angle on damping performance of fpso is examined fig 7 a shows the relation between heave damping coefficient and taper angle it is seen that the heave damping decreases with the increasing of taper angle this phenomenon is caused by the fact that the intensity of the vortex generation decreases when the taper angle is larger and it will be detailed discussed in the following paragraphs the figure shows that the damping coefficient decreases by 12 0 for every ten degrees increase of the taper angle specifically it will reduce sharply when the taper angle reaches 25 hereby it indicates that the taper angle significantly affects the heave damping of cylindrical fpso on the other hand the influence on pitch damping in fig 7 b is obviously different from heave that is to say the pitch damping coefficient increases with the taper angle however this influence is too slight to distinguish the damping values which means that the coefficient increases by 2 6 for every ten degree increasing taper angle according to both results of heave and pitch damping 20 is more suitable for the taper angle of the anti motion structure actually vortex shedding plays an important role in adding the damping coefficient thus affecting the hydrodynamic performance of the floating body guilmineau and queutey 2002 to understand the reason of results in fig 7 a the vortex shedding performance around the anti motion structure is investigated in this subsection in this study shapes of the anti motion structures are complicated and the vortex shedding phenomenon include vortices both from corners and pores therefore it is hard to make quantitative analysis such as calculating the strouhal numbers as a result the distribution of vortices around the floating structures are displayed in the following parts for analysis the vorticity distributions of zero taper angle model t1 and 25 taper angle model t5 are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the vorticity contour diagrams are plotted to show the vortices distributions where red denote positive vorticities and blue means negative due to the symmetry half of the anti motion structure and the flow field are displayed as well as the position of the fpso indicated in figs 8 and 9 the figures are in frames equally spaced over one full cycle of heave in the cycle the platform firstly rises up from the mean position then goes down and continue to finish this full cycle according to fig 8 a it is illustrated that as the fpso rises up a dominant negative vortex is created and two vortices are generated from the upper edges of the pore when the fpso reaches the highest displacement in fig 8 b the flow starts to separate from the anti motion structure surface and causes the vortex shedding then as the fpso descends shown in fig 8 c d e and f a dominant positive vortex is created while some small vortices appear besides the edges of the pore the vortex shedding regulation of the dominant vortex is accordant with that in the study of garrido et al garrido mendoza et al 2015 moreover in fig 8 f we found that the flow vorticity around the pore is equal to that around the other positions on the anti motion structure even though the vortices are smaller these phenomena indicate that a perforated structure can generate vortices under the help of interaction between water and structure these vortices can thus help to increase the damping coefficient of the fpso that is the reason why the pores on anti motion structure can make a positive effect on the hydrodynamic performance moreover since small vortices are induced besides the edges of pore adding more edges on the anti motion structure may have the same positive influence however comparing with fig 8 it is seen that the vortex shedding performance of taper anti motion structure in fig 9 slightly distinguishes from that of plane structure of model t1 in fig 9 a as the fpso ascents a dominant negative vortex is generated which is the same as model t1 the created vortex is smaller than that in fig 8 a because of the impact of taper angle in figs 8 e and fig 9 e it is evident that the vortex shedding of model t5 finishes earlier than that of model t1 we can conclude that the great taper angle makes the intensity of the vortex generation decrease so that the damping coefficient will decrease relatively on the other hand from fig 9 it shows that pores on tapered anti motion structure still play an important role and the vorticity around the pore edges is still equal to that in other places the regulation of vortex shedding of these two models are generally the same but the model with smaller taper angle has a more durable vortex shedding phenomenon hereby the taper has a negative effect on damping of the cylindrical fpso 4 3 influence of pore diameter pore diameter is also a significant factor that influences the hydrodynamic performance of fpso in this subsection the damping coefficient of models with different pore diameters are studied while the vorticity graphs are shown in fig 10 the influence of pore diameter is illustrated results in fig 10 a show that the heave damping coefficient increases with the increase of pore diameter except the case with 600 mm however the increase is too small to make sense as the heave damping coefficient increases by 1 2 for every 50 mm increase of the pore diameter on the other hand fig 10 b shows that the pitch damping coefficient of the case with 450 mm is larger than 0 mm the phenomenon is caused by the small vortices which are induced by the pores as is shown in figs 8 and 9 then the coefficient decreases sharply with the increase of pore diameter the pitch damping coefficient decreases for every 50 mm increase of the pore diameter it means that pore diameter has a great influence on the hydrodynamic performance of fpso with pitch motion the phenomenon in fig 10 b is interesting to be discussed as the difference between 450 mm pore diameter and 600 mm pore diameter is indistinctive in vorticity graphs a large pore model of 1400 mm pore diameter is simulated for comparison fig 11 and fig 12 show the vorticity distributions of 450 mm pore diameter model p2 and large pore diameter model respectively like the vorticity graphs in figs 8 and 9 according to fig 11 we see that a dominant negative vortex is firstly generated when the fpso rotates anticlockwise then the clockwise rotation induces a dominant positive vortex the phenomenon is similar with that in heave motion however the difference between pitch and heave is that vortices will shed towards the inner side of fpso when the structure rotates furthermore it can be found in fig 11 e that the vortices beside the pore disrupt the dominant vortex the results of vortex shedding around the structure with large pore in fig 12 is accordant with those in fig 11 it shows that with a larger pore diameter the vortices generated beside the pore are stronger and they will also impact the dominant vortex on the contrary the results in fig 10 b shows that the damping coefficient of larger pore is much smaller than others actually although the shedding phenomenon is more evident the dominant vortex is disrupted greatly moreover as shown in fig 12 e the finish time of the dominant vortex shedding is 0 625 t during the clockwise rotation it is earlier than that of model p2 which is 0 75 t according to fig 11 f due to the bigger vortices around the pore the dominant vortex shedding is accelerated as the dominant vortex shedding plays a determinant role in the damping performance this is the reason why the pitch damping of model p5 is smaller at this point the pitch damping decreases with the increasing pore diameter 4 4 comparison of hydrodynamic performance of different models comparison of hydrodynamic performance of different models is shown in fig 13 as model t4 is totally the same as model p4 the results of t4 could refer to those of p4 heave motion plays a more important role in the daily work of cylindrical structures gu et al 2018b so that more attention should be paid to the heave damping coefficient in the figure it indicates that model t1 t3 have large heave damping coefficients while its pitch damping coefficients are relatively well that is to say when the pore diameter is 550 mm and taper angle is in the range from 0 to 20 the hydrodynamic performance of cylindrical fpso will be better the heave damping coefficient of t1 increases greatly while that of t5 decreases sharply and those from p1 to p5 remains almost same this phenomenon shows that heave motion is more easily affected by the taper angle than pore diameter contrarily it can be found that pore diameter has a large influence on pitch damping hereby during these simulation works of the anti motion structures two regulations can be found one is that taper angle should not surpass 20 otherwise the heave damping coefficient will decrease sharply the other is that pores on anti motion structure are good at improving both heave and pitch performance of cylindrical fpso however it must be admitted that the most proper pore size and taper size is case dependent 5 conclusion and discussion forced oscillation of cylindrical fpso with anti motion structure is simulated by cfd method to study the influence of taper angle and pore diameter on its hydrodynamic performance including viscous damping and the vortex shedding it includes a sensitivity analysis of scaling factors an illustration of the vortex generation mechanism and a comparison between different models based on the method and model the sensitivity of scaling factor is found to be relatively small so that scaling factor counts less on the following simulations and a fixed scaling factor is chosen to continue the study on the whole the heave and pitch motion both decrease slightly with the decrease of scaling factor hydrodynamic performance of cylindrical fpso is sensitive to both pore diameter and taper angle the heave damping coefficient decreases with the increase of taper angle and contrarily increases with the increase of pore diameter between 400 mm and 550 mm meanwhile 600 mm diameter pore is too large to induce stronger dominant vortices so that the heave damping coefficient decreases relatively on the other hand pitch damping increases with taper angle and decreases with pore diameter furthermore it should be mentioned that opening pores on the anti motion structure has a positive effect on both heave and pitch damping moreover heave damping is more sensitive to taper angle while pitch damping is more sensitive to pore diameter when the fpso rises or rotates anticlockwise a dominant negative vortex will be generated from the anti motion structure contrarily a dominant positive vortex appears during the descent or clockwise rotation in heave motion the taper angle will decrease the intensity of vortex generation thus decrease the heave damping on the other hand vortices will be induced by pores but they will disrupt the vortex shedding of the dominant vortex in pitch motion the bigger the pore diameter is the more evident the effect is besides adding pores on anti motion structures can induce vortices thus benefit the damping however the pore diameter should be properly designed to prevent it from affecting the dominant vortex although our simulations are conducted by using a specific design as an example the results may have much broader implications according to the comparison between different models the proper taper angle and pore diameter for this cylindrical fpso is pointed out according to the simulations besides although it is known that adding pores is an effective way to improve the heave and pitch damping of fpso the pore diameter should not exceed a limit which is case dependent it is necessary to point out that although scaling factor has an insignificant effect on the current qualitative analysis the errors between different scaling factors cannot be neglected when making quantitative analysis an experimental study may be necessary for further design of the novel anti motion structure yu et al 2017 on the other hand this study mainly focuses on the damping of anti motion structures further detailed hydrodynamic analysis such as natural oscillation period and amplitude of wave response may be carried out according to faltinsen et al faltinsen 2014 moreover in present work the jonswap spectrum is directly adopted to simulate the 100 yr sea state based on the metocean data without tuning progress although it is a common way to perform the simulations of the platforms in south china sea zhao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 we may make some fine tuning on the spectrum to improve the accuracy and adaptability of jonswap spectrum when we use it to reproduce the 100 yr or other sea states in south china sea quantitative analysis of the vortex shedding phenomenon is also interesting for further study the model can be simplified so that vortex shedding phenomenon from the corners and pores can be quantified separately like the study of carberry et al 2001 besides results show that edges of structure impact greatly on the vortex generation a detailed study of vortex generation mechanism could be carried out thus the anti motion structure proposed could be optimized zhang and ishihara 2018 in reality the damping coefficient of anti motion structure may be impacted also by other factors such as the surface roughness influence of mooring system and the coupling effect of different degrees of freedom dof to analyze the damping of anti motion structure more completely further simulations under more dof are needed such as the works of mancini et al 2018 and li et al li and zhang 2016 li and liu 2018 acknowledgements the authors would also like to

22449,due to lack of research regarding the response of a piled raft foundation under combined lateral and vertical loading an attempt has been taken in this study to analyse the influence of vertical load on the lateral response of a piled raft foundation in this study numerical analyses are carried out on the piled raft subjected to combined vertical and lateral load through 3d finite element modelling the soil profile used in this study is clayey soil underlain by a layer of sand and the effect of clay layer thickness to the embedded pile length is checked the lateral load displacement curves for the piled raft and the pile group in the piled raft system are assessed and the effect of the pile positioning on the lateral response are observed for the structural design aspect the bending moment shear force and lateral soil stress along the pile depth are estimated and the lateral load sharing between the piles and the raft are assessed prediction models are then developed for estimating the load sharing ratio p multiplier and the percent increase in the lateral capacity and the lateral soil stress keywords piled raft combined load bending moment shear force load sharing ratio p multiplier 1 introduction in the recent construction techniques piled raft foundation has become the most common foundation type for high rise buildings bridges towers and offshore structures it is a combination of conventional shallow and deep foundation and can be considered as the upgraded version of the conventional pile foundation and the raft foundation this piled raft foundation can lower the differential settlement of structure and increase its serviceability to a great extent in the piled raft foundation the raft is attached to a group of piles and the structural load is conveyed through the combined action of the pile and the raft due to this combined action the piled raft shows a complex mechanism by partial sharing of load through piles and the raft adopting this complex load transfer mechanism several researchers have considered various design parameters and proposed some design concepts for the piled raft foundation researchers have suggested various methods including simplified methods poulos and davis 1980 semi analytical methods poulos 1991 clancy and randolph 1993 and computer based numerical methods reul and randolph 2004 however in most of the previous studies only vertical load or only lateral load was considered for analysing the response of the piled raft system but the studies on the combined action of both vertical and lateral load are rather limited and the load settlement response and the load sharing behaviour of the piled raft foundation under combined lateral and vertical load are not well known practically offshore and onshore structures are often subjected to a lateral load and an overturning moment is developed which reduces the bearing capacity of the foundation system the structures may be subjected to lateral loads due to wind ship impact wave loading etc in case of onshore structures this lateral load can be 10 15 of the vertical loads and it exceeds about 30 of the vertical load in case of any coastal and offshore structure rao et al 1998 palammal and senthikumar 2018 in the past few decades the response of a pile or pile groups under vertical or lateral loading has been the topic of many research works and some interesting conclusions have also been drawn from full scale tests centrifuge model tests and numerical applications however the response of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading is relatively complex compared to the piled raft subjected to pure vertical or pure lateral loads the current practice of the design of a piled raft does not also involve the analyses of the piled raft subjected to combined loading even the studies related to the piled raft system subjected to static lateral load are also very limited hence in this study an attempt is taken to analyse the behaviour of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading the prime objectives of this study are a to analyse the influence of the vertical load on the lateral response of a piled raft foundation b to analyse the lateral load sharing behaviour of various components of a piled raft foundation subjected to combined vertical and lateral load 2 behaviour of piled raft under lateral and combined loading the behaviour of the piled raft foundation under lateral loading or combined loading is completely different from that of the pile or pile group the lateral load in the piled raft is partially shared by the piles and partially by the raft through the interface frictions the interface forces developed in the piled raft and the soil surface is shown in fig 1 although the research related to the piled raft foundation under combined loading is rather limited the available literature on the research carried out on the piled raft system considering lateral loading or combined loading are summarised in table 1 lateral loading tests data on the piled raft system was reported by pastakorn et al 2002 where the authors have conducted a series of lateral loading test at 1 g condition for the piled raft foundation a numerical study was carried by small and zhang 2002 under combined vertical and lateral loading on the piled raft system horikoshi et al 2003 have studied the performance of the piled raft system subjected to static vertical and horizontal loads and concluded that the proportion of the horizontal load carried by the raft in the piled raft was much higher than that of the pile at the early stage of loading but the proportion of load carried by the pile increased with the increase in the horizontal displacement to check the influence of the loading height on the lateral response of the piled raft matsumoto et al 2004a 2004b carried out a static horizontal loading test on the piled raft system in order to check the pile connectivity matsumoto et al 2010 have performed horizontal load tests with different pile head connections and observed that the lateral load carried by the piles in a piled raft were not influenced by the pile head connectivity but the proportion of horizontal load carried by the raft in a piled got reduced as the connection became less rigid the effect of lateral and moment load on the performance of the piled raft foundation was carried out by sawada and takemura 2014 it was found from the study that the horizontal and the moment load could generate a large settlement for a pile group but for the piled raft foundation the settlement was considerably low hamada et al 2015 conducted a series of lateral load test on the piled raft and concluded that the front piles carries more lateral load compared to the rear piles finite element analysis of a piled raft foundation under vertical and lateral loading was carried out by unsever et al 2015 and it is perceived from the study that the raft present in a piled raft carried almost 85 of the lateral load at the beginning of loading but with the increase in the lateral displacement the value got reduced to almost 30 comodromos et al 2015 have also developed a design methodology for the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading in a recent study zhu et al 2018a have performed lateral load tests on the disconnected piled rafts and concluded that the deflection and moment of pile can greatly be lowered by using disconnected piled raft in place of a rigidly connected piled raft from these limited literature it is observed that there is a lack of research regarding the combined vertical and lateral loading in the piled raft system the illustration in regard to the influence of vertical loading on the lateral response of piled raft foundation is also insufficient which is considered as the major objective of this present study moreover all the existing research was based on a single layer soil system and the effect of stratum was not incorporated in those previous studies the present study also incorporates the effect of soil stratum in the lateral response of piled raft system 3 finite element modelling 3 1 numerical model in the present study abaqus software package was used for the three dimensional finite element modelling of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading the structural interaction between the piles and the raft were considered as rigidly connected without any slipping at the interface and the soil structure interface was modelled through the slip model using the master slave concept the surface to surface concept was used to ensure the slippage and the frictional behaviour between the interfaces hung and kim 2014 kim et al 2015 modified drucker prager d p cap plasticity model with non associated flow rule was chosen to model the nonlinear stress strain behaviour of the soil element while the raft and piles were modelled as the linear elastic material the failure surface of the modified d p model is shown in fig 2 the yield surface for d p model can be expressed as 1 f α j 1 j 2 d k where j 1 is the 1st invariant of stress tensor j 2 d is the 2nd invariant of deviator stress tensor and α and k are the material constants the other details of d p model can be found in deb and pal 2019 3 2 mesh pattern and boundary condition for the mesh refinement the soil and the raft element were considered as 20 nodded hexahedral brick element c3d20r and the circular pile was modelled as a triangular prism element previous studies on finite element method revealed that the pattern of mesh and the size of elements can greatly affect the outcomes and due care should be taken while developing the finite element mesh hong et al 2003 in the present study finer mesh was applied at the vicinity of the loading area for better accuracy and comparatively coarser mesh was applied at the other places following a smooth transition from fine to coarse regarding the boundary condition all the bottom nodes of the soil continuum were restricted for any kind of translation and rotation the boundary for y z plane was set as xsimm i e the symmetry about the plane x was constant the x y plane was set as zsimm i e the symmetry about the plane z was constant in addition to this a lateral displacement was also applied in the x y plane to ensure the lateral movement of the nodes due to the effect of lateral loading condition to minimize the effect of the boundary on the stress distribution the horizontal boundary was kept six times the width of the raft 6b r and the vertical boundary was kept three times the width of the raft 3b r plus one third times the length of the pile l 3 as the loading was given quite quickly the consolidation and pore pressure change was not accounted for in this model rose et al 2013 haiderali et al 2013 the effect of strain softening on the strength behaviour of clay was also neglected as the displacements considered in the study were relatively small keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2015 kong et al 2017 the pattern of mesh applied at different elements of the piled raft and dimensions of each element are shown in fig 3 3 3 analysis outline the numerical modelling was done using different steps at the first step prior to the installation of the pile the model was first brought to an equilibrium condition under geostatic stress field or gravitational loading at the second step the pile was installed and again the model was brought to an equilibrium position by inducing the self weight in the whole model due to the complicacy in modelling the pile installation process at the beginning of the analysis the model was assumed to be in a stress free state and the influence of the pile installation was neglected after the initial two steps the loading was simulated at next two different steps in the third step vertical load was applied at the top of the raft and to check the influence of vertical loading on the lateral response of the piled raft the vertical load was selected as a fraction of ultimate vertical load capacity of the piled raft the applied vertical loads were zero 0 25v u 0 5v u 0 75v u and 0 9v u where v u is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the piled raft foundation under pure vertical loading condition in the final step a lateral displacement of 0 1d where d is the diameter of the pile was then applied at the piled raft to account the combined loading effect zormpa and comodromos 2018 the ultimate vertical load carrying capacity of the piled raft was estimated as the load corresponding to the settlement of 0 1b r where b r is the width of the raft lee and salgado 1999 cerato and lutenegger 2006 3 4 validation of the model the main criterion that needs to be fulfilled while performing any numerical modelling is to check the compatibility of the developed model with any experimental result or any other numerical model for a better degree of accuracy in this study the numerical model made in abaqus was validated in two ways at the first stage the results of the numerical model was compared with a small scaled laboratory model test and in the second stage it was compared with a published work on numerical analysis carried out by small and zhang 2002 the details for both the processes are described elaborately in the following sub sections 3 4 1 case 1 experimental study to evaluate the lateral response of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading one small scale laboratory test setup was fabricated to simulate the laboratory model with the numerical model a scaling factor λ 100 was used while choosing the dimensions of the laboratory model test set up a mimic of this scaled laboratory model was then modelled in the numerical study to check the consistency in the results obtained from both the experimental and numerical analyses the test set up includes a test tank loading frame model piles and raft etc where the vertical load was applied with a hydraulic jack and the lateral load was applied through a winch and wire rope the test tank was made up of thick translucent perspex sheet and steel plates mild steel plates of square cross section were used in this study to make the raft the model piles were circular in shape and made up of steel having diameters of 10 mm and length of 300 mm to measure the applied vertical load a calibrated load cell of 30 kn capacity was used whereas the lateral load was measured through a calibrated 2 kn load cell attached with the wire rope the corresponding vertical and lateral displacements were calculated using the lvdts attached in vertical and horizontal direction respectively in sub soil profile clay was on the top followed by a layer of sand according to the standard techniques described in astm codes the index properties of the top sub soil layer i e clay sample were found as liquid limit 46 plastic limit 23 6 and plasticity index 22 4 as per the unified soil classification system uscs the clay sample is classified as low plasticity clay cl the undrained shear strength of clay sample at 35 water content was found to be 10 kpa and corresponding bulk density and angle of internal friction was obtained around 17 5 kn m3 and 100 respectively clean dry sand was used as the bottom soil layer in the model test the sand sample is classified as poorly graded sand sp as per the unified soil classification system uscs and the value of placement dry density of sand corresponding to the relative density of 70 was found to be 15 80 kn m3 the physical and engineering properties of dry sand sample are presented in table 2 the soil bed was prepared following the method described by deb and pal 2019 the lateral load test was performed under a vertical load of v 0 0 5v u and 0 9v u the comparison of the laboratory data obtained from horizontal load test are compared with the developed numerical model and plotted in fig 4 the lateral load displacement curve confirms that the numerical results are very much similar with the results obtained from the experimental test data 3 4 2 case 2 numerical study the finite element model developed by small and zhang 2002 was used as the reference model in this study to validate the numerical model a similar numerical model was used in this study having 3 3 circular pile group under the raft a quarter of the piled raft was modelled here due to the symmetric geometry of the piled raft the soil and piles were modelled through a 20 nodded solid isoperimetric element and the raft was modelled using eight nodded shell element 18 unit concentrated lateral load was applied on the pile head having spacing to diameter ratio of 3 the bending moment at corner pile pile 1 and center pile pile 5 was evaluated and compared with the cited literature fig 5 is showing the comparison of the reference numerical model and the model developed in the present study the figure depicts that the model developed in this study shows a good agreement with reported results both the comparison curves figs 4 and 5 confirm the legitimacy of the developed numerical model 3 5 model configuration and parametric study the model piled raft foundation was consisted of a soil continuum and a group of pile supported by a model raft a 5 5 pile group with 25 nos of circular pile was attached to a square sized raft as shown in fig 3 the soil continuum was consisted of two layers viz clay at the top layer following by a layer of sand to check the effect of the clay layer the thickness of the top layer was changed keeping t l 0 5 1 1 5 where t is the thickness of clay layer and l is the length of pile the properties of soil and pile raft used for fe analysis are presented in table 3 three different type of spacing to diameter ratio s d ratio such as s d 3 5 and 7 was also selected to check the effect of spacing on the lateral load response the detail program for the model configuration and parametric study is presented in table 4 4 analysis of results 4 1 pure vertical load tests on piled raft all the models are first tested under pure vertical loading independent of any lateral load and the load settlement response of the piled raft is obtained from this load settlement responses the ultimate load carrying capacity under pure vertical loading v u is then acquired for each model at a settlement of 10 of the raft width fig 6 is showing the vertical load settlement curves for the piled raft at different s d ratio and different t l ratio it is perceived from the figure that the applied load varies nonlinearly with the settlement of the piled raft under pure vertical loading condition the load carrying capacity of the piled raft gets slightly increased with the increase in s d ratio for all the cases however with the increase of the ratio of clay layer thickness to pile length t l ratio the load carrying capacity is gradually decreased in this study two layers of soil were taken keeping clay in the top layer and sand at the bottom layer the increase in t l ratio indicates the increase of thickness of the clay layer and the pile completely rests on the clay layer when the t l ratio is more than 1 if the pile rests in the clay layer the frictional resistance gets reduced as compared to the piles rested in the sand layer this is why the increasing t l ratio tends to decrease the ultimate load carrying capacity of the piled raft 4 2 effect of vertical load in lateral response of piled raft the lateral load test was carried out on different piled raft system by changing the amount of the vertical load to check the effect of the vertical load on the lateral response of the piled raft system the thickness of the clay layer t was alternatively changed to check the effect of layer thickness to the embedded length ratio t l see section 3 5 the change in the maximum lateral load of the piled raft under pure lateral load test at various t l ratios is presented in fig 7 and it is observed from the figure that the maximum lateral load decreases with the increase in the t l ratio at t l ratio of 0 5 the half portion of the pile is rested in the clay layer and the other half is rested in the sand layer and when the lateral load is applied to the piled raft the sand layer offers higher friction and higher soil resistance in the pile surface compared to the clay layer due to this increased pile soil friction and improved soil resistance the lateral resistance of the piled raft increases and hence the lateral load capacity also gets enhanced however at t l ratio of 1 only the bottom surface of the pile is resting in the sand layer and the pile soil friction also develops only at the bottom surface which is much lower than the friction develops at pile s periphery this is why the lateral capacity decreases with the increase in the t l ratio fig 8 is showing the variation of lateral load capacity for the piled raft when t l is 0 5 from the figure it can be seen that the lateral load carried by the piled raft continues to increase with the increase in the vertical loading on the raft this increase in the lateral load can be attributed to the increase in confining pressure in the soil due to the presence of the vertical load when the vertical load is applied on the top of the raft the soil below the raft gets confined which increases the confining stress in the surrounding soil and consequently the lateral load capacity gets enhanced a similar trend of variation is also observed in case of t l 1 however in fig 9 when t l is 1 5 a different trend is obtained compared to the above two cases where the lateral load capacity first increases and then decreases with the increase on the vertical load the reason may be ascribed as the effect of the thickness of clay layer because at t l 1 5 the piled raft completely rests on the clay layer there is a substantial increase in the lateral load subjected to vertical loads up to 0 5v u and after that there is a continuous reduction in the lateral load capacity this reduction in lateral load may be attributed to the early failure of the pile soil interface under the action of vertical load if the interface between the pile and the surrounding soil fails the further lateral deformation in the pile group will not affect the lateral soil stress and hence the lateral soil stress in the soils surrounding the pile group will not increase significantly which will result in a considerable decrease in the lateral load capacity of the pile group present in the piled raft moreover the plasticity model used in this study considers the yield surface as a perfectly plastic yield surface and any change of stress on the yield surface cause plastic deformation as the elasticity of clay is much lower compared to sand the recovery from failure becomes very less and the plastic failure of pile soil interface in clay layer occurs much faster than that of sand layer due to this reason in the case of t l 1 5 the total lateral load capacity of the piled raft will also decrease with the higher amount of vertical load 4 3 effect of pile spacing on lateral response of piled raft the spacing between two piles becomes an important factor while considering the response of any group pile or any piled raft the group interaction among the piles is a function of the pile spacing and this interaction significantly varies for closely spaced pile group or for the pile group with higher spacing fig 10 is showing the variation of lateral load for the piled raft under pure lateral loading at various spacing diameter s d ratios the figure depicts that the lateral load capacity for the piled raft increases with s d ratio the increase in lateral load capacity can be attributed to the pile pile interaction among the pile group under the raft for closely spaced piles due to the action of the external load the developed stress field for each pile overlap each other and the resisting zone behind the pile becomes very small when the spacing between the piles are increased the overlapping stress field becomes insignificant due to the reduction in the group interaction effect and the resisting zone behind the piles becomes larger which enhance the lateral load capacity of the piled raft there is almost 6 12 increase in the lateral load capacity when the s d is changed from 3 to 5 where the lateral load increased by 15 22 by changing s d from 3 to 7 4 4 effect of pile position on the lateral load capacity of pile group in a piled raft when the lateral load is applied on a pile group or a piled raft the piles present in the different row will show different lateral load capacity depending upon the loading direction in this study 25 piles are divided in 5 rows having 5 numbers of piles in each row the lateral load carried by each pile in a particular row is evaluated and the mean of their value is reported as the lateral load capacity of that row fig 11 is showing the lateral load displacement curves for different rows under pure lateral load for s d of 5 and t l ratio of 0 5 it is clear from the figure that the lateral load capacity subsequently decreases from row 1 to row 5 i e the front pile or the row 1 is carrying the maximum amount of lateral load whereas the rear row or row 5 is taking the least amount of lateral load when the lateral load is applied in the piled raft the stress field generated surrounding the front pile is much higher than the rear pile due to this increased stress field the piles resistance to the lateral load increases and hence the front row takes higher load compared to the successive rows the same variation has been observed for all cases under different vertical loadings during combined loading case before applying the lateral load the corner piles and edge piles takes almost same vertical load and the load carried by each corner edge pile is comparatively higher than the centre pile but after applying the lateral load the vertical load tends to increase in the front pile while the vertical load gets decreased at the rear pile due to the increase and the decrease in the soil confinement under the front and rear pile respectively comparing all the configurations it has been observed that the front row piles carry about 30 37 of the total lateral load of the pile group in the piled raft whereas the rearmost row carries 8 15 of the total lateral load 4 5 lateral load sharing between raft and pile piled raft system shows a different load transfer mechanism compared to the individual raft and the pile group and it is accomplished by partial sharing of load by both the raft and the pile group attached to the piled raft system some proportion of the load is shared by the raft and rest of the load is shared by the pile this complex load sharing nature can be assessed by evaluating the load sharing ratio between the piles and the raft the lateral load sharing ratio α p can be defined as the proportion of the lateral load carried by the piles to the total lateral load carried by the piled raft and is given by 2 α p l p l p r l p l r l p 1 l r l p r where l p r is the lateral load carried by the piled raft and l r and l p are lateral load carried by the raft and piles respectively fig 12 is showing the proportion of the lateral load carried by the pile group and the raft in a piled raft system initially at the early stage of lateral loading the raft takes more loads compared to the pile group present in the piled raft but the proportion of load carried by the raft continues to decrease with the increase in the lateral displacement as the raft transfers the load to the pile group after some period of loading the load shared by the piles becomes more than the load shared by the raft at this stage the proportion of lateral load shared by the raft is lower than that of the pile group in the piled raft the same has been evaluated for all the piled raft configurations used in this study and a similar variation is observed for all the cases the raft carries almost 30 48 of lateral load at a displacement of 0 1d whereas the load carried by the pile group present in the piled raft varies between 52 and 70 the effect of the combined loading action on the load sharing ratio is also checked and is presented in fig 13 it is observed from the results that the lateral load sharing ratio for piles reduces with the increase in the vertical load this trend of reduction suggests that the proportion of lateral load carried by the raft increases with the increase in the vertical loading i e if the external vertical load is increased the major portion of the lateral load will be shared by the raft itself and the transmission of lateral load from the raft to the piles will be very less so it can be précised as the lateral load sharing ratio decreases with the increase in the vertical loading the effect of t l ratio and s d ratio on the load sharing ratio is not reasonably significant as the variation in α p ranges within 3 8 however in all the cases it has been observed that there exist a nonlinear relationship between lateral load sharing ratio and normalized lateral displacement to idealize this nonlinear response under pure lateral loading case a logarithmic relation is chosen to formulate the general expression and is given as 3 α p a b ln y d where a and b are empirical constants in fig 14 all the results of pure lateral loading case are collaborated together and a single curve is generated to express the general trend of load sharing ratio with the normalized lateral displacement the figure shows a very good agreement between the calculated results and the projected expression giving the values of constant terms as a 0 88 and b 0 11 the results obtained using the developed equation is compared with the calculated results and it is observed that there exist a very good correlation r2 0 95 between the calculated and the predicted results with a standard error of 0 12 this equation can be directly used to predict the load sharing ratio of piled raft system subjected to lateral load 4 6 effect of vertical load on lateral soil stress the lateral soil stress is evaluated in front and along the depth of each pile in the front row and their mean value is calculated to estimate the stress generated in the sub soil the lateral soil stress is evaluated for each cases and the variation of lateral soil stress under various vertical loads at various t l ratio are represented in fig 15 in both the cases of t l 0 5 and t l 1 the lateral soil stress increases with the increase in the vertical load due to the increase in the confining stress along the pile fig 15 a and b when the external vertical load increases due to the vertical settlement of the piled raft the soil below the raft gets more confined and the confining stress in the surrounding soil gets increased which increases the lateral stress in the soil surrounding the pile however in the case of t l 1 5 the lateral soil stress decreases at higher vertical load levels fig 15 c it is noteworthy to mention that in this case the piled raft system completely rests on the clay layer and the reason in the reduction in lateral soil stress may be attributed to the early failure of the pile soil interface under the action of vertical loading because the plastic failure of pile soil interface in clay layer occurs much faster than that of sand layer once this pile soil interface fails regardless the pile deflection and pile configuration the lateral soil stress along the pile will not increase while comparing the change of lateral soil stress for different s d ratio it is obtained from all the results that the lateral soil stress increases with the increase in the pile spacing irrespective of t l ratio however the percent change in the lateral soil stress at various s d ratios is quite small and ranges within 3 10 4 7 evaluation of bending moment in pile group present in the piled raft during the design of a pile subjected to lateral loads the most critical phase is the proper estimation of the bending moment acting on the pile the bending moment developed in the piles attached to a piled raft is slightly different from that of the free standing pile group when the lateral load is applied on the raft due to the rigid connection between the pile group and the raft the piles bend from the top and a negative bending moment generates at the pile head according to hazzar et al 2017 the bending moment m in the piles can be calculated as 4 m e p i p δ ε d where e p is the modulus of elasticity of pile i p is the moment of inertia of pile δε is the difference between tensile and compressive strain and d is the diameter of the pile the bending moment developed in the pile depends up on the position of the pile in the piled raft it has already shown that the front row pile takes comparatively more load than the successive rows and in the case of bending moment the similar trend has been observed the bending moment for each pile in a particular row is evaluated and the mean value is used to show the bending moment of that row the variation of bending moment in the piles at different row and the influence of vertical loading on the bending moment are shown in fig 16 it is clear from the figure that the maximum negative bending moment generates at the pile head and the maximum positive bending moment generates at a depth of 0 33l 0 5l from the pile head the front row i e the row 1 shows the highest moment among all the rows whereas the rear row or the row 5 shows the least bending moment in the intermediate rows i e row 2 to row 4 the bending moment continuously decrease by moving towards the successive rows but the change in the bending moments are quite less for all the configurations it has seen that the change in the bending moment for front row and rear row is in the range of 8 15 the figure also depicts that with the increase in vertical loading bending moment also tends to increase irrespective of the pile position due to the increase in the vertical loading the lateral load capacity also increases which increases the bending moment in the piles it is observed that the variation of bending moment increased is by 1 07 times when the applied vertical load is 0 9v u as compared to the pure lateral case 4 8 evaluation of shear force developed along the piles the shear force developed in the pile along its depth can be measured by dividing the difference of two sectional bending moments by the distance between that two sections hamada et al 2015 and it can be represented as 5 s f d m d z where m is the bending moment and z is the depth of the pile in this study the equation for bending moment was identified using curve fitting method and the shear force is obtained by differentiating the equation of the moment fig 17 is showing the variation of shear force in the piles presented in different rows and the variation of shear force under the combined action of lateral and various vertical loads similar to moment distribution the shear force developed at the front pile row 1 is much higher than the rear pile row 5 the maximum shear force develops at the pile head and gradually decreases with the increase in the pile depth the piles shear force becomes zero at a depth of 0 33 0 5 times of the pile length and afterwards the shear force becomes negative with the increase in the vertical loading the shear force in the pile tends to increase irrespective of the position of pile in the group the variation in shear force is quite similar to the abovementioned behaviour of bending moment of the piles the variation in the shear force in front and rear row pile ranges within 30 42 and due to the effect of the vertical loading the shear force increases 1 1 to 1 3 times the shear force under pure lateral load when the applied vertical load is 0 9v u 5 percent increase in lateral load capacity and lateral soil stress the percentage increase in the lateral load capacity and the percentage increase in the lateral soil stress are evaluated to check the effect of vertical loading on the lateral response the percent increase in the lateral load capacity under the presence of vertical load can be defined as 6 i l v l w v l n v l n v 100 where ilv is the percentage increase in the lateral load capacity under vertical load l wv is the lateral load capacity with the vertical load and l nv is the lateral load capacity with no vertical load i e without any vertical load or pure lateral load the percent increase in the lateral soil stress under the action of vertical load can be defined as 7 i l s v l s w v l s n v l s n v 100 where ilsv is the percentage increase in the lateral soil stress under vertical load ls wv is the lateral soil stress with the vertical load and ls nv is the lateral soil stress without any vertical load fig 18 and fig 19 are showing the percent increase in the lateral load capacity and the lateral soil stress for different vertical loads at various t l ratios both ilv and ilsv show a similar trend where the values increase with the increase of vertical load on the top of the raft i e the vertical load has a positive impact on ilv and ilsv but while considering the effect of t l ratio for both the cases it shows a positive impact up to v 0 5vu and then shows a negative impact i e the lateral load capacity decreases for v 0 75vu and v 0 9vu compared to the pure lateral load case however from the results it has been seen that the effect of spacing to diameter ratio s d ratio on both ilv and ilsv is quite low and hence the effect of s d ratio can be neglected once this ilv and ilsv is estimated the percent change in the lateral load capacity and lateral soil stress due to the effect of vertical loading can easily be identified the statistical analysis has also been carried out to check the effect and the contribution of the design variables on ilv and ilsv analysis of variance anova technique is used in the study at a confidence level of 95 in order to check the relative contributions however it is found form anova test that the selected hypotheses for s d ratio failed in both the cases as the p value or the significance is greater than 0 05 and hence its effect on ilv and ilsv is ignored the regression analysis is then performed to predict the ilv and ilsv based on t l ratio and percentage of vertical load the predicted equations for both ilv and ilsv are expressed in eq 8 and eq 9 respectively the parameter estimates for both the equations are presented in table 5 and table 6 the contour plot for ilv and ilsv with t l ratio and vertical load are shown in fig 20 8 i l v 33 2 104 76 v v u 98 8 t l 41 85 t l 2 92 24 v v u t l 9 i l s v 23 43 76 86 v v u 47 4 t l 15 45 t l 2 68 24 v v u t l 6 prediction of p multiplier for piled raft and pile group in piled raft to understand the response of a group pile from the behaviour of a single pile p multiplier concept was introduced several researchers have identified this p multiplier for various group piles under various design considerations zhu et al 2018b studies are also carried out to modify the existing expressions of p multiplier for better understanding the response of the group pile rollins et al 1998 have developed one predictive model for p multiplier considering different s d ratio zhu et al 2018b have included various design parameters like s d ratio z d ratio etc and proposed another modified model for p multiplier however for a piled raft system although its mechanism is quite different from that of the single pile there is a lack of research regarding the application of p multiplier concept in this study an attempt is taken to idealize the response of a piled raft and the pile group present in the piled raft using the concept of p multiplier the calculation for obtaining p multiplier includes the following expressions 10 p m p r l p r l s 11 p m g p p r l g p p r l s where p m p r and p m g p p r are the p multipliers for the piled raft and the pile group present in the piled raft respectively l p r and l g p p r are the lateral load carried by the piled raft and the pile group present in the piled raft respectively and l s is the lateral load carried by the single pile the p multiplier was calculated for different configuration under pure lateral load condition the variation of p multiplier for piled raft and pile group in the piled raft for different s d ratio and t l ratio is presented in table 7 modified models are then selected for evaluating p multiplier and are expressed as 12 p m p r 1 067 0 045 s d 0 123 t l 13 p m g p p r 0 63 0 027 s d 0 083 t l as the modified model is predicted using the mean values only it is important to know the range of the coefficients involved in predicting the individual values fig 21 and fig 22 are showing the upper bound and lower bound range of the predicted values for p multiplier considering the limits of the upper bound and lower bound in both the figures it is observed that the p multiplier for the piled raft will be in the range of 1 23 1 65 whereas the p multiplier for pile group in piled raft will lie between 0 67 and 1 08 7 conclusion due to the lack of research in the field of the piled raft foundation subjected to combined loading an attempt has been taken in this paper to conduct a widespread research on the piled raft foundation under combined loading to understand the response of the piled raft under combined loading 3d finite element method was selected and a series of numerical test has been performed on the piled raft foundation under the combined action of vertical and lateral loading the conclusions that can be derived from the numerical analyses are pointed below 1 the vertical load applied on the piled raft system has an important significance on the lateral load capacity of the piled raft the lateral load capacity of the piled raft foundation increases with the increase of vertical load up to a t l ratio of 1 whereas at t l ratio of 1 5 the lateral load capacity first increases and then decreases 2 due to the reduction in group interaction effect the lateral load capacity of the piled raft increases with the increase in the spacing between the piles in the piled raft the lateral load capacity increases about 6 12 when the s d is changed from 3 to 5 whereas the lateral load increases about 15 22 by changing s d from 3 to 7 3 when the combined loading action is applied on the piled raft the presence of vertical load increases the confining pressure in the soil which increases the lateral soil stress along the piles in the piled raft 4 during the combined loading case the shear force and bending moment tend to increase with the increase in the vertical loading a negative bending moment gets generated at the pile head whereas a positive bending moment is generated at a depth of 0 33 0 5 times the length of the pile considering the piles in the piled raft the highest bending moment and shear force is taken by the front row pile whereas the rear pile takes the least bending moment and shear force 5 the raft has an important part in sharing and transmitting the applied lateral load on the piled raft foundation at the starting of loading the raft carries the maximum load and with the increase of lateral displacement the percentage of load shared by the raft continues to decrease whereas the load carried by the piles continues to increase due to the effect of vertical loading the lateral load sharing ratio continues to decrease with the increase in the amount of vertical load 6 the percent change in lateral load capacity and lateral soil stress are evaluated and prediction models are derived to evaluate ilv and ilsv the vertical load has a positive impact on ilv and ilsv for t l ratio of 0 5 and 1 whereas at t l ratio of 1 5 the vertical load shows a positive impact up to v 0 5v u and then shows a negative effect 7 the variation of p multiplier is not same for every case and largely depends up on s d ratio and t l ratio p multiplier for the piled raft and pile group present in the piled raft are also evaluated and a prediction model is developed to idealize the response of the piled raft and pile group in piled raft from the response of a single pile 8 from the overall analyses of the piled raft subjected to the combined vertical and lateral loads it can be concluded that the vertical load plays an important role to uphold the lateral response of the piled raft and the behaviour of the piled raft foundation under pure lateral load and combined load are not same adopting this principle the current design practices for the piled raft foundation should be upgraded considering the combined action of vertical and lateral loading appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 appendix a supplementary data

22449,due to lack of research regarding the response of a piled raft foundation under combined lateral and vertical loading an attempt has been taken in this study to analyse the influence of vertical load on the lateral response of a piled raft foundation in this study numerical analyses are carried out on the piled raft subjected to combined vertical and lateral load through 3d finite element modelling the soil profile used in this study is clayey soil underlain by a layer of sand and the effect of clay layer thickness to the embedded pile length is checked the lateral load displacement curves for the piled raft and the pile group in the piled raft system are assessed and the effect of the pile positioning on the lateral response are observed for the structural design aspect the bending moment shear force and lateral soil stress along the pile depth are estimated and the lateral load sharing between the piles and the raft are assessed prediction models are then developed for estimating the load sharing ratio p multiplier and the percent increase in the lateral capacity and the lateral soil stress keywords piled raft combined load bending moment shear force load sharing ratio p multiplier 1 introduction in the recent construction techniques piled raft foundation has become the most common foundation type for high rise buildings bridges towers and offshore structures it is a combination of conventional shallow and deep foundation and can be considered as the upgraded version of the conventional pile foundation and the raft foundation this piled raft foundation can lower the differential settlement of structure and increase its serviceability to a great extent in the piled raft foundation the raft is attached to a group of piles and the structural load is conveyed through the combined action of the pile and the raft due to this combined action the piled raft shows a complex mechanism by partial sharing of load through piles and the raft adopting this complex load transfer mechanism several researchers have considered various design parameters and proposed some design concepts for the piled raft foundation researchers have suggested various methods including simplified methods poulos and davis 1980 semi analytical methods poulos 1991 clancy and randolph 1993 and computer based numerical methods reul and randolph 2004 however in most of the previous studies only vertical load or only lateral load was considered for analysing the response of the piled raft system but the studies on the combined action of both vertical and lateral load are rather limited and the load settlement response and the load sharing behaviour of the piled raft foundation under combined lateral and vertical load are not well known practically offshore and onshore structures are often subjected to a lateral load and an overturning moment is developed which reduces the bearing capacity of the foundation system the structures may be subjected to lateral loads due to wind ship impact wave loading etc in case of onshore structures this lateral load can be 10 15 of the vertical loads and it exceeds about 30 of the vertical load in case of any coastal and offshore structure rao et al 1998 palammal and senthikumar 2018 in the past few decades the response of a pile or pile groups under vertical or lateral loading has been the topic of many research works and some interesting conclusions have also been drawn from full scale tests centrifuge model tests and numerical applications however the response of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading is relatively complex compared to the piled raft subjected to pure vertical or pure lateral loads the current practice of the design of a piled raft does not also involve the analyses of the piled raft subjected to combined loading even the studies related to the piled raft system subjected to static lateral load are also very limited hence in this study an attempt is taken to analyse the behaviour of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading the prime objectives of this study are a to analyse the influence of the vertical load on the lateral response of a piled raft foundation b to analyse the lateral load sharing behaviour of various components of a piled raft foundation subjected to combined vertical and lateral load 2 behaviour of piled raft under lateral and combined loading the behaviour of the piled raft foundation under lateral loading or combined loading is completely different from that of the pile or pile group the lateral load in the piled raft is partially shared by the piles and partially by the raft through the interface frictions the interface forces developed in the piled raft and the soil surface is shown in fig 1 although the research related to the piled raft foundation under combined loading is rather limited the available literature on the research carried out on the piled raft system considering lateral loading or combined loading are summarised in table 1 lateral loading tests data on the piled raft system was reported by pastakorn et al 2002 where the authors have conducted a series of lateral loading test at 1 g condition for the piled raft foundation a numerical study was carried by small and zhang 2002 under combined vertical and lateral loading on the piled raft system horikoshi et al 2003 have studied the performance of the piled raft system subjected to static vertical and horizontal loads and concluded that the proportion of the horizontal load carried by the raft in the piled raft was much higher than that of the pile at the early stage of loading but the proportion of load carried by the pile increased with the increase in the horizontal displacement to check the influence of the loading height on the lateral response of the piled raft matsumoto et al 2004a 2004b carried out a static horizontal loading test on the piled raft system in order to check the pile connectivity matsumoto et al 2010 have performed horizontal load tests with different pile head connections and observed that the lateral load carried by the piles in a piled raft were not influenced by the pile head connectivity but the proportion of horizontal load carried by the raft in a piled got reduced as the connection became less rigid the effect of lateral and moment load on the performance of the piled raft foundation was carried out by sawada and takemura 2014 it was found from the study that the horizontal and the moment load could generate a large settlement for a pile group but for the piled raft foundation the settlement was considerably low hamada et al 2015 conducted a series of lateral load test on the piled raft and concluded that the front piles carries more lateral load compared to the rear piles finite element analysis of a piled raft foundation under vertical and lateral loading was carried out by unsever et al 2015 and it is perceived from the study that the raft present in a piled raft carried almost 85 of the lateral load at the beginning of loading but with the increase in the lateral displacement the value got reduced to almost 30 comodromos et al 2015 have also developed a design methodology for the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading in a recent study zhu et al 2018a have performed lateral load tests on the disconnected piled rafts and concluded that the deflection and moment of pile can greatly be lowered by using disconnected piled raft in place of a rigidly connected piled raft from these limited literature it is observed that there is a lack of research regarding the combined vertical and lateral loading in the piled raft system the illustration in regard to the influence of vertical loading on the lateral response of piled raft foundation is also insufficient which is considered as the major objective of this present study moreover all the existing research was based on a single layer soil system and the effect of stratum was not incorporated in those previous studies the present study also incorporates the effect of soil stratum in the lateral response of piled raft system 3 finite element modelling 3 1 numerical model in the present study abaqus software package was used for the three dimensional finite element modelling of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading the structural interaction between the piles and the raft were considered as rigidly connected without any slipping at the interface and the soil structure interface was modelled through the slip model using the master slave concept the surface to surface concept was used to ensure the slippage and the frictional behaviour between the interfaces hung and kim 2014 kim et al 2015 modified drucker prager d p cap plasticity model with non associated flow rule was chosen to model the nonlinear stress strain behaviour of the soil element while the raft and piles were modelled as the linear elastic material the failure surface of the modified d p model is shown in fig 2 the yield surface for d p model can be expressed as 1 f α j 1 j 2 d k where j 1 is the 1st invariant of stress tensor j 2 d is the 2nd invariant of deviator stress tensor and α and k are the material constants the other details of d p model can be found in deb and pal 2019 3 2 mesh pattern and boundary condition for the mesh refinement the soil and the raft element were considered as 20 nodded hexahedral brick element c3d20r and the circular pile was modelled as a triangular prism element previous studies on finite element method revealed that the pattern of mesh and the size of elements can greatly affect the outcomes and due care should be taken while developing the finite element mesh hong et al 2003 in the present study finer mesh was applied at the vicinity of the loading area for better accuracy and comparatively coarser mesh was applied at the other places following a smooth transition from fine to coarse regarding the boundary condition all the bottom nodes of the soil continuum were restricted for any kind of translation and rotation the boundary for y z plane was set as xsimm i e the symmetry about the plane x was constant the x y plane was set as zsimm i e the symmetry about the plane z was constant in addition to this a lateral displacement was also applied in the x y plane to ensure the lateral movement of the nodes due to the effect of lateral loading condition to minimize the effect of the boundary on the stress distribution the horizontal boundary was kept six times the width of the raft 6b r and the vertical boundary was kept three times the width of the raft 3b r plus one third times the length of the pile l 3 as the loading was given quite quickly the consolidation and pore pressure change was not accounted for in this model rose et al 2013 haiderali et al 2013 the effect of strain softening on the strength behaviour of clay was also neglected as the displacements considered in the study were relatively small keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2015 kong et al 2017 the pattern of mesh applied at different elements of the piled raft and dimensions of each element are shown in fig 3 3 3 analysis outline the numerical modelling was done using different steps at the first step prior to the installation of the pile the model was first brought to an equilibrium condition under geostatic stress field or gravitational loading at the second step the pile was installed and again the model was brought to an equilibrium position by inducing the self weight in the whole model due to the complicacy in modelling the pile installation process at the beginning of the analysis the model was assumed to be in a stress free state and the influence of the pile installation was neglected after the initial two steps the loading was simulated at next two different steps in the third step vertical load was applied at the top of the raft and to check the influence of vertical loading on the lateral response of the piled raft the vertical load was selected as a fraction of ultimate vertical load capacity of the piled raft the applied vertical loads were zero 0 25v u 0 5v u 0 75v u and 0 9v u where v u is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the piled raft foundation under pure vertical loading condition in the final step a lateral displacement of 0 1d where d is the diameter of the pile was then applied at the piled raft to account the combined loading effect zormpa and comodromos 2018 the ultimate vertical load carrying capacity of the piled raft was estimated as the load corresponding to the settlement of 0 1b r where b r is the width of the raft lee and salgado 1999 cerato and lutenegger 2006 3 4 validation of the model the main criterion that needs to be fulfilled while performing any numerical modelling is to check the compatibility of the developed model with any experimental result or any other numerical model for a better degree of accuracy in this study the numerical model made in abaqus was validated in two ways at the first stage the results of the numerical model was compared with a small scaled laboratory model test and in the second stage it was compared with a published work on numerical analysis carried out by small and zhang 2002 the details for both the processes are described elaborately in the following sub sections 3 4 1 case 1 experimental study to evaluate the lateral response of the piled raft foundation under combined vertical and lateral loading one small scale laboratory test setup was fabricated to simulate the laboratory model with the numerical model a scaling factor λ 100 was used while choosing the dimensions of the laboratory model test set up a mimic of this scaled laboratory model was then modelled in the numerical study to check the consistency in the results obtained from both the experimental and numerical analyses the test set up includes a test tank loading frame model piles and raft etc where the vertical load was applied with a hydraulic jack and the lateral load was applied through a winch and wire rope the test tank was made up of thick translucent perspex sheet and steel plates mild steel plates of square cross section were used in this study to make the raft the model piles were circular in shape and made up of steel having diameters of 10 mm and length of 300 mm to measure the applied vertical load a calibrated load cell of 30 kn capacity was used whereas the lateral load was measured through a calibrated 2 kn load cell attached with the wire rope the corresponding vertical and lateral displacements were calculated using the lvdts attached in vertical and horizontal direction respectively in sub soil profile clay was on the top followed by a layer of sand according to the standard techniques described in astm codes the index properties of the top sub soil layer i e clay sample were found as liquid limit 46 plastic limit 23 6 and plasticity index 22 4 as per the unified soil classification system uscs the clay sample is classified as low plasticity clay cl the undrained shear strength of clay sample at 35 water content was found to be 10 kpa and corresponding bulk density and angle of internal friction was obtained around 17 5 kn m3 and 100 respectively clean dry sand was used as the bottom soil layer in the model test the sand sample is classified as poorly graded sand sp as per the unified soil classification system uscs and the value of placement dry density of sand corresponding to the relative density of 70 was found to be 15 80 kn m3 the physical and engineering properties of dry sand sample are presented in table 2 the soil bed was prepared following the method described by deb and pal 2019 the lateral load test was performed under a vertical load of v 0 0 5v u and 0 9v u the comparison of the laboratory data obtained from horizontal load test are compared with the developed numerical model and plotted in fig 4 the lateral load displacement curve confirms that the numerical results are very much similar with the results obtained from the experimental test data 3 4 2 case 2 numerical study the finite element model developed by small and zhang 2002 was used as the reference model in this study to validate the numerical model a similar numerical model was used in this study having 3 3 circular pile group under the raft a quarter of the piled raft was modelled here due to the symmetric geometry of the piled raft the soil and piles were modelled through a 20 nodded solid isoperimetric element and the raft was modelled using eight nodded shell element 18 unit concentrated lateral load was applied on the pile head having spacing to diameter ratio of 3 the bending moment at corner pile pile 1 and center pile pile 5 was evaluated and compared with the cited literature fig 5 is showing the comparison of the reference numerical model and the model developed in the present study the figure depicts that the model developed in this study shows a good agreement with reported results both the comparison curves figs 4 and 5 confirm the legitimacy of the developed numerical model 3 5 model configuration and parametric study the model piled raft foundation was consisted of a soil continuum and a group of pile supported by a model raft a 5 5 pile group with 25 nos of circular pile was attached to a square sized raft as shown in fig 3 the soil continuum was consisted of two layers viz clay at the top layer following by a layer of sand to check the effect of the clay layer the thickness of the top layer was changed keeping t l 0 5 1 1 5 where t is the thickness of clay layer and l is the length of pile the properties of soil and pile raft used for fe analysis are presented in table 3 three different type of spacing to diameter ratio s d ratio such as s d 3 5 and 7 was also selected to check the effect of spacing on the lateral load response the detail program for the model configuration and parametric study is presented in table 4 4 analysis of results 4 1 pure vertical load tests on piled raft all the models are first tested under pure vertical loading independent of any lateral load and the load settlement response of the piled raft is obtained from this load settlement responses the ultimate load carrying capacity under pure vertical loading v u is then acquired for each model at a settlement of 10 of the raft width fig 6 is showing the vertical load settlement curves for the piled raft at different s d ratio and different t l ratio it is perceived from the figure that the applied load varies nonlinearly with the settlement of the piled raft under pure vertical loading condition the load carrying capacity of the piled raft gets slightly increased with the increase in s d ratio for all the cases however with the increase of the ratio of clay layer thickness to pile length t l ratio the load carrying capacity is gradually decreased in this study two layers of soil were taken keeping clay in the top layer and sand at the bottom layer the increase in t l ratio indicates the increase of thickness of the clay layer and the pile completely rests on the clay layer when the t l ratio is more than 1 if the pile rests in the clay layer the frictional resistance gets reduced as compared to the piles rested in the sand layer this is why the increasing t l ratio tends to decrease the ultimate load carrying capacity of the piled raft 4 2 effect of vertical load in lateral response of piled raft the lateral load test was carried out on different piled raft system by changing the amount of the vertical load to check the effect of the vertical load on the lateral response of the piled raft system the thickness of the clay layer t was alternatively changed to check the effect of layer thickness to the embedded length ratio t l see section 3 5 the change in the maximum lateral load of the piled raft under pure lateral load test at various t l ratios is presented in fig 7 and it is observed from the figure that the maximum lateral load decreases with the increase in the t l ratio at t l ratio of 0 5 the half portion of the pile is rested in the clay layer and the other half is rested in the sand layer and when the lateral load is applied to the piled raft the sand layer offers higher friction and higher soil resistance in the pile surface compared to the clay layer due to this increased pile soil friction and improved soil resistance the lateral resistance of the piled raft increases and hence the lateral load capacity also gets enhanced however at t l ratio of 1 only the bottom surface of the pile is resting in the sand layer and the pile soil friction also develops only at the bottom surface which is much lower than the friction develops at pile s periphery this is why the lateral capacity decreases with the increase in the t l ratio fig 8 is showing the variation of lateral load capacity for the piled raft when t l is 0 5 from the figure it can be seen that the lateral load carried by the piled raft continues to increase with the increase in the vertical loading on the raft this increase in the lateral load can be attributed to the increase in confining pressure in the soil due to the presence of the vertical load when the vertical load is applied on the top of the raft the soil below the raft gets confined which increases the confining stress in the surrounding soil and consequently the lateral load capacity gets enhanced a similar trend of variation is also observed in case of t l 1 however in fig 9 when t l is 1 5 a different trend is obtained compared to the above two cases where the lateral load capacity first increases and then decreases with the increase on the vertical load the reason may be ascribed as the effect of the thickness of clay layer because at t l 1 5 the piled raft completely rests on the clay layer there is a substantial increase in the lateral load subjected to vertical loads up to 0 5v u and after that there is a continuous reduction in the lateral load capacity this reduction in lateral load may be attributed to the early failure of the pile soil interface under the action of vertical load if the interface between the pile and the surrounding soil fails the further lateral deformation in the pile group will not affect the lateral soil stress and hence the lateral soil stress in the soils surrounding the pile group will not increase significantly which will result in a considerable decrease in the lateral load capacity of the pile group present in the piled raft moreover the plasticity model used in this study considers the yield surface as a perfectly plastic yield surface and any change of stress on the yield surface cause plastic deformation as the elasticity of clay is much lower compared to sand the recovery from failure becomes very less and the plastic failure of pile soil interface in clay layer occurs much faster than that of sand layer due to this reason in the case of t l 1 5 the total lateral load capacity of the piled raft will also decrease with the higher amount of vertical load 4 3 effect of pile spacing on lateral response of piled raft the spacing between two piles becomes an important factor while considering the response of any group pile or any piled raft the group interaction among the piles is a function of the pile spacing and this interaction significantly varies for closely spaced pile group or for the pile group with higher spacing fig 10 is showing the variation of lateral load for the piled raft under pure lateral loading at various spacing diameter s d ratios the figure depicts that the lateral load capacity for the piled raft increases with s d ratio the increase in lateral load capacity can be attributed to the pile pile interaction among the pile group under the raft for closely spaced piles due to the action of the external load the developed stress field for each pile overlap each other and the resisting zone behind the pile becomes very small when the spacing between the piles are increased the overlapping stress field becomes insignificant due to the reduction in the group interaction effect and the resisting zone behind the piles becomes larger which enhance the lateral load capacity of the piled raft there is almost 6 12 increase in the lateral load capacity when the s d is changed from 3 to 5 where the lateral load increased by 15 22 by changing s d from 3 to 7 4 4 effect of pile position on the lateral load capacity of pile group in a piled raft when the lateral load is applied on a pile group or a piled raft the piles present in the different row will show different lateral load capacity depending upon the loading direction in this study 25 piles are divided in 5 rows having 5 numbers of piles in each row the lateral load carried by each pile in a particular row is evaluated and the mean of their value is reported as the lateral load capacity of that row fig 11 is showing the lateral load displacement curves for different rows under pure lateral load for s d of 5 and t l ratio of 0 5 it is clear from the figure that the lateral load capacity subsequently decreases from row 1 to row 5 i e the front pile or the row 1 is carrying the maximum amount of lateral load whereas the rear row or row 5 is taking the least amount of lateral load when the lateral load is applied in the piled raft the stress field generated surrounding the front pile is much higher than the rear pile due to this increased stress field the piles resistance to the lateral load increases and hence the front row takes higher load compared to the successive rows the same variation has been observed for all cases under different vertical loadings during combined loading case before applying the lateral load the corner piles and edge piles takes almost same vertical load and the load carried by each corner edge pile is comparatively higher than the centre pile but after applying the lateral load the vertical load tends to increase in the front pile while the vertical load gets decreased at the rear pile due to the increase and the decrease in the soil confinement under the front and rear pile respectively comparing all the configurations it has been observed that the front row piles carry about 30 37 of the total lateral load of the pile group in the piled raft whereas the rearmost row carries 8 15 of the total lateral load 4 5 lateral load sharing between raft and pile piled raft system shows a different load transfer mechanism compared to the individual raft and the pile group and it is accomplished by partial sharing of load by both the raft and the pile group attached to the piled raft system some proportion of the load is shared by the raft and rest of the load is shared by the pile this complex load sharing nature can be assessed by evaluating the load sharing ratio between the piles and the raft the lateral load sharing ratio α p can be defined as the proportion of the lateral load carried by the piles to the total lateral load carried by the piled raft and is given by 2 α p l p l p r l p l r l p 1 l r l p r where l p r is the lateral load carried by the piled raft and l r and l p are lateral load carried by the raft and piles respectively fig 12 is showing the proportion of the lateral load carried by the pile group and the raft in a piled raft system initially at the early stage of lateral loading the raft takes more loads compared to the pile group present in the piled raft but the proportion of load carried by the raft continues to decrease with the increase in the lateral displacement as the raft transfers the load to the pile group after some period of loading the load shared by the piles becomes more than the load shared by the raft at this stage the proportion of lateral load shared by the raft is lower than that of the pile group in the piled raft the same has been evaluated for all the piled raft configurations used in this study and a similar variation is observed for all the cases the raft carries almost 30 48 of lateral load at a displacement of 0 1d whereas the load carried by the pile group present in the piled raft varies between 52 and 70 the effect of the combined loading action on the load sharing ratio is also checked and is presented in fig 13 it is observed from the results that the lateral load sharing ratio for piles reduces with the increase in the vertical load this trend of reduction suggests that the proportion of lateral load carried by the raft increases with the increase in the vertical loading i e if the external vertical load is increased the major portion of the lateral load will be shared by the raft itself and the transmission of lateral load from the raft to the piles will be very less so it can be précised as the lateral load sharing ratio decreases with the increase in the vertical loading the effect of t l ratio and s d ratio on the load sharing ratio is not reasonably significant as the variation in α p ranges within 3 8 however in all the cases it has been observed that there exist a nonlinear relationship between lateral load sharing ratio and normalized lateral displacement to idealize this nonlinear response under pure lateral loading case a logarithmic relation is chosen to formulate the general expression and is given as 3 α p a b ln y d where a and b are empirical constants in fig 14 all the results of pure lateral loading case are collaborated together and a single curve is generated to express the general trend of load sharing ratio with the normalized lateral displacement the figure shows a very good agreement between the calculated results and the projected expression giving the values of constant terms as a 0 88 and b 0 11 the results obtained using the developed equation is compared with the calculated results and it is observed that there exist a very good correlation r2 0 95 between the calculated and the predicted results with a standard error of 0 12 this equation can be directly used to predict the load sharing ratio of piled raft system subjected to lateral load 4 6 effect of vertical load on lateral soil stress the lateral soil stress is evaluated in front and along the depth of each pile in the front row and their mean value is calculated to estimate the stress generated in the sub soil the lateral soil stress is evaluated for each cases and the variation of lateral soil stress under various vertical loads at various t l ratio are represented in fig 15 in both the cases of t l 0 5 and t l 1 the lateral soil stress increases with the increase in the vertical load due to the increase in the confining stress along the pile fig 15 a and b when the external vertical load increases due to the vertical settlement of the piled raft the soil below the raft gets more confined and the confining stress in the surrounding soil gets increased which increases the lateral stress in the soil surrounding the pile however in the case of t l 1 5 the lateral soil stress decreases at higher vertical load levels fig 15 c it is noteworthy to mention that in this case the piled raft system completely rests on the clay layer and the reason in the reduction in lateral soil stress may be attributed to the early failure of the pile soil interface under the action of vertical loading because the plastic failure of pile soil interface in clay layer occurs much faster than that of sand layer once this pile soil interface fails regardless the pile deflection and pile configuration the lateral soil stress along the pile will not increase while comparing the change of lateral soil stress for different s d ratio it is obtained from all the results that the lateral soil stress increases with the increase in the pile spacing irrespective of t l ratio however the percent change in the lateral soil stress at various s d ratios is quite small and ranges within 3 10 4 7 evaluation of bending moment in pile group present in the piled raft during the design of a pile subjected to lateral loads the most critical phase is the proper estimation of the bending moment acting on the pile the bending moment developed in the piles attached to a piled raft is slightly different from that of the free standing pile group when the lateral load is applied on the raft due to the rigid connection between the pile group and the raft the piles bend from the top and a negative bending moment generates at the pile head according to hazzar et al 2017 the bending moment m in the piles can be calculated as 4 m e p i p δ ε d where e p is the modulus of elasticity of pile i p is the moment of inertia of pile δε is the difference between tensile and compressive strain and d is the diameter of the pile the bending moment developed in the pile depends up on the position of the pile in the piled raft it has already shown that the front row pile takes comparatively more load than the successive rows and in the case of bending moment the similar trend has been observed the bending moment for each pile in a particular row is evaluated and the mean value is used to show the bending moment of that row the variation of bending moment in the piles at different row and the influence of vertical loading on the bending moment are shown in fig 16 it is clear from the figure that the maximum negative bending moment generates at the pile head and the maximum positive bending moment generates at a depth of 0 33l 0 5l from the pile head the front row i e the row 1 shows the highest moment among all the rows whereas the rear row or the row 5 shows the least bending moment in the intermediate rows i e row 2 to row 4 the bending moment continuously decrease by moving towards the successive rows but the change in the bending moments are quite less for all the configurations it has seen that the change in the bending moment for front row and rear row is in the range of 8 15 the figure also depicts that with the increase in vertical loading bending moment also tends to increase irrespective of the pile position due to the increase in the vertical loading the lateral load capacity also increases which increases the bending moment in the piles it is observed that the variation of bending moment increased is by 1 07 times when the applied vertical load is 0 9v u as compared to the pure lateral case 4 8 evaluation of shear force developed along the piles the shear force developed in the pile along its depth can be measured by dividing the difference of two sectional bending moments by the distance between that two sections hamada et al 2015 and it can be represented as 5 s f d m d z where m is the bending moment and z is the depth of the pile in this study the equation for bending moment was identified using curve fitting method and the shear force is obtained by differentiating the equation of the moment fig 17 is showing the variation of shear force in the piles presented in different rows and the variation of shear force under the combined action of lateral and various vertical loads similar to moment distribution the shear force developed at the front pile row 1 is much higher than the rear pile row 5 the maximum shear force develops at the pile head and gradually decreases with the increase in the pile depth the piles shear force becomes zero at a depth of 0 33 0 5 times of the pile length and afterwards the shear force becomes negative with the increase in the vertical loading the shear force in the pile tends to increase irrespective of the position of pile in the group the variation in shear force is quite similar to the abovementioned behaviour of bending moment of the piles the variation in the shear force in front and rear row pile ranges within 30 42 and due to the effect of the vertical loading the shear force increases 1 1 to 1 3 times the shear force under pure lateral load when the applied vertical load is 0 9v u 5 percent increase in lateral load capacity and lateral soil stress the percentage increase in the lateral load capacity and the percentage increase in the lateral soil stress are evaluated to check the effect of vertical loading on the lateral response the percent increase in the lateral load capacity under the presence of vertical load can be defined as 6 i l v l w v l n v l n v 100 where ilv is the percentage increase in the lateral load capacity under vertical load l wv is the lateral load capacity with the vertical load and l nv is the lateral load capacity with no vertical load i e without any vertical load or pure lateral load the percent increase in the lateral soil stress under the action of vertical load can be defined as 7 i l s v l s w v l s n v l s n v 100 where ilsv is the percentage increase in the lateral soil stress under vertical load ls wv is the lateral soil stress with the vertical load and ls nv is the lateral soil stress without any vertical load fig 18 and fig 19 are showing the percent increase in the lateral load capacity and the lateral soil stress for different vertical loads at various t l ratios both ilv and ilsv show a similar trend where the values increase with the increase of vertical load on the top of the raft i e the vertical load has a positive impact on ilv and ilsv but while considering the effect of t l ratio for both the cases it shows a positive impact up to v 0 5vu and then shows a negative impact i e the lateral load capacity decreases for v 0 75vu and v 0 9vu compared to the pure lateral load case however from the results it has been seen that the effect of spacing to diameter ratio s d ratio on both ilv and ilsv is quite low and hence the effect of s d ratio can be neglected once this ilv and ilsv is estimated the percent change in the lateral load capacity and lateral soil stress due to the effect of vertical loading can easily be identified the statistical analysis has also been carried out to check the effect and the contribution of the design variables on ilv and ilsv analysis of variance anova technique is used in the study at a confidence level of 95 in order to check the relative contributions however it is found form anova test that the selected hypotheses for s d ratio failed in both the cases as the p value or the significance is greater than 0 05 and hence its effect on ilv and ilsv is ignored the regression analysis is then performed to predict the ilv and ilsv based on t l ratio and percentage of vertical load the predicted equations for both ilv and ilsv are expressed in eq 8 and eq 9 respectively the parameter estimates for both the equations are presented in table 5 and table 6 the contour plot for ilv and ilsv with t l ratio and vertical load are shown in fig 20 8 i l v 33 2 104 76 v v u 98 8 t l 41 85 t l 2 92 24 v v u t l 9 i l s v 23 43 76 86 v v u 47 4 t l 15 45 t l 2

introduced several researchers have identified this p multiplier for various group piles under various design considerations zhu et al 2018b studies are also carried out to modify the existing expressions of p multiplier for better understanding the response of the group pile rollins et al 1998 have developed one predictive model for p multiplier considering different s d ratio zhu et al 2018b have included various design parameters like s d ratio z d ratio etc and proposed another modified model for p multiplier however for a piled raft system although its mechanism is quite different from that of the single pile there is a lack of research regarding the application of p multiplier concept in this study an attempt is taken to idealize the response of a piled raft and the pile group present in the piled raft using the concept of p multiplier the calculation for obtaining p multiplier includes the following expressions 10 p m p r l p r l s 11 p m g p p r l g p p r l s where p m p r and p m g p p r are the p multipliers for the piled raft and the pile group present in the piled raft respectively l p r and l g p p r are the lateral load carried by the piled raft and the pile group present in the piled raft respectively and l s is the lateral load carried by the single pile the p multiplier was calculated for different configuration under pure lateral load condition the variation of p multiplier for piled raft and pile group in the piled raft for different s d ratio and t l ratio is presented in table 7 modified models are then selected for evaluating p multiplier and are expressed as 12 p m p r 1 067 0 045 s d 0 123 t l 13 p m g p p r 0 63 0 027 s d 0 083 t l as the modified model is predicted using the mean values only it is important to know the range of the coefficients involved in predicting the individual values fig 21 and fig 22 are showing the upper bound and lower bound range of the predicted values for p multiplier considering the limits of the upper bound and lower bound in both the figures it is observed that the p multiplier for the piled raft will be in the range of 1 23 1 65 whereas the p multiplier for pile group in piled raft will lie between 0 67 and 1 08 7 conclusion due to the lack of research in the field of the piled raft foundation subjected to combined loading an attempt has been taken in this paper to conduct a widespread research on the piled raft foundation under combined loading to understand the response of the piled raft under combined loading 3d finite element method was selected and a series of numerical test has been performed on the piled raft foundation under the combined action of vertical and lateral loading the conclusions that can be derived from the numerical analyses are pointed below 1 the vertical load applied on the piled raft system has an important significance on the lateral load capacity of the piled raft the lateral load capacity of the piled raft foundation increases with the increase of vertical load up to a t l ratio of 1 whereas at t l ratio of 1 5 the lateral load capacity first increases and then decreases 2 due to the reduction in group interaction effect the lateral load capacity of the piled raft increases with the increase in the spacing between the piles in the piled raft the lateral load capacity increases about 6 12 when the s d is changed from 3 to 5 whereas the lateral load increases about 15 22 by changing s d from 3 to 7 3 when the combined loading action is applied on the piled raft the presence of vertical load increases the confining pressure in the soil which increases the lateral soil stress along the piles in the piled raft 4 during the combined loading case the shear force and bending moment tend to increase with the increase in the vertical loading a negative bending moment gets generated at the pile head whereas a positive bending moment is generated at a depth of 0 33 0 5 times the length of the pile considering the piles in the piled raft the highest bending moment and shear force is taken by the front row pile whereas the rear pile takes the least bending moment and shear force 5 the raft has an important part in sharing and transmitting the applied lateral load on the piled raft foundation at the starting of loading the raft carries the maximum load and with the increase of lateral displacement the percentage of load shared by the raft continues to decrease whereas the load carried by the piles continues to increase due to the effect of vertical loading the lateral load sharing ratio continues to decrease with the increase in the amount of vertical load 6 the percent change in lateral load capacity and lateral soil stress are evaluated and prediction models are derived to evaluate ilv and ilsv the vertical load has a positive impact on ilv and ilsv for t l ratio of 0 5 and 1 whereas at t l ratio of 1 5 the vertical load shows a positive impact up to v 0 5v u and then shows a negative effect 7 the variation of p multiplier is not same for every case and largely depends up on s d ratio and t l ratio p multiplier for the piled raft and pile group present in the piled raft are also evaluated and a prediction model is developed to idealize the response of the piled raft and pile group in piled raft from the response of a single pile 8 from the overall analyses of the piled raft subjected to the combined vertical and lateral loads it can be concluded that the vertical load plays an important role to uphold the lateral response of the piled raft and the behaviour of the piled raft foundation under pure lateral load and combined load are not same adopting this principle the current design practices for the piled raft foundation should be upgraded considering the combined action of vertical and lateral loading appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 appendix a supplementary data
