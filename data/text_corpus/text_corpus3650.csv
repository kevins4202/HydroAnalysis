18250,cryptosporidium parvum toxoplasma gondii and giardia duodenalis are worldwide pathogenic protozoa recognized as major causal agents of waterborne disease outbreaks to overcome the normative process iso 15553 2006 limitations of protozoa detection in aquatic systems we propose to use the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha a freshwater bivalve mollusc as a tool for biomonitoring protozoan contamination mussels were exposed to three concentrations of c parvum oocysts g duodenalis cysts or t gondii oocysts for 21 days followed by 21 days of depuration in clear water d polymorpha accumulated protozoa in its tissues and haemolymph concerning t gondii and g duodenalis the percentage of protozoa positive mussels reflected the contamination level in water bodies as for c parvum detection oocysts did accumulate in mussel tissues and haemolymph but in small quantities and the limit of detection was high between 50 and 100 oocysts low levels of t gondii 1 5 oocysts mussel and g duodenalis less than 1 cyst mussel were quantified in d polymorpha tissues the ability of zebra mussels to reflect contamination by the three protozoa for weeks after the contamination event makes them a good integrative matrix for the biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords toxoplasma gondii giardia duodenalis cryptosporidium parvum zebra mussel biomonitoring 1 introduction cryptosporidium parvum and giardia duodenalis are the major causes of protozoal diarrhea in humans cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis can cause high morbidity and severe dehydration and even death in immunocompromised hosts cacciò et al 2005 toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis it is usually asymptomatic in humans but can cause severe clinical diseases in immunocompromised hosts or in case of congenital infection montoya and liesenfeld 2004 the minimal infectious doses for humans may be low 9 to 1 042 c parvum oocysts fayer et al 2000 and down to 10 g duodenalis cysts rendtorff 1954 although the minimal t gondii infectious dose for humans has not been determined based on animal experimentation one single oocyst can infect humans dubey 2010 the environment including food and water are contaminated by these protozoa via human or animal faeces felids faeces for t gondii or mammals faeces for c parvum and g duodenalis the consumption of fruit and vegetables mckerr et al 2015 pönka et al 2009 and untreated water are known vectors of the foodborne transmission cycle moreno et al 2018 the environmental stages i e giardia cysts and t gondii and cryptosporidium oocysts hereafter designated as protozoa throughout this paper are extremely resistant and can persist in aquatic ecosystems for months bingham et al 1979 lindsay and dubey 2009 olson et al 1999 protozoa have been found in several freshwater aquatic ecosystems such as surface water aubert and villena 2009 bautista et al 2018 karanis et al 2006 vermeulen et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 and underground water aubert and villena 2009 hancock et al 1998 khaldi et al 2011 solo gabriele et al 1998 but also in drinking water almeida et al 2010 aubert and villena 2009 castro hermida et al 2010 cheun et al 2013 ware et al 2010 waterborne transmission to humans is the major cause of cryptosporidiosis putignani and menichella 2010 and giardiasis adam et al 2016 outbreaks cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp indeed caused 63 and 37 of waterborne parasitic disease outbreaks in australia north america and europe between january 2011 and december 2016 respectively efstratiou et al 2017 and t gondii caused 2 between january 2004 and december 2010 baldursson and karanis 2011 in the water matrix cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts are currently detected by immunofluorescence if in filtered water sample iso 15553 2006 however this method is time consuming expensive and requires expert image analysis so it is unsuitable for rapid parasite detection it requires a large volume of filtered water and a high parasite concentration in the samples furthermore the filtration and the purification techniques can yield variable results depending on the water quality the sampling period the location and the water volume gallas lindemann et al 2013 karanis et al 2006 efstratiou et al 2018 no normative process is available for t gondii oocyst detection in water because oocysts are present in limited numbers whereas giardia and cryptosporidium oo cysts are present in high numbers this represents a limitation when applying a monitoring approach based on the water matrix and it seems necessary to investigate new methods for assessing water quality in terms of biological contamination several studies have underlined the ability of filter feeding species such as bivalves to accumulate and concentrate protozoa in their tissues aksoy et al 2014 arkush et al 2003 fayer et al 2003 gómez couso et al 2004 graczyk et al 1999 among bivalves the freshwater zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha has been particularly studied as a biomonitoring tool binelli et al 2015 it is a sedentary species with a high filtration rate 5 400 ml h mussel ackerman 1999 costa et al 2008 reeders et al 1989 the ability of d polymorpha to bioaccumulate c parvum g duodenalis and t gondii under laboratory conditions is well known graczyk et al 2003 palos ladeiro et al 2015 2014 a few studies have already used this bivalve to recover and concentrate environmental c parvum graczyk et al 2008 2004 lucy et al 2010 2008 g duodenalis graczyk et al 2008 2004 lucy et al 2010 2008 and t gondii kerambrun et al 2016 using attached filter feeding organisms allows for a representative measurement of protozoan contamination of the mussels living in water bodies and limits the variability of measurements by integrating temporal contamination in addition such a tool makes it possible to assess water contamination by t gondii g duodenalis and c parvum from only one sample however bivalves are a complex matrix that render measurements difficult it is therefore necessary to determine the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of the method before proposing d polymorpha as a tool for biomonitoring protozoa it is necessary to determine whether the parasite loads measured in zebra mussels are relevant to the water contamination levels this study aimed to define for the first time the kinetics of c parvum g duodenalis and t gondii accumulation and depuration by d polymorpha under control conditions so as to propose recommendations for using d polymorpha as a matrix to monitor the quality of watercourses for this purpose zebra mussels were exposed to three doses of these protozoa for 21 days to characterize the integration of protozoa contamination by zebra mussels over time the exposure period was followed by 21 days of depuration in clear water protozoa levels were measured in whole tissue and in the haemolymph because haemolymph collection can be considered as a nonlethal technique gustafson et al 2005 mccartney and wilbur 2007 and the haemolymph bioaccumulates protozoa graczyk et al 2004 palos ladeiro et al 2015 in order to facilitate the use of zebra mussels as a biomonitoring tool the three protozoa were detected by a molecular technique and the same protocol of dna extraction was used 2 materials and methods 2 1 mussels and protozoa zebra mussels d polymorpha were collected at around 5 m depth in port de nuisement n 48 36 10 0728 e 4 44 57 408 at the lac du der chantecoq marne france in october 2015 then the mussels measuring 20 2 mm were acclimated in the dark in aerated cristaline aurèle france drinking water at 12 c for two weeks the water was renewed twice a week to ensure that mussels were protozoa free on the first day of exposure the mussels were fed ad libitum twice a week with 20 000 cells of two microalgal species chlorella pyrenoidosa and scenedesmus obliquus per mussel and per day t gondii oocysts of the strain me49 genotype ii were obtained as described previously dubey 2010 oocysts were sporulated in 2 aqueous sulfuric acid and stored at 4 c until use c parvum oocyst and g duodenalis cyst preparations were purchased from waterborne inc new orleans la usa and kept at 4 c until use 2 2 exposure conditions before exposure zebra mussels were randomly divided into 10 groups of 195 mussels each i e 1 control group and 9 exposed groups each group was placed in a tank containing 10 l of cristaline aurèle france water zebra mussels were exposed to 0 100 1000 or 10 000 protozoa per bivalve and per day for 21 days supplementary data the tank water was changed once a week and the volume of water was adapted to the number of remaining bivalves the protozoa were spiked again after water changes to maintain the initial protozoa concentrations in the tanks to determine the environmental equivalent for each exposure concentration the number of protozoa per litre protozoa l 1 in each tank was calculated for each condition 1 9 x 103 1 9 x 104 and 1 9 x 105 on day 1 3 6 x 103 3 6 x 104 and 3 6 x 105 on day 2 5 3 x 103 5 3 x 104 and 5 3 x 105 on day 3 1 1 x 104 1 1 x 105 and 1 1 x 106 on day 7 2 8 x 104 2 8 x 105 and 2 8 x 106 on day 14 and 4 3 x 104 4 3 x 105 and 4 3 x 106 on day 21 for 100 1000 or 10 000 protozoa bivalve day respectively then the mussels were transferred into new tanks filled with clean water for the depuration period during the exposure and depuration periods 10 mussels per condition were sampled on days1 2 3 7 14 and 21 haemolymph was taken from the posterior adductor muscle and whole tissue was collected and then stored at 80 c until analysis mussels were still fed ad libitum twice a week with chlorella pyrenoidosa and scenedesmus obliquus mortality was recorded daily mortality of 1 62 in the control tank 1 08 in the three tanks devoted to t gondii exposure 1 08 in the three tanks devoted to c parvum exposure and 0 72 in three tanks devoted to g duodenalis exposure were recorded throughout the experiment no difference in mortality was observed between the different exposure concentrations 2 3 dna extraction from different matrices bivalve tissues were ground and digested using 1x trypsin for 1h at 37 c under 90 rpm shaking each tissues homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5min and the pellet was stored at 20 c until dna extraction dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil according to the manufacturer s instruction mp biomedicals illkirch graffenstaden france this kit was previously tested in our laboratory and appeared to be the most effective method for extracting the three protozoa from zebra mussel tissues data not shown dna was extracted from haemolymph samples using an optimized protocol based on palos ladeiro et al 2014 haemolymph samples were centrifuged at 5 000 g for 5 min pellets containing 100 μl of supernatant were submitted to heat shock cycles consisting of freezing at 80 c for 5 min and thawing at 95 c for 4 min these heat shock cycles were repeated six times to break the wall and access protozoan dna then the samples were subjected to ultrasonic treatment at 37 hz ultrasonics 88155 for 1 min for c parvum and g duodenalis samples and 10 min for t gondii samples dna was extracted from the pellets using an instagene matrix kit following the manufacturer s instructions bio rad marnes la coquette france 2 4 taqman qpcr parasite dna detection was detected by taqman real time qpcr in a cfx96 touch thermocycler bio rad usa according to palos ladeiro et al 2014 taqman real time qpcr targeted specific t gondii af487550 1 lélu et al 2011 g duodenalis m54878 verweij et al 2003 and c parvum hominis af188110 fontaine and guillot 2002 genes supplementary data qpcr amplifications were performed as specified by the manufacturer s instructions in the following mixtures 5 μl of extracted dna sample were added to 20 μl of mix containing 2x iq supermix bio rad 1 μl of bsa 10 mg ml 1 sigma france 400 nm of each primers and 200 nm of probe for t gondii and g duodenalis or 100 nm for c parvum a no template control was added dna polymerase was activated after an initial 3 min denaturation step at 95 c then the samples were submitted to 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 1 min at 60 c the cq values were collected each correspond to the number of cycles for which fluorescence exceed a fixed threshold and allows for quantifying the amount of the target dna each sample was analyzed in duplicate and non diluted and ten fold diluted 10 1 dna extracts were analyzed to limit the inhibition effect in case of inhibition non diluted cq values were extrapolated from the cq of the ten fold dilution considering a cq difference of 3 3 for a dilution factor equal to 10 and an optimal pcr efficacy equal to 2 log2 10 to determine the number of oo cyst in the samples reference curves were established using a serial dilution ranging from 50 000 to 1 oo cyst s spiked in mussel tissues or added to the water suspensions for tissues analysis experiments were performed in quintuplicate for dilutions ranging from 100 to 1 protozoa five dilutions and in triplicate for dilutions ranging from 50 000 to 500 oo cysts five dilutions too for haemolymph analysis samples were spiked in triplicate with dilutions ranging from 10 000 to 100 oo cysts six dilutions all spiked tissues and haemolymph samples were also used to determine the limit of quantification loq and the limit of detection lod95 loq was determined as the lowest number of parasites for which a linear relationship was observed between the cq and the number of parasites r2 0 98 and lod95 was defined as the lowest number of parasites for which 95 of positive samples were detected 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with r software version 3 5 2 as physiological data did not comply with the parametric assumption of normality shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variance levene s tests nonparametric tests were used kruskal wallis test and nemenyi test for post hoc pairwise comparisons were used α 0 05 only data above the loq war presented in the graphs 3 results 3 1 determination of lod95 and loq for the tissues samples the performances of the method were determined using tissues spiked with 50 000 to 1 oo cyst s table 1 for t gondii oocysts a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 5 oocysts so loq was five oocysts in whole tissues no amplification curve was obtained in 1 10 replicate corresponding to 1 oocyst so lod95 was between one 95 of positive samples and five 100 of positive samples oocysts in whole tissues the slope coefficient was 3 1193 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 supplementary data for g duodenalis cysts a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 1 cyst s so loq was 1 cyst an amplification curve was obtained in all replicates corresponding to 1 cyst so lod95 was less than 1 cyst the slope coefficient was 3 5093 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 supplementary data for c parvum a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 100 oocysts so loq was 100 oocysts an amplification curve was obtained in 90 of the replicates corresponding to 50 oocysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 100 oocysts so lod95 was between 50 and 100 oocysts in whole tissues the slope coefficient was 3 5673 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 96 supplementary data for the haemolymph analysis samples were spiked in triplicate with dilutions ranging from 10 000 to 10 oo cysts table 1 for t gondii the slope coefficient was 3 2996 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 supplementary data a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 100 oocysts per sample so loq was 100 oocysts an amplification curve was obtained in 83 of the replicates corresponding to 10 oocysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 50 oocysts per sample so lod95 was between 10 and 50 oocysts for g duodenalis the slope coefficient was 4 591 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 supplementary data a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 10 cysts per sample so loq was 10 cysts an amplification curve was obtained in 67 of the replicates corresponding to 5 cysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 10 cysts in the samples so lod95 was between 5 and 10 cysts lastly for c parvum a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 100 oocysts per sample so loq was 100 oocysts an amplification curve was obtained in 80 of the replicates corresponding to 50 oocysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 100 oocysts in the samples so lod95 was between 50 and 100 oocysts the slope coefficient was 3 2776 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 98 supplementary data 3 2 protozoa levels in bivalves in the control samples no protozoa was detected in the haemolymph in whole tissues 4 2 5 120 of the samples were positive to t gondii oocysts with 1 oocyst per mussel no c parvum oocyst or g duodenalis cyst was detected in whole tissue samples 3 2 1 protozoa detection the number of mussels positive to t gondii was higher in tissues than in the haemolymph fig 1 in the haemolymph samples at 100 oocysts mussel day mussels were positive to t gondii from day 7 of the exposure period until the end of the 21 days of depuration fig 1 a however at higher concentrations oocysts were detected in the haemolymph from 1 day of exposure 10 of positive samples and the number of positive mussels increased until 21 days of exposure and reached 100 for the highest dose mussels remained positive to t gondii throughout the 21 days of the depuration period whatever the exposure dose for each sampling time the percentage of positive mussels increased with the protozoa concentration in water in mussel tissues t gondii oocysts were consistently detected from day 1 of exposure period until the end of the day 21 of depuration at all oocyst concentrations fig 1 b during the accumulation phase all samples were positive from 1 day of exposure at the highest concentration and from 3 days at the two lower concentrations 100 and 1000 oocysts mussel day during depuration all mussels remained positive at the two highest doses while the percentage tended to decrease at 100 oocysts mussel day the percentage of mussels positive to g duodenalis cysts increased with the protozoa concentration in water at each sampling time in the haemolymph and in tissues fig 1 in the haemolymph g duodenalis cysts were detected from day 1 of the exposure period until the end of the 21 days of depuration fig 1 c the percentage of positive haemolymph samples increased during the exposure period it reached more than 50 of positive samples at the two lowest concentrations and 100 at the highest concentration and remained relatively steady throughout the depuration period only varying by 20 cysts were detected in tissues later than in the haemolymph fig 1 d i e after 7 days 10 2 days 40 or 1 day 50 of exposure to 100 1000 and 10 000 cysts mussel day respectively the percentage of positive tissues increased until 21 days of exposure and cysts were still detected in mussel tissues after 21 days of depuration few haemolymph and tissues samples positive to c parvum were detected fig 1 in the haemolymph fig 1 e the percentage of detection increased between 14 and 21 days of exposure for the two highest concentrations and decreased during the depuration period in tissues fig 1 f detection slightly increased with the oocyst concentration at each sampling time no clear trend was observed and the percentage of positive mussels did not exceed 50 in the haemolymph or in tissues 3 2 2 protozoa quantification we failed to quantify part of the samples detected as protozoa positive because the amount of bioaccumulated protozoa was below the loq the number of samples above the loq is summarized in table 2 quantification results are presented in graphs if at least 50 of the samples had values greater than the lod95 and if at least 30 of those samples had values greater than the loq per modality consequently only the numbers of t gondii oocysts bioaccumulated in tissues at 1000 and 10 000 oocysts bivalve day fig 2 and the numbers of g duodenalis cysts bioaccumulated in the haemolymph at 10 000 cysts bivalve day fig 3 and in tissues at 1000 and 10 000 cysts bivalve day fig 4 are presented in the graphs the number of t gondii oocysts bioaccumulated in tissues fig 2 did not significantly vary throughout the exposure period with 10 2 3 8 and 166 4 231 4 oocysts at 1000 and 10 000 oocysts mussel day respectively then a non significant decrease was observed after 3 days of depuration with 3 1 2 6 and 18 2 10 8 oocysts at 1000 and 10 000 oocysts mussel day respectively oocysts still accumulated in mussel tissues even after 21 days of depuration with 7 7 only one positive sample and 38 2 61 5 oocysts respectively the quantity of bioaccumulated oocysts was not significantly different between the two concentrations all sampling times combined the numbers of g duodenalis cysts in the haemolymph significantly increased on day 21 of the exposure period 218 7 143 3 compared to day 3 15 8 0 6 and day 7 20 9 7 7 of exposure fig 3 during the depuration period the number of cysts per mussel significantly decreased after 1 day 32 7 19 9 and cysts remained in the haemolymph for at least 21 days 36 1 13 6 in tissues fig 4 the number of cysts per mussel was very variable and no significant difference was shown at 1000 cysts mussel day or between the two concentrations at 10 000 cysts mussel day the number of bioaccumulated cysts after 1 day of depuration 15 1 19 9 was significantly higher than after 3 days 2 0 2 2 and 7 days 2 5 2 4 of exposure then at 1000 and 10 000 cysts mussel day a non significant decrease was observed after 3 days of depuration 1 8 1 4 and 4 3 4 9 respectively compared to 2 days of depuration 12 5 22 9 and 13 4 18 7 respectively the cyst level remained similar in tissues until 21 days of depuration with 15 9 25 4 and 25 6 46 0 cysts per mussel at 1000 and 10 000 cysts mussel day respectively 4 discussion the waterborne transmission of c parvum and g duodenalis is well documented adam et al 2016 identified 242 giardiosis outbreaks including 74 6 with a waterborne origin between 1972 and 2011 likewise among the 70 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks reported between 2000 and 2010 56 4 had a waterborne origin putignani and menichella 2010 the prevalence of t gondii oocysts in watercourses has been studied only recently between 2004 and 2010 out of 325 waterborne protozoa outbreaks reported 2 were caused by t gondii baldursson and karanis 2011 for example t gondii oocysts were found in 27 2 n 114 of drinking water samples in poland sroka et al 2006 c parvum oocysts were detected in 10 2 n 167 32 7 n 52 and 35 n 26 and g duodenalis in 8 4 n 167 36 5 n 52 and 12 n 26 of drinking water samples in portugal almeida et al 2010 spain castro hermida et al 2010 and japan hashimoto et al 2002 respectively considering the low doses required for these parasites to infect humans positive detection in water reflects a health risk this study addresses for the first time exposure of zebra mussels to g duodenalis and t gondii for 21 days and the subsequent depuration kinetics the percentages of detection provided relevant results for assessing the presence of protozoa loads in aquatic environments detection of t gondii and g duodenalis in zebra mussel tissues or haemolymph indeed provided early diagnosis i e as early as after 1 day of exposure to 100 oo cysts mussel day oo cysts were still detected after 21 days of depuration therefore the method could reflect present or recent contamination of water bodies moreover the percentages of positive samples appeared to reflect contamination levels with different levels of sensitivity depending on the compartment tissues or haemolymph this may be related to lod95 which differed according to each protozoan and each mussel compartment for g duodenalis contamination was detected in the haemolymph from 1 day of exposure with 10 30 or 60 of positive samples for punctual contamination levels of 1 9 x 103 1 9 x 104 and 1 9 x 105 cysts l 1 respectively but contamination was not detected in the tissue samples the percentage of positive haemolymph samples could reflect contamination by cysts whether occasional or chronic over a time span of 21 days a percentage of 80 100 was representative of contamination ranging from 5 3 x 105 to more than 4 3 x 106 cysts l 1 while a percentage of 10 20 reflected a cyst level ranging from 1 9 x 103 to 5 3 x 104 cysts l 1 the percentage of positive mussels remained relatively stable throughout the depuration period 20 variation and clearly distinct for each contamination level 10 30 60 80 or 90 100 after chronic exposure to 4 3 x 104 4 3 x 105 and 4 3 x 106 cysts l 1 respectively the same patterns were observed in tissues with later and lower detection percentages of 10 on average for each cyst concentration contrary to g duodenalis t gondii was detected earlier in tissues than in the haemolymph the percentage of positive tissues reached 100 from 5 3 x 103 oocysts l 1 and remained stable for the 21 days of depuration after chronic exposure 21 days at 4 3 x 105 oocysts l 1 t gondii detection in the haemolymph samples occurred later but still provided an assessment of t gondii levels in water all haemolymph samples were positive following exposure to only 4 3 x 106 oocysts l 1 10 30 of positive samples reflected oocyst levels ranging from 1 1e4 to 1 1 x 105 oocysts l 1 while 80 90 of positive samples tended to reflect contamination by 2 8e5 to 4 3 x 105 oocysts l 1 zebra mussels integrated protozoan contamination over the 21 days of depuration this underlines their ability to reflect past contamination of the water environment previous studies also showed integration of contamination by t gondii palos ladeiro et al 2015 c parvum and g duodenalis graczyk et al 2003 for 14 days of depuration in zebra mussels in marine species t gondii oocysts were still detected in m galloprovincialis 21 days after inoculation arkush et al 2003 and c parvum oocysts remained detected in gills and haemocytes of crassostrea virginica 12 days after exposure fayer et al 1997 in agreement with our results c parvum oocysts persisted 14 days after inoculation in the freshwater mollusc corbicula fluminea graczyk et al 1998 many samples were not quantifiable with protozoa loads in mussels was no representative of the water contamination level nevertheless our experiment provided further details on bioaccumulation of oo cysts between 1 and 3 days of depuration the number of t gondii oocysts bioaccumulated in zebra mussel tissues dropped between 1 and 2 days of depuration and then a minimal quantity per mussel seemed to persist up to 21 days of depuration palos ladeiro et al 2015 also showed a sharp decrease in the number of bioaccumulated oocysts after one week of depuration which then remained the same the 2 following weeks for g duodenalis an increasing trend was observed in tissues after 1 day in clear water compared to the exposure period simultaneously in the haemolymph a significant increase of the number of cysts was observed after 21 days of exposure followed by a decrease after 1 day in clear water therefore zebra mussels appeared to transfer cysts from the haemolymph to tissues in the depuration period which explained the concentration of g duodenalis cysts after 1 day in clear water as previously observed palos ladeiro et al 2015 t gondii oocysts seemed to be less detected in the haemolymph than in tissues as opposed to t gondii oocysts g duodenalis cysts seemed to be more accumulated in the haemolymph than in tissues especially during the exposure period despite a higher loq in tissues than in the haemolymph these two protozoa could be managed differently by zebra mussel cells t gondii oocysts and g duodenalis cysts have different sizes 10 13 μm and 12 15 μm respectively and wall structures adam 2001 dumètre et al 2013 moreover some authors have shown the presence of lectins in the gills and labial palp mucus in crassostrea virginica pales espinosa et al 2009 and m edulis pales espinosa et al 2010 these lectins recognized some carbohydrates on the surfaces of filtered particles that is used for a biochemical selection of particles this mechanism could explain the differences between the number of t gondii oocysts and g duodenalis cysts accumulated by d polymorpha the higher lod95 for c parvum oocysts might explain its low detection in zebra mussel matrix whether haemolymph or tissue moreover c parvum oocysts have a small diameter 4 5 μm fayer et al 2000 and their wall also has a different composition dumètre et al 2012 than t gondii oocysts and g duodenalis cysts therefore cellular management and biochemical selection of c parvum oocysts by zebra mussels could lead to lower bioaccumulation or destruction of c parvum oocysts in vitro experiments showed that c parvum oocysts could be internalized by d polymorpha haemocytes palos ladeiro et al 2018 whereas t gondii and g duodenalis oo cysts were trapped in haemocyte aggregates owing to their large size le guernic et al 2018 these explanations are in agreement with the findings of other studies in which c fluminea haemocytes internalized c parvum oocysts in vivo graczyk et al 1998 and phagocytized them in vitro graczyk et al 1997 this might explain the difference in the dna quantities we detected in mussels whether from t gondii g duodenalis or c parvum oo cysts molecular techniques seemed to underline a higher accumulation of t gondii oocysts than g duodenalis cysts and c parvum oocysts in zebra mussels as previously highlighted palos ladeiro et al 2014 this could be explained by the differences in lod95 and loq observed for each parasite in tissues and in the haemolymph the extraction method led to a sensitive lod95 for t gondii 1 5 oocysts mussel and g duodenalis 1 cyst mussel in tissues but was less efficient for c parvum 50 100 oocysts mussel the literature does nor provide any data on the lod of molecular techniques for g duodenalis cyst detection in shellfish however our results highlighted a significant improvement in detection sensitivity for t gondii and c parvum oocysts in mussel tissues staggs et al 2015 found a lod 1000 t gondii and c parvum oocysts per mytilus spp tissues by taqman qpcr targeting the repeat region gene and esmerini et al 2010 found a lod ranging between 100 and 1000 t gondii oocysts per sample in mytella guyanensis and c rhiziphorae by nested pcr targeting the b1 gene the present study highlighted a lod ranging between 10 and 50 t gondii oocysts in mussel haemolymph samples the same sensitivity was highlighted in perna canaliculus haemolymph by qpcr targeting the repeat region gene coupe et al 2019 but detection was more sensitive in mytilus spp haemolymph with a lod ranging between 1 and 10 oocysts by taqman qpcr repeat region gene staggs et al 2015 for c parvum the lod ranged between 50 and 100 oocysts in zebra mussel staggs et al 2015 highlighted similar sensitivity in mytilus spp the extraction technique should be improved for c parvum in future experiments the current extraction protocol 1 could be too drastic and might damage the dna integrity of c parvum oocysts or on the contrary 2 might partially damage the integrity of the oocyst wall and reduce access to oocyst dna in order to verify these hypotheses it would be necessary to test different parameters of the dna extraction protocol ahmed and karanis 2018 trypsin digestion heat shock cycles manore et al 2019 ultrasonic treatment homogenization frequency however improving the method for c parvum might alter the performance for t gondii and g duodenalis zebra mussels could concentrate these two protozoa for a few weeks even during the depuration period and could be used as an integrative matrix for biomonitoring aquatic ecosystems the percentage of positive mussels used allows to limit the risk of false negatives compared to protozoa quantification in mussel matrix and reflect a health risk the number of positive mussels could predict the water contamination level in water therefore additional studies are needed to improve the sensitivity of this model our results underline higher numbers of positive samples and lower lod95 and loq for tissue samples than for haemolymph samples for the tree protozoa thus within the framework of protozoa biomonitoring in watercourses it seems more appropriate to search for protozoa in tissue samples in the light of these results we propose to analyze whole zebra mussels without haemolymph punction this method was previouly used in our laboratory and did not impact the quality of dna extraction or protozoa quantification the lod95 and loq remained unchanged data not shown this simplifies handling and handlers would not need any knowledge of zebra mussel anatomy or dissection in addition using pooled tissues with pool of similar weights could make the technique more reliable and limit inter individual variation caused by zebra mussel size for example lucy et al 2010 d polymorpha can be used for passive and active biomonitoring the establishment of a reference population could provide a rapid and sustainable supply of zebra mussels to facilitate its caging however one should keep in mind that zebra mussel is an invasive species that cannot be used outside its distribution area but since it is mainly present in europe and north america its use as a biomonitoring tool can still be applied in many countries moreover this methodology is less expensive and time consuming than the current normative process iso 15553 2006 and makes it possible to monitor contamination by protozoan oo cysts and reduce the variability of the results induced by water quality the sampling period physicochemical parameters using protozoa concentration in mussel tissues 5 conclusion this study highlights a high sensitivity of molecular techniques for detecting g duodenalis and t gondii in mussel matrix i e 1 5 t gondii oocysts mussel and less than 1 g duodenalis cyst mussel the percentage of detection in mussels could highlight present or past protozoa contamination and reflect the contamination level of water bodies d polymorpha also concentrated c parvum oocysts but our technique was less sensitive and still needs to be improved zebra mussels are sedentary organisms with a worldwide distribution allowing for the monitoring of a wide range of water bodies implementing this biomonitoring would be easier than the current normative process iso 15553 2006 and may limit result variation caused by water quality the sampling period or physicochemical parameters the use of zebra mussels as an integrative tool may allow for assessing water quality in terms of protozoa contamination and could consequently help to estimate the health risk associated with contaminated water potentially re used for crop irrigation or as recreational water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18250,cryptosporidium parvum toxoplasma gondii and giardia duodenalis are worldwide pathogenic protozoa recognized as major causal agents of waterborne disease outbreaks to overcome the normative process iso 15553 2006 limitations of protozoa detection in aquatic systems we propose to use the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha a freshwater bivalve mollusc as a tool for biomonitoring protozoan contamination mussels were exposed to three concentrations of c parvum oocysts g duodenalis cysts or t gondii oocysts for 21 days followed by 21 days of depuration in clear water d polymorpha accumulated protozoa in its tissues and haemolymph concerning t gondii and g duodenalis the percentage of protozoa positive mussels reflected the contamination level in water bodies as for c parvum detection oocysts did accumulate in mussel tissues and haemolymph but in small quantities and the limit of detection was high between 50 and 100 oocysts low levels of t gondii 1 5 oocysts mussel and g duodenalis less than 1 cyst mussel were quantified in d polymorpha tissues the ability of zebra mussels to reflect contamination by the three protozoa for weeks after the contamination event makes them a good integrative matrix for the biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords toxoplasma gondii giardia duodenalis cryptosporidium parvum zebra mussel biomonitoring 1 introduction cryptosporidium parvum and giardia duodenalis are the major causes of protozoal diarrhea in humans cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis can cause high morbidity and severe dehydration and even death in immunocompromised hosts cacciò et al 2005 toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis it is usually asymptomatic in humans but can cause severe clinical diseases in immunocompromised hosts or in case of congenital infection montoya and liesenfeld 2004 the minimal infectious doses for humans may be low 9 to 1 042 c parvum oocysts fayer et al 2000 and down to 10 g duodenalis cysts rendtorff 1954 although the minimal t gondii infectious dose for humans has not been determined based on animal experimentation one single oocyst can infect humans dubey 2010 the environment including food and water are contaminated by these protozoa via human or animal faeces felids faeces for t gondii or mammals faeces for c parvum and g duodenalis the consumption of fruit and vegetables mckerr et al 2015 pönka et al 2009 and untreated water are known vectors of the foodborne transmission cycle moreno et al 2018 the environmental stages i e giardia cysts and t gondii and cryptosporidium oocysts hereafter designated as protozoa throughout this paper are extremely resistant and can persist in aquatic ecosystems for months bingham et al 1979 lindsay and dubey 2009 olson et al 1999 protozoa have been found in several freshwater aquatic ecosystems such as surface water aubert and villena 2009 bautista et al 2018 karanis et al 2006 vermeulen et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 and underground water aubert and villena 2009 hancock et al 1998 khaldi et al 2011 solo gabriele et al 1998 but also in drinking water almeida et al 2010 aubert and villena 2009 castro hermida et al 2010 cheun et al 2013 ware et al 2010 waterborne transmission to humans is the major cause of cryptosporidiosis putignani and menichella 2010 and giardiasis adam et al 2016 outbreaks cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp indeed caused 63 and 37 of waterborne parasitic disease outbreaks in australia north america and europe between january 2011 and december 2016 respectively efstratiou et al 2017 and t gondii caused 2 between january 2004 and december 2010 baldursson and karanis 2011 in the water matrix cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts are currently detected by immunofluorescence if in filtered water sample iso 15553 2006 however this method is time consuming expensive and requires expert image analysis so it is unsuitable for rapid parasite detection it requires a large volume of filtered water and a high parasite concentration in the samples furthermore the filtration and the purification techniques can yield variable results depending on the water quality the sampling period the location and the water volume gallas lindemann et al 2013 karanis et al 2006 efstratiou et al 2018 no normative process is available for t gondii oocyst detection in water because oocysts are present in limited numbers whereas giardia and cryptosporidium oo cysts are present in high numbers this represents a limitation when applying a monitoring approach based on the water matrix and it seems necessary to investigate new methods for assessing water quality in terms of biological contamination several studies have underlined the ability of filter feeding species such as bivalves to accumulate and concentrate protozoa in their tissues aksoy et al 2014 arkush et al 2003 fayer et al 2003 gómez couso et al 2004 graczyk et al 1999 among bivalves the freshwater zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha has been particularly studied as a biomonitoring tool binelli et al 2015 it is a sedentary species with a high filtration rate 5 400 ml h mussel ackerman 1999 costa et al 2008 reeders et al 1989 the ability of d polymorpha to bioaccumulate c parvum g duodenalis and t gondii under laboratory conditions is well known graczyk et al 2003 palos ladeiro et al 2015 2014 a few studies have already used this bivalve to recover and concentrate environmental c parvum graczyk et al 2008 2004 lucy et al 2010 2008 g duodenalis graczyk et al 2008 2004 lucy et al 2010 2008 and t gondii kerambrun et al 2016 using attached filter feeding organisms allows for a representative measurement of protozoan contamination of the mussels living in water bodies and limits the variability of measurements by integrating temporal contamination in addition such a tool makes it possible to assess water contamination by t gondii g duodenalis and c parvum from only one sample however bivalves are a complex matrix that render measurements difficult it is therefore necessary to determine the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of the method before proposing d polymorpha as a tool for biomonitoring protozoa it is necessary to determine whether the parasite loads measured in zebra mussels are relevant to the water contamination levels this study aimed to define for the first time the kinetics of c parvum g duodenalis and t gondii accumulation and depuration by d polymorpha under control conditions so as to propose recommendations for using d polymorpha as a matrix to monitor the quality of watercourses for this purpose zebra mussels were exposed to three doses of these protozoa for 21 days to characterize the integration of protozoa contamination by zebra mussels over time the exposure period was followed by 21 days of depuration in clear water protozoa levels were measured in whole tissue and in the haemolymph because haemolymph collection can be considered as a nonlethal technique gustafson et al 2005 mccartney and wilbur 2007 and the haemolymph bioaccumulates protozoa graczyk et al 2004 palos ladeiro et al 2015 in order to facilitate the use of zebra mussels as a biomonitoring tool the three protozoa were detected by a molecular technique and the same protocol of dna extraction was used 2 materials and methods 2 1 mussels and protozoa zebra mussels d polymorpha were collected at around 5 m depth in port de nuisement n 48 36 10 0728 e 4 44 57 408 at the lac du der chantecoq marne france in october 2015 then the mussels measuring 20 2 mm were acclimated in the dark in aerated cristaline aurèle france drinking water at 12 c for two weeks the water was renewed twice a week to ensure that mussels were protozoa free on the first day of exposure the mussels were fed ad libitum twice a week with 20 000 cells of two microalgal species chlorella pyrenoidosa and scenedesmus obliquus per mussel and per day t gondii oocysts of the strain me49 genotype ii were obtained as described previously dubey 2010 oocysts were sporulated in 2 aqueous sulfuric acid and stored at 4 c until use c parvum oocyst and g duodenalis cyst preparations were purchased from waterborne inc new orleans la usa and kept at 4 c until use 2 2 exposure conditions before exposure zebra mussels were randomly divided into 10 groups of 195 mussels each i e 1 control group and 9 exposed groups each group was placed in a tank containing 10 l of cristaline aurèle france water zebra mussels were exposed to 0 100 1000 or 10 000 protozoa per bivalve and per day for 21 days supplementary data the tank water was changed once a week and the volume of water was adapted to the number of remaining bivalves the protozoa were spiked again after water changes to maintain the initial protozoa concentrations in the tanks to determine the environmental equivalent for each exposure concentration the number of protozoa per litre protozoa l 1 in each tank was calculated for each condition 1 9 x 103 1 9 x 104 and 1 9 x 105 on day 1 3 6 x 103 3 6 x 104 and 3 6 x 105 on day 2 5 3 x 103 5 3 x 104 and 5 3 x 105 on day 3 1 1 x 104 1 1 x 105 and 1 1 x 106 on day 7 2 8 x 104 2 8 x 105 and 2 8 x 106 on day 14 and 4 3 x 104 4 3 x 105 and 4 3 x 106 on day 21 for 100 1000 or 10 000 protozoa bivalve day respectively then the mussels were transferred into new tanks filled with clean water for the depuration period during the exposure and depuration periods 10 mussels per condition were sampled on days1 2 3 7 14 and 21 haemolymph was taken from the posterior adductor muscle and whole tissue was collected and then stored at 80 c until analysis mussels were still fed ad libitum twice a week with chlorella pyrenoidosa and scenedesmus obliquus mortality was recorded daily mortality of 1 62 in the control tank 1 08 in the three tanks devoted to t gondii exposure 1 08 in the three tanks devoted to c parvum exposure and 0 72 in three tanks devoted to g duodenalis exposure were recorded throughout the experiment no difference in mortality was observed between the different exposure concentrations 2 3 dna extraction from different matrices bivalve tissues were ground and digested using 1x trypsin for 1h at 37 c under 90 rpm shaking each tissues homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5min and the pellet was stored at 20 c until dna extraction dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil according to the manufacturer s instruction mp biomedicals illkirch graffenstaden france this kit was previously tested in our laboratory and appeared to be the most effective method for extracting the three protozoa from zebra mussel tissues data not shown dna was extracted from haemolymph samples using an optimized protocol based on palos ladeiro et al 2014 haemolymph samples were centrifuged at 5 000 g for 5 min pellets containing 100 μl of supernatant were submitted to heat shock cycles consisting of freezing at 80 c for 5 min and thawing at 95 c for 4 min these heat shock cycles were repeated six times to break the wall and access protozoan dna then the samples were subjected to ultrasonic treatment at 37 hz ultrasonics 88155 for 1 min for c parvum and g duodenalis samples and 10 min for t gondii samples dna was extracted from the pellets using an instagene matrix kit following the manufacturer s instructions bio rad marnes la coquette france 2 4 taqman qpcr parasite dna detection was detected by taqman real time qpcr in a cfx96 touch thermocycler bio rad usa according to palos ladeiro et al

qpcr amplifications were performed as specified by the manufacturer s instructions in the following mixtures 5 μl of extracted dna sample were added to 20 μl of mix containing 2x iq supermix bio rad 1 μl of bsa 10 mg ml 1 sigma france 400 nm of each primers and 200 nm of probe for t gondii and g duodenalis or 100 nm for c parvum a no template control was added dna polymerase was activated after an initial 3 min denaturation step at 95 c then the samples were submitted to 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 1 min at 60 c the cq values were collected each correspond to the number of cycles for which fluorescence exceed a fixed threshold and allows for quantifying the amount of the target dna each sample was analyzed in duplicate and non diluted and ten fold diluted 10 1 dna extracts were analyzed to limit the inhibition effect in case of inhibition non diluted cq values were extrapolated from the cq of the ten fold dilution considering a cq difference of 3 3 for a dilution factor equal to 10 and an optimal pcr efficacy equal to 2 log2 10 to determine the number of oo cyst in the samples reference curves were established using a serial dilution ranging from 50 000 to 1 oo cyst s spiked in mussel tissues or added to the water suspensions for tissues analysis experiments were performed in quintuplicate for dilutions ranging from 100 to 1 protozoa five dilutions and in triplicate for dilutions ranging from 50 000 to 500 oo cysts five dilutions too for haemolymph analysis samples were spiked in triplicate with dilutions ranging from 10 000 to 100 oo cysts six dilutions all spiked tissues and haemolymph samples were also used to determine the limit of quantification loq and the limit of detection lod95 loq was determined as the lowest number of parasites for which a linear relationship was observed between the cq and the number of parasites r2 0 98 and lod95 was defined as the lowest number of parasites for which 95 of positive samples were detected 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with r software version 3 5 2 as physiological data did not comply with the parametric assumption of normality shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of

cysts a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 1 cyst s so loq was 1 cyst an amplification curve was obtained in all replicates corresponding to 1 cyst so lod95 was less than 1 cyst the slope coefficient was 3 5093 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 supplementary data for c parvum a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 100 oocysts so loq was 100 oocysts an amplification curve was obtained in 90 of the replicates corresponding to 50 oocysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 100 oocysts so lod95 was between 50 and 100 oocysts in whole tissues the slope coefficient was 3 5673 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 96 supplementary data for the haemolymph analysis samples were spiked in triplicate with dilutions ranging from 10 000 to 10 oo cysts table 1 for t gondii the slope coefficient was 3 2996 with a squared correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 supplementary data a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to

observed from 50 000 to 10 cysts per sample so loq was 10 cysts an amplification curve was obtained in 67 of the replicates corresponding to 5 cysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 10 cysts in the samples so lod95 was between 5 and 10 cysts lastly for c parvum a linear response r2 0 98 was observed from 50 000 to 100 oocysts per sample so loq was 100 oocysts an amplification curve was obtained in 80 of the replicates corresponding to 50 oocysts and in 100 of the replicates corresponding to 100 oocysts in the samples so lod95 was between 50 and 100 oocysts the slope coefficient

120 of the samples were positive to t gondii oocysts with 1 oocyst per mussel no c parvum oocyst or g duodenalis cyst was detected in whole tissue samples 3 2 1 protozoa detection the number of mussels positive to t gondii was higher in tissues than in the haemolymph fig 1 in the haemolymph samples at 100 oocysts mussel day mussels were positive to t gondii from day 7 of the exposure period until the end of the 21 days of depuration fig 1 a however at higher concentrations oocysts were detected in the haemolymph from 1 day of exposure 10 of positive samples and the number of positive mussels increased until 21 days of exposure and reached 100 for the highest dose mussels remained positive to t gondii throughout the 21 days of the depuration period whatever the exposure dose for each sampling time the percentage of positive mussels increased with the protozoa concentration in water in mussel tissues t gondii oocysts were consistently detected from day 1 of exposure period until the end of the day 21 of depuration at all oocyst concentrations fig 1 b during the accumulation phase all samples were positive from 1 day of exposure at the highest concentration and from 3 days at the two lower concentrations 100 and 1000 oocysts mussel day during depuration all mussels remained positive at the two highest doses while the percentage tended to decrease at 100 oocysts mussel day the percentage of mussels positive to g duodenalis cysts increased with the protozoa concentration in water at each sampling time in the haemolymph and in tissues fig 1 in the haemolymph g duodenalis cysts were detected from day 1 of the exposure period until the end of the 21 days of depuration fig 1 c the percentage of positive haemolymph samples increased during the exposure period it reached more than 50 of positive samples at the two lowest concentrations and 100 at the highest concentration and remained relatively steady throughout the depuration period only varying by 20 cysts were detected in tissues later than in the haemolymph fig 1 d i e after 7 days 10 2 days 40 or 1 day 50 of exposure to 100 1000 and 10 000 cysts mussel day respectively the percentage of positive tissues increased until 21 days of exposure and cysts were still detected in mussel tissues after 21 days of depuration few haemolymph and tissues samples positive to c parvum were detected fig 1 in the haemolymph fig 1 e the percentage of detection increased between 14 and 21 days of exposure for the two highest concentrations and decreased during the depuration period in tissues fig 1 f detection slightly increased with the oocyst concentration at each sampling time no clear trend was observed and the percentage of positive mussels did not exceed 50 in the haemolymph or in tissues 3 2 2 protozoa quantification we failed to quantify part of the samples detected as protozoa positive because the amount of bioaccumulated protozoa was below the loq the number of samples above the loq is summarized in table 2 quantification results are presented in graphs if at least 50 of the samples had values greater than the lod95 and if at least 30 of those samples had values greater than the loq per modality consequently only the numbers of t gondii oocysts bioaccumulated in tissues at 1000 and 10 000 oocysts bivalve day fig 2 and the numbers of g duodenalis cysts bioaccumulated in the haemolymph at 10 000 cysts bivalve day fig 3 and in tissues at 1000 and 10 000 cysts bivalve day fig 4 are presented in the graphs the number of t gondii oocysts bioaccumulated in tissues fig 2 did not significantly vary throughout the exposure period with 10 2 3 8 and 166 4 231 4 oocysts at 1000 and 10 000 oocysts mussel day respectively then a non significant decrease was observed after 3 days of depuration with 3 1 2 6 and 18 2 10 8 oocysts at 1000 and 10 000 oocysts mussel day respectively oocysts still accumulated in mussel tissues even after 21 days of depuration with 7 7 only one positive sample and 38 2 61 5 oocysts respectively the quantity of bioaccumulated oocysts was not significantly different between the two concentrations all sampling times combined the numbers of g duodenalis cysts in the haemolymph significantly increased on day 21 of the exposure period 218 7 143 3 compared to day 3 15 8 0 6 and day 7 20 9 7 7 of exposure fig 3 during the depuration period the number of cysts per mussel significantly decreased after 1 day 32 7 19 9 and cysts remained in the haemolymph for at least 21 days 36 1 13 6 in tissues fig 4 the number of cysts per mussel was very variable and no significant difference was shown at 1000 cysts mussel day or between the two concentrations at 10 000 cysts mussel day the number of bioaccumulated cysts after 1 day of depuration 15 1 19 9 was significantly higher than after 3 days 2 0 2 2 and 7 days 2 5 2 4 of exposure then at 1000 and 10 000 cysts mussel day a non significant decrease was observed after 3 days of depuration 1 8 1 4 and 4 3 4 9 respectively compared to 2 days of depuration 12 5 22 9 and 13 4 18 7 respectively the cyst level remained similar in tissues until 21 days of depuration with 15 9 25 4 and 25 6 46 0 cysts per mussel at 1000 and 10 000 cysts mussel day respectively 4 discussion the waterborne transmission of c parvum and g duodenalis is well documented adam et al 2016 identified 242 giardiosis outbreaks including 74 6 with a waterborne origin between 1972 and 2011 likewise among the 70 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks reported between 2000 and 2010 56 4 had a waterborne origin putignani and menichella 2010 the prevalence of t gondii oocysts in watercourses has been studied only recently between 2004 and 2010 out of 325 waterborne protozoa outbreaks reported 2 were caused by t gondii baldursson and karanis 2011 for example t gondii oocysts were found in 27 2 n 114 of drinking water samples in poland sroka et al 2006 c parvum oocysts were detected in 10 2 n 167 32 7 n 52 and 35 n 26 and g duodenalis in 8 4 n 167 36 5 n 52 and 12 n 26 of drinking water samples in portugal almeida et al 2010 spain castro hermida et al 2010 and japan hashimoto et al 2002 respectively considering the low doses required for these parasites to infect humans positive detection in water reflects a health risk this study addresses for the first time exposure of zebra mussels to g duodenalis and t gondii for 21 days and the subsequent depuration kinetics the percentages of detection provided relevant results for assessing the presence of protozoa loads in aquatic environments detection of t gondii and g duodenalis in zebra mussel tissues or haemolymph indeed provided early diagnosis i e as early as after 1 day of exposure to 100 oo cysts mussel day oo cysts were still detected after 21 days of depuration therefore the method could reflect present or recent contamination of water bodies moreover the percentages of positive samples appeared to reflect contamination levels with different levels of sensitivity depending on the compartment tissues or haemolymph this may be related to lod95 which differed according to each protozoan and each mussel compartment for g duodenalis contamination was detected in the haemolymph from 1 day of exposure with 10 30 or 60 of positive samples for punctual contamination levels of 1 9 x 103 1 9 x 104 and 1 9 x 105 cysts l 1 respectively but contamination was not detected in the tissue samples the percentage of positive haemolymph samples could reflect contamination by cysts whether occasional or chronic over a time span of 21 days a percentage of 80 100 was representative of contamination ranging from 5 3 x 105 to more than 4 3 x 106 cysts l 1 while a percentage of 10 20 reflected a cyst level ranging from 1 9 x 103 to 5 3 x 104 cysts l 1 the percentage of positive mussels remained relatively stable throughout the depuration period 20 variation and clearly distinct for each contamination level 10 30 60 80 or 90 100 after chronic exposure to 4 3 x 104 4 3 x 105 and 4 3 x 106 cysts l 1 respectively the same patterns were observed in tissues with later and lower detection percentages of 10 on average for each cyst concentration contrary to g duodenalis t gondii was detected earlier in tissues than in the haemolymph the percentage of positive tissues reached 100 from 5 3 x 103 oocysts l 1 and remained stable for the 21 days of depuration after chronic exposure 21 days at 4 3 x 105 oocysts l 1 t gondii detection in the haemolymph samples occurred later but still provided an assessment of t gondii levels in water all haemolymph samples were positive following exposure to only 4 3 x 106 oocysts l 1 10 30 of positive samples reflected oocyst levels ranging from 1 1e4 to 1 1 x 105 oocysts l 1 while 80 90 of positive samples tended to reflect contamination by 2 8e5 to 4 3 x 105 oocysts l 1 zebra mussels integrated protozoan contamination over the 21 days of depuration this underlines their ability to reflect past contamination of the water environment previous studies also showed integration of contamination by t gondii palos ladeiro et al 2015 c parvum and g duodenalis graczyk et al 2003 for 14 days of depuration in zebra mussels in marine species t gondii oocysts were still detected in m galloprovincialis 21 days after inoculation arkush et al 2003 and c parvum oocysts remained detected in gills and haemocytes of crassostrea virginica 12 days after exposure fayer et al 1997 in agreement with our results c parvum oocysts persisted 14 days after inoculation in the freshwater mollusc corbicula fluminea graczyk et al 1998 many samples were not quantifiable with protozoa loads in mussels was no representative of the water contamination level nevertheless our experiment provided further details on bioaccumulation of oo cysts between 1 and 3 days of depuration the number of t gondii oocysts bioaccumulated in zebra mussel tissues dropped between 1 and 2 days of depuration and then a minimal quantity per mussel seemed to persist up to 21 days of depuration palos ladeiro et al 2015 also showed a sharp decrease in the number of bioaccumulated oocysts after one week of depuration which then remained the same the 2 following weeks for g duodenalis an increasing trend was observed in tissues after 1 day in clear water compared to the exposure period simultaneously in the haemolymph a significant increase of the number of cysts was observed after 21 days of exposure followed by a decrease after 1 day in clear water therefore zebra mussels appeared to transfer cysts from the haemolymph to tissues in the depuration period which explained the concentration of g duodenalis cysts after 1 day in clear water as previously observed palos ladeiro et al 2015 t gondii oocysts seemed to be less detected in the haemolymph than in tissues as opposed to t gondii oocysts g duodenalis cysts seemed to be more accumulated in the haemolymph than in tissues especially during the exposure period despite a higher loq in tissues than in the haemolymph these two protozoa could be managed differently by zebra mussel cells t gondii oocysts and g duodenalis cysts have different sizes 10 13 μm and 12 15 μm respectively and wall structures adam 2001 dumètre et al 2013 moreover some authors have shown the presence of lectins in the gills and labial palp mucus in crassostrea virginica pales espinosa et al 2009 and m edulis pales espinosa et al 2010 these lectins recognized some carbohydrates on the surfaces of filtered particles that is used for a biochemical selection of particles this mechanism could explain the differences between the number of t gondii oocysts and g duodenalis cysts accumulated by d polymorpha the higher lod95 for c parvum oocysts might explain its low detection in zebra mussel matrix whether haemolymph or tissue moreover c parvum oocysts have a small diameter 4 5 μm fayer et al 2000 and their wall also has a different composition dumètre et al 2012 than t gondii oocysts and g duodenalis cysts therefore cellular management and biochemical selection of c parvum oocysts by zebra mussels could lead to lower bioaccumulation or destruction of c parvum oocysts in vitro experiments showed that c parvum oocysts could be internalized by d polymorpha haemocytes palos ladeiro et al 2018 whereas t gondii and g duodenalis oo cysts were trapped in haemocyte aggregates owing to their large size le guernic et al 2018 these explanations are in agreement with the findings of other studies in which c fluminea haemocytes internalized c parvum oocysts in vivo graczyk et al 1998 and phagocytized them in vitro graczyk et al 1997 this might explain the difference in the dna quantities we detected in mussels whether from t gondii g duodenalis or c parvum oo cysts molecular techniques seemed to underline a higher accumulation of t gondii oocysts than g duodenalis cysts and c parvum oocysts in zebra mussels as previously highlighted palos ladeiro et al 2014 this could be explained by the differences in lod95 and loq observed for each parasite in tissues and in the haemolymph the extraction method led to a sensitive lod95 for t gondii 1 5 oocysts mussel and g duodenalis 1 cyst mussel in tissues but was less efficient for c parvum 50 100 oocysts mussel the literature does nor provide any data on the lod of molecular techniques for g duodenalis cyst detection in shellfish however our results highlighted a significant improvement in detection sensitivity for t gondii and c parvum oocysts in mussel tissues staggs et al 2015 found a lod 1000 t gondii and c parvum oocysts per mytilus spp tissues by taqman qpcr targeting the repeat region gene and esmerini et al 2010 found a lod ranging between 100 and 1000 t gondii oocysts per sample in mytella guyanensis and c rhiziphorae by nested pcr targeting the b1 gene the present study highlighted a lod ranging between 10 and 50 t gondii oocysts in mussel haemolymph samples the same sensitivity was highlighted in perna canaliculus haemolymph by qpcr targeting the repeat region gene coupe et al 2019 but detection was more sensitive in mytilus spp haemolymph with a lod ranging between 1 and 10 oocysts by taqman qpcr repeat region gene staggs et al 2015 for c parvum the lod ranged between 50 and 100 oocysts in zebra mussel staggs et al 2015 highlighted similar sensitivity in mytilus spp the extraction technique should be improved for c parvum in future experiments the current extraction protocol 1 could be too drastic and might damage the dna integrity of c parvum oocysts or on the contrary 2 might partially damage the integrity of the oocyst wall and reduce access to oocyst dna in order to verify these hypotheses it would be necessary to test different parameters of the dna extraction protocol ahmed and karanis 2018 trypsin digestion heat shock cycles manore et al 2019 ultrasonic treatment homogenization frequency however improving the method for c parvum might alter the performance for t gondii and g duodenalis zebra mussels could concentrate these two protozoa for a few weeks even during the depuration period and could be used as an integrative matrix for biomonitoring aquatic ecosystems the percentage of positive mussels used allows to limit the risk of false negatives compared to protozoa quantification in mussel matrix and reflect a health risk the number of positive mussels could predict the water contamination level in water therefore additional studies are needed to improve the sensitivity of this model our results underline higher numbers of positive samples and lower lod95 and loq for tissue samples than for haemolymph samples for the tree protozoa thus within the framework of protozoa biomonitoring in watercourses it seems more appropriate to search for protozoa in tissue samples in the light of these results we propose to analyze whole zebra mussels without haemolymph punction this method was previouly used in our laboratory and did not impact the quality of dna extraction or protozoa quantification the lod95 and loq remained unchanged data not shown this simplifies handling and handlers would not need any knowledge of zebra mussel anatomy or dissection in addition using pooled tissues with pool of similar weights could make the technique more reliable and limit inter individual variation caused by zebra mussel size for example lucy et al 2010 d polymorpha can be used for passive and active biomonitoring the establishment of a reference population could provide a rapid and sustainable supply of zebra mussels to facilitate its caging however one should keep in mind that zebra mussel is an invasive species that cannot be used outside its distribution area but since it is mainly present in europe and north america its use as a biomonitoring tool can still be applied in many countries moreover this methodology is less expensive and time consuming than the current normative process iso 15553 2006 and makes it possible to monitor contamination by protozoan oo cysts and reduce the variability of the results induced by water quality the sampling period physicochemical parameters using protozoa concentration in mussel tissues 5 conclusion this study highlights a high sensitivity of molecular techniques for detecting g duodenalis and t gondii in mussel matrix i e 1 5 t gondii oocysts mussel and less than 1 g duodenalis cyst mussel the percentage of detection in mussels could highlight present or past protozoa contamination and reflect the contamination level of water bodies d polymorpha also concentrated c parvum oocysts but our technique was less sensitive and still needs to be improved zebra mussels are sedentary organisms with a worldwide distribution allowing for the monitoring of a wide range of water bodies implementing this biomonitoring would be easier than the current normative process iso 15553 2006 and may limit result variation caused by water quality the sampling period or physicochemical parameters the use of zebra mussels as an integrative tool may allow for assessing water quality in terms of protozoa contamination and could consequently help to

18251,the emergence and spread of resistance to antibiotics among bacteria is the most serious global threat to public health in recent and coming decades in this study we characterized qualitatively and quantitatively β lactamase and carbapenemase genes in the wastewater resistome of central wastewater treatment plant in koziegłowy poland the research concerns determination of the frequency of genes conferring resistance to β lactam and carbapenem antibiotics in the genomes of culturable bacteria as well as in the wastewater metagenome at three stages of treatment raw sewage aeration tank and final effluent in the final effluent we found bacteria with genes that pose the greatest threat to public health including genes of extended spectrum β lactamases bla ctx m carbapenemases bla ndm bla vim bla ges bla oxa 48 and showed that during the wastewater treatment their frequency increased moreover the wastewater treatment process leads to significant increase in the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ges genes and tend to increase the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla shv and bla oxa 48 genes in the effluent metagenome the biodiversity of bacterial populations increased during the wastewater treatment and there was a correlation between the change in the composition of bacterial populations and the variation of relative abundance of β lactamase and carbapenemase genes pcr based quantitative metagenomic analysis combined with analyses based on culture methods provided significant information on the routes of arbs and args spread through wwtp the limited effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes in the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes impose the need to develop an effective strategy and implement additional methods of wastewater disinfection in order to limit the increase and the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment keywords antibiotic resistance escherichia coli coliforms esbl cpe 1 introduction the occurrence of drug resistance in bacteria is an unquestionable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections and according to who who 2015 2017 one of the most serious global threats in the 21st century

wwtps creates excellent conditions and routes for spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args ben said et al 2016 turolla et al 2018 osińska et al 2019 the peculiar features of wastewaters like the high number of bacteria originating from different sources high nutrients content and the presence of trace concentrations of antimicrobials heavy metals and

antibiotic resistance worldwide to protect human animal health and environment king et al 2008 robinson et al 2016 rousham et al 2018 assessment of antibiotic resistance in the environment based only on cultivable bacteria generate biased results as approximately only 1 of bacteria can be cultivated in vitro amann et al 1995 quantitative pcr analysis of metagenomic dna can be a good estimation of the level of contamination by known args berendonk et al 2015 despite growing number of publications concerning arb and args in wwtps the wastewater resistome is still poorly characterized when it comes to β lactamase and especially carbapenemase genes therefore the aim of this study was to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively wastewater resistome during the sewage treatment as a model

ctx m bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla kpc p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 041 p 0 027 respectively between raw sewage and the sewage from aeration tank an increase between aeration tank and the effluent was noted for bla ges p 0 001 and between raw sewage and the effluent for bla ges and bla tem p 0 001 p 0 018 respectively the relative abundance for bla oxa 1 bla ndm bla kpc and bla vim decreased between raw sewage and the effluent of 47 19 56 8 96 0 and 98 7 respectively the relative abundances of several β lactamases and carbapenemases genes were correlated with each other both positively and negatively supplementary table s10 3 5 taxonomic composition the ngs sequencing of the v4 16s rrna gene fragment showed that the microbial community present in the raw sewage consisted of 31 families within four dominant phyla accounted for more than 1 of the bacterial taxa present in the sample of bacteria the raw sewage was dominated by campylobacteraceae and moraxellaceae belonging to the proteobacteria fig 3 the population of microorganisms in aeration tank consisted of 29 families within five dominant phyla the dominant families in this site were comamonadaceae proteobacteria and chitinophagaceae bacteroidetes fig 3 the effluent population exhibited the highest number of taxa and at the same time the highest diversity the population consisted of 49 families belonging to five dominant phyla the pseudomonadaceae and comamonadaceae proteobacteria were the most frequently recorded families fig 3 there were statistically significant differences in the taxonomic composition between raw sewage aeration tank and effluent p 0 003 during the wastewater treatment process the diversity of the taxonomic composition increased which was supported by the shannon h index values reaching the highest value 3 107 for the effluent compared to 2 489 and 2 486 for raw sewage and aeration tank respectively supplementary table s11 principal coordinates analyses pcoa revealed that the taxonomic structure of the wwtp microbiota was clustered into three groups that correlated with raw sewage aeration tank and final effluent fig 4 a results of spatial distribution obtained for relative abundance of all resistance genes analyzed were also divided into three groups fig 4c which showed diversity between raw sewage aeration tank and effluent the most homogeneous group was the effluent whereas in the two remaining groups the relative abundance was more diverse as the groups contained elements of both the raw sewage and the aeration tank the hierarchical clustering of the population composition fig 4b as well as relative abundance of genes fig 4d confirmed the results obtained by pcoa the dendrogram of the relative abundance of genes and the pcoa plot for taxonomic variability showed a correlation between the change in the composition of bacterial populations and the variation of relative abundance of genes in individual samples and vice versa 4 discussion misuse of antibiotics resulted in rapid increase of antimicrobial resistance among clinically relevant bacteria and their spread in the environment particularly in and via water van boeckel et al 2014 turano et al 2016 conte et al 2017 lamba and ahammad 2017 osińska et al 2017 bacteria resistant to antibiotics and resistance genes present in the environment are considered biotic pollutants and a direct threat to the public health martinez 2009 nascimento et al 2017 resistance to β lactams and carbapenems antibiotics used to treat the most serious infections caused by gram negative bacteria poses a serious problem in medicine leaving little if any therapeutic options considering the fact that resistance to that group of antimicrobials is often associated with resistance to other drugs such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones naquin et al 2017 in this study we depicted the wastewater resistome when it comes to bacterial resistance to β lactams and carbapenems and its relationship with the composition of the sewage population at three stages of wastewater treatment the central wastewater treatment plant collects sewage from poznań which is the fifth largest city in poland and surrounded communes of which some are agricultural thus the sewage may contain both household and hospital wastes and agricultural runoffs metagenomic approach is a valuable source of information during the analysis of antibiotic resistance in the environment and allows determining full characteristics of the wastewater resistome and its impact on river water the treatment of sewage reduced significantly the total number of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms which was reflected by the decrease of 16s rrna gene copy number in the metagenome of the effluent in comparison with that of the raw sewage 99 5 the highest average copy number of 16s rrna gene was recorded for the wastewater from aeration tank 1 0 109 copies ml while the lowest in the effluent 2 5 106 copies ml these values indicated two to three orders of magnitude higher numbers of bacteria than those obtained in culturable analyses the copy number of 16s rrna gene in wastewater at different stages of treatment depends on bacterial load of the sewage similar values were reported for polish wwtps higher for chinese and american ones walia et al 2016 yang et al 2016b wang et al 2017 significant reduction of the number of 16s rrna gene copies in the effluent in comparison with the raw sewage metagenome have been reported for many mechanical biological wwtps makowska et al 2016 mcconnell et al 2018 bondarczuk and piotrowska seget 2019 yet sometimes as in the case of the effluent from several wwtps including those in cluj county romania jinan china and warmia and mazury north eastern poland 16s rrna gene copy number was not significantly reduced in treatment process szekeres et al 2017 wang et al 2017 korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 esbl producing coliforms cpe and oxa 48 type cpe strains were present in the sewage at each treatment stage also in the final effluent where their frequency increased compared to raw sewage from 0 18 to 0 39 0 30 0 36 and 0 0009 0 001 respectively although not significantly still the results of our study support assumptions that the mechanical biological wwtp does not eliminate bacteria with the most serious resistance mechanisms the phenomenon of the presence of drug resistant strains in effluent is undoubtedly related to inadequacy of the sewage treatment which is firstly meant to reduce the total number of bacteria and does not assume the presence of arbs accompanied by subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics chemotherapeutics and other pollutants those factors facilitate acquisition of resistance by hgt and may also select for resistant strains in aeration tank michael et al 2013 mao et al 2015 the increase in the frequency of esbl producing and cpe bacteria in effluent may be also related to the presence of biofilms which according to lépesová et al 2018 are largely created by coliforms and in turn the multiresistant bacteria have a special potential for its formation the args detected in the genomes of bacteria cultured from sewage at all treatment stages included six genes conferring esbl phenotype bla ctx m bla shv bla tem bla oxa 1 bla cmy and bla dha and four determining carbapenem resistance bla ges bla oxa 48 bla vim and bla ndm in the genomes of esbl producing coliforms bla ctx m was the dominant gene which supports the concept of its most dynamic evolution and spread tacão et al 2012 picão et al 2013 oliveira et al 2014 de araujo et al 2016 dropa et al 2016 turano et al 2016 campana et al 2017 conte et al 2017 yang et al 2017 in the genomes of cpe strains bla ges 30 3 bla vim 7 8 bla ndm 6 2 and bla oxa 48 present in 74 3 of oxa 48 type cpe strains genes were identified with bla vim and bla ndm most frequently detected in strains isolated from effluent in a hospital wwtp in basel switzerland the bla vim gene was recorded in 8 2 presumptive cpe strains interestingly no bla vim harboring strains were found in the effluent which shows that they were effectively eliminated during the wastewater treatment process zurfluh et al 2017 on the other hand cpe strains with bla ndm have been reported in bacteria from the effluent of a wwtp in tianjin china where they survived even the disinfection process yang et al 2016b in poland there was a dramatic increase in cpe presence since 2013 which is an alarming threat to public health rapid increase of ndm producing enterobacteriaceae in poland started from 2012 when first ndm positive k pneumoniae strain of unknown origin spread in the area of poznań and then in warsaw baraniak et al 2016 although the situation in the poznań area is said to be successfully controlled since the mid 2014 in the raw sewage and the final effluent we were detecting strains with bla ndm in sampling events till 2017 we also noted high incidence of strains with bla oxa 48 gene oxa 48 type carbapenemase producers have been reported in poland from 2012 majewski et al 2014 in our study alarmingly high incidence of bacteria harbouring bla ndm and bla oxa 48 genes in the effluent could indicate the spread of the genes among bacteria in the previous stages of treatment taking into account the official number of infections caused by bla ndm and bla oxa 48 strains literacka et al 2019 we assume more frequent than expected occurrence of the genes in sewage due to their presence in strains from non clinical environment comprising human and animal intestinal microbiota and agricultural run offs previous studies have shown that bla ctx m genes and most importantly bla kpc and bla ndm are located within the group of incf plasmids responsible for the emergence and global spread of genes encoding esbl and carbapenemase as well as bacterial virulence coque et al 2008 gonullu et al 2008 carattoli 2009 calisto et al 2011 kumarasamy and kalyanasundaram 2012 wibberg et al 2013 bevan et al 2017 these plasmids are stable and persist in the bacterial cells even in the absence of selective pressure carattoli 2009 they most often occur in clinical enterobacteriaceae strains including e coli salmonella enterica klebsiella pneumonia yersinia pestis and y pseudotuberculosis but can also spread among strictly environmental strains carattoli et al 2001 marcadé et al 2009 garcía fernández et al 2010 villa et al 2010 yang et al 2016b we identified bla ndm only in coliforms which were the primary goal of our research but disturbing is the fact that it could have been transferred to bacteria belonging to species of other not only gram negative genera enterococcus faecium acinetobacter seohaensis and wautersiella falsenii yang et al 2016b therefore we can presume that the number of bla ndm harbouring bacteria in the final effluent is underestimated traditional approach based on analysis of dna isolated from bacteria cultured from wastewater samples is limited and does not present the full characteristics of the resistome therefore quantitative analysis of wastewater metagenome was performed we quantified genes which were the most abundant in the genomes of culturable coliforms or the most alarming bla ctx m bla tem bla ges bla shv bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla vim and bla kpc the copy number of all tested args in the effluent decreased during the wastewater treatment process which was parallel to the reduction of both culturable bacteria and 16s rrna gene copy number in the sewage metagenome among the analyzed genes the highest mean copy number was obtained for the bla oxa 1 gene which in raw sewage and aeration tank was only an order of magnitude lower than the number of bacteria estimated on the basis of the 16s rrna gene copy number the bla oxa 1 gene analyzed by using universal primers to detect several bla oxa variants determine oxacillinase production which does not confer resistance to carbapenems in the effluent metagenome the highest average gene copy number was found for bla ges and bla oxa 1 while the lowest was recorded for the bla vim and bla kpc genes the five most frequently occurring genes in wastewater metagenome were bla ges bla tem bla oxa 48 bla shv bla ctx m the relative abundance of these genes calculated on the basis of the copy number of the 16s rrna gene 4 increased in the effluent metagenome compared to the raw sewage metagenome a significant increase in the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla kpc genes observed in the metagenome of aeration tank sewage may indicate enhanced hgt processes and or selection of isolates with resistance genes in the central wastewater treatment plant sewage metagenome the values of gene relative abundances reached relatively high levels compared to other reports the increase of bla tem relative abundance 10 3 copy number 16s rrna during mechanical biological wastewater treatment with uv disinfection was also observed in studies regarding args in wwtp in jinan china wang et al 2017 much lower values of the relative abundance calculated by dividing the resistance gene copy number by 16s rrna gene copy number for bla ctx m 10 4 bla tem 10 5 and bla shv 10 5 were observed in the effluent from a hospital wwtp in michigan usa walia et al 2016 in a hospital wwtp with chlorine disinfection in romania lower relative abundances of bla shv 10 3 and bla vim 10 5 were found in effluent szekeres et al 2017 the quantitative analysis of args present in the metagenome effluent in spain showed the accumulation of bla kpc and bla ndm genes determining resistance to carbapenems 0 006 and 0 3 respectively that was in contrast to our study in which the decrease of relative abundance of these genes was noted 0 001 and 0 2 respectively subirats et al 2017 this supports the possibility of the spread of β lactamases and carbapenemases genes in high concentration in regions with favorable hot and humid climate nordmann and poirel 2014 a decrease in the frequency of bla ndm bla vim and bla kpc genes was demonstrated in a wwtp in china yang et al 2016a quantitative arg analysis in metagenomic dna showed that the bla tem bla ctx m bla shv bla ges bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla kpc and bla vim genes are moderately and strongly correlated with each other that may be explained by similar mechanisms of arg removal during wastewater treatment munir et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 but may also indicate the coexistence of these args on a common mobile genetic element like plasmid or within integron structure which enables their spread by the hgt bonnin et al 2013 liapis et al 2019 moura et al 2009 our results indicated that during the wastewater treatment there is an increase of relative abundance of genes conferring resistance to β lactams including carbapenems most threatening for public health bla ctx m bla tem bla ges bla shv and bla oxa 48 at the same time a decrease in the relative abundance of bla ndm bla vim and bla kpc genes was demonstrated still the effluent of central wwtp in koziegłowy remains a reservoir of carbapenem resistance genes that spread into the environment via a route which with warta river water leads to animals directly to humans or to potable water intakes located downstream the effluent discharge point as the microbial population composition might facilitate the interactions between transfer units involved in spreading antibiotic resistance because antibiotics amplify particular genetic exchange communities baquero et al 2013 pal et al 2016 we analyzed the composition of bacterial population in the wastewater metagenome by next generation sequencing of 16s rrna gene determination of the diversity degree of bacterial populations with the shannon biodiversity index between the three sampling sites indicated the effluent as the most diverse in terms of the composition of bacterial populations an increase in bacterial richness in the final effluent has been also observed in a wwtp in china tang et al 2016 increasing taxonomic diversity during the wastewater treatment process may be related to formation of biofilms in the environment of wwtp wakelin et al 2008 peng et al 2018 the pcoa analysis and hierarchical clustering indicated relationship between the composition of bacterial populations and relative abundance of genes at different stages of the wastewater treatment process bacterial composition and horizontal gene transfer are speculated to be the major factors that shape wwtp resistomes fernandes et al 2019 ju et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 on the other hand in other settings like food waste composting environmental factors rather than bacterial community composition may be associated with changes in arg abundance liao et al 2019 5 conclusions our results indicate that the final effluent contains arb with genes that pose the greatest threat to the public health including genes coding for extended spectrum β lactamases bla ctx m and carbapenemases bla ndm bla vim bla ges bla oxa 48 during wastewater treatment the frequency of these bacteria tends to increase the wastewater treatment process leads to significant increase in the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ges genes and tends to increase the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla shv and bla oxa 48 genes in the effluent metagenome which consequently enriches the surface water resistome the increased relative abundance of the bla ctx m bla tem bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla kpc genes in the resistome of sewage from the aeration chamber indicates selection in activated sludge there is a relationship between the composition of bacterial populations and relative abundance of genes at different stages of the wastewater treatment process quantitative metagenomic analysis combined with analysis based on culturable methods provides significant information on the limited effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes in the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes this indicates the need to develop an effective strategy and implement additional methods of wastewater

18251,the emergence and spread of resistance to antibiotics among bacteria is the most serious global threat to public health in recent and coming decades in this study we characterized qualitatively and quantitatively β lactamase and carbapenemase genes in the wastewater resistome of central wastewater treatment plant in koziegłowy poland the research concerns determination of the frequency of genes conferring resistance to β lactam and carbapenem antibiotics in the genomes of culturable bacteria as well as in the wastewater metagenome at three stages of treatment raw sewage aeration tank and final effluent in the final effluent we found bacteria with genes that pose the greatest threat to public health including genes of extended spectrum β lactamases bla ctx m carbapenemases bla ndm bla vim bla ges bla oxa 48 and showed that during the wastewater treatment their frequency increased moreover the wastewater treatment process leads to significant increase in the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ges genes and tend to increase the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla shv and bla oxa 48 genes in the effluent metagenome the biodiversity of bacterial populations increased during the wastewater treatment and there was a correlation between the change in the composition of bacterial populations and the variation of relative abundance of β lactamase and carbapenemase genes pcr based quantitative metagenomic analysis combined with analyses based on culture methods provided significant information on the routes of arbs and args spread through wwtp the limited effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes in the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes impose the need to develop an effective strategy and implement additional methods of wastewater disinfection in order to limit the increase and the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment keywords antibiotic resistance escherichia coli coliforms esbl cpe 1 introduction the occurrence of drug resistance in bacteria is an unquestionable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections and according to who who 2015 2017 one of the most serious global threats in the 21st century intensive and uncontrolled use and overuse of antibiotics not only therapeutically in human and veterinary medicine and in animal breeding and agriculture has provoked the worldwide spread of

wwtps creates excellent conditions and routes for spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args ben said et al 2016 turolla et al 2018 osińska et al 2019 the peculiar features of wastewaters like the high number of bacteria originating from different sources high nutrients content and the presence of trace concentrations of antimicrobials heavy metals and biocides may facilitate the flow of args among bacteria by horizontal gene transfer hgt and increase their frequency in the effluent czekalski et al 2012 rizzo et al 2013 berglund et al 2015 garner et al 2018 proia et al 2018 the production of extended spectrum β lactamases esbl which are mainly plasmid encoded enzymes conferring resistance to third and fourth generation cephalosporins and

esbls belonging to class a according to bush and jacoby 2010 are the most common among all β lactamases apart from being the most prevalent esbl produced by strains isolated from human infections they occur in environmental bacteria and represent the most dynamically evolving family of β lactamases worldwide bonnet 2004 bush 2013 blair et al 2015 bevan et al 2017 another serious treatment problem and the greatest threat to public health are carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae cpe that are causative agents of infections associated with high morbidity and mortality nasri et al 2017 isolates producing metallo β lactamases e g ndm or vim type and carbapenemases like kpc ges or oxa 48 are clinically most important and particularly dangerous as they are often pandrug resistant and leave no treatment options walsh 2010 nasri et al 2017 as it is not clear to what extent environmental arb and args promote the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria global efforts are required to characterize and quantify antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment berendonk et al 2015 research on the spread of antibiotic resistance is one of the areas of the one health

antibiotic resistance worldwide to protect human animal health and environment king et al 2008 robinson et al 2016 rousham et al 2018 assessment of antibiotic resistance in the environment based only on cultivable bacteria generate biased results as approximately only 1 of bacteria can be cultivated in vitro amann et al 1995 quantitative pcr analysis of metagenomic dna can be a good estimation of the level of contamination by known args berendonk et al 2015 despite growing number of publications concerning arb and args in wwtps the wastewater resistome is still poorly characterized when it comes to β lactamase and especially carbapenemase genes therefore the aim of this study was to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively wastewater resistome during the sewage treatment as a model

bla ges and bla vim was the highest in raw sewage and the lowest in the effluent the removal efficiency of args was the least for bla ges 94 8 and bla ctx m 95 29 whereas for the remaining genes it exceeded 98 bla oxa 48 99 5 bla ndm 99 7 bla tem 98 5 bla shv 98 8 bla kpc 99 97 and bla vim 99 98 there were no statistically significant differences between samplings sites and different seasons there was moderate strong and very strong correlation between the copy number per ml of the analyzed genes except for bla ges and bla kpc supplementary table s8 to determine the relative abundance of β lactamase and carbapenemase genes in the metagenome samples the copy number of the resistance genes in each site was normalized to the copy number of bacterial 16s rrna gene supplementary table s7 the highest mean values of bla ges bla tem and bla shv genes relative abundance were observed in the final effluent supplementary table s9 table 1 fig 2b the relative abundance of bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla tem bla ctx m and bla kpc genes increased in the sewage metagenome from aeration tank compared to that of raw sewage and for bla oxa 1 bla ndm and bla kpc decreased and reached the lowest values in effluent in the case of bla vim the relative abundance decreased during wastewater treatment the highest mean gene relative abundance in the metagenome of raw sewage was observed for bla oxa

lactamases and carbapenemases genes with the exception of bla oxa 1 bla shv and bla vim between raw sewage aeration tank and effluent p 0 001 treatment process increased the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla kpc p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 041 p 0 027 respectively between raw sewage and the sewage from aeration tank an increase between aeration tank and the effluent was noted for bla ges p 0 001 and between raw sewage and the effluent for bla ges and bla tem p 0 001 p 0 018 respectively the relative abundance for bla oxa 1 bla ndm bla kpc and bla vim decreased between raw

supplementary table s10 3 5 taxonomic composition the ngs sequencing of the v4 16s rrna gene fragment showed that the microbial community present in the raw sewage consisted of 31 families within four dominant phyla accounted for more than 1 of the bacterial taxa present in the sample of bacteria the raw sewage was dominated by campylobacteraceae and moraxellaceae belonging to the proteobacteria fig 3 the population of microorganisms in aeration tank consisted of 29 families within five dominant phyla the dominant families in this site were comamonadaceae proteobacteria and chitinophagaceae bacteroidetes fig 3 the effluent population exhibited the highest number of taxa and at the same time the highest diversity the population consisted of 49 families belonging to five dominant phyla the pseudomonadaceae and comamonadaceae proteobacteria were the most frequently recorded families fig 3 there were statistically significant differences in the taxonomic composition between raw sewage aeration tank and effluent p 0 003 during the wastewater treatment process the diversity of the taxonomic composition increased which was supported by the shannon h index values reaching the highest value 3 107 for the effluent compared to 2 489 and 2 486 for raw sewage and aeration tank respectively supplementary table s11 principal coordinates analyses pcoa revealed that the taxonomic structure of the wwtp microbiota was clustered into three groups that correlated with raw sewage aeration tank and final effluent fig 4 a results of spatial distribution obtained for relative abundance of all resistance genes analyzed were also divided into three groups fig 4c which showed diversity between raw sewage aeration tank and effluent the most homogeneous group was the effluent whereas in the two remaining groups the relative abundance was more diverse as the groups contained elements of both the raw sewage and the aeration tank the hierarchical clustering of the population composition fig 4b as well as relative abundance of genes fig 4d confirmed the results obtained by pcoa the dendrogram of the relative abundance of genes and the pcoa plot for taxonomic variability showed a correlation between the change in the composition of bacterial populations and the variation of relative abundance of genes in individual samples and vice versa 4 discussion misuse of antibiotics resulted in rapid increase of antimicrobial resistance among clinically relevant bacteria and their spread in the environment particularly in and via water van boeckel et al 2014 turano et al 2016 conte et al 2017 lamba and ahammad 2017 osińska et al 2017 bacteria resistant to antibiotics and resistance genes present in the environment are considered biotic pollutants and a direct threat to the public health martinez 2009 nascimento et al 2017 resistance to β lactams and carbapenems antibiotics used to treat the most serious infections caused by gram negative bacteria poses a serious problem in medicine leaving little if any therapeutic options considering the fact that resistance to that group of antimicrobials is often associated with resistance to other drugs such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones naquin et al 2017 in this study we depicted the wastewater resistome when it comes to bacterial resistance to β lactams and carbapenems and its relationship with the composition of the sewage population at three stages of wastewater treatment the central wastewater treatment plant collects sewage from poznań which is the fifth largest city in poland and surrounded communes of which some are agricultural thus the sewage may contain both household and hospital wastes and agricultural runoffs metagenomic approach is a valuable source of information during the analysis of antibiotic resistance in the environment and allows determining full characteristics of the wastewater resistome and its impact on river water the treatment of sewage reduced significantly the total number of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and coliforms which was reflected by the decrease of 16s rrna gene copy number in the metagenome of the effluent in comparison with that of the raw sewage 99 5 the highest average copy number of 16s rrna gene was recorded for the wastewater from aeration tank 1 0 109 copies ml while the lowest in the effluent 2 5 106 copies ml these values indicated two to three orders of magnitude higher numbers of bacteria than those obtained in culturable analyses the copy number of 16s rrna gene in wastewater at different stages of treatment depends on bacterial load of the sewage similar values were reported for polish wwtps higher for chinese and american ones walia et al 2016 yang et al 2016b wang et al 2017 significant reduction of the number of 16s rrna gene copies in the effluent in comparison with the raw sewage metagenome have been reported for many mechanical biological wwtps makowska et al 2016 mcconnell et al 2018 bondarczuk and piotrowska seget 2019 yet sometimes as in the case of the effluent from several wwtps including those in cluj county romania jinan china and warmia and mazury north eastern poland 16s rrna gene copy number was not significantly reduced in treatment process szekeres et al 2017 wang et al 2017 korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 esbl producing coliforms cpe and oxa 48 type cpe strains were present in the sewage at each treatment stage also in the final effluent where their frequency increased compared to raw sewage from 0 18 to 0 39 0 30 0 36 and 0 0009 0 001 respectively although not significantly still the results of our study support assumptions that the mechanical biological wwtp does not eliminate bacteria with the most serious resistance mechanisms the phenomenon of the presence of drug resistant strains in effluent is undoubtedly related to inadequacy of the sewage treatment which is firstly meant to reduce the total number of bacteria and does not assume the presence of arbs accompanied by subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics chemotherapeutics and other pollutants those factors facilitate acquisition of resistance by hgt and may also select for resistant strains in aeration tank michael et al 2013 mao et al 2015 the increase in the frequency of esbl producing and cpe bacteria in effluent may be also related to the presence of biofilms which according to lépesová et al 2018 are largely created by coliforms and in turn the multiresistant bacteria have a special potential for its formation the args detected in the genomes of bacteria cultured from sewage at all treatment stages included six genes conferring esbl phenotype bla ctx m bla shv bla tem bla oxa 1 bla cmy and bla dha and four determining carbapenem resistance bla ges bla oxa 48 bla vim and bla ndm in the genomes of esbl producing coliforms bla ctx m was the dominant gene which supports the concept of its most dynamic evolution and spread tacão et al 2012 picão et al 2013 oliveira et al 2014 de araujo et al 2016 dropa et al 2016 turano et al 2016 campana et al 2017 conte et al 2017 yang et al 2017 in the genomes of cpe strains bla ges 30 3 bla vim 7 8 bla ndm 6 2 and bla oxa 48 present in 74 3 of oxa 48 type cpe strains genes were identified with bla vim and bla ndm most frequently detected in strains isolated from effluent in a hospital wwtp in basel switzerland the bla vim gene was recorded in 8 2 presumptive cpe strains interestingly no bla vim harboring strains were found in the effluent which shows that they were effectively eliminated during the wastewater treatment process zurfluh et al 2017 on the other hand cpe strains with bla ndm have been reported in bacteria from the effluent of a wwtp in tianjin china where they survived even the disinfection process yang et al 2016b in poland there was a dramatic increase in cpe presence since 2013 which is an alarming threat to public health rapid increase of ndm producing enterobacteriaceae in poland started from 2012 when first ndm positive k pneumoniae strain of unknown origin spread in the area of poznań and then in warsaw baraniak et al 2016 although the situation in the poznań area is said to be successfully controlled since the mid 2014 in the raw sewage and the final effluent we were detecting strains with bla ndm in sampling events till 2017 we also noted high incidence of strains with bla oxa 48 gene oxa 48 type carbapenemase producers have been reported in poland from 2012 majewski et al 2014 in our study alarmingly high incidence of bacteria harbouring bla ndm and bla oxa 48 genes in the effluent could indicate the spread of the genes among bacteria in the previous stages of treatment taking into account the official number of infections caused by bla ndm and bla oxa 48 strains literacka et al 2019 we assume more frequent than expected occurrence of the genes in sewage due to their presence in strains from non clinical environment comprising human and animal intestinal microbiota and agricultural run offs previous studies have shown that bla ctx m genes and most importantly bla kpc and bla ndm are located within the group of incf plasmids responsible for the emergence and global spread of genes encoding esbl and carbapenemase as well as bacterial virulence coque et al 2008 gonullu et al 2008 carattoli 2009 calisto et al 2011 kumarasamy and kalyanasundaram 2012 wibberg et al 2013 bevan et al 2017 these plasmids are stable and persist in the bacterial cells even in the absence of selective pressure carattoli 2009 they most often occur in clinical enterobacteriaceae strains including e coli salmonella enterica klebsiella pneumonia yersinia pestis and y pseudotuberculosis but can also spread among strictly environmental strains carattoli et al 2001 marcadé et al 2009 garcía fernández et al 2010 villa et al 2010 yang et al 2016b we identified bla ndm only in coliforms which were the primary goal of our research but disturbing is the fact that it could have been transferred to bacteria belonging to species of other not only gram negative genera enterococcus faecium acinetobacter seohaensis and wautersiella falsenii yang et al 2016b therefore we can presume that the number of bla ndm harbouring bacteria in the final effluent is underestimated traditional approach based on analysis of dna isolated from bacteria cultured from wastewater samples is limited and does not present the full characteristics of the resistome therefore quantitative analysis of wastewater metagenome was performed we quantified genes which were the most abundant in the genomes of culturable coliforms or the most alarming bla ctx m bla tem bla ges bla shv bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla vim and bla kpc the copy number of all tested args in the effluent decreased during the wastewater treatment process which was parallel to the reduction of both culturable bacteria and 16s rrna gene copy number in the sewage metagenome among the analyzed genes the highest mean copy number was obtained for the bla oxa 1 gene which in raw sewage and aeration tank was only an order of magnitude lower than the number of bacteria estimated on the basis of the 16s rrna gene copy number the bla oxa 1 gene analyzed by using universal primers to detect several bla oxa variants determine oxacillinase production which does not confer resistance to carbapenems in the effluent metagenome the highest average gene copy number was found for bla ges and bla oxa 1 while the lowest was recorded for the bla vim and bla kpc genes the five most frequently occurring genes in wastewater metagenome were bla ges bla tem bla oxa 48 bla shv bla ctx m the relative abundance of these genes calculated on the basis of the copy number of the 16s rrna gene 4 increased in the effluent metagenome compared to the raw sewage metagenome a significant increase in the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla kpc genes observed in the metagenome of aeration tank sewage may indicate enhanced hgt processes and or selection of isolates with resistance genes in the central wastewater treatment plant sewage metagenome the values of gene relative abundances reached relatively high levels compared to other reports the increase of bla tem relative abundance 10 3 copy number 16s rrna during mechanical biological wastewater treatment with uv disinfection was also observed in studies regarding args in wwtp in jinan china wang et al 2017 much lower values of the relative abundance calculated by dividing the resistance gene copy number by 16s rrna gene copy number for bla ctx m 10 4 bla tem 10 5 and bla shv 10 5 were observed in the effluent from a hospital wwtp in michigan usa walia et al 2016 in a hospital wwtp with chlorine disinfection in romania lower relative abundances of bla shv 10 3 and bla vim 10 5 were found in effluent szekeres et al 2017 the quantitative analysis of args present in the metagenome effluent in spain showed the accumulation of bla kpc and bla ndm genes determining resistance to carbapenems 0 006 and 0 3 respectively that was in contrast to our study in which the decrease of relative abundance of these genes was noted 0 001 and 0 2 respectively subirats et al 2017 this supports the possibility of the spread of β lactamases and carbapenemases genes in high concentration in regions with favorable hot and humid climate nordmann and poirel 2014 a decrease in the frequency of bla ndm bla vim and bla kpc genes was demonstrated in a wwtp in china yang et al 2016a quantitative arg analysis in metagenomic dna showed that the bla tem bla ctx m bla shv bla ges bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm bla kpc and bla vim genes are moderately and strongly correlated with each other that may be explained by similar mechanisms of arg removal during wastewater treatment munir et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 but may also indicate the coexistence of these args on a common mobile genetic element like plasmid or within integron structure which enables their spread by the hgt bonnin et al 2013 liapis et al 2019 moura et al 2009 our results indicated that during the wastewater treatment there is an increase of relative abundance of genes conferring resistance to β lactams including carbapenems most threatening for public health bla ctx m bla tem bla ges bla shv and bla oxa 48 at the same time a decrease in the relative abundance of bla ndm bla vim and bla kpc genes was demonstrated still the effluent of central wwtp in koziegłowy remains a reservoir of carbapenem resistance genes that spread into the environment via a route which with warta river water leads to animals directly to humans or to potable water intakes located downstream the effluent discharge point as the microbial population composition might facilitate the interactions between transfer units involved in spreading antibiotic resistance because antibiotics amplify particular genetic exchange communities baquero et al 2013 pal et al 2016 we analyzed the composition of bacterial population in the wastewater metagenome by next generation sequencing of 16s rrna gene determination of the diversity degree of bacterial populations with the shannon biodiversity index between the three sampling sites indicated the effluent as the most diverse in terms of the composition of bacterial populations an increase in bacterial richness in the final effluent has been also observed in a wwtp in china tang et al 2016 increasing taxonomic diversity during the wastewater treatment process may be related to formation of biofilms in the environment of wwtp wakelin et al 2008 peng et al 2018 the pcoa analysis and hierarchical clustering indicated relationship between the composition of bacterial populations and relative abundance of genes at different stages of the wastewater treatment process bacterial composition and horizontal gene transfer are speculated to be the major factors that shape wwtp resistomes fernandes et al 2019 ju et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 on the other hand in other settings like food waste composting environmental factors rather than bacterial community composition may be associated with changes in arg abundance liao et al 2019 5 conclusions our results indicate that the final effluent contains arb with genes that pose the greatest threat to the public health including genes coding for extended spectrum β lactamases bla ctx m and carbapenemases bla ndm bla vim bla ges bla oxa 48 during wastewater treatment the frequency of these bacteria tends to increase the wastewater treatment process leads to significant increase in the relative abundance of bla tem and bla ges genes and tends to increase the relative abundance of bla ctx m bla shv and bla oxa 48 genes in the effluent metagenome which consequently enriches the surface water resistome the increased relative abundance of the bla ctx m bla tem bla oxa 1 bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla kpc genes in the resistome of sewage from the aeration chamber indicates selection in activated sludge there is a relationship between the composition of bacterial populations and relative abundance of genes at different stages of the wastewater treatment process quantitative metagenomic analysis combined with analysis based on culturable methods provides significant information on the limited effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes in the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes this indicates the need to develop an effective strategy and implement additional methods of wastewater

18252,wastewater from food processing facilities can have high nutrient valorisation potential valorising sugar rich agro industrial wastewater may have significant impacts on sustainability of wastewater treatment plant wwtp the objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental economic and social impacts of a novel wastewater valorisation technology this technology is designed to produce single cell protein scp from wastewater of a fruit juice processing facility to evaluate the comprehensive sustainability impacts on wwtp and overall background economy a hybrid life cycle assessment model was developed by combining the multi regional input output database exiobase with process based life cycle inventories of conventional and agrocycle wwtp the results indicated the upstream impacts of wastewater could have significant influence on sustainability of wwtp with nutrient valorisation therefore the zero burden assumption should not be adopted for upstream wastewater for the sustainability performance valorising nutrients from wwtp with agrocycle technology can improve the environmental performance of wwtp however the positive social economic impacts were directly associated with wwtp system not the whole background economy the production of scp could reduce the gross value added gva and employment in the oil seeds sector in order to improve the social economic impacts and promote a circular bioeconomy model in the fruit juice sector further development is required to improve valorisation productivity and create a better value chain for valorised products graphical abstract image 1 keywords circular economy food waste hybrid life cycle assessment nutrient valorisation sustainability 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtp are used to treat municipal and industrial sewage produced by human activities wagner et al 2002 although wwtp can purify water and reduce the negative environmental impacts of wastewater they still have adverse environmental impact such as high energy consumption mccarty et al 2011 additional sludge treatment yoshida et al 2013 and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria rizzo et al 2013 as wastewater contains potentially valuable nutrient resources research is focusing on extracting value from the treatment process e g to recover nutrients directly ward et al 2018 to generate energy shen et al 2019 and to use the nutrients to support further growth of either crops vazquez montiel et al 1995 or more recently algae wang et al 2019 it is necessary to better understand how different options to circularise and extend the use of resources in wastewater can influence the environmental social and economic impacts of wwtp this research focuses on how introducing a technology to produce single cell protein scp from the wastewater would influence these impacts of wastewater treatment for a fruit processing facility life cycle assessment lca is a method that should account for environmental

al 2015 or investigating management strategies and alternative scenarios hospido et al 2012 mccarty et al 2011 o connor et al 2014 thibodeau et al 2014 there have also been studies that have reported the effect of methodological choices including functional unit and assumed life span foley et al 2010a harder et al 2014 rodriguez garcia et al 2011 impact methods renou et al 2008 and regionalization hernández padilla et al 2017 environmental and economic interactions have also been studied theregowda et al 2016 thibodeau et al 2014 the importance of data collection and system boundary has been emphasised by foley et al 2010a and yoshida et al 2014 with corominas et al 2013a reporting that few studies included the construction phase which can account for up to 20 of total impacts morera et al 2017 ortiz et al 2007 singh and kansal 2018 the system boundary is also a critical decision with two specific issues to consider 1 assumptions about the types of replaced activities e g energy or nutrient supply lundin et al 2000 vergara et al 2011 and 2 inclusion of the upstream impact of wastewater currently wwtp lcas fall into two groups most focus on water treatment to improve water quality as an end of pipe solution to a waste problem foley j et al 2010a b gallego et al 2008 hospido et al 2004 risch et al 2015 but some are more interested in the valorisation such as nutrient and energy recovery corominas et al 2013b ontiveros and campanella 2013 theregowda et al 2016 almost all wastewater lca studies have adopted the zero burden assumption ekvall et al 2007 schrijvers et al 2016 which excludes the upstream impact of waste from the waste treatment system boundary pradel et al 2016 recent studies questioned this approach as the waste was derived from technosphere and is assumed to be used as an input remaining in the technosphere cleary 2010 oldfield and holden 2014 this issue is important when considering the value of a technology in the context of circular economy ilic et al 2018 for this work the upstream environmental impacts have been included as the valorised resource could not exist without the original activity having occurred to reduce the complexity and uncertainty of allocating upstream burden the source of wastewater needs to be specified and classified hybrid life cycle assessment crawford et al 2018 was used for capturing the comprehensive impacts of the product supply chains including in the context of a circular economy genovese et al 2017 pagotto and halog 2015 reynolds et al 2015 this approach combines specific data from process based description of the foreground engineering system with economic value based information from economic input output database for the background system suh and huppes 2005 hybrid lca can account the impacts of the entire supply chain to avoid truncation error suh et al 2004 lin 2009 used a waste input output model wio nakamura and kondo 2002 to develop a hybrid lca for wwtp and stokes and horvath 2010 also used hybrid lca to investigate the environmental impact of biogas generation from wastewater hybrid lca has also been applied downstream for sewerage sludge treatment ashley et al

was assumed to treat wastewater from a fruit juice factory in italy the treated water will reach the necessary environmental standard and will be discharged to the local river or will be used for irrigation barbagallo et al 2001 for this study it was assumed that the wwtp is owned and managed by the fruit juice producer and is a necessary part of the facility operation the owner does not receive any financial income for treating the wastewater and must meet all costs associated with wwtp operation the juice factory uses three types of fruit peach apple kiwi to produce juice the annual processing capacity of peach apple and kiwi were taken as 50 000 tonnes 10 000 tonnes and 3 000 tonnes respectively the annual wastewater for processing these fruits is 1 008 000 m3 to evaluate the change in impacts of valorising nutrient from the fruit juice wastewater agrocycle wwtp fig 1 and conventional wwtp fig 2 were modelled in this study the agrocycle wwtp is a hypothetical system to adopt a nutrient recovery valorisation technology to produce single cell protein scp fig 1 the technology has been tested at pilot scale and these data used to develop a prospective lca model for full scale deployment in this case 10 of wastewater from specific points in the fruit juice facility was assumed to be directed to the scp production process the effluent after scp then combines with the remaining 90 of wastewater to enter anaerobic sequencing batch reactor anaerobic sbr and aerobic membrane bioreactor aerobic mbr processes the biogas generated from the anaerobic sbr stage was used as thermal energy for the anaerobic sbr electricity is also provided in anaerobic sbr process to meet the extra demand of power and thermal in the wwtp facility the material and energy input per functional unit in the foreground system were derived from the pilot scale study the conventional wwtp represents the current wastewater treatment technology used in fruit juice factory fig 2 the data was collected from a business as usual wwtp both agrocycle and conventional wwtp would process 1 008 000 m3 wastewater annually the two wwtps have the same capacity which is defined by the daily wastewater flow rate however due to the duration of the fruit harvest season fruit juice factory normally operates for approx six months e g mid may to mid november in a year therefore the nominal capacity of each plant is 2 016 000 m3 year the functional unit in this study was 1 m3 wastewater treated by the wwtp facility working at half capacity the assumed life span for both wwtp was 20 years see supplementary information for table of assumptions 2 2 nutrient valorisation scenarios in many published lca studies for wwtp foley j et al 2010a b gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 rodriguez garcia et al 2011 the zero burden assumption was adopted to avoid having to deal with the complexity of wastewater sources most of these studies focused on the impacts of municipal wwtp for which it is difficult to allocate the upstream impacts even though some have included nutrient recovery corominas et al 2013b guven et al 2018 rodriguez garcia et al 2014 in addition the goals were generally defined in terms of an end of pipe solution to a problem rather than as a valorisation opportunity however the commissioning stakeholder perspective for this study was to use a known and quantifiable wastewater as a raw material to create a valuable substance therefore the zero burden assumption was neither necessary nor tenable to investigate the effect of upstream wastewater the impact of fruit production needs to be accounted in wastewater a 1 cut off rule is generally adopted to exclude the impact of small inputs bonamente et al 2014 humbert et al 2009 shen et al 2010 therefore we used the 1 as allocation factor cut off for upstream of wastewater if including the upstream impact of wastewater with only 1 of its impacts allocated to wwtp had a significant impact on results then the upstream input of wastewater need to be included and the zero burden assumption was not valid in agro industrial food wastewater valorisation four scenarios were modelled with uncertainty around allocation 1 agrocycle wwtp without upstream impact agro 2 conventional wwtp without upstream impact conv 3 agrocycle wwtp with 1 upstream impact allocated to wastewater agro u and 4 conventional wwtp with 1 upstream impact allocated to wastewater conv u the elementary inputs per functional unit for scenarios agro and conv table 1 were used for agro u and conv u with the addition of 1 of the impacts of fruit juice production allocated to wastewater this was achieved by creating an input demand from the food product nec sector in exiobase see section 2 3 according to the annual wastewater processing capacity the material and energy consumption for construction of both wwtps were estimated from morera et al 2017 and risch et al 2015 the construction inventory included the inputs demand for pumping pre treatment all primary treatments secondary treatment sludge treatment water and electricity network in the wastewater treatment plant the chemical water and energy inputs for all operation stages were measured in situ with the cooperation of the fruit juice factory the sludge management in the wwtp comprised primary treatment thickening and drying bed and the dried sludge was sent to a specialised sludge treatment facility for further treatment e g composting as fertilizer therefore the owner needed to pay for sludge transport and treatment in this study it was regarded as a service input for the wwtp operation for implementing the agrocycle wwtp a specialised pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride and polyester membrane psh 1650 koch membrane systems with a life span of 10 year was used and the membrane was assumed to be replaced during the whole operation time of wwtp see supplementary information for the characteristics of this membrane based on the measured dimensions of pvdf and polyester fibre the volume of pvdf and polyester layer was calculated the mass was estimated based on the typical density of these two materials the share of pvdf and polyester accounts approximately 50 of total weight the rest of the material was estimated from ioannou ttofa et al 2016 the metallic frame was assumed to account for 35 of total weight and 5 each for other plastics table 2 the other minor equipment in wwtp was not included in this study according to morera et al 2017 equipment normally represents only a small share of total impact in wwtp especially for impact of climate change the economic information for the foreground wwtp systems tables 1 and 2 and unit price data table 3 were mapped to the corresponding sectors in exiobase see section 2 3 the value of energy electricity and thermal energy and aluminium in italy was taken from statista statistics the diesel price was from energy report by european commission based on personal communication with an expert in logistic the cost of fuel accounting was assumed to be 20 of transport expenditure the price of steel was estimated from a steel benchmark report steelbenchmarker 2019 and the historical price of steel from trade organization the unit price for concrete brick and sludge management was estimated from survey and communication the cost of rubber plastic products and raw plastic material was estimated from the website plastics insight the average water price in italy was taken from oecd database oecd the average cost of nh4cl and other chemicals was derived from various traders and wholesalers on alibaba the shares of chemical cost in total cost of agrocycle and conventional wwtps range from 11 to 2 based on communication with experts in wwtp and report by tianjiao et al 2014 the construction cost for the specific scale wwtp in this study was assumed to be 1m the cost of civil work was calculated by deducting material cost from total construction cost the conventional wwtps is net input without income but the agrocycle wwtp can create economic income by selling scp the scp was assumed to displace soybean derived animal feed according to average soybean price from eurostat and scp cost on alibaba the selling price for scp from wwtp was assumed to be 0 44 kg 2 3 hybridisation of process information and exiobase input output io analysis is a powerful tool to describe economic activity within a country region or even global scale the general io analysis uses the leontief model equation 1 leontief 1952 where i a 1 is referred to as the leontief inverse it indicates the direct and indirect input demands on all other producers generated by one unit of output a is the technical coefficient matrix the element aij in a describes the input demand i needed by industry j to produce a unit monetary output i is an identity matrix and f is the final demand matrix x is total output matrix representing all outputs triggered by the given final demand f 1 x i a 1 f l f from io analysis the environmental or social impacts can be calculated by multiplying the total output with data for impact intensity per unit output equation 2 where b is a row vector it functions as a satellite account with impact intensities per unit product 2 s b x b i a 1 f b l f to reflect the technical characteristics of wwtp with a full supply chain the life cycle inventories of foreground processes in the wwtp scenarios were hybridised with the multi regional io mrio table exiobase wood et al 2014 as exiobase has a global scope approximately 89 of global gross domestic product and detailed information for european countries it was the most suitable mrio for this hybrid lca analysis the first step of hybridisation in exiobase is the creation of four new sectors in the original technical coefficient matrix each of which represents the scenarios agro conv agro u and conv u fig 3 the hybrid technical coefficient matrix can be illustrated in equation 3 with four submatrices suh and huppes 2005 where matrix a r r is four by four diagonal matrix representing intermediate input coefficients within wwtp no interaction between different wwtp sectors in four scenarios was assumed matrix cu represents upstream cut off flows as input demands by wwtp sectors cd captures downstream cut off flows from the wwtp systems to background io table matrix a is the same as in the existing product by product io matrix in exiobase version 3 3 a hybrid a r r c d c u a the matrix a r r and cu represent the four wwtp scenarios to build the bridge between process data with io table a concordance was developed based on the mapping relation in table 3 the concordance was used for constructing matrix cu the italian food waste for treatment wastewater treatment sector was taken as the reference sector the corresponding sectors in each region were aggregated into the same cost structure as the cost elements of wwtp in concordance all the import shares were in the same proportion as in exiobase a scalar multiplier was developed by dividing the aggregated coefficients in exiobase with the cost structures of wwtps it was multiplied by concordance and the column of italian food waste for treatment wastewater treatment sector to calculate matrix cu for the scenarios with upstream impact the input demand from food product nec sector was created in matrix cu to avoid double counting the inputs already captured in a r r were deleted in cu for matrix cd previous studies found the effect of the downstream sectors on the overall results is minor suh 2006 so it can be set to 0 for simplicity wiedmann et al 2011 in this study cd was assumed to have the same downstream distribution as the reference sector in exiobase chen et al 2019 the second step was developing the new satellite matrix with impact intensities for wwtp scenarios and original exiobase sectors for value added in wwtp no subsidies or tax were applied the value added matrix for wwtp sector was calculated by summation of wage and operating surplus of wwtp system in scenarios with upstream impact the potential value of wastewater was included in operating surplus for employment the total working hours required by wwtp was used as indicator it was calculated by multiplying number of employees in plant and the working hours per person according to a survey of the current conventional plant it needs two employees managing the whole plant for approximately 6 months each year for safe operation each one works 12 h per day due to the fruit harvest period the fruit juice factory can only operate half time in the agrocycle plant one more technician was assumed to be required to manage scp production process the working time was assumed to be 8 h per day in this study as the carbon in the wastewater is from biogenic source e g fruit cultivation therefore the co2 from wastewater treatment was not accounted for as part of ghg emission from wwtp which is different approach in municipal wwtp law et al 2013 the main direct ghg emission from wwtp was n2o the emission factor for n2o in sludge management was taken from soda et al 2010 and n2o from the biogas combustion process was estimated from doka 2003 the share of chemical cost accounted for a relatively high share of total cost of wwtp so considering the generality of the chemical sector in exiobase the ghg emission of chemicals was estimated from the corresponding emission intensities which were taken from ecoinvent database for the offset ghg emission by scp the ghg intensity of soybean meal in italy was taken from the agri footprint database durlinger et al 2014 the inputs already captured for the wwtp sector were discounted in the background io table the direct ghg emission from the wwtp sector was calculated using structural path analysis according to lenzen and crawford 2009 and malik et al 2015 the total direct indirect ghg emission m can be enumerated as equation 4 where matrix q represents the direct ghg emission of wwtp therefore the direct ghg emission q can be calculated by multiplying matrix m with l 1 hybrid 4 m ql hybrid q 1 a hybrid 1 q qa hybrid qa 2 hybrid qa 3 hybrid qa n hybrid the final step of the hybrid lca is defining the final demand f according to functional unit in this study 1 m3 treated wastewater was used as the final demand in each scenario the demand of other sectors was set to 0 the environmental impact of climate change kgco2 eq euro the economic impact of gross value added euro euro and social impact of employment hours euro were evaluated for all wwtp scenarios per m3 wastewater treated in addition the impacts on 200 sectors in each region were aggregated into 15 sector categories see supplementary information and a detailed analysis of aggregated impacts on environmental social and economic aspects was undertaken 3 results and discussion 3 1 the total impact of the wastewater treatment plant the direct impacts of wwtp and total impacts of wastewater treatment service table 4 indicated the wwtp with agrocycle approach caused greater direct social employment and economic gva impact than conventional wwtp however the total direct and indirect social economic impacts were greater for the conventional technology for these two indicators a greater impact is a positive or good outcome the agrocycle wwtp was estimated to cause less direct and total impact on climate change than the conventional wwtp comparing scenarios with and without upstream impacts suggested the upstream impacts only have a small influence on the direct impact but a much more important influence on the total impact accounting of upstream impact will not influence direct employment and gva for either wwtp approach the gva calculation suggested that even from the point of nutrient valorisation it would be difficult to add economic value to wastewater in practise therefore the market value of wastewater in agro u was also zero for climate change impact accounting for the upstream impact of fruit juice increased the direct ghg emission from wwtp the detailed assessment of the impacts is presented in following sections 3 2 economic impacts the gva of wwtp in all scenarios fig 4 showed that wwtp was the main contributor among all sector groups all scenarios had negative added value in wwtp process the main reason for this was the result indicated that the fruit juice factory could not generate income for processing the wastewater however valorisation through scp production in the wwtp could improve the economic performance the valorised scp that can replace soybean meal for animal feed therefore agrocycle wwtp could reduce the gva in the oil seeds sector which leads to the negative value for total gva of the agricultural and food sector group allocating upstream impact of fruit juice to wastewater would create input demand from the food product sector this has a significant effect on creation of gva in the agricultural and food sector group the analysis indicates that a simple assessment of increase or decrease in gva from process based lca with predefined system boundary or zero burden assumption might be misleading in addition decreasing gva for a very impactful sector such as fossil fuels could be regarded as a positive short term goal there is certainly a perception that decreasing demand for soybean for animal feed may be worth more than the gva generated by the sector willett et al 2019 an issue to note was the agrocycle wwtp created more gva in the sectors fossil based fuel and chemical and materials this was triggered by the greater demand for electricity thermal energy and chemical in anaerobic sbr aerobic mbr and scp production a transition to renewable energy would alleviate this antagonistic outcome however there is now some concern about the adverse impacts of renewable energy e g hydro power grill et al 2015 conventional wwtp had better economic performance in sector for transport administrative and personal service business and financial service and sludge treatment the smaller amount of sludge from agrocycle wwtps reduced the added value in the supply chain of sludge treatment service the offset of soybean by scp product also contributed to the lower gva in transport administrative and personal service and business and financial service sectors although wwtps with agrocycle approach caused greater direct gva the reduced gva in the background sectors led to a smaller total gva per m3 wastewater treated in agro and agro u to improve the total gva of agrocycle wwtp further development of supporting sectors e g administrative and personal service and business and financial service for scp is required the implication of including upstream gva in the analysis was for most sector groups at least a 10 increase than the gva compared to non upstream impact scenarios the difference in gva for the agrocycle wwtp was greater than for conventional wwtp the most significant changes existed in the sectors agricultural and food administrative and personal service business and financial service and transport the differences ranged from 23 to 96 this indicated the importance of allocating upstream impact for the total gva evaluation especially for the background sectors 3 3 social impacts the contribution of employment was concentrated mainly in the sector agricultural and food fig 5 the agrocycle wwtp caused a marked reduction in employment caused by the reduced labor demand associated with the offset soybean in oil seed sector for agricultural and food supply chains primary production at farm stage is normally associated with intensive labor demand chen and holden 2016 huang et al 2009 as with the economic impact there are some important impacts of soybean production that could well be valued far greater than employment but that would depend on specific geographical locations comparing the conv u and conv scenarios the employment by the agricultural and food sector group in conv u was almost five times greater than employment in conv the increase was driven by input demand from the food product sector while in the two agrocycle scenarios the change in the agricultural and food sector group was small because of the high share of the oil seed sector the marked differences between upstream and non upstream scenario was also noted for the sectors administrative and personal service business and financial service transport and chemical and materials the differences ranged from 25 to 89 so similar to gva the employment results also suggested allocation of upstream impact can play an important role in evaluation of employment in the background sectors in contrast the foreground wwtp system had no change of employment in upstream and non upstream scenario the contribution to total employment was quite small 3 4 environmental impacts wwtp was the main contributor to total ghg emission and thus climate change impact fig 6 for conventional wwtp ghg emission from direct inputs to wwtp accounted for 29 31 of total ghg emissions for the agrocycele wwtp the negative value for direct ghg emissions was almost double the total ghg value the offset ghg emissions caused by soybean meal production accounted for the dominant share of direct ghg emission in agrocycle wwtp this suggested that wastewater valorisation through scp production could significantly reduce the climate change impact of wwtp in this study the ghg intensity of soybean meal in italy was 2 57 kg co2 eq kg it is worth noting that the ghg intensity of soybean from other regions could be much lower so the benefits are not necessarily universal according to agri footprint database american soybean meal has emission value of 0 8 kg co2 eq kg so the benefit of agrocycle wwtp in that context would be much smaller to treat one m3 wastewater the direct ghg emission from agrocycle and conventional treatment stages are 4 33 kg co2 eq and 0 08 kg co2 eq respectively although both wwtps have n2o and ch4 emission the scp in agrocycle scenarios resulted in a negative value for direct ghg emission from wwtp the other inputs to the wwtp have positive values for ghg emissions table 5 indicates the contribution of inputs to direct ghg emission excluding the emission from wwtp in all scenarios for conventional wwtp electricity was found to be the main contributor to direct ghg emissions it accounted for 60 from conv and 69 from conv u similar findings were reported in previous wwtp lca studies corominas et al 2013a gallego et al 2008 zang et al 2015 for agrocycle wwtp electricity had smaller contribution to direct ghg emission to process one m3 wastewater in agrocycle wwtp the ghg emission from electricity only ranges from 28 to 30 in agrocycle scenarios however in agrocycle wwtp the ghg emission from fossil fuel was more than double the ghg emissions from electricity generation this was caused by greater natural gas consumption which was used as thermal energy for the anaerobic sbr and scp production stages comparing the upstream and non upstream scenarios the contribution of upstream impact to direct ghg emissions in conv u was greater than conv scenario the effect of upstream impact in agrocycle wwtps was much smaller but the results still indicated that upstream impact would have an influence on direct ghg emissions the major sector groups associated with indirect ghg emissions were fossil fuel transport administrative and personal service business and financial service and manufacture and equipment fig 6 the indirect ghg emissions accounted for 68 of total ghg in the conv scenario and 71 in the conv u scenario the sectors fossil fuel and transport were the main indirect ghg contributors for conventional wwtp about 50 of total indirect ghg due to the electricity and material consumption used by conventional wwtp the sector of administrative and personal service and business and financial service also contributed 25 of total indirect ghg from conventional wwtp for agrocycle wwtp the impact contribution from the fossil fuel sector as indirect ghg emissions was reduced while the indirect ghg contribution from administrative and personal service and business and financial service sector increased this suggested agrocycle wwtp shifted indirect ghg from resource based sectors to service based sectors it is worth noting that the total indirect ghg emission from agrocycle and conventional wwtp was almost the same with the main difference due to upstream and non upstream scenarios 3 5 sustainability implication based on the economic social and environmental results above agro industrial wastewater valorisation can improve the environmental performance as indicated by climate change impact but will have less influence on social economic performance as indicated by employment and gva the offsetting of the impact of soybean meal by valorised scp offers more carbon credit than the additional ghg emissions from the increased demand for thermal energy and chemical and material consumption a transition to renewable energy and bioeconomy may increase the relative benefits further the negative ghg emissions for the agrocycle wwtp was due to the carbon reduction associated with decreased demand for soybean production its relative value also depends on the ghg intensity of the offset soybean meal this will vary through space and time as well agrocycle wwtp can create more value for the plant owner and wwtp system but conventional wwtp can add more gva for background sectors the decreased demand for sludge treatment and transport can be regard as an improvement of resource efficiency in term of sustainability it was positive indicator and should be supported to further improve the economic performance over the background sectors more development is required in the administrative and personal service and business and financial service sectors possible solutions include supporting more research activities on valorised scp and developing better reverse supply chains for valorised products ülkü and hsuan 2017 another option for increasing total gva using the agrocycle wwtp technology is to valorise more scp and other products e g pectin per unit wastewater galanakis et al 2010 this would generate a greater demand for technology and thus inputs from the administrative and personal service sector and leads to greater gva 3 6 limit and future research for employment valorising nutrients from wastewater reduced working hours the reduction of working hours on farms producing soybean will need to be valued against the other adverse impacts caused by such farms and the steady development of new technology that is normally associated with improvement of agricultural productivity and reduction of labor intensity in agriculture sector espey and thilmany 2000 ruttan 2002 which would probably reduce employment hours anyway the scp can provide the same function as soybean meal but with much less labor demand improving the labor efficiency of protein production through scp valorisation could be regard as positive feature as the nature of labor is changing it should not only be evaluated by working hours from a quantity point of view in the future agrocycle wwtp is worth promoting unless regional stakeholders have a very high priority associated with employment hours the assumed allocation factor for upstream impact to wastewater 1 was equal to the magnitude of a mass energy flow that could be excluded using the lca cut off rule shen et al 2010 this rule imposed the upstream impact could be excluded however the economic social and environmental results all suggested that upstream impacts as small as only 1 had a marked influence on the direct and total impacts so could not be ignored an accurate allocation method for upstream impact is required for wwtp with nutrient recovery or any other valorisation technology the zero burden assumption should not be adopted in this case as suggested for other valorisation technologies by oldfield and holden 2014 perhaps the most important limitation of this study was absence of an accurate allocation method for the upstream impact from fruit juice to wastewater in future work the allocation of upstream impact could be based on the nutrient content such as sugar content in fruit juice and wastewater upstream impacts can also be allocated to corresponding sector e g food product in the exiobase input output table finally the rebound effect caused by displacing soybean with scp technology on the soybean market was excluded this is the normal approach hybrid lcas with small functional unit acquaye et al 2011 genovese et al 2017 malik et al 2015 because at sectoral intervention level the annual scp production from the wwtp is around 2 000 t which would be expected to have a negligible effect on soybean meal price for sectoral effect future studies should estimate the potential scp from the whole juice sector which requires the information about sectoral juice productivity the scp productivity from different types of agro industrial wastewater should be investigated to fully understand the impact implications of this technology 4 conclusion agro industrial wastewater has high nutrient value valorising wastewater nutrients could increase the added value of the treatment plant and influence the sustainability of the food processing facility this study was the first attempt to use hybrid lca to evaluate the comprehensive environmental social and economic performance of a wastewater treatment plant for a fruit juice factory the results indicated that valorising agro industrial wastewater streams using scp technology can improve the environmental performance indicated by climate change and resource use efficiency however the current valorisation technology could only drive positive social economic impact to the wwtp system and not the whole background economy especially for social aspect the agrocycle wwtp can contribute to technical transformation of agricultural labor however it is not a suitable option for those situations that prioritise employment hybrid lca can capture the impacts which could be cut off by inappropriate system boundary placement in conventional process lca in order to improve the social economic impacts and promote a circular bioeconomy model in the fruit juice sector further development is required to better understand valorisation productivity and develop better reverse supply chains to create more social economic value for the products this study provides comprehensive sustainability information for stakeholders in wastewater treatment and the fruit juice sectors the implication can be used for making management or pollical decision with consideration of three aspects of sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18252,wastewater from food processing facilities can have high nutrient valorisation potential valorising sugar rich agro industrial wastewater may have significant impacts on sustainability of wastewater treatment plant wwtp the objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental economic and social impacts of a novel wastewater valorisation technology this technology is designed to produce single cell protein scp from wastewater of a fruit juice processing facility to evaluate the comprehensive sustainability impacts on wwtp and overall background economy a hybrid life cycle assessment model was developed by combining the multi regional input output database exiobase with process based life cycle inventories of conventional and agrocycle wwtp the results indicated the upstream impacts of wastewater could have significant influence on sustainability of wwtp with nutrient valorisation therefore the zero burden assumption should not be adopted for upstream wastewater for the sustainability performance valorising nutrients from wwtp with agrocycle technology can improve the environmental performance of wwtp however the positive social economic impacts were directly associated with wwtp system not the whole background economy the production of scp could reduce the gross value added gva and employment in the oil seeds sector in order to improve the social economic impacts and promote a circular bioeconomy model in the fruit juice sector further development is required to improve valorisation productivity and create a better value chain for valorised products

municipal and industrial sewage produced by human activities wagner et al 2002 although wwtp can purify water and reduce the negative environmental impacts of wastewater they still have adverse environmental impact such as high energy consumption mccarty et al 2011 additional sludge treatment yoshida et al 2013 and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria rizzo et al 2013 as wastewater contains potentially valuable nutrient resources research is focusing on extracting value from the treatment process e g to recover nutrients directly ward et al 2018 to generate energy shen et al 2019 and to use the nutrients to support further growth of either crops vazquez montiel et al 1995 or more recently algae wang et al 2019 it is necessary to better understand how different options to circularise and extend the use of resources in wastewater can influence the environmental social and economic impacts of wwtp this research focuses on how introducing a technology to produce single cell protein scp from the wastewater would influence these impacts of wastewater treatment for a fruit processing facility life cycle assessment lca is a method that should account for environmental

al 2015 or investigating management strategies and alternative scenarios hospido et al 2012 mccarty et al 2011 o connor et al 2014 thibodeau et al 2014 there have also been studies that have reported the effect of methodological choices including functional unit and assumed life span foley et al 2010a harder et al 2014 rodriguez garcia et al 2011 impact methods renou et al 2008 and regionalization hernández padilla et al 2017 environmental and economic interactions have also been studied theregowda et al 2016 thibodeau et al 2014 the importance of data collection and system boundary has been emphasised by foley et al 2010a and yoshida et al 2014 with corominas et al 2013a reporting that few studies included the construction phase which can account for up to 20 of total impacts morera et al 2017 ortiz et al 2007 singh and kansal 2018 the system boundary is also a critical decision with two specific issues to consider 1 assumptions about the types of replaced activities e g energy or nutrient supply lundin et al 2000 vergara et al 2011 and 2 inclusion of the upstream impact of wastewater currently wwtp lcas fall into two groups most focus on water treatment to improve water quality as an end of pipe solution to a waste problem foley j et al 2010a b gallego et al 2008 hospido et al 2004 risch et al 2015 but some are more interested in the valorisation such as nutrient and energy recovery corominas et al 2013b ontiveros and campanella 2013 theregowda et al 2016 almost all wastewater lca studies have adopted the zero burden assumption ekvall et al 2007 schrijvers et al 2016 which excludes the upstream impact of waste from the waste treatment system boundary pradel et al 2016 recent studies questioned this approach as the waste was derived from technosphere and is assumed to be used as an input remaining in the technosphere cleary 2010 oldfield and holden 2014 this issue is important when considering the value of a technology in the context of circular economy ilic et al 2018 for this work the upstream environmental impacts have been included as the valorised resource could not exist without the original activity having occurred to reduce the complexity and uncertainty of allocating upstream burden the source of wastewater needs to be specified and classified hybrid life cycle assessment crawford et al 2018 was used for capturing the comprehensive impacts of the product supply chains including in the context of a circular economy genovese et al 2017 pagotto and halog 2015 reynolds et al 2015 this approach combines specific data from process based description of the foreground engineering system with economic value based information from economic input output database for the background system suh and huppes 2005 hybrid lca can account the impacts of the entire supply chain to avoid truncation error suh et al 2004 lin 2009 used a waste input output model wio nakamura and kondo 2002 to develop a hybrid lca for wwtp and stokes and horvath 2010 also used hybrid lca to investigate the environmental impact of biogas generation from wastewater hybrid lca has also been applied downstream for sewerage sludge treatment ashley et al

irrigation barbagallo et al 2001 for this study it was assumed that the wwtp is owned and managed by the fruit juice producer and is a necessary part of the facility operation the owner does not receive any financial income for treating the wastewater and must meet all costs associated with wwtp operation the juice factory uses three types of fruit peach apple kiwi to produce juice the annual processing capacity of peach apple and kiwi were taken as 50 000 tonnes 10 000 tonnes and 3 000 tonnes respectively the annual wastewater for processing these fruits is 1 008 000 m3 to evaluate the change in impacts of valorising nutrient from the fruit juice wastewater agrocycle wwtp fig 1 and conventional wwtp fig 2 were modelled in this study the agrocycle wwtp is a hypothetical system to adopt a nutrient recovery valorisation technology to produce single cell protein scp fig 1 the technology has been tested at pilot scale and these data used to develop a prospective lca model for full scale deployment in this case 10 of wastewater from specific points in the fruit juice facility was assumed to be directed to the scp production process the effluent after scp then combines with the remaining 90 of wastewater to enter anaerobic sequencing batch reactor anaerobic sbr and aerobic membrane bioreactor aerobic mbr processes the biogas generated from the anaerobic sbr stage was used as thermal energy for the anaerobic sbr electricity is also provided in anaerobic sbr process to meet the extra demand of power and thermal in the wwtp facility the material and energy input per functional unit in the foreground system were derived from the pilot scale study the conventional wwtp represents the current wastewater treatment technology used in fruit juice factory fig 2 the data was collected from a business as usual wwtp both agrocycle and conventional wwtp would process 1 008 000 m3 wastewater annually the two wwtps have the same capacity which is defined by the daily wastewater flow rate however due to the duration of the fruit harvest season fruit juice factory normally operates for approx six months e g mid may to mid november in a year therefore the nominal capacity of each plant is 2 016 000 m3 year the functional unit in this study was 1 m3 wastewater treated by the wwtp facility working at half capacity the assumed life span for both wwtp was 20 years see supplementary information for table of assumptions 2 2 nutrient valorisation scenarios in many published lca studies for wwtp foley j et al 2010a b gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 rodriguez garcia et al 2011 the zero burden assumption was adopted to avoid having to deal with the complexity of wastewater sources most of these studies focused on the impacts of municipal wwtp for which it is difficult to allocate the upstream impacts even though some have included nutrient recovery corominas et al 2013b guven et al 2018 rodriguez garcia et al 2014 in addition the goals were generally defined in terms of an end of pipe solution to a problem rather than as a valorisation opportunity however the commissioning stakeholder perspective for this study was to use a known and quantifiable wastewater as a raw material to create a valuable substance therefore the zero burden assumption was neither necessary nor tenable to investigate the effect of upstream wastewater the impact of fruit production needs to be accounted in wastewater a 1 cut off rule is generally adopted to exclude the impact of small inputs bonamente et al 2014 humbert et al 2009 shen et al 2010 therefore we used the 1 as allocation factor cut off for upstream of wastewater if including the upstream impact of wastewater with only 1 of its impacts allocated to wwtp had a significant impact on results then the upstream input of wastewater need to be included and the zero burden assumption was not valid in agro industrial food wastewater valorisation four scenarios were modelled with uncertainty around allocation 1 agrocycle wwtp without upstream impact agro 2 conventional wwtp without upstream impact conv 3 agrocycle wwtp with 1 upstream impact allocated to wastewater agro u and 4 conventional wwtp with 1 upstream impact allocated to wastewater conv u the elementary inputs per functional unit for scenarios agro and conv table 1 were used for agro u and conv u with the addition of 1 of the impacts of fruit juice production allocated to wastewater this was achieved by creating an input demand from the food product nec sector in exiobase see section 2 3 according to the annual wastewater processing capacity the material and energy consumption for construction of both wwtps were estimated from morera et al 2017 and risch et al 2015 the construction inventory included the inputs demand for pumping pre treatment all primary treatments secondary treatment sludge treatment water and electricity network in the wastewater treatment plant the chemical water and energy inputs for all operation stages were measured in situ with the cooperation of the fruit juice factory the sludge management in the wwtp comprised primary treatment thickening and drying bed and the dried sludge was sent to a specialised sludge treatment facility for further treatment e g composting as fertilizer therefore the owner needed to pay for sludge transport and treatment in this study it was regarded as a service input for the wwtp operation for implementing the agrocycle wwtp a specialised pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride and polyester membrane psh 1650 koch membrane systems with a life span of 10 year was used and the membrane was assumed to be replaced during the whole operation time of wwtp see supplementary information for the characteristics of this membrane based on the measured dimensions of pvdf and polyester fibre the volume of pvdf and polyester layer was calculated the mass was estimated based on the typical density of these two materials the share of pvdf and polyester accounts approximately 50 of total weight the rest of the material was estimated from ioannou ttofa et al 2016 the metallic frame was assumed to account for 35 of total weight and 5 each for other plastics table 2 the other minor equipment in wwtp was not included in this study according to morera et al 2017 equipment normally represents only a small share of total impact in wwtp especially for impact of climate change the economic information for the foreground wwtp systems tables 1 and 2 and unit price data table 3 were mapped to the corresponding sectors in exiobase see section 2 3 the value of energy electricity and thermal energy and aluminium in italy was taken from statista statistics the diesel price was from energy report by european commission based on personal communication with an expert in logistic the cost of fuel accounting was assumed to be 20 of transport expenditure the price of steel was estimated from a steel benchmark report steelbenchmarker 2019 and the historical price of steel from trade organization the unit price for concrete brick and sludge management was estimated from survey and communication the cost of rubber plastic products and raw plastic material was estimated from the website plastics insight the average water price in italy was taken from oecd database oecd the average cost of nh4cl and other chemicals was derived from various traders and wholesalers on alibaba the shares of chemical cost in total cost of agrocycle and conventional wwtps range from 11 to 2 based on communication with experts in wwtp and report by tianjiao et al 2014 the construction cost for the specific scale wwtp in this study was assumed to be 1m the cost of civil work was calculated by deducting material cost from total construction cost the conventional wwtps is net input without income but the agrocycle wwtp can create economic income by selling scp the scp was assumed to displace soybean derived animal feed according to average soybean price from eurostat and scp cost on alibaba the selling price for scp from wwtp was assumed to be 0 44 kg 2 3 hybridisation of process information and exiobase input output io analysis is a powerful tool to describe economic activity within a country region or even global scale the general io analysis uses the leontief model equation 1 leontief 1952 where i a 1 is referred to as the leontief inverse it indicates the direct and indirect input demands on all other producers generated by one unit of output a is the technical coefficient matrix the element aij in a describes the input demand i needed by industry j to produce a unit monetary output i is an identity matrix and f is the final demand matrix x is total output matrix representing all outputs triggered by the given final demand f 1 x i a 1 f l f from io analysis the environmental or social impacts can be calculated by multiplying the total output with data for impact intensity per unit output equation 2 where b is a row vector it functions as a satellite account with impact intensities per unit product 2 s b x b i a 1 f b l f to reflect the technical characteristics of wwtp with a full supply chain the life cycle inventories of foreground processes in the wwtp scenarios were hybridised with the multi regional io mrio table exiobase wood et al 2014 as exiobase has a global scope approximately 89 of global gross domestic product and detailed information for european countries it was the most suitable mrio for this hybrid lca analysis the first step of hybridisation in exiobase is the creation of four new sectors in the original technical coefficient matrix each of which represents the scenarios agro conv agro u and conv u fig 3 the hybrid technical coefficient matrix can be illustrated in equation 3 with four submatrices suh and huppes 2005 where matrix a r r is four by four diagonal matrix representing intermediate input coefficients within wwtp no interaction between different wwtp sectors in four scenarios was assumed matrix cu represents upstream cut off flows as input demands by wwtp sectors cd captures downstream cut off flows from the wwtp systems to background io table matrix a is the same as in the existing product by product io matrix in exiobase version 3 3 a hybrid a r r c d c u a the matrix a r r and cu represent the four wwtp scenarios to build the bridge between process data with io table a concordance was developed based on the mapping relation in table 3 the concordance was used for constructing matrix cu the italian food waste for treatment wastewater treatment sector was taken as the reference sector the corresponding sectors in each region were aggregated into the same cost structure as the cost elements of wwtp in concordance all the import shares were in the same proportion as in exiobase a scalar multiplier was developed by dividing the aggregated coefficients in exiobase with the cost structures of wwtps it was multiplied by concordance and the column of italian food waste for treatment wastewater treatment sector to calculate matrix cu for the scenarios with upstream impact the input demand from food product nec sector was created in matrix cu to avoid double counting the inputs already captured in a r r were deleted in cu for matrix cd previous studies found the effect of the downstream sectors on the overall results is minor suh 2006 so it can be set to 0 for simplicity wiedmann et al 2011 in this study cd was assumed to have the same downstream distribution as the reference sector in exiobase chen et al 2019 the second step was developing the new satellite matrix with impact intensities for wwtp scenarios and original exiobase sectors for value added in wwtp no subsidies or tax were applied the value added matrix for wwtp sector was calculated by summation of wage and operating surplus of wwtp system in scenarios with upstream impact the potential value of wastewater was included in operating surplus for employment the total working hours required by wwtp was used as indicator it was calculated by multiplying number of employees in plant and the working hours per person according to a survey of the current conventional plant it needs two employees managing the whole plant for approximately 6 months each year for safe operation each one works 12 h per day due to the fruit harvest period the fruit juice factory can only operate half time in the agrocycle plant one more technician was assumed to be required to manage scp production process the working time was assumed to be 8 h per day in this study as the carbon in the wastewater is from biogenic source e g fruit cultivation therefore the co2 from wastewater treatment was not accounted for as part of ghg emission from wwtp which is different approach in municipal wwtp law et al 2013 the main direct ghg emission from wwtp was n2o the emission factor for n2o in sludge management was taken from soda et al 2010 and n2o from the biogas combustion process was estimated from doka 2003 the share of chemical cost accounted for a relatively high share of total cost of wwtp so considering the generality of the chemical sector in exiobase the ghg emission of chemicals was estimated from the corresponding emission intensities which were taken from ecoinvent database for the offset ghg emission by scp the ghg intensity of soybean meal in italy was taken from the agri footprint database durlinger et al 2014 the inputs already captured for the wwtp sector were discounted in the background io table the direct ghg emission from the wwtp sector was calculated using structural path analysis according to lenzen and crawford 2009 and malik et al 2015 the total direct indirect ghg emission m can be enumerated as equation 4 where matrix q represents the direct ghg emission of wwtp therefore the direct ghg emission q can be calculated by multiplying matrix m with l 1 hybrid 4 m ql hybrid q 1 a hybrid 1 q qa hybrid qa 2 hybrid qa 3 hybrid qa n hybrid the final step of the hybrid lca is defining the final demand f according to functional unit in this study 1 m3 treated wastewater was used as the final demand in each scenario the demand of other sectors was set to 0 the environmental impact of climate change kgco2 eq euro the economic impact of gross value added euro euro and social impact of employment hours euro were evaluated for all wwtp scenarios per m3 wastewater treated in addition the impacts on 200 sectors in each region were aggregated into 15 sector categories see supplementary information and a detailed analysis of aggregated impacts on environmental social and economic aspects was undertaken 3 results and discussion 3 1 the total impact of the wastewater treatment plant the direct impacts of wwtp and total impacts of wastewater treatment service table 4 indicated the wwtp with agrocycle approach caused greater direct social employment and economic gva impact than conventional wwtp however the total direct and indirect social economic impacts were greater for the conventional technology for these two indicators a greater impact is a positive or good outcome the agrocycle wwtp was estimated to cause less direct and total impact on climate change than the conventional wwtp comparing scenarios with and without upstream impacts suggested the upstream impacts only have a small influence on the direct impact but a much more important influence on the total impact accounting of upstream impact will not influence direct employment and gva for either wwtp approach the gva calculation suggested that even from the point of nutrient valorisation it would be difficult to add economic value to wastewater in practise therefore the market value of wastewater in agro u was also zero for climate change impact accounting for the upstream impact of fruit juice increased the direct ghg emission from wwtp the detailed assessment of the impacts is presented in following sections 3 2 economic impacts the gva of wwtp in all scenarios fig 4 showed that wwtp was the main contributor among all sector groups all scenarios had negative added value in wwtp process the main reason for this was the result indicated that the fruit juice factory could not generate income for processing the wastewater however valorisation through scp production in the wwtp could improve the economic performance the valorised scp that can replace soybean meal for animal feed therefore agrocycle wwtp could reduce the gva in the oil seeds sector which leads to the negative value for total gva of the agricultural and food sector group allocating upstream impact of fruit juice to wastewater would create input demand from the food product sector this has a significant effect on creation of gva in the agricultural and food sector group the analysis indicates that a simple assessment of increase or decrease in gva from process based lca with predefined system boundary or zero burden assumption might be misleading in addition decreasing gva for a very impactful sector such as fossil fuels could be regarded as a positive short term goal there is certainly a perception that decreasing demand for soybean for animal feed may be worth more than the gva generated by the sector willett et al 2019 an issue to note was the agrocycle wwtp created more gva in the sectors fossil based fuel and chemical and materials this was triggered by the greater demand for electricity thermal energy and chemical in anaerobic sbr aerobic mbr and scp production a transition to renewable energy would alleviate this antagonistic outcome however there is now some concern about the adverse impacts of renewable energy e g hydro power grill et al 2015 conventional wwtp had better economic performance in sector for transport administrative and personal service business and financial service and sludge treatment the smaller amount of sludge from agrocycle wwtps reduced the added value in the supply chain of sludge treatment service the offset of soybean by scp product also contributed to the lower gva in transport administrative and personal service and business and financial service sectors although wwtps with agrocycle approach caused greater direct gva the reduced gva in the background sectors led to a smaller total gva per m3 wastewater treated in agro and agro u to improve the total gva of agrocycle wwtp further development of supporting sectors e g administrative and personal service and business and financial service for scp is required the implication of including upstream gva in the analysis was for most sector groups at least a 10 increase than the gva compared to non upstream impact scenarios the difference in gva for the agrocycle wwtp was greater than for conventional wwtp the most significant changes existed in the sectors agricultural and food administrative and personal service business and financial service and transport the differences ranged from 23 to 96 this indicated the importance of allocating upstream impact for the total gva evaluation especially for the background sectors 3 3 social impacts the contribution of employment was concentrated mainly in the sector agricultural and food fig 5 the agrocycle wwtp caused a marked reduction in employment caused by the reduced labor demand associated with the offset soybean in oil seed sector for agricultural and food supply chains primary production at farm stage is normally associated with intensive labor demand chen and holden 2016 huang et al 2009 as with the economic impact there are some important impacts of soybean production that could well be valued far greater than employment but that would depend on specific geographical locations comparing the conv u and conv scenarios the employment by the agricultural and food sector group in conv u was almost five times greater than employment in conv the increase was driven by input demand from the food product sector while in the two agrocycle scenarios the change in the agricultural and food sector group was small because of the high share of the oil seed sector the marked differences between upstream and non upstream scenario was also noted for the sectors administrative and personal service business and financial service transport and chemical and materials the differences ranged from 25 to 89 so similar to gva the employment results also suggested allocation of upstream impact can play an important role in evaluation of employment in the background sectors in contrast the foreground wwtp system had no change of employment in upstream and non upstream scenario the contribution to total employment was quite small 3 4 environmental impacts wwtp was the main contributor to total ghg emission and thus climate change impact fig 6 for conventional wwtp ghg emission from direct inputs to wwtp accounted for 29 31 of total ghg emissions for the agrocycele wwtp the negative value for direct ghg emissions was almost double the total ghg value the offset ghg emissions caused by soybean meal production accounted for the dominant share of direct ghg emission in agrocycle wwtp this suggested that wastewater valorisation through scp production could significantly reduce the climate change impact of wwtp in this study the ghg intensity of soybean meal in italy was 2 57 kg co2 eq kg it is worth noting that the ghg intensity of soybean from other regions could be much lower so the benefits are not necessarily universal according to agri footprint database american soybean meal has emission value of 0 8 kg co2 eq kg so the benefit of agrocycle wwtp in that context would be much smaller to treat one m3 wastewater the direct ghg emission from agrocycle and conventional treatment stages are 4 33 kg co2 eq and 0 08 kg co2 eq respectively although both wwtps have n2o and ch4 emission the scp in agrocycle scenarios resulted in a negative value for direct ghg emission from wwtp the other inputs to the wwtp have positive values for ghg emissions table 5 indicates the contribution of inputs to direct ghg emission excluding the emission from wwtp in all scenarios for conventional wwtp electricity was found to be the main contributor to direct ghg emissions it accounted for 60 from conv and 69 from conv u similar findings were reported in previous wwtp lca studies corominas et al 2013a gallego et al 2008 zang et al 2015 for agrocycle wwtp electricity had smaller contribution to direct ghg emission to process one m3 wastewater in agrocycle wwtp the ghg emission from electricity only ranges from 28 to 30 in agrocycle scenarios however in agrocycle wwtp the ghg emission from fossil fuel was more than double the ghg emissions from electricity generation this was caused by greater natural gas consumption which was used as thermal energy for the anaerobic sbr and scp production stages comparing the upstream and non upstream scenarios the contribution of upstream impact to direct ghg emissions in conv u was greater than conv scenario the effect of upstream impact in agrocycle wwtps was much smaller but the results still indicated that upstream impact would have an influence on direct ghg emissions the major sector groups associated with indirect ghg emissions were fossil fuel transport administrative and personal service business and financial service and manufacture and equipment fig 6 the indirect ghg emissions accounted for 68 of total ghg in the conv scenario and 71 in the conv u scenario the sectors fossil fuel and transport were the main indirect ghg contributors for conventional wwtp about 50 of total indirect ghg due to the electricity and material consumption used by conventional wwtp the sector of administrative and personal service and business and financial service also contributed 25 of total indirect ghg from conventional wwtp for agrocycle wwtp the impact contribution from the fossil fuel sector as indirect ghg emissions was reduced while the indirect ghg contribution from administrative and personal service and business and financial service sector increased this suggested agrocycle wwtp shifted indirect ghg from resource based sectors to service based sectors it is worth noting that the total indirect ghg emission from agrocycle and conventional wwtp was almost the same with the main difference due to upstream and non upstream scenarios 3 5 sustainability implication based on the economic social and environmental results above agro industrial wastewater valorisation can improve the environmental performance as indicated by climate change impact but will have less influence on social economic performance as indicated by employment and gva the offsetting of the impact of soybean meal by valorised scp offers more carbon credit than the additional ghg emissions from the increased demand for thermal energy and chemical and material consumption a transition to renewable energy and bioeconomy may increase the relative benefits further the negative ghg emissions for the agrocycle wwtp was due to the carbon reduction associated with decreased demand for soybean production its relative value also depends on the ghg intensity of the offset soybean meal this will vary through space and time as well agrocycle wwtp can create more value for the plant owner and wwtp system but conventional wwtp can add more gva for background sectors the decreased demand for sludge treatment and transport can be regard as an improvement of resource efficiency in term of sustainability it was positive indicator and should be supported to further improve the economic performance over the background sectors more development is required in the administrative and personal service and business and financial service sectors possible solutions include supporting more research activities on valorised scp and developing better reverse supply chains for valorised products ülkü and hsuan 2017 another option for increasing total gva using the agrocycle wwtp technology is to valorise more scp and other products e g pectin per unit wastewater galanakis et al 2010 this would generate a greater demand for technology and thus inputs from the administrative and personal service sector and leads to greater gva 3 6 limit and future research for employment valorising nutrients from wastewater reduced working hours the reduction of working hours on farms producing soybean will need to be valued against the other adverse impacts caused by such farms and the steady development of new technology that is normally associated with improvement of agricultural productivity and reduction of labor intensity in agriculture sector espey and thilmany 2000 ruttan 2002 which would probably reduce employment hours anyway the scp can provide the same function as soybean meal but with much less labor demand improving the labor efficiency of protein production through scp valorisation could be regard as positive feature as the nature of labor is changing it should not only be evaluated by working hours from a quantity point of view in the future agrocycle wwtp is worth promoting unless regional stakeholders have a very high priority associated with employment hours the assumed allocation factor for upstream impact to wastewater 1 was equal to the magnitude of a mass energy flow that could be excluded using the lca cut off rule shen et al 2010 this rule imposed the upstream impact could be excluded however the economic social and environmental results all suggested that upstream impacts as small as only 1 had a marked influence on the direct and total impacts so could not be ignored an accurate allocation method for upstream impact is required for wwtp with nutrient recovery or any other valorisation technology the zero burden assumption should not be adopted in this case as suggested for other valorisation technologies by oldfield and holden 2014 perhaps the most important limitation of this study was absence of an accurate allocation method for the upstream impact from fruit juice to wastewater in future work the allocation of upstream impact could be based on the nutrient content such as sugar content in fruit juice and wastewater upstream impacts can also be allocated to corresponding sector e g food product in the exiobase input output table finally the rebound effect caused by displacing soybean with scp technology on the soybean market was excluded this is the normal approach hybrid lcas with small functional unit acquaye et al 2011 genovese et al 2017 malik et al 2015 because at sectoral intervention level the annual scp production from the wwtp is around 2 000 t which would be expected to have a negligible effect on soybean meal price for sectoral effect future studies should estimate the potential scp from the whole juice sector which requires the information about sectoral juice productivity the scp productivity from different types of agro industrial wastewater should be investigated to fully understand the impact implications of this technology 4 conclusion agro industrial wastewater has high nutrient value valorising wastewater nutrients could increase the added value of the treatment plant and influence the sustainability of the food processing facility this study was the first attempt to use hybrid lca to evaluate the comprehensive environmental social and economic performance of a wastewater treatment plant for a fruit juice factory the results indicated that valorising agro industrial wastewater streams using scp technology can improve the environmental performance indicated by climate change and resource use efficiency however the current valorisation technology could only drive positive social economic impact to the wwtp system and not the whole background economy especially for social aspect the agrocycle wwtp can contribute to technical transformation of agricultural labor however it is not a suitable option for those situations that prioritise employment hybrid lca can capture the impacts which could be cut off by inappropriate system boundary placement in conventional process lca in order to improve the social economic impacts and promote a circular bioeconomy model in the fruit juice sector further development is required to better understand valorisation productivity and develop better reverse supply chains to create more social economic value for the products this study provides comprehensive sustainability information for stakeholders in wastewater treatment and the fruit juice sectors the implication can be used for making management or pollical decision with consideration of three aspects of sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18253,in this study an ammonium nitrogen nh4 n adsorption and regeneration aar was constructed by a zeolite packed column and naclo nacl regeneration unit and coupled with an anoxic aerobic ao system to achieve efficient removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus under short hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt compared to conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao process the proposed ao aar process achieved more efficient and stable nitrogen removal with greatly shorter hrt 5 6 h and srt 8 d at 10 4 c with nh4 n and total nitrogen in the effluent below 1 5 and 8 0 mg l respectively the ao aar also obtained efficient phosphorus removal 0 5 mg l by dosing aluminum in aerobic tank high load and short srt deteriorated sludge settleability and dewaterability but enhanced methane production by improving sludge biodegradability dosing aluminum made the ao operating module more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability and further enhanced methane production short hrt and srt also resulted in the thriving of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and heterotrophic nitrifiers acinetobacter pseudomonas and rhodobacter in the ao module which helped in enhancing denitrification potential and nitrification efficiency under low temperature long term operation showed that exchange capacity and physicochemical properties of zeolite were unchanged under naclo nacl regeneration by introducing the tail gas from aerobic tank into the used regenerant to remove ca2 and mg2 exchanged from effluent of the ao module techno economic analysis showed that the ao aar process is attractive and sustainable for municipal wastewater treatment by significantly improving nitrogen removal greatly reducing land occupancy enhancing methane production and achieving efficient reduction of carbon dioxide emission graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment nitrogen removal ion exchange regeneration zeolite 1 introduction nitrogenous compounds discharged from municipal and industrial wastewaters are drivers of eutrophication and oxygen depletion in receiving water bodies polluting waterways and the coastal zone rockström et al 2009 in municipal wastewater nitrogen is primarily presented in the form of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and organic nitrogen that readily changes to nh4 n accompanied with hydrolysis in conventional biological wastewater treatment systems nitrogen removal depends on a two step process of nitrification and denitrification nitrification process is usually achieved by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob which have slow growth rates and are much sensitive to low temperature dissolved oxygen do and inhibitory compounds tang and chen 2015 zhou et al 2015a therefore nitrification is deteriorated in winter months or the presence of toxic compounds discharge from industrial wastewater in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps leading to high nh4 n concentrations in the effluent young et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in order to ensure efficient nh4 n removal prolonging hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt are usually applied as design and operational measures but both enhance land occupancy and the later also reduces the phosphorus removal inevitably zhang et al 2017a denitrification is usually prohibited by the unstable nitrification or shortage of electron donors in municipal wastewater wang et al 2015 in wastewater with deficient carbon sources denitrification usually disturbs anaerobic phosphorus release due to its preferential utilization of carbon source and induces expensive operation cost owing to the dosing of external carbon source conventional nitrogen removal in wwtps have been facing enormous challenges because of the limitation of land area investment wastewater characteristics and operational cost many studies have been conducted to develop more efficient stable economic and compact nitrogen removal process the biological methods targeting to decrease requirements of oxygen supply and electron donors including shortcut nitrogen removal via nitrite kornaros et al 2010 and partial nitritation and anammox van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 were developed and successfully applied in the treatment of warm and concentrated streams e g digester supernatant lackner et al 2014 these methods are considered as promising way to achieve efficient nitrogen removal and energy savings but highly variable and dilute characteristics of influent wastewater low temperature and stringent discharge standards have prohibited their applications in mainstream currently laureni et al 2019 compared to biological nitrogen removal methods ion exchange process has capability for effective nh4 n removal with a higher rate and is almost unaffected by temperature and ph fluctuations suitable for low nh4 n concentration and easy to operate li et al 2010 various ion exchange materials especially zeolites natural or synthetic and cation exchange resins were investigated in literatures and showed high exchange capacities and selectivity for nh4 n removal malovanyy et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b ion exchange is unsuitable for high nh4 n concentration owing to the decreased removal efficiency with the rise in concentration saltali et al 2007 and the limited ion exchange capacity but effective regeneration method is expected to change the limit of concentration even though one time use of ion exchange materials is not economically feasible these materials can be easily regenerated by nacl solution malovanyy et al 2013 chlorination zhang et al 2017b or electrolysis lahav et al 2013 li et al 2010 to convert nh4 n to gaseous nh3 for recovery or n2 with efficient and sustainable nitrogen removal by ion exchange regeneration cycle the wastewater treatment system is expected to be designed with short hrt and srt for the degradation of organic matters and phosphorus removal furthermore contradictions between nitrogen removal and biological phosphorus removal for srt nitrification and carbon sources denitrification can be solved by the combination of ion exchange with the activated sludge process in this study an nh4 n adsorption and regeneration aar was constructed by a zeolite packed column and a naclo nacl regeneration unit and coupled with an anoxic aerobic ao system ao aar to achieve simultaneous and efficient removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus under short hrt and srt pollutants removal performance sludge properties and microbial community structures of the ao aar system were investigated and compared with a full scale wwtp with conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao process in the identical time interval in addition characteristics of regenerant and zeolites after multiple operation cycles were investigated to evaluate the long term operation performance of the ao aar system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions two pilot scale ao aar systems fig 1 were fed with influent wastewater of dongqu municipal wwtp shanghai china and operated for 71 days at constant flow rate of 240 l d temperature was in the range of 6 7 14 4 c during operation 2 1 1 ao module hrts of anoxic and aerobic tank in the ao module were 1 5 and 2 0 h respectively the secondary clarifier was made of cylindrical and conical plexiglass with inner diameter of 270 mm and a height of 200 mm an agitator was mounted in the anoxic zone to maintain sludge suspended air was supplied through micro pore pipes to aerobic tanks to maintain do levels of 3 0 4 0 mg l aluminum chloride alcl3 6h2o 98 was added into the aerobic tank of one ao module aoa at dosage of 3 48 mg al l for phosphorus removal the two bioreactors were inoculated at mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of 3 0 0 5 g l by sludge from the wwtp with an aao process srt of the ao module was kept at 8 d by discharging waste activated sludge was from secondary clarifier the mixed liquor recirculation ratio and returned sludge ratio were maintained at 200 and 100 by peristaltic pump for both systems 2 1 2 zeolite packed column the effluent of ao module was fed into the aar module consisting of a zeolite packed column and a regeneration tank the zeolite packed column was a cylinder with an inner diameter of 90 mm and a height of 400 mm operated in up flow mode fig 1 and retention time of empty column ecrt was 0 25 h the natural zeolite nz used in this study are commercial products from jinyun county zhejiang province china and provided with mean particle size of 1 2 mm and initial adsorption capacity of 3 4 mg nh4 n g the zeolite was washed to remove any fines and other undesirable materials before packed into the column 2 1 3 regeneration unit two zeolite packed columns were equipped in parallel for each ao module and the spare column was switched to operation when nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the other column reached the required level then the column adsorbed with nh4 n was regenerated and put back in service after regeneration in this study the zeolite packed column was continuously fed with effluent of the ao module for 24 h then switched to regeneration step by pumping regenerant into the column to immerse loaded zeolite for 4 h and then maintained idle for 20 h until the next cycle the regenerant is a mixed solution of 20 g l nacl and naclo with molar ratio of naclo in the regenerant and adsorbed nh4 n in zeolite of 1 75 zhang et al 2017b tail gas collected from the aerobic tank of the ao module was introduced into the regeneration tank under the idle stage to remove exchanged ca2 and mg2 from wastewater 2 2 full scale wastewater treatment plant for comparison in order to compare with conventional wastewater treatment process wastewater and sludge samples were also collected from the bailonggang wwtp with treatment capacity of 2 800 000 m3 d which was operated with an aao process with or without chemical phosphorus removal in aerobic tank aaoa and aaoc hrts of the anaerobic tank anoxic tank aerobic tank and secondary clarifier were 1 51 2 03 8 25 and 5 50 h respectively zhou et al 2015a the do in the aerobic stage was controlled at 2 5 mg l ratios of returned sludge and mixed liquor recirculation were both controlled at 100 and srt was maintained at 15 0 d 2 3 microbial community analysis two samples were taken from mixed liquor of the two reactors on day 71 and then analyzed by miseq sequencing to reveal microbial community evolution in the reactors and effects of aluminum on microbial structures deoxyribonucleic acid extraction polymerase chain reaction amplifications and amplicons purification were conducted in accordance with zheng et al 2019a after purification amplicons from the samples were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an average length of 396 bp by setting a 3 distance limit α based on cluster information parameters referring to species richness chao and ace community diversity shannon and simpson and sequencing depth good s coverage were calculated by mothur software http www mothur org 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the influent effluent of ao and zeolite packed column were analyzed every two days according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 mlss and volatile suspended solids in the ao were determined twice a week the sludge settleability was characterized by the sludge volume index svi after 30 min of settling do in aerobic tank was monitored using an hq40d portable meter hach usa the concentrations of ca2 and al3 were determined using the icp 7510 shimadzu japan sludge specific resistance to filtrate srf was measured according to pressure filtration method capillary suction time cst was measured with a portable 304b instrument triton uk equipped with an 18 mm diameter funnel and whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper the particle size distribution was monitored using an sald 2201 laser diffraction particle size analyzer shimadzu japan the viscosity of sludge was measured with a brookfield viscometer brookfield usa biochemical methane potential of was was measured and calculated as specific methane production smp according to ruan et al 2019 morphology and composition of zeolites before and after long term regeneration were analyzed by using jsm 7800f field emission scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan and d8 x ray powder diffraction xrd analyzer 40 kv 40 ma step size 0 1 bruker ltd germany respectively differences of pollutants in the effluent were compared by one way factor analysis of variance anova using office excel 2010 microsoft usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutant removal performance variations of pollutant concentrations and mlss in the two ao aars are illustrated in fig 2 with cod in the influent varying in a wide range from 132 0 to 403 2 mg l the two ao aars were almost equally effective in cod removal fig 2a the average cod concentrations in the effluent of aoa aar and aoc aar were 19 3 9 3 and 22 2 9 5 mg l respectively the one way anova results showed no significant difference between the two systems in cod removal indicating that dosing alcl3 had no adverse effects on biodegradation of organic substances fig 2b depicts variations of tn concentrations in the influent and effluent of the two ao aars tn concentration and cod tn ratio in the influent were 37 9 10 8 mg l and 7 1 the average tn concentration in the effluent of aoa aoc aoa aar and aoc aar was 14 1 6 2 14 7 5 1 6 6 2 2 and 6 5 2 2 mg l respectively the ao aar process obtained greatly lower tn in the effluent than the bailonggang wwtp 10 57 1 87 mg l ao membrane bioreactor ao mbr operated in the same wwtp 12 26 7 20 mg l zheng et al 2019b and most systems summarized by zhou et al 2018 in winter with influent nh4 n concentration of 30 0 10 3 mg l nh4 n concentration in the effluent of aoa aoc aoa aar and aoc aar was 8 4 7 3 8 1 5 6 0 5 0 6 and 0 3 0 1 mg l respectively fig 2c it was observed that nitrification was partially inhibited in the ao module with lower srt and the posterior zeolite packed column achieved efficient nh4 n removal which resulted in high removal efficiencies of both nh4 n 94 7 96 0 and tn 82 5 82 8 zeolites had high exchange rate capacity and selectivity for nh4 n removal and their ion exchange capacity can be recovered after naclo nacl regeneration by oxidizing most nh4 n in the zeolite into gaseous nitrogen malovanyy et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b as shown in fig 2b d the major nitrogen species in tn of the effluent was no3 n 2 79 2 01 and 2 97 1 83 mg l suggesting that inhibition of nitrification in the ao module was important for efficient nitrogen removal in the ao aar system anova results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two systems in nh4 n and tn removal in the ao module although many literatures have reported that aluminum had inhibitory effects on nitrifiers liu et al 2011 fig 2e shows variations of tp concentrations in the influent and effluent of the two ao aars compared to aoc aar with tp removal of 64 6 aoa aar achieved higher efficiency of 91 2 anova α 0 05 showed that there was significant difference of effluent tp between the two systems indicating that dosing al3 favored phosphorus removal in aoc tp removal mainly depends on sludge discharge at short srt of 8 d and assimilation by microorganisms in aoa besides biological phosphorus removal chemical precipitation by dosing aluminum greatly enhanced phosphorus removal to ensure low and stable tp concentration in the effluent it should be noted that zeolite packed column also removed tp by 0 15 mg l and guaranteed tp concentration in the effluent of aoa aar below 0 5 mg l 3 2 characteristics of activated sludge in the ao module as shown in fig 2f mlss concentrations in the two ao modules were relatively stable with average value of 3 4 0 7 and 2 4 0 3 g l in aoa and aoc respectively as shown in table 1 sludge in the ao modules showed significantly higher vss ss ratios than the full scale aao which was attributed to their high organic load and short srt higher organic contents in was resulted in higher smp of 129 0 4 5 and 119 5 3 3 ml ch4 g vs in aoa and aoc which were 13 9 and 15 5 higher than those in the corresponding aao bolzonella et al 2005 also observed similar smp and found that smp decreased from 180 to 70 ml g vs when increasing srt from 8 to 35 d it is confirmed that smp was heavily affected by srt and the decrease in sludge biodegradability is very significant at longer srt 8 d ge et al 2013 the above results also showed that dosing small amount of aluminum was conducive to sludge anaerobic digestion and increased smp compared to aaoc aoc showed worse sludge settleability owing to its greatly higher svi value 313 4 178 8 ml g table 1 previous studies demonstrated that svi of activated sludge increased with decreasing srt or hrt of bioreactors campbell et al 2019 as shown in table 1 dosing aluminum improved sludge settleability by enlarging particle size by 73 6 and decreasing sludge viscosity by 66 1 dosing aluminum also improved sludge dewaterability of the ao module which was also deteriorated in aoc in comparison to aaoc the beneficial effects of aluminum on sludge dewaterability have been reported by wang et al 2018b therefore dosing aluminum made aoa operation more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability and enhanced smp of sludge 3 3 microbial community structure 3 3 1 richness and diversity of microbial communities table 2 compares statistical results of richness and diversity of microbial community in the ao module with those in aao and ao mbr ace and chao estimator in table 2 both indicated that aoc exhibited greatly lower microbial richness than aaoc and ao mbr zheng et al 2019a higher shannon and lower simpson index indicated microbial communities in aaoc and ao mbr was more diverse than those in aoc the results inferred that short hrt and srt were the major reason for the great decrease of microbial richness and diversity which was confirmed by findings that otu richness and diversity increased with prolonging srts gerrity and neyestani 2019 and hrt cheng et al 2018a compared to aoc aoa with chemical phosphorus removal showed higher ace chao and shannon indices and lower simpson indices it is indicated that dosing aluminum in activated sludge enhanced richness and diversity of microbial communities and made the enriched otus in communities distributed more evenly zheng et al 2018 also found that aluminum salt addition enhanced microbial diversity of anaerobic mbr 3 3 2 taxonomic complexity of the bacterial community fig 3 a shows the relative abundance of bacterial communities in samples collected from aoa aoc and aaoc at the phylum level proteobacteria 32 52 80 46 bacteroidetes 6 38 21 17 firmicutes 2 99 12 56 and actinobacteria 1 06 14 43 were four predominant phyla in the three samples and were commonly found in activated sludge systems cheng et al 2018b the relative abundance of proteobacteria in aoc 80 46 was 2 47 times of that in aaoc 32 52 and obviously higher than those in conventional activated sludge cas systems 10 4 67 4 chen et al 2019 su et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019a in contrast relative abundances of bacteroidetes 21 17 actinobacteria 14 43 chloroflexi 7 35 saccharibacteria 7 53 acidobacteria 4 26 verrucomicrobia 2 36 nitrospirae 1 39 and parcubacteria 1 63 in aaoc were significantly higher than those in aoc 8 53 1 06 0 65 0 26 0 36 0 45 0 07 and 0 15 respectively the total relative abundances of bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia in aoc was 1 35 times of those in aoa indicating that aluminum addition reduced their abundances pan et al 2014 more detailed microbial community profiles at genus level are demonstrated by a hierarchically clustered heatmap in fig 3b aoc and aoa were clustered together and separated from aaoc indicating clear distinctions of microbial community structure between ao module with short hrt and the aao system in spite of the fact aluminum addition into aoa altered its microbial structure filamentous sulfur bacteria thiothrix affiliated to phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant genus in aoc 40 92 which was higher than that in aaoc 0 02 and cas rodriguez sanchez et al 2018 low hrt and high organic and nitrogen loading rates in aoc resulted in the thriving of thiothrix qiu et al 2016 and the high relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria aluminum dosing into aoa inhibited thiothrix by 13 81 and converted a bulking sludge caused by thiothrix into a well settling granular sludge henriet et al 2017 leading to improvements of sludge settleability and dewaterability table 1 dechloromonas 10 88 acidovorax 4 93 trichococcus 4 60 and flavobacterium 4 20 were the second to fifth dominant genera in aoc it was reported that dechloromonas acidovorax and flavobacterium played important roles in nitrogen removal phosphorus accumulation and granule structure stabilization wang et al 2018a the relative abundances of dechloromonas and flavobacterium in aoc were 5 73 and 7 37 times of those in aaoc and 5 52 and 4 57 times of that in aoa while acidovorax was enriched in aoa the relative abundance of trichococcus which utilize carbohydrates to produce short chain fatty acid ethanol and co2 pikuta et al 2006 in aoc was obviously higher than that in aaoc 1 44 and aluminum dosing further enriched the genus in aoa 6 09 in aaoc candidatus microthrix 9 78 norank f saprospiraceae 9 34 norank p saccharibacteria 6 46 norank f mle1 27 2 26 and terrimonas 2 20 were the first five predominant genera the results indicated that the difference of operational conditions between aoc and aaoc played a significant effect on taxonomic evolution and generated unique microbial community in the ao module besides being notorious in causing foaming and bulking candidatus microthrix belonging to phylum actinobacteria was heterotrophic organisms that can reduce nitrate vieira et al 2019 predatory bacteria norank f saprospiraceae and hydrolytic bacteria norank p saccharibacteria and terrimonas emerged in aaoc with relative abundances of 12 0 24 8 and 73 3 times of those in aoc additionally the relative abundance of norank f mle1 27 within phylum proteobacteria was only 0 01 in aoc the rhodobacter genus is a metabolically diverse bacterium found ubiquitously in soil and in wastewater vieira et al 2019 which was 1 06 and 0 97 in aoc and aaoc and lower than that in aoa 4 37 the dominant genera of the three systems were majorly from phylum proteobacteria and bacteroidetes 3 3 3 nitrifiers to inhibit the enrichment of nitrifiers the ao module was designed with short hrt and operated with short srt under low temperature with aluminum dosing and thus the total relative abundance of autotrophic aob genera including nitrosomonas hira et al 2018 and norank f nitrosomonadaceae xu et al 2019 in aoc 0 05 and aoa 0 10 was greatly lower than that in aaoc 0 42 respectively meanwhile the autotrophic nob genus nitrospira xu et al 2019 was also enriched in aaoc 1 39 rather than in aoa 0 75 and aoc 0 07 but strangely there was still a certain nitrification capability in the aoa and aoc with nh4 n removal of 72 1 and 73 0 which was because the enrichment of heterotrophic nitrifiers in the ao module as shown in table 3 three genera responsible for heterotrophic nitrification acinetobacter yao et al 2013 pseudomonas liu et al 2018 and rhodobacter chen et al 2019 were enriched in both aoa and aoc with total relative abundances of 3 84 and 2 15 times of that in aaoc compared with autotrophic aob and nob heterotrophic nitrifiers was predominant in the ao module due to their faster growth rate and better cold adaptation yao et al 2013 in addition high organic load in the ao module also favored heterotrophic nitrification because of their carbon dependency chen et al 2019 the development of heterotrophic nitrifiers offset the loss in the overall nitrification activities which was unfavorable to tn removal of the ao aar system in this study nevertheless the enrichment of heterotrophic nitrifiers helped in enhancing nitrification efficiency under low temperature for cas systems 3 3 4 denitrifiers from the microbiological perspective the ao module had high denitrification potential because thiothrix a sulfur based autotrophic denitrifiers feng et al 2018 was massively enriched in both aoc and aoa in comparison to aaoc dechloromonas correlated with denitrifying phosphate accumulation and perchlorate reduction cheng et al 2018b was the second dominant genus in the ao module and the most predominant genus in aaoc for denitrification acidovorax was the third dominant denitrifying genus in aoc 4 93 yang et al 2019 with relative abundance higher than in aaoc and aoa 1 08 and 1 10 compared to aaoc aoc enriched genera flavobacterium 4 20 azospira 2 73 comamonas 0 47 brevundimonas 0 19 and norank f rhodocyclaceae 0 07 responsible for denitrification besides anoxic denitrifiers some genera responsible for aerobic denitrification were also detected including the three heterotrophic nitrifiers mentioned above acinetobacter pseudomonas and rhodobacter thauera thermomonas and hyphomicrobium were another three genera acting as aerobic denitrifiers yao et al 2013 the relative abundance of thauera was the highest in aaoc 1 14 followed by aoc 0 92 and the lowest in aoa 0 48 thermomonas and hyphomicrobium were both preferentially enriched in aoa 1 35 and 0 59 and showed the lowest relative abundance of 0 26 and 0 08 in aoc it is indicated that the ao module with short hrt and srt had high denitrification potential 3 4 nitrogen removal by zeolite packed columns 3 4 1 long term performance of aar system in order to determine ecrt for nh4 n adsorption batch tests of column adsorption naclo nacl regeneration were carried out firstly with initial nh4 n concentration of 25 mg l under three ecrts of 5 10 and 15 min the profiles of nh4 n concentration in the effluent of zeolite packed columns in different cycles are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 under ecrts of 5 10 and 15 min the nh4 n concentration in the effluent were 14 9 6 9 and 1 4 mg l at the end of adsorption stage for the first cycle then increased to 18 7 11 1 and 3 2 mg l for the second cycle and 20 2 13 0 and 5 5 mg l for the tenth cycle respectively ecrt of 15 min is adequate for effective control nh4 n concentration in the effluent the results also suggested that adsorption capacity of zeolite was attenuated after multiple adsorption regeneration cycles for real wastewater treatment which was probably because of competitive adsorption of ca2 and mg2 with nh4 n huang et al 2015 continuous measurement showed that ca2 and mg2 concentrations decreased by 26 76 4 35 and 2 19 2 17 mg l after passing through the zeolite packed column respectively these results indicated that zeolite has a certain softening effect on wastewater but some divalent metals occupy adsorption sites of zeolite and disturb nh4 n adsorption in the tenth cycle the regenerant was aerated by tail gas exhausted from the aerobic tank to precipitate ca2 and mg2 as carbonate under weak alkaline naclo nacl mixture before pumping for the regeneration of loaded zeolite co2 production collected from the tail gas of ao was 2 48 mg h and thus the regenerant were aerated for 20 h in the idle stage thus nh4 n concentration in the effluent were 19 8 9 6 and 2 8 mg l at the end of adsorption stage for the eleventh cycle fig 4 which was lower than the level of the second cycle therefore aeration for regenerant can be adopted as an effective measure to enhance regeneration efficiency of nh4 n loaded zeolite and achieved complete reduction of co2 emission from aerobic tank 3 4 2 characteristics of regenerant after multiple operation cycles the adsorption regeneration idle cycles were repeated for 17 times for naclo nacl regenerant to investigate variations of characteristics fig 5 as shown in fig 5a ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the regenerant gradually increased to 3436 0 and 415 2 mg l when zeolite was regenerated for 10 times and then tended to be stable according to mass balance analysis regeneration of ca2 and mg2 in fig 5 can be divided into three stages in the first five regeneration cycles ca2 in the regenerant was derived from both wastewater and zeolite while part of mg2 in the wastewater was adsorbed by zeolite in the second stage ca2 and mg2 exchanged into regenerant was approximately equal to those captured by zeolite from wastewater concentrations of ca2 and mg2 was almost unchanged in the third stage indicating an equilibrium state between regenerant and used zeolite for ion exchange of these divalent metals therefore ca2 and mg2 can be removed by aeration in the idle stage fig 4 and a complete removal campaign by dosing external carbonate is required when their concentrations reached the equilibrium stage 3 4 3 physicochemical characteristics of zeolites before and after long term naclo nacl regeneration the xrd patterns of nz regenerated zeolite from aara rz aara and aarc rz aarc are shown in fig 6 a the results indicate that nz consisted of a mixture of heulandite and quartz which was similar to the report of abukhadra and mohamed 2018 xrd patterns of nz rz aara and rz aarc all had diffraction peaks of heulandite centered at 2θ 11 08 13 32 17 38 19 12 22 35 26 00 27 99 29 98 and 31 97 abukhadra and mohamed 2018 and sio2 centered at 2θ 20 86 26 58 36 44 50 04 59 82 and 68 03 01 075 1555 jcpds card moradi et al 2018 compositions of the zeolite was almost unchanged after regeneration for 24 times the sem pictures of nz rz aara and rz aarc samples are presented in fig 6b sem images showed there was no obvious morphological differences between nz and rz composition and morphological analysis revealed that naclo nacl regenerant used in this study provided a moderate alkaline environment which was harmless to mineral species and surface morphology of zeolite the findings were inconsistent with zhang et al 2017b who also found that naclo nacl regeneration had insignificant adverse effects on textural properties and adsorption performance of zeolite and even led to an increased surface area 3 5 techno economic analysis in this study techno economic analysis was conducted by comparing aoa aar with the full scale aao process in a wwtp treatment cost mainly consists of energy consumption and chemical costs energy consumption are majorly consumed for two distinctive purposes namely provision of gravity water head and or mechanic mixing and provision of oxygenated air by aeration under given conditions the energy consumed for pumping is mainly determined by the volume of the wastewater treated luo et al 2019 therefore pumping energy consumptions for the delivery of wastewater and mixed liquor 0 060 kwh m3 can be considered as the same for aoa aar and aao process compared to aao process aoa aar saved energy consumption of both mixing and aeration but only slightly increase the energy consumption for periodic regeneration and backflushing the mixing energy of aoa aar was 0 0075 kwh m3 according to the recommended method zhou et al 2015b and saved mixing energy for 0 0102 kwh m3 by reducing anoxic hrt from 3 54 in aao to 1 50 h the aeration energy in a wwtp was ranged from 0 148 to 0 222 kwh m3 with the mean energy consumption of 0 296 kwh m3 luo et al 2019 by reducing aerobic hrt from 8 65 to 2 0 h aoa aar system only requires aeration energy for 0 041 kwh m3 and reduced the energy by 0 137 kwh m3 therefore the total energy consumption for aoa aar was 0 108 kwh m3 which saved energy for 0 147 kwh m3 the chemical cost required in aoa aar was majorly applied for tp removal and regeneration of zeolite chemical phosphorus removal required alcl3 with unit price of 361 9 ton of 3 48 mg l with cost of 0 008 m3 which was close to the aao process with simultaneous phosphorus removal the aoa aar newly increased the cost of regeneration for loaded zeolite for loaded zeolite regeneration only naclo 82 2 ton with effective chlorine of 13 was consumed during operation cycle and thus the cost was 0 0402 m3 at dosage of 0 938 mol m3 electrochemical regeneration was also an attractive approach for loaded zeolite because it can be applied during low cost electricity hours lahav et al 2013 and the cost could decrease to 0 0224 m3 considering energy consumption with power cost of 0 117 kwh the total cost of 0 0608 and 0 0430 m3 for naclo and electrochemical regeneration respectively as mentioned above ao aar process with chlorination for regeneration increased wastewater treatment cost even by electrochemical method at low cost electricity hours as an alternative the loaded zeolite can be regenerated by nacl solutions and then the concentrated nh4 n is recycled by ammonia stripping or struvite precipitation or removed by low cost biological transformations malovanyy et al 2013 by combining with low cost regeneration approach the ao aar process recommended in this study is a promising alternative to solve main challenges of cas process i e large upfront investment costs and land area requirements van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 and to realize high efficient control of nitrogenous pollutants discharge the ao aar process with greatly short hrt is expected to significantly improve nitrogen removal reduce land occupancy generate easily degradable sludge with high smp to compensate energy consumption and achieve efficient reduction of co2 emission from aerobic tank 4 conclusions compared to aao process the proposed ao aar process achieved more efficient and stable nitrogen removal with greatly shorter hrt 5 6 h and srt 8 d at 10 4 c with nh4 n and tn in the effluent below 1 5 and 8 0 mg l respectively the ao aar obtained efficient phosphorus removal 0 5 mg l by dosing aluminum in aerobic tank high load and short srt deteriorated sludge settleability and dewaterability but enhanced smp by improving sludge biodegradability dosing aluminum made the ao module operated more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability and further enhanced smp short hrt and srt also resulted in the thriving of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and heterotrophic nitrifiers acinetobacter pseudomonas and rhodobacter in the ao module which helped in enhancing denitrification potential and nitrification efficiency under low temperature long term operation showed that exchange capacity and physicochemical properties of zeolite were unchanged under naclo nacl regeneration by introducing the tail gas from aerobic tank into the used regenerant to remove ca2 and mg2 exchanged from the effluent of the ao module techno economic analysis showed that the ao aar process will significantly improve nitrogen removal greatly reduce land occupancy generate easily degradable sludge with high smp and achieve efficient

18253,in this study an ammonium nitrogen nh4 n adsorption and regeneration aar was constructed by a zeolite packed column and naclo nacl regeneration unit and coupled with an anoxic aerobic ao system to achieve efficient removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus under short hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt compared to conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao process the proposed ao aar process achieved more efficient and stable nitrogen removal with greatly shorter hrt 5 6 h and srt 8 d at 10 4 c with nh4 n and total nitrogen in the effluent below 1 5 and 8 0 mg l respectively the ao aar also obtained efficient phosphorus removal 0 5 mg l by dosing aluminum in aerobic tank high load and short srt deteriorated sludge settleability and dewaterability but enhanced methane production by improving sludge biodegradability dosing aluminum made the ao operating module more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability and further enhanced methane production short hrt and srt also resulted in the thriving of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and heterotrophic nitrifiers acinetobacter pseudomonas and rhodobacter in the ao module which helped in enhancing denitrification potential and nitrification efficiency under low temperature long term operation showed that exchange capacity and physicochemical properties of zeolite were unchanged under naclo nacl regeneration by introducing the tail gas from aerobic tank into the used regenerant to remove ca2 and mg2 exchanged from effluent of the ao module techno economic analysis showed that the ao aar process is attractive and sustainable for municipal wastewater treatment by significantly improving nitrogen removal greatly reducing land occupancy enhancing methane production and achieving efficient reduction of carbon dioxide emission graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment nitrogen removal ion exchange regeneration zeolite 1 introduction nitrogenous compounds discharged from municipal and industrial wastewaters are drivers of eutrophication and oxygen depletion in receiving water bodies polluting waterways and the coastal zone rockström et al 2009 in municipal wastewater nitrogen is primarily presented in the form of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and organic nitrogen that readily changes to nh4 n accompanied with hydrolysis in conventional biological wastewater treatment systems nitrogen removal depends on a two step process of nitrification and denitrification nitrification process is usually achieved by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob which have slow growth rates and are much sensitive to low temperature dissolved oxygen do and inhibitory compounds tang and chen 2015 zhou et al 2015a therefore nitrification is deteriorated in winter months or the presence of toxic compounds discharge from industrial wastewater in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps leading to high nh4 n concentrations in the effluent young et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in order to ensure efficient nh4 n removal prolonging hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt are usually applied as design and operational measures but both enhance land occupancy and the later also reduces the phosphorus removal inevitably zhang et al 2017a denitrification is usually prohibited by the unstable nitrification or shortage of electron donors in municipal wastewater wang et al 2015 in wastewater with deficient carbon sources denitrification usually disturbs anaerobic phosphorus release due to its preferential utilization of carbon source and induces expensive operation cost owing to the dosing of external carbon source conventional nitrogen removal in wwtps have been facing enormous challenges because of the limitation of land area investment wastewater characteristics and operational cost many studies have been conducted to develop more efficient stable economic and compact nitrogen removal process the biological methods targeting to decrease requirements of oxygen supply and electron donors including shortcut nitrogen removal via nitrite kornaros et al 2010 and partial nitritation and anammox van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 were developed and successfully applied in the treatment of warm and concentrated streams e g digester supernatant lackner et al 2014 these methods are considered as promising way to achieve efficient nitrogen removal and energy savings but highly variable and dilute characteristics of influent wastewater low temperature and stringent discharge standards have prohibited their applications in mainstream currently laureni et al 2019 compared to biological nitrogen removal methods ion exchange process has capability for effective nh4 n removal with a higher rate and is almost unaffected by temperature and ph fluctuations suitable for low nh4 n concentration and easy to operate li et al 2010 various ion exchange materials especially zeolites natural or synthetic and cation exchange resins were investigated in literatures and showed high exchange capacities and selectivity for nh4 n removal malovanyy et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b ion exchange is unsuitable for high nh4 n concentration owing to the decreased removal efficiency with the rise in concentration saltali et al 2007 and the limited ion exchange capacity but effective regeneration method is expected to change the limit of concentration even though one time use of ion exchange materials is not economically feasible these materials can be easily regenerated by nacl solution malovanyy et al 2013 chlorination zhang et al 2017b or electrolysis lahav et al 2013 li et al 2010 to convert nh4 n to gaseous nh3 for recovery or n2 with efficient and sustainable nitrogen removal by ion exchange regeneration cycle the wastewater treatment system is expected to be designed with short hrt and srt for the degradation of organic matters and phosphorus removal furthermore contradictions between nitrogen removal and biological phosphorus removal for srt nitrification and carbon sources denitrification can be solved by the combination of ion exchange with the activated sludge process in this study an nh4 n adsorption and regeneration aar was constructed by a zeolite packed column and a naclo nacl regeneration unit and coupled with an anoxic aerobic ao system ao aar to achieve simultaneous and efficient removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus under short hrt and srt pollutants removal performance sludge properties and microbial community structures of the ao aar system were investigated and compared with a full scale wwtp with conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic aao process in the identical time interval in addition characteristics of regenerant and zeolites after multiple operation cycles were investigated to evaluate the long term operation performance of the ao aar system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions two pilot scale ao aar systems fig 1 were fed with influent wastewater of dongqu municipal wwtp shanghai china and operated for 71 days at constant flow rate of 240 l d temperature was in the range of 6 7 14 4 c during operation 2 1 1 ao module hrts of anoxic and aerobic tank in the ao module were 1 5 and 2 0 h respectively the secondary clarifier was made of cylindrical and conical plexiglass with inner diameter of 270 mm and a height of 200 mm an agitator was mounted in the anoxic zone to maintain sludge suspended air was supplied through micro pore pipes to aerobic tanks to maintain do levels of 3 0 4 0 mg l aluminum chloride alcl3 6h2o 98 was added into the aerobic tank of one ao module aoa at dosage of 3 48 mg al l for phosphorus removal the two bioreactors were inoculated at mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of 3 0 0 5 g l by sludge from the wwtp with an aao process srt of the ao module was kept at 8 d by discharging waste activated sludge was from secondary clarifier the mixed liquor recirculation ratio and returned sludge ratio were maintained at 200 and 100 by peristaltic pump for both systems 2 1 2 zeolite packed column the effluent of ao module was fed into the aar module consisting of a zeolite packed column and a regeneration tank the zeolite packed column was a cylinder with an inner diameter of 90 mm and a height of 400 mm operated in up flow mode fig 1 and retention time of empty column ecrt was 0 25 h the natural zeolite nz used in this study are commercial products from jinyun county zhejiang province china and provided with mean particle size of 1 2 mm and initial adsorption capacity of 3 4 mg nh4 n g the zeolite was washed to remove any fines and other undesirable materials before packed into the column 2 1 3 regeneration unit two zeolite packed columns were equipped in parallel for each ao module and the spare column was switched to operation when nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the other column reached the required level then the column adsorbed with nh4 n was regenerated and put back in service after regeneration in this study the zeolite packed column was continuously fed with effluent of the ao module for 24 h then switched to regeneration step by pumping regenerant into the column to immerse loaded zeolite for 4 h and then maintained idle for 20 h until the next cycle the regenerant is a mixed solution of 20 g l nacl and naclo with molar ratio of naclo in the regenerant and adsorbed nh4 n in zeolite of 1 75 zhang et al 2017b tail gas collected from the aerobic tank of the ao module was introduced into the regeneration tank under the idle stage to remove exchanged ca2 and mg2 from wastewater 2 2 full scale wastewater treatment plant for comparison in order to compare with conventional wastewater treatment process wastewater and sludge samples were also collected from the bailonggang wwtp with treatment capacity of 2 800 000 m3 d which was operated with an aao process with or without chemical phosphorus removal in aerobic tank aaoa and aaoc hrts of the anaerobic tank anoxic tank aerobic tank and secondary clarifier were 1 51 2 03 8 25 and 5 50 h respectively zhou et al 2015a the do in the aerobic stage was controlled at 2 5 mg l ratios of returned sludge and mixed liquor recirculation were both controlled at 100 and srt was maintained at 15 0 d 2 3 microbial community analysis two samples were taken from mixed liquor of the two reactors on day 71 and then analyzed by miseq sequencing to reveal microbial community evolution in the reactors and effects of aluminum on microbial structures deoxyribonucleic acid extraction polymerase chain reaction amplifications and amplicons purification were conducted in accordance with zheng et al 2019a after purification amplicons from the samples were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an average length of 396 bp by setting a 3 distance limit α based on cluster information parameters referring to species richness chao and ace community diversity shannon and simpson and sequencing depth good s coverage were calculated by mothur software http www mothur org 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the influent effluent of ao and zeolite packed column were analyzed every two days according to standard methods chinese nepa 2012 mlss and volatile suspended solids in the ao were determined twice a week the sludge settleability was characterized by the sludge volume index svi after 30 min of settling do in aerobic tank was monitored using an hq40d portable meter hach usa the concentrations of ca2 and al3 were determined using the icp 7510 shimadzu japan sludge specific resistance to filtrate srf was measured according to pressure filtration method capillary suction time cst was measured with a portable 304b instrument triton uk equipped with an 18 mm diameter funnel and whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper the particle size distribution was monitored using an sald 2201 laser diffraction particle size analyzer shimadzu japan the viscosity of sludge was measured with a brookfield viscometer brookfield usa biochemical methane potential of was was measured and calculated as specific methane production smp according to ruan et al 2019 morphology and composition of zeolites before and after long term regeneration were analyzed by using jsm 7800f field emission scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan and d8 x ray powder diffraction xrd analyzer 40 kv 40 ma step size 0 1 bruker ltd germany respectively differences of pollutants in the effluent were compared by one way factor analysis of variance anova using office excel 2010 microsoft usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutant removal performance variations of pollutant concentrations and mlss in the two ao aars are illustrated in fig 2 with cod in the influent varying in a wide range from 132 0 to 403 2 mg l the two ao aars were almost equally effective in cod removal fig 2a the average cod concentrations in the effluent of aoa aar and aoc aar were 19 3 9 3 and 22 2 9 5 mg l respectively the one way anova results showed no significant difference between the two systems in cod removal indicating that dosing alcl3 had no adverse effects on biodegradation of organic substances fig 2b depicts variations of tn concentrations in the influent and effluent of the two ao aars tn concentration and cod tn ratio in the influent were 37 9 10 8 mg l and 7 1 the average tn concentration in the effluent of aoa aoc aoa aar and aoc aar was 14 1 6 2 14 7 5 1 6 6 2 2 and 6 5 2 2 mg l respectively the ao aar process obtained greatly lower tn in the effluent than the bailonggang wwtp 10 57 1 87 mg l ao membrane bioreactor ao mbr operated in the same wwtp 12 26 7 20 mg l zheng et al 2019b and most systems summarized by zhou et al 2018 in winter with influent nh4 n concentration of 30 0 10 3 mg l nh4 n concentration in the effluent of aoa aoc aoa aar and aoc aar was 8 4 7 3 8 1 5 6 0 5 0 6 and 0 3 0 1 mg l respectively fig 2c it was observed that nitrification was partially inhibited in the ao module with lower srt and the posterior zeolite packed column achieved efficient nh4 n removal which resulted in high removal efficiencies of both nh4 n 94 7 96 0 and tn 82 5 82 8 zeolites had high exchange rate capacity and selectivity for nh4 n removal and their ion exchange capacity can be recovered after naclo nacl regeneration by oxidizing most nh4 n in the zeolite into gaseous nitrogen malovanyy et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b as shown in fig 2b d the major nitrogen species in tn of the effluent was no3 n 2 79 2 01 and 2 97 1 83 mg l suggesting that inhibition of nitrification in the ao module was important for efficient nitrogen removal in the ao aar system anova results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two systems in nh4 n and tn removal in the ao module although many literatures have reported that aluminum had inhibitory effects on nitrifiers liu et al 2011 fig 2e shows variations of tp concentrations in the influent and effluent of the two ao aars compared to aoc aar with tp removal of 64 6 aoa aar achieved higher efficiency of 91 2 anova α 0 05 showed that there was significant difference of effluent tp between the two systems indicating that dosing al3 favored phosphorus removal in aoc tp removal mainly depends on sludge discharge at short srt of 8 d and assimilation by microorganisms in aoa besides biological phosphorus removal chemical precipitation by dosing aluminum greatly enhanced phosphorus removal to ensure low and stable tp concentration in the effluent it should be noted that zeolite packed column also removed tp by 0 15 mg l and guaranteed tp concentration in the effluent of aoa aar below 0 5 mg l 3 2 characteristics of activated sludge in the ao module as shown in fig 2f mlss concentrations in the two ao modules were relatively stable with average value of 3 4 0 7 and 2 4 0 3 g l in aoa and aoc respectively as shown in table 1 sludge in the ao modules showed significantly higher vss ss ratios than the full scale aao which was attributed to their high organic load and short srt higher organic contents in was resulted in higher smp of 129 0 4 5 and 119 5 3 3 ml ch4 g vs in aoa and aoc which were 13 9 and 15 5 higher than those in the corresponding aao bolzonella et al 2005 also observed similar smp and found that smp decreased from 180 to 70 ml g vs when increasing srt from 8 to 35 d it is confirmed that smp was heavily affected by srt and the decrease in sludge biodegradability is very significant at longer srt 8 d ge et al 2013 the above results also showed that dosing small amount of aluminum was conducive to sludge anaerobic digestion and increased smp compared to aaoc aoc showed worse sludge settleability owing to its greatly higher svi value 313 4 178 8 ml g table 1 previous studies demonstrated that svi of activated sludge increased with decreasing srt or hrt of bioreactors campbell et al 2019 as shown in table 1 dosing aluminum improved sludge settleability by enlarging particle size by 73 6 and decreasing sludge viscosity by 66 1 dosing aluminum also improved sludge dewaterability of the ao module which was also deteriorated in aoc in comparison to aaoc the beneficial effects of aluminum on sludge dewaterability have been reported by wang et al 2018b therefore dosing aluminum made aoa operation more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability and enhanced smp of sludge 3 3 microbial community structure 3 3 1 richness and diversity of microbial communities table 2 compares statistical results of richness and diversity of microbial community in the ao module with those in aao and ao mbr ace and chao estimator in table 2 both indicated that aoc exhibited greatly lower microbial richness than aaoc and ao mbr zheng et al 2019a higher shannon and lower simpson index indicated microbial communities in aaoc and ao mbr was more diverse than those in aoc the results inferred that short hrt and srt were the major reason for the great decrease of microbial richness and diversity which was confirmed by findings that otu richness and diversity increased with prolonging srts gerrity and neyestani 2019 and hrt cheng et al 2018a compared to aoc aoa with chemical phosphorus removal showed higher ace chao and shannon indices and lower simpson indices it is indicated that dosing aluminum in activated sludge enhanced richness and diversity of microbial communities and made the enriched otus in communities distributed more evenly zheng et al 2018 also found that aluminum salt addition enhanced microbial diversity of anaerobic mbr 3 3 2 taxonomic complexity of the bacterial community fig 3 a shows the relative abundance of bacterial communities in samples collected from aoa aoc and aaoc at the phylum level proteobacteria 32 52 80 46 bacteroidetes 6 38 21 17 firmicutes 2 99 12 56 and actinobacteria 1 06 14 43 were four predominant phyla in the three samples and were commonly found in activated sludge systems cheng et al 2018b the relative abundance of proteobacteria in aoc 80 46 was 2 47 times of that in aaoc 32 52 and obviously higher than those in conventional activated sludge cas systems 10 4 67 4 chen et al 2019 su et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019a in contrast relative abundances of bacteroidetes 21 17 actinobacteria 14 43 chloroflexi 7 35 saccharibacteria 7 53 acidobacteria 4 26 verrucomicrobia 2 36 nitrospirae 1 39 and parcubacteria 1 63 in aaoc were significantly higher than those in aoc 8 53 1 06 0 65 0 26 0 36 0 45 0 07 and 0 15 respectively the total relative abundances of bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia in aoc was 1 35 times of those in aoa indicating that aluminum addition reduced their abundances pan et al 2014 more detailed microbial community profiles at genus level are demonstrated by a hierarchically clustered heatmap in fig 3b aoc and aoa were clustered together and separated from aaoc indicating clear distinctions of microbial community structure between ao module with short hrt and the aao system in spite of the fact aluminum addition into aoa altered its microbial structure filamentous sulfur bacteria thiothrix affiliated to phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant genus in aoc 40 92 which was higher than that in aaoc 0 02 and cas rodriguez sanchez et al 2018 low hrt and high organic and nitrogen loading rates in aoc resulted in the thriving of thiothrix qiu et al 2016 and the high relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria aluminum dosing into aoa inhibited thiothrix by 13 81 and converted a bulking sludge caused by thiothrix into a well settling granular sludge henriet et al 2017 leading to improvements of sludge settleability and dewaterability table 1 dechloromonas 10 88 acidovorax 4 93 trichococcus 4 60 and flavobacterium 4 20 were the second to fifth dominant genera in aoc it was reported that dechloromonas acidovorax and flavobacterium played important roles in nitrogen removal phosphorus accumulation and granule structure stabilization wang et al 2018a the relative abundances of dechloromonas and flavobacterium in aoc were 5 73 and 7 37 times of those in aaoc and 5 52 and 4 57 times of that in aoa while acidovorax was enriched in aoa the relative abundance of trichococcus which utilize carbohydrates to produce short chain fatty acid ethanol and co2 pikuta et al 2006 in aoc was obviously higher than that in aaoc 1 44 and aluminum dosing further enriched the genus in aoa 6 09 in aaoc candidatus microthrix 9 78 norank f saprospiraceae 9 34 norank p saccharibacteria 6 46 norank f mle1 27 2 26 and terrimonas 2 20 were the first five predominant genera the results indicated that the difference of operational conditions between aoc and aaoc played a significant effect on taxonomic evolution and generated unique microbial community in the ao module besides being notorious in causing foaming and bulking candidatus microthrix belonging to phylum actinobacteria was heterotrophic organisms that can reduce nitrate vieira et al 2019 predatory bacteria norank f saprospiraceae and hydrolytic bacteria norank p saccharibacteria and terrimonas emerged in aaoc with relative abundances of 12 0 24 8 and 73 3 times of those in aoc additionally the relative abundance of norank f mle1 27 within phylum proteobacteria was only 0 01 in aoc the rhodobacter genus is a metabolically diverse bacterium found ubiquitously in soil and in wastewater vieira et al 2019 which was 1 06 and 0 97 in aoc and aaoc and lower than that in aoa 4 37 the dominant genera of the three systems were majorly from phylum proteobacteria and bacteroidetes 3 3 3 nitrifiers to inhibit the enrichment of nitrifiers the ao module was designed with short hrt and operated with short srt under low temperature with aluminum dosing and thus the total relative abundance of autotrophic aob genera including nitrosomonas hira et al 2018 and norank f nitrosomonadaceae xu et al 2019 in aoc 0 05 and aoa 0 10 was greatly lower than that in aaoc 0 42 respectively meanwhile the autotrophic nob genus nitrospira xu et al 2019 was also enriched in aaoc 1 39 rather than in aoa 0 75 and aoc 0 07 but strangely there was still a certain nitrification capability in the aoa and aoc with nh4 n removal of 72 1 and 73 0 which was because the enrichment of heterotrophic nitrifiers in the ao module as shown in table 3 three genera responsible for heterotrophic nitrification acinetobacter yao et al 2013 pseudomonas liu et al 2018 and rhodobacter chen et al 2019 were enriched in both aoa and aoc with total relative abundances of 3 84 and 2 15 times of that in aaoc compared with autotrophic aob and nob heterotrophic nitrifiers was predominant in the ao module due to their faster growth rate and better cold adaptation yao et al 2013 in addition high organic load in the ao module also favored heterotrophic nitrification because of their carbon dependency chen et al 2019 the development of heterotrophic nitrifiers offset the loss in the overall nitrification activities which was unfavorable to tn removal of the ao aar system in this study nevertheless the enrichment of heterotrophic nitrifiers helped in enhancing nitrification efficiency under low temperature for cas systems 3 3 4 denitrifiers from the microbiological perspective the ao module had high denitrification potential because thiothrix a sulfur based autotrophic denitrifiers feng et al 2018 was massively enriched in both aoc and aoa in comparison to aaoc dechloromonas correlated with denitrifying phosphate accumulation and perchlorate reduction cheng et al 2018b was the second dominant genus in the ao module and the most predominant genus in aaoc for denitrification acidovorax was the third dominant denitrifying genus in aoc 4 93 yang et al 2019 with relative abundance higher than in aaoc and aoa 1 08 and 1 10 compared to aaoc aoc enriched genera flavobacterium 4 20 azospira 2 73 comamonas 0 47 brevundimonas 0 19 and norank f rhodocyclaceae 0 07 responsible for denitrification besides anoxic denitrifiers some genera responsible for aerobic denitrification were also detected including the three heterotrophic nitrifiers mentioned above acinetobacter pseudomonas and rhodobacter thauera thermomonas and hyphomicrobium were another three genera acting as aerobic denitrifiers yao et al 2013 the relative abundance of thauera was the highest in aaoc 1 14 followed by aoc 0 92 and the lowest in aoa 0 48 thermomonas and hyphomicrobium were both preferentially enriched in aoa 1 35 and 0 59 and showed the lowest relative abundance of 0 26 and 0 08 in aoc it is indicated that the ao module with short hrt and srt had high denitrification potential 3 4 nitrogen removal by zeolite packed columns 3 4 1 long term performance of aar system in order to determine ecrt for nh4 n adsorption batch tests of column adsorption naclo nacl regeneration were carried out firstly with initial nh4 n concentration of 25 mg l under three ecrts of 5 10 and 15 min the profiles of nh4 n concentration in the effluent of zeolite packed columns in different cycles are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 under ecrts of 5 10 and 15 min the nh4 n concentration in the effluent were 14 9 6 9 and 1 4 mg l at the end of adsorption stage for the first cycle then increased to 18 7 11 1 and 3 2 mg l for the second cycle and 20 2 13 0 and 5 5 mg l for the tenth cycle respectively ecrt of 15 min is adequate for effective control nh4 n concentration in the effluent the results also suggested that adsorption capacity of zeolite was attenuated after multiple adsorption regeneration cycles for real wastewater treatment which was probably because of competitive adsorption of ca2 and mg2 with nh4 n huang et al 2015 continuous measurement showed that ca2 and mg2 concentrations decreased by 26 76 4 35 and 2 19 2 17 mg l after passing through the zeolite packed column respectively these results indicated that zeolite has a certain softening effect on wastewater but some divalent metals occupy adsorption sites of zeolite and disturb nh4 n adsorption in the tenth cycle the regenerant was aerated by tail gas exhausted from the aerobic tank to precipitate ca2 and mg2 as carbonate under weak alkaline naclo nacl mixture before pumping for the regeneration of loaded zeolite co2 production collected from the tail gas of ao was 2 48 mg h and thus the regenerant were aerated for 20 h in the idle stage thus nh4 n concentration in the effluent were 19 8 9 6 and 2 8 mg l at the end of adsorption stage for the eleventh cycle fig 4 which was lower than the level of the second cycle therefore aeration for regenerant can be adopted as an effective measure to enhance regeneration efficiency of nh4 n loaded zeolite and achieved complete reduction of co2 emission from aerobic tank 3 4 2 characteristics of regenerant after multiple operation cycles the adsorption regeneration idle cycles were repeated for 17 times for naclo nacl regenerant to investigate variations of characteristics fig 5 as shown in fig 5a ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the regenerant gradually increased to 3436 0 and 415 2 mg l when zeolite was regenerated for 10 times and then tended to be stable according to mass balance analysis regeneration of ca2 and mg2 in fig 5 can be divided into three stages in the first five regeneration cycles ca2 in the regenerant was derived from both wastewater and zeolite while part of mg2 in the wastewater was adsorbed by zeolite in the second stage ca2 and mg2 exchanged into regenerant was approximately equal to those captured by zeolite from wastewater concentrations of ca2 and mg2 was almost unchanged in the third stage indicating an equilibrium state between regenerant and used zeolite for ion exchange of these divalent metals therefore ca2 and mg2 can be removed by aeration in the idle stage fig 4 and a complete removal campaign by dosing external carbonate is required when their concentrations reached the equilibrium stage 3 4 3 physicochemical characteristics of zeolites before and after long term naclo nacl regeneration the xrd patterns of nz regenerated zeolite from aara rz aara and aarc rz aarc are shown in fig 6 a the results indicate that nz consisted of a mixture of heulandite and quartz which was similar to the report of abukhadra and mohamed 2018 xrd patterns of nz rz aara and rz aarc all had diffraction peaks of heulandite centered at 2θ 11 08 13 32 17 38 19 12 22 35 26 00 27 99 29 98 and 31 97 abukhadra and mohamed 2018 and sio2 centered at 2θ 20 86 26 58 36 44 50 04 59 82 and 68 03 01 075 1555 jcpds card moradi et al 2018 compositions of the zeolite was almost unchanged after regeneration for 24 times the sem pictures of nz rz aara and rz aarc samples are presented in fig 6b sem images showed there was no obvious morphological differences between nz and rz composition and morphological analysis revealed that naclo nacl regenerant used in this study provided a moderate alkaline environment which was harmless to mineral species and surface morphology of zeolite the findings were inconsistent with zhang et al 2017b who also found that naclo nacl regeneration had insignificant adverse effects on textural properties and adsorption performance of zeolite and even led to an increased surface area 3 5 techno economic analysis in this study techno economic analysis was conducted by comparing aoa aar with the full scale aao process in a wwtp treatment cost mainly consists of energy consumption and chemical costs energy consumption are majorly consumed for two distinctive purposes namely provision of gravity water head and or mechanic mixing and provision of oxygenated air by aeration under given conditions the energy consumed for pumping is mainly determined by the volume of the wastewater treated luo et al 2019 therefore pumping energy consumptions for the delivery of wastewater and mixed liquor 0 060 kwh m3 can be considered as the same for aoa aar and aao process compared to aao process aoa aar saved energy consumption of both mixing and aeration but only slightly increase the energy consumption for periodic regeneration and backflushing the mixing energy of aoa aar was 0 0075 kwh m3 according to the recommended method zhou et al 2015b and saved mixing energy for 0 0102 kwh m3 by reducing anoxic hrt from 3 54 in aao to 1 50 h the aeration energy in a wwtp was ranged from 0 148 to 0 222 kwh m3 with the mean energy consumption of 0 296 kwh m3 luo et al 2019 by reducing aerobic hrt from 8 65 to 2 0 h aoa aar system only requires aeration energy for 0 041 kwh m3 and reduced the energy by 0 137 kwh m3 therefore the total energy consumption for aoa aar was 0 108 kwh m3 which saved energy for 0 147 kwh m3 the chemical cost required in aoa aar was majorly applied for tp removal and regeneration of zeolite chemical phosphorus removal required alcl3 with unit price of 361 9 ton of 3 48 mg l with cost of 0 008 m3 which was close to the aao process with simultaneous phosphorus removal the aoa aar newly increased the cost of regeneration for loaded zeolite for loaded zeolite regeneration only naclo 82 2 ton with effective chlorine of 13 was consumed during operation cycle and thus the cost was 0 0402 m3 at dosage of 0 938 mol m3 electrochemical regeneration was also an attractive approach for loaded zeolite because it can be applied during low cost electricity hours lahav et al 2013 and the cost could decrease to 0 0224 m3 considering energy consumption with power cost of 0 117 kwh the total cost of 0 0608 and 0 0430 m3 for naclo and electrochemical regeneration respectively as mentioned above ao aar process with chlorination for regeneration increased wastewater treatment cost even by electrochemical method at low cost electricity hours as an alternative the loaded zeolite can be regenerated by nacl solutions and then the concentrated nh4 n is recycled by ammonia stripping or struvite precipitation or removed by low cost biological transformations malovanyy et al 2013 by combining with low cost regeneration approach the ao aar process recommended in this study is a promising alternative to solve main challenges of cas process i e large upfront investment costs and land area requirements van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 and to realize high efficient control of nitrogenous pollutants discharge the ao aar process with greatly short hrt is expected to significantly improve nitrogen removal reduce land occupancy generate easily degradable sludge with high smp to compensate energy consumption and achieve efficient reduction of co2 emission from aerobic tank 4 conclusions compared to aao process the proposed ao aar process achieved more efficient and stable nitrogen removal with greatly shorter hrt 5 6 h and srt 8 d at 10 4 c with nh4 n and tn in the effluent below 1 5 and 8 0 mg l respectively the ao aar obtained efficient phosphorus removal 0 5 mg l by dosing aluminum in aerobic tank high load and short srt deteriorated sludge settleability and dewaterability but enhanced smp by improving sludge biodegradability dosing aluminum made the ao module operated more stable with improved settleability and dewaterability and further enhanced smp short hrt and srt also resulted in the thriving of filamentous bacteria thiothrix and heterotrophic nitrifiers acinetobacter pseudomonas and rhodobacter in the ao module which helped in enhancing denitrification potential and nitrification efficiency under low temperature long term operation showed that exchange capacity and physicochemical properties of zeolite were unchanged under naclo nacl regeneration by introducing the tail gas from aerobic tank into the used regenerant to remove ca2 and mg2 exchanged from the effluent of the ao module techno economic analysis showed that the ao aar process will significantly improve nitrogen removal greatly reduce land occupancy generate easily degradable sludge with high smp and achieve efficient

manuals have been developed to simplify and tailor wsps for community managed water suppliers by reducing the 11 sub modules to 6 suggested tasks world health organization 2012 greaves and simmons 2011 unicef and global water partnership 2014 rickert et al 2014 mudaliar et al undated espinoza et al 2009 the evidence on wsps in these settings is limited with lessons from four case studies suggesting 1 to rely on minimal water quality testing in favor of sanitary inspections for hazard identification and implementation of non wsp measures hasan et al 2011 barrington et al 2013 mahmud et al 2007 2 the need for interactive workshops and tools hasan et al 2011 barrington et al 2013 mahmud et al 2007 timilsina 2012 and 3 to couple wsp implementations with existing water sanitation and hygiene wash education activities hasan et al 2011 barrington et al 2013 mahmud et al 2007 timilsina 2012 however as case studies are tailored to local contexts it is difficult to ascertain whether these lessons are transferable furthermore a recent cross context study evaluated wsps in 12 countries and identified a lack of financial and water supply data in rural wsp implementations as compared to urban sites kumpel et al 2018 to fill this evidence gap on the effectiveness and outcomes of wsp implementations in specifically rural community managed contexts we conducted a mixed methods exploratory assessment in four countries to accomplish this aim and having limited information prior to assessment we broadly collected as much data as possible in each country from wsp and non wsp communities as appropriate related to the quality of wsp implementations wsp process and management household characteristics and collection point and household water quality after data collection we triangulated data and compared outcomes between wsp implementations across countries and between wsp and non wsp implementations within each country to determine if wsps can be effective in these contexts and if so develop recommendations on the implementation of wsps in rural community managed contexts 2 materials and methods the wsps assessed in this study were implemented by unicef and their partners according to local priorities before our engagement some of the benefits of the study design include the ability to evaluate real world programs and to have partners implement programs without research influence the drawbacks of the study design are a lack of community baseline data a lack of longitudinal data on wsp outcomes at selected sites and the inability to control for potential implementer bias in their selection of communities that received wsps thus this study was completed using an exploratory case control mixed methods protocol including site selection review of wsp documents to assess implementation quality assessment of wsp management via key informant interviews and focus group discussions characterization of households via surveys assessment of water quality via testing and sanitary inspections and data analysis protocols were approved by the tufts university institutional review board protocols 1607025 1608019 1610007 and 1610006 and the local ethics review process in each country 1 in india the institutional ethics committee at the national environmental engineering research institute in nagpur 2 in drc comité institutionnel d ethique université catholique du bukavu protocol ucb cie 017 2016 and 3 in fiji and vanuatu the research evaluation studies and ethics committee of the unicef pacific region no number assigned 2 1 country selection the unicef water team at headquarters selected eight priority countries where unicef country offices were supporting wsp implementation after discussion with country offices and their partners it was determined that wsps were advanced sufficiently for assessment in four countries india the democratic republic of the congo drc fiji and vanuatu assessment visits to each country were carried out 7 12 months prior to the operational research to ascertain the local wsp implementation program details and develop an appropriate evaluation plan for each country 2 2 site selection for the context of this study rural communities were defined as communities that do not have the potential for large scale utility managed water supply systems and instead depend on small community systems or point sources given time and resources available in the field the target was set to randomly survey 100 households in rural wsp communities and 100 households in rural non wsp communities per country non wsp communities were matched to wsp communities on the criteria of similar population size similar geographic location and as per unicef request were communities already involved in general wash or child protection programming with implementing partners implementing partners and unicef country offices in three countries india fiji and vanuatu provided lists of wsp communities from which 10 were randomly selected for study inclusion ten non wsp communities with the criteria listed above were then selected as matched non wsp communities ten households per community were randomly selected for participation by starting in the community center and skipping a pre determined number of houses in the fourth country drc implementing partners and unicef provided lists of wsp communities from which 20 were randomly chosen for inclusion twenty non wsp communities with similar geographic locations and populations were used as matched non wsp communities households were selected in the same random manner but the number of households visited per community was determined by sampling 3 5 of households 3 7 in each community per department of health request each country had a slightly different definition of wsp communities in india wsp communities were defined as those that operated water supplies under the supervision of a community water technician and non wsp communities were those that did not in drc the study was conducted in one health zone where wsp communities were defined as those that had received certification in the comprehensive 8 step wash training program village assaini from the ministry of health and non wsps were communities in active training steps of the program that had not yet achieved implementation or certification on three islands in fiji and two islands in vanuatu wsp communities were those that received training from implementing partners under the drinking water safety and security plan program and non wsps were communities that had not yet entered the process 2 3 review of wsp documents to assess the quality of wsp implementations documents related to training management and wsp water committee process were evaluated in each country based on the wsp for small community water supplies list of tasks 1 engage community and assemble wsp team 2 describe the community water supply 3 identify hazards hazardous events and existing control measures 4 develop and implement an incremental improvement plan 5 monitor control measures and verify effectiveness of wsp and 6 document review and improve all aspects of wsp implementation world health organization 2012 for each of the six tasks one researcher reviewed each country s material and assigned a numerical score 0 for no inclusion during implementation 1 for partial implementation of the task 2 for basic inclusion of all elements of the task and 3 for detailed and thorough inclusion of all elements of a task a country sum was calculated out of 18 maximum points the material review and score assignment was discussed with another author prior to finalizing 2 4 qualitative data collection to assess the use of the wsp process and identify themes related to management key informant interviews kii and focus group discussions fgd containing primarily qualitative questions were carried out in the local language by trained enumerators kiis were conducted with community leaders 12 22 questions and water system maintainers 5 questions fgds were held with water management committees 26 34 questions community healthcare workers 5 27 questions and community wash committees 17 questions as appropriate to the local context in each country please note kii and fgd length varied in each context depending on the defined role of individuals for instance in fiji there was no single water system maintainer as those functions fell under the responsibility of the village water committee while in india there was a person separate from the village water and sanitation committee with remunerated responsibility for maintaining water systems a thematic analysis was conducted whereby kiis and fgds were coded using a top down theoretical approach braun and clarke 2006 possible themes were first identified using a semantic approach and codes were then refined as the themes were clarified and defined qualitative data were summarized according to five themes pertinent to communities management of their water supplies documentation risk identification and assessment water safety water security and capital and technical assistance a rubric was then developed to review the coded data associated with each theme to contextualize the extent to which communities were able to manage each aspect of their water supplies table s1 2 5 household characteristics household surveys were carried out in the local language on paper surveys by trained enumerators surveys were developed generally for the project adapted for local context in each country and pre tested during enumerator training in each country surveys comprised 57 60 questions and observations on household demographics knowledge attitudes and practices towards wash and knowledge of community water committees and wsp work as appropriate 2 6 assessment of water quality during each household survey a household collection point water sample e g a local tapstand and household stored water sample if available was collected aseptically in 125 ml whirlpak bags with sodium thiosulfate nasco fort atkinson wi usa samples were placed on ice and transported to a field laboratory for subsequent microbiological and turbidity analysis within 8 h of collection well under the 24 h maximum hold time pope et al 2003 world health organization 1997 if ice was unavailable samples were processed immediately after collection water samples were prepared using standard methods of membrane filtration for simultaneous detection of total coliforms and e coli with m coliblue24 media hach company loveland co usa all samples were diluted with sterile buffered water vacuum filtered aseptically through a 45 μm filter emd millipore billerica ma usa placed in a plastic petri dish with a media soaked pad and incubated for 24 h at 35 c colonies were counted and concentrations calculated by averaging plate counts within a countable range 10 200 colony forming units cfu plate after accounting for dilution factors ten percent of samples were duplicated and a sterile buffered water blank was run every 20 plates turbidity was measured with a calibrated lamotte 2020 turbidimeter chestertown md usa at the household enumerators measured temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec of water samples with an oakton pcstestr 35 wd 35425 10 multi parameter probe oakton vernon hills il usa additionally enumerators conducted a sanitary survey at household water systems in fiji and vanuatu only as they were identified as being a part of wsp implementations in both countries before data collection sanitary survey assessment questions were dependent on water system type and based on who s surveys and risk scoring guide world health organization 1997 every identified risk was given one point and the sum of identified risks was the reported water system risk score maximum possible scores were 5 for a tap stand 10 for rainwater catchment and 11 for an open hand dug well the risk score was sorted into the who categories of low intermediate high and very high risk 2 7 analysis data was manually recorded entered into microsoft excel 2010 redmond washington usa and cleaned and statistically analyzed using r 3 3 2 vienna austria in addition to summary statistics of household survey data household variables related to demographics beliefs about drinking water and household water handling practices were compared between wsp and non wsp communities in each context using a chi square test to determine where communities differed microbiological water quality results were grouped by the who s example risk classification levels of conforms to guidelines 1 e coli cfu 100 ml low risk 1 10 cfu 100 ml medium risk 10 100 cfu 100 ml and high risk 100 cfu 100 ml world health organization 1997 then a fisher s exact statistic test of independence was conducted for each type of water sample to compare wsp to non wsp households at two grouped classification levels samples conforming 1 cfu 100 ml vs non conforming and samples 10 cfu 100 ml vs 10 cfu 100 ml additionally by country a geometric mean was calculated and presented for water quality parameters as data were non normal paired wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed on e coli concentrations of household collection point water to stored water when both samples were collected and independent mann whitney u tests were performed to compare the geometric mean e coli concentrations for wsp and non wsp household collection point and stored water respectively an exploratory analysis was conducted to investigate the possible impacts of significantly different water collection points as confounders on the water quality data by further stratifying the data for data stratification during exploratory analysis the microbiological data was again grouped by the who risk classification matrix and a fisher s exact statistic was calculated as before furthermore odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for the same data at the same two classification levels as before where gathered sanitary survey risk scores were grouped and plotted against the water collection point s corresponding log e coli cfu 100 ml concentration for all statistical tests p values 0 05 were considered significant 3 results data collection was carried out between august december 2016 in total 120 key informant interviews 136 focus groups 816 household surveys and 1 099 water samples were collected across the four country study table 1 where implemented wsps varied within and between countries on characteristics ranging from water source type to management structure table s2 3 1 wsp implementation quality assessment the level of wsp implementation was assessed through a combination of 1 information on wsp programming gathered during assessment trips and 2 from documents gathered during the kiis and fgds in india wsp implementation scored a 6 18 where there were water committees but not dedicated wsp teams some hazard identification limited knowledge or follow through of improvement plans yearly water quality monitoring but no verification documentation or improvement of the wsp in drc wsp implementation scored a 7 18 where there was integration of community water committees descriptions of water supply systems improvement plans implemented where possible but no control measure monitoring verification documentation or review of wsp implementation in fiji and vanuatu wsp implementations were orchestrated under the same general programming plan and scored 13 18 where there were trained wsp teams thorough descriptions of water systems including supply and demand amounts identification of hazards and non wsp measures but little verification of effectiveness or review of the wsp in summary wsp implementations varied from minimal programming in india score 6 18 to thorough front end wsp processes in fiji and vanuatu score 13 18 all implementations lacked back end wsp principles of regular monitoring verification and review table 2 3 2 wsp implementation and management as described in section 2 4 above key themes were identified relating to the management of wsps and their associated challenges qualitative data is presented by these themes 3 2 1 documentation in general wsp communities in all countries and non wsp communities in india and drc had well managed documentation associated with the operation of their water supplies as defined by the rubric documentation of meeting minutes and outcomes was common for water committees in all countries regardless of training on wsps evidence of meetings including minutes was often sent to local authorities in both wsp and non wsp communities in india drc and fiji in compliance with local policy maps of water collection points and water supply distribution systems were uncommon excepting most wsp communities in fiji and a few wsp communities in vanuatu communities instead relied upon informal knowledge of water source and distribution tap locations in drc fiji and vanuatu most wsp trained communities had documented improvement plans while non wsp communities had wish lists in india most communities kept their own plans for the installation of small water systems but the district kept improvement plans for large infrastructure 3 2 2 risk identification and assessment risk identification and assessment was partially managed according to the rubric in wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu and in non wsp communities in india all communities in india and wsp trained communities in fiji and vanuatu utilized a form of sanitary surveys for risk identification non wsp communities in fiji and vanuatu as well as all water management committees in drc indicated pipe breakages as the primary monitored and mitigated hazard there was no procedural risk prioritization indicated by discussions in any country regardless of wsp training a reactive rather than proactive approach to managing risks was described in all countries frequently associated with obstruction of water delivery 3 2 3 water safety water safety was rated as poorly managed by the rubric in all wsp and non wsp communities in drc fiji and vanuatu no regular water quality testing was discussed in these countries regardless of wsp implementation water safety was rated as partially managed in both wsp and non wsp communities in india in india water quality in all communities was tested on a rotating schedule by the district and reported to the community per national guidelines treatment of water sources was discussed as being partially implemented in india i e bleaching powder at open wells and in piped water systems in some communities and in fiji i e community slow sand filters in two non wsp communities hh water treatment was advocated by community health workers during rainy seasons and outbreaks india and drc and during emergencies fiji and vanuatu clear alert systems for water safety emergencies existed in all communities in india because of the reporting structures that existed as a result of the district water quality testing 3 2 4 water security water security was partially managed according to the rubric by wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu and poorly managed by all communities in drc as well as non wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu water availability issues were discussed in all four countries regardless of wsp implementation in india the government had a well water level monitoring project to watch for indications of drought in wsp communities in fiji 6 10 wsp communities reported calculating their water supply and demand as part of wsp trainings no non wsp communities reported knowledge of water supply and demand similarly in vanuatu all wsp communities were trained to calculate water supply and demand but no one in focus group discussions indicated confidence in their ability to do so additionally all communities in vanuatu indicated water shortages particularly during el niño seasons in drc water security concerns in most communities included unknown water usage amounts uneven coverage of piped water systems and point sources and long distances from hhs to their water collection point 3 2 5 capital and technical assistance capital and technical assistance were rated as partially managed according to the rubric in wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu and poorly managed in non wsp communities in those countries and in communities in drc regardless of wsp implementation in india communities discussed fundraising for installation and maintenance of community tube wells while the district funded piped water supplies water fees were collected in vanuatu communities regardless of wsp implementation and by one water committee in drc additionally four wsp trained communities in vanuatu successfully used their action plans to solicit external funding assistance however stakeholders in drc fiji and vanuatu all indicated the need for external financial assistance to conduct water system upgrades tools distributed to communities varied by country and were often cited as a source of confusion in india where tools were minimal and in drc where specific wsp tools were not given to the communities and implementer s tools were text laden however in fiji and vanuatu the tools were pictorial and contained tick boxes and decision trees with suggested solutions these were described as being instructional for water system maintainers to use stakeholders across all countries frequently requested more trainings on operation and maintenance improvement plans and risk assessment regardless of whether they had implemented wsps 3 3 household demographics and water practices in all four countries the majority of survey respondents were the female head of household table 3 respondents in india and fiji had predominantly attained some secondary education in vanuatu 50 of wsp respondents had a primary education while 50 of all respondents in drc had any schooling mean hh size was similar between wsp and non wsp communities in all countries except drc where the wsp communities had a slightly higher household population 6 9 than non wsp 6 0 p 0 016 greater than 90 of respondents in india drc and fiji reported believing that you can get sick from water in vanuatu more wsp respondents 70 than non wsp 47 reported the same p 0 032 table 3 across all four countries the most common reported water related illness was diarrhea fever and vomiting were also noted in all countries while cholera was only reported in india and drc in all four countries the top reported reason for believing water was safe to drink was if the water is clear and for believing water was not safe to drink was if the water is dirty household demographic data across all four countries were generally similar and indicated that communities were well matched from this aspect the primary source of hh drinking water varied by country and within countries table 4 table 5 indian hhs primarily used tube wells 75 wsp 78 non wsp and hhs in vanuatu used rainwater 53 wsp 78 non wsp in drc 48 of wsp hhs reported utilizing a public tap from a piped water supply 53 of non wsp reported using a protected spring in fiji wsp hhs utilized private piped taps 31 protected springs 22 and rainwater 22 while non wsp communities predominantly used private piped taps 79 the distribution of primary sources was different between wsp and non wsp hhs in drc and fiji p 0 002 0 003 and indicates that communities were not well matched by water supply in those two countries in india fiji and vanuatu the median round trip time to collect water was 10 min in drc it was 60 min table 4 table 5 the mean number of times a hh collected water per day ranged from 2 1 in drc to 8 4 in wsp hhs in fiji over 50 of respondents in each country reported drinking water from secondary sources this was highest in the pacific with 80 of wsp and non wsp hhs using secondary sources and in wsp hhs in drc 83 the percentage reporting payment of a monthly water fee was highest in wsp hhs in india drc and vanuatu 57 64 73 respectively while no respondent reported paying in fiji more hhs paid for water in wsp communities in drc and vanuatu p 0 001 each the mean cost was lower in wsp communities in drc p 0 001 please note differences in these factors are expected based due to the varied water supply system types during the survey 95 of hhs in india 95 of wsp and 100 of non wsp hhs in drc p 0 020 78 of wsp and 61 of non wsp hhs in vanuatu p 0 001 and 40 of wsp and 33 of non wsp hhs in fiji p 0 002 reported storage of water table 4 table 5 the primary storage container varied by country with metallic pots most popular in india 53 wsp 54 non wsp jerricans in drc 98 wsp 100 non wsp p 0 003 plastic bottles in fiji 73 wsp 43 non wsp p 0 005 and buckets in vanuatu 60 wsp 48 non

retrieval method from a storage container in both wsp and non wsp communities was by pouring in india drc and vanuatu and by using a tap in fiji although more non wsp households used taps than wsp households 68 wsp 86 non wsp p 0 005 reported water treatment was 5 in india and 0 in drc while it was reported in 4 of wsp and 21 of non wsp hhs in fiji p 0 001 and 15 of wsp and 5 of non wsp hhs in vanuatu the most common treatment method in fiji was boiling in wsp hhs 53 and filtration in non wsp hhs 55 p 0 002 boiling was the top reported method in both wsp and non wsp hhs in vanuatu 88 and 80 respectively p 0 020 3 4 collection point and stored water quality 3 4 1 risk categorization of water quality wsp community water collection points had more e coli contamination than non wsp community

our assessment found limited effectiveness of these implemented wsps and 1 incomplete wsp implementations and low wsp implementation quality 2 small improvements in water supply operations and 3 no documented microbiological water quality improvements from wsps in comparison to non wsp communities while implementers considered these wsps several implementations did not follow guidelines in india despite program labeling there was no concerted wsp implementation for community managed systems only a water quality surveillance program while conceptual integration of aspects of wsps into the village assaini program was evident in drc actual use of wsp elements particularly around risk assessment was found to be deficient in fiji and vanuatu implementation trainings were clearly a wsp process but continued use of wsps by water committees was uncertain other case studies have also found incomplete wsp implementations and made context specific recommendations to address this issue aghaei et al 2017 budiyono et al 2018 certainly there have been widespread pressures to utilize wsps in the sustainable development goal era and as a consequence perhaps both haste to implement where they may not be appropriate and coopting of the term water safety plan to describe programs that are in some way attempting to improve water quality safety but are not focused on risk management in the operations of a water supply furthermore evidence on how to implement wsps in communities that rely on private and or self supply is lacking and it was not clear in the wsp implementations in this study that any community was managing these effectively outcomes related to improvements in the operation and maintenance of the water supply were found throughout this study in india drc and vanuatu a larger portion of wsp households reported paying for water than in non wsp communities in wsp trained communities in fiji and vanuatu water system upgrades were based on technical calculations of their water supply and demand instead of ad hoc improvements infrastructure improvements after implementation of a wsp is consistent with other recent research kumpel et al 2018 as is improvements in the operation of a water supply as a result of a wsp implementation world health organization 2017 string and lantagne 2016 kumpel et al 2018 despite promoting the delivery of safe drinking water this study did not find any clear evidence linking wsp implementation with water quality improvements exploratory analysis indicated that these trends held when stratifying data by water system type in drc and fiji where the type of water systems and therefore the type of collection points varied between wsp and non wsp communities it is difficult to ascertain how much of this effect is due to wsp implementation as development and rehabilitation of water systems was part of the wsp training programs as most communities lacked the means to regularly monitor the quality of their drinking water it is not surprising to find that the microbiological quality was not improved in wsp communities furthermore there was no evidence of source water treatment in wsp communities in drc fiji and vanuatu sanitary surveys showed no correlation with microbiological water quality in fiji and vanuatu which is consistent with other studies indicating mixed results when comparing sanitary surveys to water quality misati et al 2017 mushi et al 2012 parker et al 2010 bacci and chapman 2011 howard et al 2003 water quality cannot be expected to improve in contaminated water sources without some form of treatment the primary limitation of this study is that it did not capture baseline information about water system operation prior to wsp implementation nor did it track changes in water quality longitudinally to determine the specific outcomes of wsp training there was also a risk of bias in the implementers choice of communities that received wsp implementation training and it was not possible for us to control for their reasoning in selecting a particular community although wsp and non wsp communities were intended to be similar during data analysis we found that water collection point types were not matched in drc and fiji nor was the frequency and type of water treatment in fiji which reflects the realities of varied water supply situations additionally only one researcher reviewed each country s materials and assigned a quality score after discussion with a second having two or more people independently review material and average scores would have been preferred despite these limitations we feel the data and lessons learned from the case studies add value to implementers and researchers investigating wsps based on our results we make no recommendations on whether wsps are appropriate in rural community managed systems in developing contexts and would caution that implementers should consider the full ramifications and support to communities that is required should they advocate the use of these tools we would recommend that wsp programs are piloted and appropriately tailored in any new context prior to widespread implementation recent evidence indicates that extensive capacity building and ensuring an enabling environment are critical for the support of wsp implementation ferrero et al 2019 furthermore a significant research gap currently exists in providing clear evidence to either support or refute the use of wsps in these contexts it is likely that determination of the suitability of wsps is highly context dependent and therefore no single process should be promoted globally if wsps are to be implemented in these contexts we make the following recommendations to implementers 1 provide sufficient training and simplify tools through the use of tick boxes and decision diagrams 2 motivate community level wsp uptake via supervision and encouragement from an external body preferably governmental to achieve long term sustainability 3 integrate full wsp programming into existing wash programs where possible to reduce duplication of effort 4 promote water treatment and monitoring of water quality at either the community or household level 5 establish financing and technical assistance to provide communities with more permanent solutions to wash infrastructure deficiencies identified during wsp implementation furthermore it is recommended that baseline water quality water system functionality and community and household data is collected in future evaluations to better understand the outcomes of wsp implementations 5 conclusions our research on the effectiveness of extending wsps from large urban systems to community managed supplies identified four core challenges 1 the weak capacity of these communities and implementers and lack of enabling environments to support the implementation of wsps as an ongoing process 2 communities with multiple private drinking water sources may not have full wsp coverage thereby limiting the potential for wsp benefits and questioning the appropriateness of wsp implementations in these settings 3 if wsps are to be implemented ensure wsp processes are not diluted thorough training of trainers and training of communities on the complete six task wsp implementation is critical and 4 if wsps are to be implemented financial and technical resource support is required for design hardware operation and maintenance to improve drinking water quality the mixed evidence found herein on wsp implementations in these community managed rural water supplies questions their use in these contexts and if used highlights the need for further development of sustainable wsp processes including accounting for mixed multiple water sources training and resourcing tailored to community managed supplies the risks in recommending wsps for community managed supplies in the absence of these processes and the need for further studies to assess the outcomes and impacts of wsp implementations to provide guidance to the sector funding this work was supported by the united nations children s fund unicef in new york city declaration of competing

wsp communities overall 256 kiis and fgds 816 household surveys and 1 099 water quality samples were completed the quality of wsp implementations scored 6 13 out of 18 possible points kiis and fgds found wsp communities had improved capacity to manage water supplies and identify key risks to safe water delivery fewer non wsp community households reported paying for water in drc and vanuatu p 0 001 wsp community water collection points had more e coli contamination than non wsp community collection points in drc p 0 009 fiji p 0 020 and vanuatu p 0 004 household results varied although exploratory analysis revealed that non wsp communities were imperfectly matched to wsp communities overall we found 1 incomplete wsp implementations 2 small improvements in water supply operations and 3 no documented microbiological water quality improvements from wsps these results highlight that wsps implemented in rural community managed supplies are challenging and question their effectiveness

sanitation and hygiene wsp water safety plan 1 introduction water safety plans wsps are a comprehensive source to point of consumption risk assessment and management tool designed to ensure the safety of drinking water world health organization 2011 wsps have been promoted since the 2004 launch of the world health organization s who guidelines for drinking water quality and the international water association s bonn charter for safe drinking water breach 2012 a wsp consists of five specific steps preparation system assessment monitoring management and communication and feedback and improvement with associated sub module s 11 in total that provide guidance and structure to the process bartram et al 2009 to date wsps have been implemented in 90 countries and integrated into policy or regulation in 60 countries world health organization 2017 additionally the proposed metric for drinking water in the sustainable development goals is percentage of population using safely managed drinking water services statistical commission 47th session of un ecosoc 2016 which aligns with the intended outcome of a wsp implementation despite the widespread implementation and policy presence of wsps there 1 is a lack of standardized methods for evaluating wsps despite recent auditing guidelines and 2 have been few evaluations completed world health organization 2011 world health organization international water association 2015 the centers for disease control and prevention developed a logic model framework for assessing wsp implementations in four outcomes areas institutional operational financial and policy change and regulation from which key performance indicators were developed gelting et al 2012 lockhart et al 2014 mudaliar 2012 a review of available evidence across these outcome areas found 1 financial outcomes have the clearest evidence base in case studies 2 operational outcomes particularly in relation to infrastructure improvements were documented most frequently and 3 despite the prevalence of wsp policies regulations and ad hoc knowledge of institutional change these outcomes institutional policy change and regulation had the least evidence that they were a result of wsp implementation string and lantagne 2016 furthermore recent evidence has found that after wsp implementation in medium large systems in iceland france spain and china there were documented improvements in operational parameters and water quality gunnarsdottir et al 2012 setty et al 2017 ye et al 2014 additionally in these larger utility managed systems external institutional support for wsps was found to be critical to meet outcome goals world health organization 2017 rinehold et al 2011 rural community managed water supply systems are different than large urban systems as they are more at risk of breakdown have limited financial resources and are often maintained by undertrained operators world health organization 2012 as such guidance manuals have been developed to simplify and tailor wsps for community managed water suppliers by reducing the 11 sub modules to 6 suggested tasks world health organization 2012 greaves and simmons 2011 unicef and global water partnership 2014 rickert et al 2014 mudaliar et al undated espinoza et al 2009 the evidence on wsps in these settings is limited with lessons from four case studies suggesting 1 to rely on minimal water quality testing in favor of sanitary inspections for hazard identification and implementation of non wsp measures hasan et al 2011 barrington et al 2013 mahmud et al 2007 2 the need for interactive workshops and tools hasan et al 2011 barrington et al 2013 mahmud et al 2007 timilsina 2012 and 3 to couple wsp implementations with existing water sanitation and hygiene wash education activities hasan et al 2011 barrington et al 2013 mahmud et al 2007 timilsina 2012 however as case studies are tailored to local contexts it is difficult to ascertain whether these lessons are transferable furthermore a recent cross context study evaluated wsps in 12 countries and identified a lack of financial and water supply data in rural wsp implementations as compared to urban sites kumpel et al 2018 to fill this evidence gap on the effectiveness and outcomes of wsp implementations in specifically rural community managed contexts we conducted a mixed methods exploratory assessment in four countries to accomplish this aim and having limited information prior to assessment we broadly collected as much data as possible in each country from wsp and non wsp communities as appropriate related to the quality of wsp implementations wsp process and management household characteristics and collection point and household water quality after data collection we triangulated data and compared outcomes between wsp implementations across countries and between wsp and non wsp implementations within each country to determine if wsps can be effective in these contexts and if so develop recommendations on the implementation of wsps in rural community managed contexts 2 materials and methods the wsps assessed in this study were implemented by unicef and their partners according to local priorities before our engagement some of the benefits of the study design include the ability to evaluate real world programs and to have partners implement programs without research influence the drawbacks of the study design are a lack of community baseline data a lack of longitudinal data on wsp outcomes at selected sites and the inability to control for potential implementer bias in their selection of communities that received wsps thus this study was completed using an exploratory case control mixed methods protocol including site selection review of wsp documents to assess implementation quality assessment of wsp management via key informant interviews and focus group discussions characterization of households via surveys assessment of water quality via testing and sanitary inspections and data analysis protocols were approved by the tufts university institutional review board protocols 1607025 1608019 1610007 and 1610006 and the local ethics review process in each country 1 in india the institutional ethics committee at the national environmental engineering research institute in nagpur 2 in drc comité institutionnel d ethique

selection the unicef water team at headquarters selected eight priority countries where unicef country offices were supporting wsp implementation after discussion with country offices and their partners it was determined that wsps were advanced sufficiently for assessment in four countries india the democratic republic of the congo drc fiji and vanuatu assessment visits to each country were carried out 7 12 months prior to the operational research to ascertain the local wsp implementation program details and develop an appropriate evaluation plan for each country 2 2 site selection for the context of this study rural communities were defined as communities that do not have the potential for large scale utility managed water supply systems and instead depend on small community systems or point sources given time and resources available in the field the target was set to randomly survey 100 households in rural wsp communities and 100 households in rural non wsp communities per country non wsp communities were matched to wsp communities on the criteria of similar population size similar geographic location and as per unicef request were communities already involved in general wash or child protection programming with implementing partners implementing partners and unicef country offices in three countries india fiji and vanuatu provided lists of wsp communities from which 10 were randomly selected for study inclusion ten non wsp communities with the criteria listed above were then selected as matched non wsp communities ten households per community were randomly selected for participation by starting in the community center and skipping a pre determined number of houses in the fourth country drc implementing partners and unicef provided lists of wsp communities from which 20 were randomly chosen for inclusion twenty non wsp communities with similar geographic locations and populations were used as matched non wsp communities households were selected in the same random manner but the number of households visited per community was determined by sampling 3 5 of households 3 7 in each community per department of health request each country had a slightly different definition of wsp communities in india wsp communities were defined as those that operated water supplies under the supervision of a community water technician and non wsp communities were those that did not in drc the study was conducted in one health zone where wsp communities were defined as those that had received certification in the comprehensive 8 step wash training program village assaini from the ministry of health and non wsps were communities in active training steps of the program that had not yet achieved implementation or certification on three islands in fiji and two islands in vanuatu wsp communities were those that received training from implementing partners under the drinking water safety and security plan program and non wsps were communities that had not yet entered the process 2 3 review of wsp documents to assess the quality of wsp implementations documents related to training management and wsp water committee process were evaluated in each country based on the wsp for small community water supplies list of tasks 1 engage community and assemble wsp team 2 describe the community water supply 3 identify hazards hazardous events and existing control measures 4 develop and implement an incremental improvement plan 5 monitor control measures and verify effectiveness of wsp and 6 document review and improve all aspects of wsp implementation world health organization 2012 for each of the six tasks one researcher reviewed each country s material and assigned a numerical score 0 for no inclusion during implementation 1 for partial implementation of the task 2 for basic inclusion of all elements of the task and 3 for detailed and thorough inclusion of all elements of a task a country sum was calculated out of 18 maximum points the material review and score assignment was discussed with another author prior to finalizing 2 4 qualitative data collection to assess the use of the wsp process and identify themes related to management key informant interviews kii and focus group discussions fgd containing primarily qualitative questions were carried out in the local language by trained enumerators kiis were conducted with community leaders 12 22 questions and water system maintainers 5 questions fgds were held with water management committees 26 34 questions community healthcare workers 5 27 questions and community wash committees 17 questions as appropriate to the local context in each country please note kii and fgd length varied in each context depending on the defined role of individuals for instance in fiji there was no single water system maintainer as those functions fell under the responsibility of the village water committee while in india there was a person separate from the village water and sanitation committee with remunerated responsibility for maintaining water systems a thematic analysis was conducted whereby kiis and fgds were coded using a top down theoretical approach braun and clarke 2006 possible themes were first identified using a semantic approach and codes were then refined as the themes were clarified and defined qualitative data were summarized according to five themes pertinent to communities management of their water supplies documentation risk identification and assessment water safety water security and capital and technical assistance a rubric was then developed to review the coded data associated with each theme to contextualize the extent to which communities were able to manage each aspect of their water supplies table s1 2 5 household characteristics household surveys were carried out in the local language on paper surveys by trained enumerators surveys were developed generally for the project adapted for local context in each country and pre tested during enumerator training in each country surveys comprised 57 60 questions and observations on household demographics knowledge attitudes and practices towards wash and knowledge of community water committees and wsp work as appropriate 2 6 assessment of water quality during each household survey a household collection point water sample e g a local tapstand and household stored water sample if available was collected aseptically in 125 ml whirlpak bags with sodium thiosulfate nasco fort atkinson wi usa samples were placed on ice and transported to a field laboratory for subsequent microbiological and turbidity analysis within 8 h of collection well under the 24 h maximum hold time pope et al 2003 world health organization 1997 if ice was unavailable samples were processed immediately after collection water samples were prepared using standard methods of membrane filtration for simultaneous detection of total coliforms and e coli with m coliblue24 media hach company loveland co usa all samples were diluted with sterile buffered water vacuum filtered aseptically through a 45 μm filter emd millipore billerica ma usa placed in a plastic petri dish with a media soaked pad and incubated for 24 h at 35 c colonies were counted and concentrations calculated by averaging plate counts within a countable range 10 200 colony forming units cfu plate after accounting for dilution factors ten percent of samples were duplicated and a sterile buffered water blank was run every 20 plates turbidity was measured with a calibrated lamotte 2020 turbidimeter chestertown md usa at the household enumerators measured temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec of water samples with an oakton pcstestr 35 wd 35425 10 multi parameter probe oakton vernon hills il usa additionally enumerators conducted a sanitary survey at household water systems in fiji and vanuatu only as they were identified as being a part of wsp implementations in both countries before data collection sanitary survey assessment questions were dependent on water system type and based on who s surveys and risk scoring guide world health organization 1997 every identified risk was given one point and the sum of identified risks was the reported water system risk score maximum possible scores were 5 for a tap stand 10 for rainwater catchment and 11 for an open hand dug well the risk score was sorted into the who categories of low intermediate high and very high risk 2 7 analysis data was manually recorded entered into microsoft excel 2010 redmond washington usa and cleaned and statistically analyzed using r 3 3 2 vienna austria in addition to summary statistics of household survey data household variables related to demographics beliefs about drinking water and household water handling practices were compared between wsp and non wsp communities in each context using a chi square test to determine where communities differed microbiological water quality results were grouped by the who s example risk classification levels of conforms to guidelines 1 e coli cfu 100 ml low risk 1 10 cfu 100 ml medium risk 10 100 cfu 100 ml and high risk 100 cfu 100 ml world health organization 1997 then a fisher s exact statistic test of independence was conducted for each type of water sample to compare wsp to non wsp households at two grouped classification levels samples conforming 1 cfu 100 ml vs non conforming and samples 10 cfu 100 ml vs 10 cfu 100 ml additionally by country a geometric mean was calculated and presented for water quality parameters as data were non normal paired wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed on e coli concentrations of household collection point water to stored water when both samples were collected and independent mann whitney u tests were performed to compare the geometric mean e coli concentrations for wsp and non wsp household collection point and stored water respectively an exploratory analysis was conducted to investigate the possible impacts of significantly different water collection points as confounders on the water quality data by further stratifying the data for data stratification during exploratory analysis the microbiological data was again grouped by the who risk classification matrix and a fisher s exact statistic was calculated as before furthermore odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for the same data at the same two classification levels as before where gathered sanitary survey risk scores were grouped and plotted against the water collection point s corresponding log e coli cfu 100 ml concentration for all statistical tests p values 0 05 were considered significant 3 results data collection was carried out between august december 2016 in total 120 key informant interviews 136 focus groups 816 household surveys and 1 099 water samples were collected across the four country study table 1 where implemented wsps varied within and between countries on characteristics ranging from water source type to management structure table s2 3 1 wsp implementation quality assessment the level of wsp implementation was assessed through a combination of 1 information on wsp programming gathered during assessment trips and 2 from documents gathered during the kiis and fgds in india wsp implementation scored a 6 18 where there were water committees but not dedicated wsp teams some hazard identification limited knowledge or follow through of improvement plans yearly water quality monitoring but no verification documentation or improvement of the wsp in drc wsp implementation scored a 7 18 where there was integration of community water committees descriptions of water supply systems improvement plans implemented where possible but no control measure monitoring verification documentation or review of wsp implementation in fiji and vanuatu wsp implementations were orchestrated under the same general programming plan and scored 13 18 where there were trained wsp teams thorough descriptions of water systems including supply and demand amounts identification of hazards and non wsp measures but little verification of effectiveness or review of the wsp in summary wsp implementations varied from minimal programming in india score 6 18 to thorough front end wsp processes in fiji and vanuatu score 13 18 all implementations lacked back end wsp principles of regular monitoring verification and review table 2 3 2 wsp implementation and management as described in section 2 4 above key themes were identified relating to the management of wsps and their associated challenges qualitative data is presented by these themes 3 2 1 documentation in general wsp communities in all countries and non wsp communities in india and drc had well managed documentation associated with the operation of their water supplies as defined by the rubric documentation of meeting minutes and outcomes was common for water committees in all countries regardless of training on wsps evidence of meetings including minutes was often sent to local authorities in both wsp and non wsp communities in india drc and fiji in compliance with local policy maps of water collection points and water supply distribution systems were uncommon excepting most wsp communities in fiji and a few wsp communities in vanuatu communities instead relied upon informal knowledge of water source and distribution tap locations in drc fiji and vanuatu most wsp trained communities had documented improvement plans while non wsp communities had wish lists in india most communities kept their own plans for the installation of small water systems but the district kept improvement plans for large infrastructure 3 2 2 risk identification and assessment risk identification and assessment was partially managed according to the rubric in wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu and in non wsp communities in india all communities in india and wsp trained communities in fiji and vanuatu utilized a form of sanitary surveys for risk identification non wsp communities in fiji and vanuatu as well as all water management committees in drc indicated pipe breakages as the primary monitored and mitigated hazard there was no procedural risk prioritization indicated by discussions in any country regardless of wsp training a reactive rather than proactive approach to managing risks was described in all countries frequently associated with obstruction of water delivery 3 2 3 water safety water safety was rated as poorly managed by the rubric in all wsp and non wsp communities in drc fiji and vanuatu no regular water quality testing was discussed in these countries regardless of wsp implementation water safety was rated as partially managed in both wsp and non wsp communities in india in india water quality in all communities was tested on a rotating schedule by the district and reported to the community per national guidelines treatment of water sources was discussed as being partially implemented in india i e bleaching powder at open wells and in piped water systems in some communities and in fiji i e community slow sand filters in two non wsp communities hh water treatment was advocated by community health workers during rainy seasons and outbreaks india and drc and during emergencies fiji and vanuatu clear alert systems for water safety emergencies existed in all communities in india because of the reporting structures that existed as a result of the district water quality testing 3 2 4 water security water security was partially managed according to the rubric by wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu and poorly managed by all communities in drc as well as non wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu water availability issues were discussed in all four countries regardless of wsp implementation in india the government had a well water level monitoring project to watch for indications of drought in wsp communities in fiji 6 10 wsp communities reported calculating their water supply and demand as part of wsp trainings no non wsp communities reported knowledge of water supply and demand similarly in vanuatu all wsp communities were trained to calculate water supply and demand but no one in focus group discussions indicated confidence in their ability to do so additionally all communities in vanuatu indicated water shortages particularly during el niño seasons in drc water security concerns in most communities included unknown water usage amounts uneven coverage of piped water systems and point sources and long distances from hhs to their water collection point 3 2 5 capital and technical assistance capital and technical assistance were rated as partially managed according to the rubric in wsp communities in india fiji and vanuatu and poorly managed in non wsp communities in those countries and in communities in drc regardless of wsp implementation in india communities discussed fundraising for installation and maintenance of community tube wells while the district funded piped water supplies water fees were collected in vanuatu communities regardless of wsp implementation and by one water committee in drc additionally four wsp trained communities in vanuatu successfully used their action plans to solicit external funding assistance however stakeholders in drc fiji and vanuatu all indicated the need for external financial assistance to conduct water system upgrades tools distributed to communities varied by country and were often cited as a source of confusion in india where tools were minimal and in drc where specific wsp tools were not given to the communities and implementer s tools were text laden however in fiji and vanuatu the tools were pictorial and contained tick boxes and decision trees with suggested solutions these were described as being instructional for water system maintainers to use stakeholders across all countries frequently requested more trainings on operation and maintenance improvement plans and risk assessment regardless of whether they had implemented wsps 3 3 household demographics and water practices in all four countries the majority of survey respondents were the female head of household table 3 respondents in india and fiji had predominantly attained some secondary education in vanuatu 50 of wsp respondents had a primary education while 50 of all respondents in drc had any schooling mean hh size was similar between wsp and non wsp communities in all countries except drc where the wsp communities had a slightly higher household population 6 9 than non wsp 6 0 p 0 016 greater than 90 of respondents in india drc and fiji reported believing that you can get sick from water in vanuatu more wsp respondents 70 than non wsp 47 reported the same p 0 032 table 3 across all four countries the most common reported water related illness was diarrhea fever and vomiting were also noted in all countries while cholera was only reported in india and drc in all four countries the top reported reason for believing water was safe to drink was if the water is clear and for believing water was not safe to drink was if the water is dirty household demographic data across all four countries were generally similar and indicated that communities were well matched from this aspect the primary source of hh drinking water varied by country and within countries table 4 table 5 indian hhs primarily used tube wells 75 wsp 78 non wsp and hhs in vanuatu used rainwater 53 wsp 78 non wsp in drc 48 of wsp hhs reported utilizing a public tap from a piped water supply 53 of non wsp reported using a protected spring in fiji wsp hhs utilized private piped taps 31 protected springs 22 and rainwater 22 while non wsp communities predominantly used private piped taps 79 the distribution of primary sources was different between wsp and non wsp hhs in drc and fiji p 0 002 0 003 and indicates that communities were not well matched by water supply in those two countries in india fiji and vanuatu the median round trip time to collect water was 10 min in drc it was 60 min table 4 table 5 the mean number of times a hh collected water per day ranged from 2 1 in drc to 8 4 in wsp hhs in fiji over 50 of respondents in each country reported drinking water from secondary sources this was highest in the pacific with 80 of wsp and non wsp hhs using secondary sources and in wsp hhs in drc 83 the percentage reporting payment of a monthly water fee was highest in wsp hhs in india drc and vanuatu 57 64 73 respectively while no respondent reported paying in fiji more hhs paid for water in wsp communities in drc and vanuatu p 0 001 each the mean cost was lower in wsp communities in drc p 0 001 please note differences in these factors are expected based due to the varied water supply system types during the survey 95 of hhs in india 95 of wsp and 100 of non wsp hhs in drc p 0 020 78 of wsp and 61 of non wsp hhs in vanuatu p 0 001 and 40 of wsp and 33 of non wsp hhs in fiji p 0 002 reported storage of water table 4 table 5 the primary storage container varied by country with metallic pots most popular in india 53 wsp 54 non wsp jerricans in drc 98 wsp 100 non wsp p 0 003 plastic bottles in fiji 73 wsp 43 non wsp p 0 005 and buckets in vanuatu 60 wsp 48 non wsp over 99 of hhs reporting storage in india and 95 in fiji had covered storage containers more non wsp hh containers were covered in drc 53 wsp 74 non wsp containers p 0 002 the most common water retrieval method from a storage container in both wsp and non wsp communities was by pouring in india drc and vanuatu and by using a tap in fiji although more non wsp households used taps than wsp households 68 wsp 86 non wsp p 0 005 reported water treatment was 5 in india and 0 in drc while it was reported in 4 of wsp and 21 of non wsp hhs in fiji p 0 001 and 15 of wsp and 5 of non wsp hhs in vanuatu the most common treatment method in fiji was boiling in wsp hhs 53 and filtration in non wsp hhs 55 p 0 002 boiling was the top reported method in both wsp and non wsp hhs in vanuatu 88 and 80 respectively p 0 020 3 4 collection point and stored water quality 3 4 1 risk categorization of water quality wsp community water collection points had more e coli contamination than non wsp community

our assessment found limited effectiveness of these implemented wsps and 1 incomplete wsp implementations and low wsp implementation quality 2 small improvements in water supply operations and 3 no documented microbiological water quality improvements from wsps in comparison to non wsp communities while implementers considered these wsps several implementations did not follow guidelines in india despite program labeling there was no concerted wsp implementation for community managed systems only a water quality surveillance program while conceptual integration of aspects of wsps into the village assaini program was evident in drc actual use of wsp elements particularly around risk assessment was found to be deficient in fiji and vanuatu implementation trainings were clearly a wsp process but continued use of wsps by water committees was uncertain other case studies have also found incomplete wsp implementations and made context specific recommendations to address this issue aghaei et al 2017 budiyono et al 2018 certainly there have been widespread pressures to utilize wsps in the sustainable development goal era and as a consequence perhaps both haste to implement where they may not be appropriate and coopting of the term water safety plan to describe programs that are in some way attempting to improve water quality safety but are not focused on risk management in the operations of a water supply furthermore evidence on how to implement wsps in communities that rely on private and or self supply is lacking and it was not clear in the wsp implementations in this study that any community was managing these effectively outcomes related to improvements in the operation and maintenance of the water supply were found throughout this study in india drc and vanuatu a larger portion of wsp households reported paying for water than in non wsp communities in wsp trained communities in fiji and vanuatu water system upgrades were based on technical calculations of their water supply and demand instead of ad hoc improvements infrastructure improvements after implementation of a wsp is consistent with other recent research kumpel et al 2018 as is improvements in the operation of a water supply as a result of a wsp implementation world health organization 2017 string and lantagne 2016 kumpel et al 2018 despite promoting the delivery of safe drinking water this study did not find any clear evidence linking wsp implementation with water quality improvements exploratory analysis indicated that these trends held when stratifying data by water system type in drc and fiji where the type of water systems and therefore the type of collection points varied between wsp and non wsp communities it is difficult to ascertain how much of this effect is due to wsp implementation as development and rehabilitation of water systems was part of the wsp training programs as most communities lacked the means to regularly monitor the quality of their drinking water it is not surprising to find that the microbiological quality was not improved in wsp communities furthermore there was no evidence of source water treatment in wsp communities in drc fiji and vanuatu sanitary surveys showed no correlation with microbiological water quality in fiji and vanuatu which is consistent with other studies indicating mixed results when comparing sanitary surveys to water quality misati et al 2017 mushi et al 2012 parker et al 2010 bacci and chapman 2011 howard et al 2003 water quality cannot be expected to improve in contaminated water sources without some form of treatment the primary limitation of this study is that it did not capture baseline information about water system operation prior to wsp implementation nor did it track changes in water quality longitudinally to determine the specific outcomes of wsp training there was also a risk of bias in the implementers choice of communities that received wsp implementation training and it was not possible for us to control for their reasoning in selecting a particular community although wsp and non wsp communities were intended to be similar during data analysis we found that water collection point types were not matched in drc and fiji nor was the frequency and type of water treatment in fiji which reflects the realities of varied water supply situations additionally only one researcher reviewed each country s materials and assigned a quality score after discussion with a second having two or more people independently review material and average scores would have been preferred despite these limitations we feel the data and lessons learned from the case studies add value to implementers and researchers investigating wsps based on our results we make no recommendations on whether wsps are appropriate in rural community managed systems in developing contexts and would caution that implementers should consider the full ramifications and support to communities that is required should they advocate the use of these tools we would recommend that wsp programs are piloted and appropriately tailored in any new context prior to widespread implementation recent evidence indicates that extensive capacity building and ensuring an enabling environment are critical for the support of wsp implementation ferrero et al 2019 furthermore a significant research gap currently exists in providing clear evidence to either support or refute the use of wsps in these contexts it is likely that determination of the suitability of wsps is highly context dependent and therefore no single process should be promoted globally if wsps are to be implemented in these contexts we make the following recommendations to implementers 1 provide sufficient training and simplify tools through the use of tick boxes and decision diagrams 2 motivate community level wsp uptake via supervision and encouragement from an external body preferably governmental to achieve long term sustainability 3 integrate full wsp programming into existing wash programs where possible to reduce duplication of effort 4 promote water treatment and monitoring of water quality at either the community or household level 5 establish financing and technical assistance to provide communities with more permanent solutions to wash infrastructure deficiencies identified during wsp implementation furthermore it is recommended that baseline water quality water system functionality and community and household data is collected in future evaluations to better understand the outcomes of wsp implementations 5 conclusions our research on the effectiveness of extending wsps from large urban systems to community managed supplies identified four core challenges 1 the weak capacity of these communities and implementers and lack of enabling environments to support the implementation of wsps as an ongoing process 2 communities with multiple private drinking water sources may not have full wsp coverage thereby limiting the potential for wsp benefits and questioning the appropriateness of wsp implementations in these settings 3 if wsps are to be implemented ensure wsp processes are not diluted thorough training of trainers and training of communities on the complete six task wsp implementation is critical and 4 if wsps are to be implemented financial and technical resource support is required for design hardware operation and maintenance to improve drinking water quality the mixed evidence found herein on wsp implementations in these community managed rural water supplies questions their use in these contexts and if used highlights the need for further development of sustainable wsp processes including accounting for mixed multiple water sources training and resourcing tailored to community managed supplies the risks in recommending wsps for community managed supplies in the absence of these processes and the need for further studies to assess the outcomes and impacts of wsp implementations to provide guidance to the sector funding this work was supported by the united nations children s fund unicef in new york city declaration of competing
