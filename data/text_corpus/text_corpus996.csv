4980,the complementary principle provides a simple method for estimating land surface evaporation using standard meteorological observations and has received increasing attention in recent years in this study we propose an exponential generalized complementary function that satisfies the physical boundary conditions and constraints proposed by brutsaert 2015 with one adjustable parameter the new exponential function is validated using observations from 21 fluxnet stations and the results show that the exponential function can efficiently simulate actual daily evaporation a comparison between the exponential function and the polynomial function proposed in previous studies suggests that the exponential function can improve the accuracy reasonableness and flexibility of land surface evaporation estimation overall the exponential function provides a new method for estimating land surface evaporation and may enhance our understanding of the complementary principle keywords evaporation complementary principle fluxnet physical constraint exponential function 1 introduction evaporation for simplicity it denotes the combined rate of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation in this study and it has the same meaning as the term evapotranspiration is a key component of the global water and energy balance and has an important effect on the interactions between the atmospheric system and the land surface despite its importance land surface evaporation is usually difficult to estimate through conventional observations proposed by bouchet 1963 the complementary principle provides an accurate method for evaporation estimation using standard meteorological observations that does not rely on measurements of land surface temperature soil moisture or vegetation resistance therefore in recent years an increasing number of studies have investigated the complementary principle brutsaert 2015 ma et al 2015 2019 szilagyi et al 2016 gao et al 2018 han and tian 2018 as introduced by brutsaert 2015 the complementary principle describes the relationships among actual evaporation e potential evaporation epo and apparent potential evaporation epa as follows 1 e f e po e pa the physical interpretation of the complementary principle is that as the land surface dries part of the energy not used for evaporation becomes available in the form of increased sensible heat flux which increases epa brutsaert and parlange 1998 brutsaert 2005 this process leads to a complementary relationship between e and epa the interpretation and calculation of epo and epa are widely debated and various definitions of these two variables can be found brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 granger 1989 mcmahon et al 2013 aminzadeh et al 2016 however most studies suggest that epa can be calculated using penman s 1948 equation as follows brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert 2015 2 e pa e pen e rad e aero where epen is the penman potential evaporation erad is referred to as the radiation term and eaero is referred to as the aerodynamic term based on penman s equation erad and eaero are calculated as follows 3 e rad δ r n g δ γ 4 e aero γ e a δ γ where δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure kpa c which is calculated by the air temperature ta rn is the net radiation w m2 g is the ground heat flux w m2 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c and ea is the drying power w m2 which is calculated by the wind speed and vapor pressure deficit epo is also called wet environment evaporation which is the evaporation from a complete saturated surface where input energy is the only limiting factor most studies suggested that epo can be calculated by priestley taylor s 1972 equation as follows 5 e po e pt α δ r n g δ γ where ept is the evaporation calculated using priestley taylor s equation pt equation and α is a coefficient suggested as 1 26 for large saturated land surfaces various models for estimating evaporation based on the complementary principle have been proposed bouchet 1963 developed a symmetric linear function of equation 1 that was improved to an advection aridity hereinafter referred to as aa function brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert and parlange 1998 as follows 6 e pa e po b e po e where b is a parameter describing the asymmetric feature of the complementary principle kahler and brutsaert 2006 szilagyi 2007 han et al 2008 2011 2012 proposed the conception of the dimensionless form of the complementary principle and normalized equation 6 by epa and obtained another form of the aa function han et al 2008 as follows 7 y 1 1 b x 1 b where x epo epa and y e epa brutsaert 2015 defined the same dimensionless variables x epo epa and y e epa and proposed a general form of the complementary principle gcr as follows 8 y f x he proposed that 0 e epo epa therefore the physical constraints of the complementary principle should be 0 y x then he proposed the zero and first order boundary conditions of equation 8 as follows 9 y 0 x 0 y 1 x 1 dy dx 0 x 0 dy dx 1 x 1 assuming equation 8 is a polynomial function brutsaert 2015 adopted x 0 1 and obtained a fourth order polynomial function with considerations of the physical boundary conditions as follows 10 y 2 c x 2 1 2 c x 3 c x 4 where c is a parameter brutsaert 2015 suggested that c 0 is preferable in most cases for convenience in application the conception of gcr proposed by brutsaert 2015 is widely accepted equation 10 hereinafter referred to as b15 has been applied and validated in regions with various climates liu et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2016 ai et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 furthermore brutsaert et al 2020 defined xb αce e and proposed a calibration free equation as follows 11 y 2 x b 2 x b 3 where e e is the equilibrium evaporation defined by slatyer and mcilroy 1961 αc is a coefficient and it can be determined by a global calibrated equation in equation 11 hereinafter referred to as b20 e e is calculated as follows 12 e e δ r n g δ γ following the conception of gcr crago et al 2016 and szilagyi et al 2017 proposed the method for rescaling of x and developed another calibration free equation for the complementary principle these works were improved in szilagyi et al 2020 and y e epa was suggested to be determined as follows 13 y 2 x s 2 x s 3 in equation 13 hereinafter referred to as s20 x s is a variable representing the rescaling of x and is defined as x s ep max epa ep max epo 1 x ep max is the maximum value that epa can achieve han and tian 2018 defined x erad epen and y e epen and proposed different boundary conditions as follows 14 y 0 x x min y 1 x x max d y d x 0 y 0 d y d x 0 y 1 then they developed a sigmoid function as follows 15 y 1 1 m x max x x x min n where m and n are parameters and x max and x min are the upper and lower bounds of x respectively the inputs of equation 15 hereinafter referred to as h18 are epen and erad which differs from the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 that suggested that e is a function of epo and epa however epo and epa should be specified for actual evaporation estimations as suggested by brutsaert 2015 epo and epa can be determined as ept and epen respectively then the sigmoid function is mathematically related to the framework of brutsaert 2015 and we can obtain x α x epo epa ept epen αerad epen and y y e epa e epen table 1 summarizes the major analytical complementary functions proposed in previous studies the sigmoid function is presented as an equivalent form using x e po e pa α e rad e pen α x shortcomings of the existing functions have been proposed in previous studies the aa function cannot capture the nonlinear relationship between x and y and has been found to underestimate the actual evaporation in arid regions and overestimate the actual evaporation in wet regions qualls and gultekin 1997 hobbins et al 2001 it should also be mentioned that aa does not satisfy all the boundary conditions shown in equation 9 proposed by brutsaert 2015 with comprehensive physical boundary conditions the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 provides a rigorous basis for gcr the polynomial function b15 well follows the constraints and physical boundary conditions and has been applied in various regions however there were also some arguments illustrating that the accuracy of b15 needs to be increased for example han and tian 2018 found that b15 does not show the best performance of actual evaporation estimation in many sites with c ranging within the feasible domain 1 2 liu et al 2020 developing new analytical solutions of gcr proposed by brutsaert 2015 is one possible way to increase the accuracy of actual evaporation estimation based on the complementary principle the sigmoid function h18 has provided a new understanding of the complementary principle and has been validated at different time scales zhou et al 2020 but it differs from the framework of brutsaert 2015 szilagyi and crago 2019 argued that h18 may exceed the upper limit of the complementary principle the om line in fig 1 in some cases with x max α 1 and that the exact function of the complementary principle remains unknown therefore more reasonable and accurate functions considering the physical constraints of the complementary principle are still needed the objectives of this study are 1 to derive an exponential function of the complementary principle satisfying physical boundary conditions and constraints and 2 to evaluate the new function using observations at 21 fluxnet stations and compare it with the functions proposed in previous studies 2 derivation of the exponential complementary function as mentioned in section 1 there are debates about the first order boundary condition of the complementary principle in wet environments han and tian 2018 used dy dx 0 d y d x 0 where y 1 and brutsaert 2015 proposed dy dx 1 where y 1 han and tian 2019 argued that these conflicts may be attributed to the differences in the definitions and frameworks between their work and brutsaert s work in this study our derivation is within the framework introduced by brutsaert 2015 and the first order boundary condition of his work is more widely accepted therefore the derivation in this study follows the first order boundary condition proposed by brutsaert 2015 which is shown in equation 9 crago et al 2016 suggested that the upper bound of x x max should be equal to 1 and that the boundary conditions of the complementary principle could be modified as follows 16 y 0 x x min o r lim x x min y 0 y 1 x 1 dy dx 0 x x min o r lim x x min dy dx 0 dy dx 1 x 1 where x min is the lower bound of x and 0 x min 1 han and tian 2018 assumed dy dx ky 1 y x x min x max x where k is a parameter considering the boundary condition dy dx 1 x 1 we can modify the assumptions of han and tian 2018 and adopt the following 17 dy dx y x x min 1 x min d 1 d 0 where d is a parameter performing the integration of equation 17 we can obtain 18 y e 1 x min d x x min 1 x min d c 1 d 0 where c 1 is a constant by applying the boundary condition y 1 x 1 the constant c 1 can be determined as follows 19 c 1 1 x min d then we obtain a new function as follows 20 y e 1 x min d 1 1 x x min 1 x min d d 0 where d is a parameter with a feasible domain 0 when x x min x x min 1 x min d 0 then we can obtain 1 1 x x min 1 x min d and y e 1 x min d 1 1 x x min 1 x min d 0 which proves lim x x min y 0 therefore we prove that equation 20 satisfies the zero order boundary condition shown in equation 16 we can also prove that lim x x min dy dx 0 see the supplemental material it is clear that equation 20 satisfies the boundary condition dy dx 1 x 1 therefore equation 20 hereinafter referred to as g19 is an exponential function that satisfies the zero and first order boundary conditions of the complementary principle shown in equation 16 because it is an exponential function g19 always follows the constraint y 0 g19 exhibits the typical complementary behavior between the scaled actual evaporation e epo and apparent potential evaporation epa epo and it shows an asymmetric feature see fig s1 in the supplemental material fig 2 shows the curves of g19 with different values of the parameter d the figure shows that the curvature of the g19 curve increases as d increases the curve of g19 closely resembles a linear line as d decreases and it approaches the upper limit om line in fig 2 as d approaches zero fig 3 illustrates that the differences between y calculated by g19 and x are always negative even with a very small value of parameter d this result indicates that the curve of g19 is always below the line y x implying that g19 never exceeds the upper limit these results show that g19 follows the physical constraints of the complementary principle well our analysis shows that the accuracy of g19 is not sensitive to x min details are shown in section 5 1 therefore x min can be ignored in most cases and a simplified form of g19 is recommended for application as follows 21 y e 1 d 1 1 x d d 0 3 data used and calculation of epo epa as mentioned in section 1 various definitions of epo and epa can be found in the literature and none of them is universally accepted in this study following brutsaert 2015 epa is defined as the evaporation from a small saturated surface inside the larger surface and the presence of this small saturated surface does not affect the surrounding environment therefore epa is calculated using penman s equation equation 2 in this study as suggested by brutsaert 2015 epo is defined as evaporation that takes place from the same surface as the actual evaporation when the evaporating water is not a limiting factor and with the same solar radiative input therefore brutsaert 2015 suggested that epo could be formulated by priestley and taylor s equation equation 5 however szilagyi et al 2016 pointed out that under wet environmental conditions epo should be estimated using the wet environment air temperature t w therefore a modified priestley and taylor equation is used to estimate epo szilagyi and jozsa 2008 in this study as follows 22 e po e pt α δ t w δ t w γ r n g tw is used to calculate the slope of the saturated vapor pressure and it is estimated using the air temperature ta as follows 23 r n e pa e pa γ t ws t a e t w s e t a where tws k is the air temperature at the wet surface and e kpa is the saturated vapor pressure tw is equal to tws when tws ta otherwise t w can be replaced by t a szilagyi 2014 the observed latent heat flux and meteorological variables from 21 stations included in the fluxnet dataset baldocchi et al 2001 are used in this study to evaluate the accuracy of g19 and other functions these stations are selected from different climate zones and landscapes with a minimum availability of 90 high quality daily data within a continuous two year period the descriptions of the stations are shown in table 2 the land cover types of these selected stations are evergreen needleleaf forest deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest grassland cropland shrubland savannas wetland and paddy rice which represent various environments including those under arid and wet conditions the daily data on the days of the month with a large amount of solar radiation mainly may to september for most stations during the two selected years table 2 are used the unreasonable observations of e epo or e epa due to unsteady atmospheric conditions are excluded the actual evaporation is estimated using the residual corrected latent heat fluxes the drying power ea is calculated as follows han and tian 2018 crago and crowley 2005 24 e a ρ c p γ k 2 u ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e a e a where k 0 41 is von karman s constant ρ is the air density kg m3 cp is the specific heat j kg k e a and ea are the saturated and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively z is the measurement height m u is the wind speed at the measurement height m s d 0 is the zero plane displacement height m z 0 m is the momentum roughness length m and z 0 v is the roughness length for vapor m d 0 z 0 m and z 0 v are estimated using canopy height allen et al 1998 the canopy height at the stations located in the usa and the au how station are derived from ershadi et al 2014 and the canopy heights at other stations are estimated using the relationship between the observed wind speed and friction wind velocity following ma and szilagyi 2019 and szilagyi et al 2020 ep max in s20 is calculated as follows 25 e p max δ t dry δ t dry γ r n g γ δ t dry γ e a max where ea max is the maximum value of ea which is calculated as follows 26 e a max ρ c p γ k 2 u ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e t dry where tdry is the so achieved dry environment air temperature which is determined by the wet bulb temperature t wb szilagyi et al 2020 the units of the observed and calculated e epa epo and ep max are all converted to mm day 4 results 4 1 validation of the new function the coefficient α in equation 22 may significantly affect the evaporation calculation using the complementary principle and the value of α is usually optimized by a specific function however han and tian 2018 found that the optimized values were quite different when using different functions to avoid the impact of the uncertainty in α on the comparison of different functions the coefficient α at different stations was estimated using the formula suggested by liu et al 2018 as follows 27 α 1 15 a i 0 14 where ai is the aridity index which is determined as the ratio of annual epa to annual rainfall p the actual evaporation was calculated by different functions using the same value of α see table 2 the coefficient αc the values are shown in table 2 in b20 was determined as follows 28 α c a 1 1 a 2 a i a 3 where a 1 1 496 a 2 0 2948 a 3 0 6697 brutsaert et al 2020 the minimum value of observed x at some fluxnet stations was close to zero therefore x min 0 was used for g19 for convenience of comparison with b15 the performances of the functions are related to the parameters to compare the effectiveness of g19 with that of b15 and aa the parameters of these three functions were calibrated for all 21 stations by minimizing the root mean square errors rmses of the actual daily evaporation estimation the parameter c was optimized within the reasonable range 1 2 the parameters of g19 and aa were also calibrated within their feasible ranges the calibrated parameters are shown in table 3 table 3 illustrates the performance of g19 for actual evaporation estimation at the selected fluxnet stations using the calibrated parameters in general g19 was the most efficient in estimating the actual evaporation and the mean value of rmse for g19 was lower than that for b15 and aa fig 4 shows the model performance of g19 at four selected fluxnet stations g19 accurately captured the variations in actual evaporation theoretically actual evaporation increases very slowly with epo in an arid environment for small values of x and grows rapidly with epo when the environment becomes wet for large values of x this physical process can be described as an exponential feature and can be validated in observations for example at the us srm and us src stations y increased slowly with x when x was less than 0 3 and increased rapidly after x exceeded 0 3 this characteristic was well described by g19 and was not captured by the linear aa these results indicate that g19 can accurately estimate the daily actual evaporation 4 2 comparison with other complementary functions 4 2 1 comparison with b15 aa and h18 the om line in fig 1 represents the upper limit of the complementary principle y x and the ob line represents the lower limit y 0 therefore the triangle omb is the reasonable domain of the general form of the complementary principle as shown in fig 1 the polynomial function b15 exceeds the upper limit with parameter c 1 and produces negative values with c 2 therefore the reasonable curves of b15 can only vary within a narrow region surrounded by the curve with c 1 and the curve with c 2 b15 cannot cover the full space of the omb domain if the observations are located outside this region b15 may have poor performance with c in the reasonable range 1 2 in contrast the curves of g19 vary over a much wider range with parameter d in the reasonable domain 0 and approximately cover the whole space of the omb domain this is illustrated in fig 1 fig 2 and the results shown in table 3 fig 4 and fig 5 table 3 shows that the stations are grouped into two groups for the stations in the first group b15 showed comparable accuracy with g19 and that the curves of b15 were close to those of g19 with optimized parameters see fig 4 however for the stations in the second group the optimized parameter c was 2 within the range 1 2 indicating that b15 could not simulate the actual evaporation very well at these stations table 3 the mean rmse of g19 was significantly lower than that of b15 for the stations in the second group fig 5 shows two examples from the au emr station and es lju station the rmse of the actual evaporation estimation was lower using g19 1 27 and 1 04 mm day than b15 2 58 and 1 42 mm day at these two stations table 3 with the optimized parameter c 2 table 3 in the range 1 2 b15 still overestimated the actual evaporation at the au emr station see fig 5 a if c was not constrained the optimized curve of b15 with c 6 87 fit the observations well at the au emr station when x 0 5 but produced unphysically negative values of y when x 0 5 g19 agreed well with the observations and kept y 0 when x 0 5 at this station a similar result was also found at the es lju station see fig 5 b these results imply that the curve of g19 is more flexible and reasonable than that of b15 g19 follows the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 as mentioned in section 1 h18 follows the framework proposed by han and tian 2018 which is different from that proposed by brutsaert 2015 thus g19 and h18 are not theoretically comparable therefore we did not compare the accuracy of g19 and h18 fig 4 shows the comparison between the curves of g19 and h18 h18 was plotted using the equivalent form shown in table 1 the parameters m and n were estimated using the optimized values of α and b following the method developed by han and tian 2018 for small values of x the curve of h18 was close to that of g19 for large values of x the curve of h18 differed from that of g19 this difference is related to the different boundary conditions and constraints followed by g19 and h18 details of the different boundary conditions and constraints followed by g19 and h18 are discussed in section 5 3 4 2 2 comparison with b20 and s20 g19 was also compared with the two calibration free equations b20 and s20 in addition to the result with α estimated using equation 27 we also compared the results of g19 with α set to αc with the results of b20 the mean rmses of g19 with the two different values of α were both lower than that of b20 see table 4 figs 6 7 and s2 in the supplemental material for a large number of stations the accuracy of b20 was close to g19 however b20 significantly overestimated the actual evaporation at some stations as shown in fig 7 c table 4 also shows that the mean rmse of g19 was significantly lower than that of s20 for some stations s20 had much larger bias than g19 see fig 6 c d and fig 8 c d these results imply that g19 is more accurate than b20 and s20 5 discussion 5 1 determination of x min and parameter d in g19 based on g19 e epa y could also be considered as a function of rescaling variable x x x min 1 x min as follows 29 y e 1 x min d 1 1 x d d 0 this finding is consistent with crago et al 2016 crago et al 2016 argue that x min changes with time tables 3 and 5 illustrate the differences in the rmses of the actual daily evaporation estimation using g19 with different values of x min the rmse changes very little as x min changes this result implies that the accuracy of g19 is not sensitive to x min for convenience of application at the daily time scale a simplified form of g19 equation 21 is recommended this is also consistent with the findings of han and tian 2018 therefore g19 has only one adjustable parameter d when applied to evaporation estimation obviously d can be calibrated using observations we analyzed the correlations between parameter d and the climate variables fig 9 shows that the calibrated parameter d has negative correlations with precipitation indicating that d decreases as precipitation increases fig 2 illustrates that d decreases as the curve of g19 approaches the epo limit therefore the negative correlation between d and precipitation occurs because the actual evaporation in wet conditions is closer to the epo limit than in arid conditions this result implies that d represents the water supply of the land surface stations with humid climates may have smaller values of d studies on physical models of the complementary relationship and more detailed descriptions of evaporation processes are required to develop the physically based formulation of parameter d in future studies examinations of the relationships between parameter d and land surface water availability variables may also be helpful 5 2 comparison of the results using the original and modified pt equations fig 10 a shows the comparison of epo calculated using the modified and original pt equations the difference in the results of these two equations was quite limited and the epo calculated using the modified pt equation was slightly larger than that calculated using the original pt equation for the stations in the second group the actual daily evaporation estimated by aa and b15 using the original pt equation has a slightly lower rmse than that using the modified pt equation however both aa and b15 still have significantly larger rmses than g19 fig 10 c in general the results in this study are not sensitive to the selection of different pt equations original or modified pt equation 5 3 different frameworks of the complementary principle g19 followed the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 brutsaert 2015 adopted e epo epa as the limit of the complementary principle and the application of brutsaert 2015 depends on the specific forms of epo and epa han and tian 2020 with epo and epa determined using ept and epen respectively the limit of the complementary principle proposed by brutsaert 2015 is equal to e ept epen however the sigmoid function proposed by han and tian 2018 uses different definitions than g19 and b15 and x e rad e pen is used in the sigmoid function instead of x e po e pa han and tian 2018 argued that the limits of ept and epen are parallel and adopted e e pen e e pt moreover coefficient α in the pt equation was not involved in the derivation of the sigmoid function although it was introduced in the constraints on the parameters of the sigmoid function han and tian 2019 considered a nonconstant nature of α and proposed constraints 0 erad epen 1 whereas 0 αe rad epen 1 for x they also suggested x max max α 1 0 01 1 to avoid exceeding the upper limit however these constraints are not consistent with that proposed by brutsaert 2015 therefore the sigmoid function and g19 are not comparable different first order boundary conditions satisfied by g19 and the sigmoid function under completely wet conditions also need examination however observations in completely wet environments are not easy to obtain making it difficult to validate the first order boundary condition of complementary functions in completely wet environments analyses of the variation in coefficient α in wet environments and further comparison of the reasonability of the first order boundary conditions of the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 and that of han and tian 2018 are required in future studies g19 will provide a useful basis for comparing different frameworks 6 conclusion 1 we proposed an exponential generalized function for the complementary principle satisfying the widely accepted physical boundary conditions and constraints proposed by brutsaert 2015 and crago et al 2016 the exponential function provides a new approach for estimating land surface evaporation using standard meteorological measurements and may provide further understanding of the complementary principle 2 validation of the exponential function using observations at 21 fluxnet stations suggests that this function can accurately simulate the actual daily evaporation 3 a comparison with the functions proposed in previous studies suggests that the exponential function is more reasonable and flexible than the widely used polynomial function however because the exponential function and the sigmoid function follow different frameworks further analysis of the reasonability of the existing frameworks for the complementary principle is required in future studies credit authorship contribution statement bing gao conceptualization methodology

4980,the complementary principle provides a simple method for estimating land surface evaporation using standard meteorological observations and has received increasing attention in recent years in this study we propose an exponential generalized complementary function that satisfies the physical boundary conditions and constraints proposed by brutsaert 2015 with one adjustable parameter the new exponential function is validated using observations from 21 fluxnet stations and the results show that the exponential function can efficiently simulate actual daily evaporation a comparison between the exponential function and the polynomial function proposed in previous studies suggests that the exponential function can improve the accuracy reasonableness and flexibility of land surface evaporation estimation overall the exponential function provides a new method for estimating land surface evaporation and may enhance our understanding of the complementary principle keywords evaporation complementary principle fluxnet physical constraint exponential function 1 introduction evaporation for simplicity it denotes the combined rate of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation in this study and it has the same meaning as the term evapotranspiration is a key component of the global water and energy balance and has an important effect on the interactions between the atmospheric system and the land surface despite its importance land surface evaporation is usually difficult to estimate through conventional observations proposed by bouchet 1963 the complementary principle provides an accurate method for evaporation estimation using standard meteorological observations that does not rely on measurements of land surface temperature soil moisture or vegetation resistance therefore in recent years an increasing number of studies have investigated the complementary principle brutsaert 2015 ma et al 2015 2019 szilagyi et al 2016 gao et al 2018 han and tian 2018 as introduced by brutsaert 2015 the complementary principle describes the relationships among actual evaporation e potential evaporation epo and apparent potential evaporation epa as follows 1 e f e po e pa the physical interpretation of the complementary principle is that as the land surface dries part of the energy not used for evaporation becomes available in the form of increased sensible heat flux which increases epa brutsaert and parlange 1998 brutsaert 2005 this process leads to a complementary relationship between e and epa the interpretation and calculation of epo and epa are widely debated and various definitions of these two variables can be found brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 granger 1989 mcmahon et al 2013 aminzadeh et al 2016 however most studies suggest that epa can be calculated using penman s 1948 equation as follows brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert 2015 2 e pa e pen e rad e aero where epen is the penman potential evaporation erad is referred to as the radiation term and eaero is referred to as the aerodynamic term based on penman s equation erad and eaero are calculated as follows 3 e rad δ r n g δ γ 4 e aero γ e a δ γ where δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure kpa c which is calculated by the air temperature ta rn is the net radiation w m2 g is the ground heat flux w m2 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c and ea is the drying power w m2 which is calculated by the wind speed and vapor pressure deficit epo is also called wet environment evaporation which is the evaporation from a complete saturated surface where input energy is the only limiting factor most studies suggested that epo can be calculated by priestley taylor s 1972 equation as follows 5 e po e pt α δ r n g δ γ where ept is the evaporation calculated using priestley taylor s equation pt equation and α is a coefficient suggested as 1 26 for large saturated land surfaces various models for estimating evaporation based on the complementary principle have been proposed bouchet 1963 developed a symmetric linear function of equation 1 that was improved to an advection aridity hereinafter referred to as aa function brutsaert

2007 han et al 2008 2011 2012 proposed the conception of the dimensionless form of the complementary principle and normalized equation 6 by epa and obtained another form of the aa function han et al

as follows 8 y f x he proposed that 0 e epo epa therefore the physical constraints of the complementary principle should be 0 y x then he proposed the zero and first order boundary conditions of equation 8 as follows 9 y 0 x 0 y 1 x 1 dy dx 0 x 0 dy dx 1 x 1 assuming equation 8 is a polynomial function brutsaert 2015 adopted x 0 1 and obtained a fourth order polynomial function with considerations of the physical boundary conditions as follows 10 y 2 c x 2 1 2 c x 3 c x 4 where c is a parameter brutsaert 2015 suggested that c 0 is preferable in most cases for convenience in application the conception of gcr proposed by brutsaert 2015 is widely accepted equation 10 hereinafter referred to as b15 has been applied and validated in regions with various climates liu et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2016 ai et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 furthermore brutsaert et al 2020 defined xb αce e and proposed a calibration free equation as follows 11 y 2 x b 2 x b 3 where e e is the equilibrium evaporation defined by slatyer and mcilroy 1961 αc is a coefficient and it can be determined by a global calibrated equation in equation 11 hereinafter referred to as b20 e e is calculated as follows 12 e e δ r n g δ γ following the conception of gcr crago et al 2016 and szilagyi et al 2017 proposed the method for rescaling of x and developed another calibration free equation for the complementary principle these works were improved in szilagyi et al 2020 and y e epa was suggested to be determined as follows 13 y 2 x s 2 x s 3 in equation 13 hereinafter referred to as s20 x s is a variable representing the rescaling of x and is defined as x s ep max epa ep max epo 1 x ep max is the maximum value that epa can achieve han and tian 2018 defined x erad epen and y e epen and proposed different boundary conditions as follows 14 y 0 x x min y 1 x x max d y d x 0 y 0 d y d x 0 y 1 then they developed a sigmoid function as follows 15 y 1 1 m x max x x x min n where m and n are parameters and x max and x min are the upper and lower bounds of x respectively the inputs of equation 15 hereinafter referred to as h18 are epen and erad which differs from the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 that suggested that e is a function of epo and epa however epo and epa should be specified for actual evaporation estimations as suggested by brutsaert 2015 epo and epa can be determined as ept and epen respectively then the sigmoid function is mathematically related to the framework of brutsaert 2015 and we can obtain x α x epo epa ept epen αerad epen and y y e epa e epen table 1 summarizes the major analytical complementary functions proposed in previous studies the sigmoid function is presented as an equivalent form using x e po e pa α e rad e pen α x shortcomings of the existing functions have been proposed in previous studies the aa function cannot capture the nonlinear relationship between x and y and has been found to underestimate the actual evaporation in arid regions and overestimate the actual evaporation in wet regions qualls and gultekin 1997 hobbins et al 2001 it should also be mentioned that aa does not satisfy all the boundary conditions shown in equation 9 proposed by brutsaert 2015 with comprehensive physical boundary conditions the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 provides a rigorous basis for gcr the polynomial function b15 well follows the constraints and physical boundary conditions and has been applied in various regions however there were also some arguments illustrating that the accuracy of b15 needs to be increased for example han and tian 2018 found that b15 does not show the best performance of actual evaporation estimation in many sites with c ranging within the feasible domain 1 2 liu et al 2020 developing new analytical solutions of gcr proposed by brutsaert 2015 is one possible way to increase the accuracy of actual evaporation estimation based on the complementary principle the sigmoid function h18 has provided a new understanding of the complementary principle and has been validated at different time scales zhou et al 2020 but it differs from the framework of brutsaert 2015 szilagyi and crago 2019 argued that h18 may exceed the upper limit of the complementary principle the om line in fig 1 in some cases with x max α 1 and that the exact function of the complementary principle remains unknown therefore more reasonable and accurate functions considering the physical constraints of the complementary principle are still needed the objectives of this study are 1 to derive an exponential function of the complementary principle satisfying physical boundary conditions and constraints and 2 to evaluate the new function using observations at 21 fluxnet stations and compare it with the functions proposed in previous studies 2 derivation of the exponential complementary function as mentioned in section 1 there are debates about the first order boundary condition of the complementary principle in wet environments han and tian 2018 used dy dx 0 d y d x 0 where y 1 and brutsaert 2015 proposed dy dx 1 where y 1 han and tian 2019 argued that these conflicts may be attributed to the differences in the definitions and frameworks between their work and brutsaert s work in this study our derivation is within the framework introduced by brutsaert 2015 and the first order boundary condition of his work is more widely accepted therefore the derivation in this study follows the first order boundary condition proposed by brutsaert 2015 which is shown in equation 9 crago et al 2016 suggested that the upper bound of x x max should be equal to 1 and that the boundary conditions of the complementary principle could be modified as follows 16 y 0 x x min o r lim x x min y 0 y 1 x 1 dy dx 0 x x min o r lim x x min dy dx 0 dy dx 1 x 1 where x min is the lower bound of x and 0 x min 1 han and tian 2018 assumed dy dx ky 1 y x x min x max x where k is a parameter considering the boundary condition dy dx 1 x 1 we can modify the assumptions of han and tian 2018 and adopt the following 17 dy dx y x x min 1 x min d 1 d 0 where d is a parameter performing the integration of equation 17 we can obtain 18 y e 1 x min d x x min 1 x min d c 1 d 0 where c 1 is a constant by applying the boundary condition y 1 x 1 the constant c 1 can be determined as follows 19 c 1 1 x min d then we obtain a new function as follows 20 y e 1 x min d 1 1 x x min 1 x min d d 0 where d is a parameter with a feasible domain 0 when x x min x x min 1 x min d 0 then we can obtain 1 1 x x min 1 x min d and y e 1 x min d 1 1 x x min 1 x min d 0 which proves lim x x min y 0 therefore we prove that equation 20 satisfies the zero order boundary condition shown in equation 16 we can also prove that lim x x min dy dx 0 see the supplemental material it is clear that equation 20 satisfies the boundary condition dy dx 1 x 1 therefore equation 20 hereinafter referred to as g19 is an exponential function that satisfies the zero and first order boundary conditions of the complementary principle shown in equation 16 because it is an exponential function g19 always follows the constraint y 0 g19 exhibits the typical complementary behavior between the scaled actual evaporation e epo and apparent potential evaporation epa epo and it shows an asymmetric feature see fig s1 in the supplemental material fig 2 shows the curves of g19 with different values of the parameter d the figure shows that the curvature of the g19 curve increases as d increases the curve of g19 closely resembles a linear line as d decreases and it approaches the upper limit om line in fig 2 as d approaches zero fig 3 illustrates that the differences between y calculated by g19 and x are always negative even with a very small value of parameter d this result indicates that the curve of g19 is always below the line y x implying that g19 never exceeds the upper limit these results show that g19 follows the physical constraints of the complementary principle well our analysis shows that the accuracy of g19 is not sensitive to x min details are shown in section 5 1 therefore x min can be ignored in most cases and a simplified form of g19 is recommended for application as follows 21 y e 1 d 1 1 x d d 0 3 data used and calculation of epo epa as mentioned in section 1 various definitions of epo and epa can be found in the literature and none of them is universally accepted in this study following brutsaert 2015 epa is defined as the evaporation from a small saturated surface inside the larger surface and the presence of this small saturated surface does not affect the surrounding environment therefore epa is calculated using penman s equation equation 2 in this study as suggested by brutsaert 2015 epo is defined as evaporation that takes place from the same surface as the actual evaporation when the evaporating water is not a limiting factor and with the same solar radiative input therefore brutsaert 2015 suggested that epo could be formulated by priestley and taylor s equation equation 5 however szilagyi et al 2016 pointed out that under wet environmental conditions epo should be estimated using the wet environment air temperature t w therefore a modified priestley and taylor equation is used to estimate epo szilagyi and jozsa 2008 in this study as follows 22 e po e pt α δ t w δ t w γ r n g tw is used to calculate the slope of the saturated vapor pressure and it is estimated using the air temperature ta as follows 23 r n e pa e pa γ t ws t a e t w s e t a where tws k is the air temperature at the wet surface and e kpa is the saturated vapor pressure tw is equal to tws when tws ta otherwise t w can be replaced by t a szilagyi 2014 the observed latent heat flux and meteorological variables from 21 stations included in the fluxnet dataset baldocchi et al 2001 are used in this study to evaluate the accuracy of g19 and other functions these stations are selected from different climate zones and landscapes with a minimum availability of 90 high quality daily data within a continuous two year period the descriptions of the stations are shown in table 2 the land cover types of these selected stations are evergreen needleleaf forest deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest grassland cropland shrubland savannas wetland and paddy rice which represent various environments including those under arid and wet conditions the daily data on the days of the month with a large amount of solar radiation mainly may to september for most stations during the two selected years table 2 are used the unreasonable observations of e epo or e epa due to unsteady atmospheric conditions are excluded the actual evaporation is estimated using the residual corrected latent heat fluxes the drying power ea is calculated as follows han and tian 2018 crago and crowley 2005 24 e a ρ c p γ k 2 u ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e a e a where k 0 41 is von karman s constant ρ is the air density kg m3 cp is the specific heat j kg k e a and ea are the saturated and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively z is the measurement height m u is the wind speed at the measurement height m s d 0 is the zero plane displacement height m z 0 m is the momentum roughness length m and z 0 v is the roughness length for vapor m d 0 z 0 m and z 0 v are estimated using canopy height allen et al 1998 the canopy height at the stations located in the usa and the au how station are derived from ershadi et al 2014 and the canopy heights at other stations are estimated using the relationship between the observed wind speed and friction wind velocity following ma and szilagyi 2019 and szilagyi et al 2020 ep max in s20 is calculated as follows 25 e p max δ t dry δ t dry γ r n g γ δ t dry γ e a max where ea max is the maximum value of ea which is calculated as follows 26 e a max ρ c p γ k 2 u ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e t dry where tdry is the so achieved dry environment air temperature which is determined by the wet bulb temperature t wb szilagyi et al 2020 the units of the observed and calculated e epa epo and ep max are all converted to mm day 4 results 4 1 validation of the new function the coefficient α in equation 22 may significantly affect the evaporation calculation using the complementary principle and the value of α is usually optimized by a specific function however han and tian 2018 found that the optimized values were quite different when using different functions to avoid the impact of the uncertainty in α on the comparison of different functions the coefficient α at different stations was estimated using the formula suggested by liu et al 2018 as follows 27 α 1 15 a i 0 14 where ai is the aridity index which is determined as the ratio of annual epa to annual rainfall p the actual evaporation was calculated by different functions using the same value of α see table 2 the coefficient αc the values are shown in table 2 in b20 was determined as follows 28 α c a 1 1 a 2 a i a 3 where a 1 1 496 a 2 0 2948 a 3 0 6697 brutsaert et al 2020 the minimum value of observed x at some fluxnet stations was close to zero therefore x min 0 was used for g19 for convenience of comparison with b15 the performances of the functions are related to the parameters to compare the effectiveness of g19 with that of b15 and aa the parameters of these three functions were calibrated for all 21 stations by minimizing the root mean square errors rmses of the actual daily evaporation estimation the parameter c was optimized within the reasonable range 1 2 the parameters of g19 and aa were also calibrated within their feasible ranges the calibrated parameters are shown in table 3 table 3 illustrates the performance of g19 for actual evaporation estimation at the selected fluxnet stations using the calibrated parameters in general g19 was the most efficient in estimating the actual evaporation and the mean value of rmse for g19 was lower than that for b15 and aa fig 4 shows the model performance of g19 at four selected fluxnet stations g19 accurately captured the variations in actual evaporation theoretically actual evaporation increases very slowly with epo in an arid environment for small values of x and grows rapidly with epo when the environment becomes wet for large values of x this physical process can be described as an exponential feature and can be validated in observations for example at the us srm and us src stations y increased slowly with x when x was less than 0 3 and increased rapidly after x exceeded 0 3 this characteristic was well described by g19 and was not captured by the linear aa these results indicate that g19 can accurately estimate the daily actual evaporation 4 2 comparison with other complementary functions 4 2 1 comparison with b15 aa and h18 the om line in fig 1 represents the upper limit of the complementary principle y x and the ob line represents the lower limit y 0 therefore the triangle omb is the reasonable domain of the general form of the complementary principle as shown in fig 1 the polynomial function b15 exceeds the upper limit with parameter c 1 and produces negative values with c 2 therefore the reasonable curves of b15 can only vary within a narrow region surrounded by the curve with c 1 and the curve with c 2 b15 cannot cover the full space of the omb domain if the observations are located outside this region b15 may have poor performance with c in the reasonable range 1 2 in contrast the curves of g19 vary over a much wider range with parameter d in the reasonable domain 0 and approximately cover the whole space of the omb domain this is illustrated in fig 1 fig 2 and the results shown in table 3 fig 4 and fig 5 table 3 shows that the stations are grouped into two groups for the stations in the first group b15 showed comparable accuracy with g19 and that the curves of b15 were close to those of g19 with optimized parameters see fig 4 however for the stations in the second group the optimized parameter c was 2 within the range 1 2 indicating that b15 could not simulate the actual evaporation very well at these stations table 3 the mean rmse of g19 was significantly lower than that of b15 for the stations in the second group fig 5 shows two examples from the au emr station and es lju station the rmse of the actual evaporation estimation was lower using g19 1 27 and 1 04 mm day than b15 2 58 and 1 42 mm day at these two stations table 3 with the optimized parameter c 2 table 3 in the range 1 2 b15 still overestimated the actual evaporation at the au emr station see fig 5 a if c was not constrained the optimized curve of b15 with c 6 87 fit the observations well at the au emr station when x 0 5 but produced unphysically negative values of y when x 0 5 g19 agreed well with the observations and kept y 0 when x 0 5 at this station a similar result was also found at the es lju station see fig 5 b these results imply that the curve of g19 is more flexible and reasonable than that of b15 g19 follows the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 as mentioned in section 1 h18 follows the framework proposed by han and tian 2018 which is different from that proposed by brutsaert 2015 thus g19 and h18 are not theoretically comparable therefore we did not compare the accuracy of g19 and h18 fig 4 shows the comparison between the curves of g19 and h18 h18 was plotted using the equivalent form shown in table 1 the parameters m and n were estimated using the optimized values of α and b following the method developed by han and tian 2018 for small values of x the curve of h18 was close to that of g19 for large values of x the curve of h18 differed from that of g19 this difference is related to the different boundary conditions and constraints followed by g19 and h18 details of the different boundary conditions and constraints followed by g19 and h18 are discussed in section 5 3 4 2 2 comparison with b20 and s20 g19 was also compared with the two calibration free equations b20 and s20 in addition to the result with α estimated using equation 27 we also compared the results of g19 with α set to αc with the results of b20 the mean rmses of g19 with the two different values of α were both lower than that of b20 see table 4 figs 6 7 and s2 in the supplemental material for a large number of stations the accuracy of b20 was close to g19 however b20 significantly overestimated the actual evaporation at some stations as shown in fig 7 c table 4 also shows that the mean rmse of g19 was significantly lower than that of s20 for some stations s20 had much larger bias than g19 see fig 6 c d and fig 8 c d these results imply that g19 is more accurate than b20 and s20 5 discussion 5 1 determination of x min and parameter d in g19 based on g19 e epa y could also be considered as a function of rescaling variable x x x min 1 x min as follows 29 y e 1 x min d 1 1 x d d 0 this finding is consistent with crago et al 2016 crago et al 2016 argue that x min changes with time tables 3 and 5 illustrate the differences in the rmses of the actual daily evaporation estimation using g19 with different values of x min the rmse changes very little as x min changes this result implies that the accuracy of g19 is not sensitive to x min for convenience of application at the daily time scale a simplified form of g19 equation 21 is recommended this is also consistent with the findings of han and tian 2018 therefore g19 has only one adjustable parameter d when applied to evaporation estimation obviously d can be calibrated using observations we analyzed the correlations between parameter d and the climate variables fig 9 shows that the calibrated parameter d has negative correlations with precipitation indicating that d decreases as precipitation increases fig 2 illustrates that d decreases as the curve of g19 approaches the epo limit therefore the negative correlation between d and precipitation occurs because the actual evaporation in wet conditions is closer to the epo limit than in arid conditions this result implies that d represents the water supply of the land surface stations with humid climates may have smaller values of d studies on physical models of the complementary relationship and more detailed descriptions of evaporation processes are required to develop the physically based formulation of parameter d in future studies examinations of the relationships between parameter d and land surface water availability variables may also be helpful 5 2 comparison of the results using the original and modified pt equations fig 10 a shows the comparison of epo calculated using the modified and original pt equations the difference in the results of these two equations was quite limited and the epo calculated using the modified pt equation was slightly larger than that calculated using the original pt equation for the stations in the second group the actual daily evaporation estimated by aa and b15 using the original pt equation has a slightly lower rmse than that using the modified pt equation however both aa and b15 still have significantly larger rmses than g19 fig 10 c in general the results in this study are not sensitive to the selection of different pt equations original or modified pt equation 5 3 different frameworks of the complementary principle g19 followed the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 brutsaert 2015 adopted e epo epa as the limit of the complementary principle and the application of brutsaert 2015 depends on the specific forms of epo and epa han and tian 2020 with epo and epa determined using ept and epen respectively the limit of the complementary principle proposed by brutsaert 2015 is equal to e ept epen however the sigmoid function proposed by han and tian 2018 uses different definitions than g19 and b15 and x e rad e pen is used in the sigmoid function instead of x e po e pa han and tian 2018 argued that the limits of ept and epen are parallel and adopted e e pen e e pt moreover coefficient α in the pt equation was not involved in the derivation of the sigmoid function although it was introduced in the constraints on the parameters of the sigmoid function han and tian 2019 considered a nonconstant nature of α and proposed constraints 0 erad epen 1 whereas 0 αe rad epen 1 for x they also suggested x max max α 1 0 01 1 to avoid exceeding the upper limit however these constraints are not consistent with that proposed by brutsaert 2015 therefore the sigmoid function and g19 are not comparable different first order boundary conditions satisfied by g19 and the sigmoid function under completely wet conditions also need examination however observations in completely wet environments are not easy to obtain making it difficult to validate the first order boundary condition of complementary functions in completely wet environments analyses of the variation in coefficient α in wet environments and further comparison of the reasonability of the first order boundary conditions of the framework proposed by brutsaert 2015 and that of han and tian 2018 are required in future studies g19 will provide a useful basis for comparing different frameworks 6 conclusion 1 we proposed an exponential generalized function for the complementary principle satisfying the widely accepted physical boundary conditions and constraints proposed by brutsaert 2015 and crago et al 2016 the exponential function provides a new approach for estimating land surface evaporation using standard meteorological measurements and may provide further understanding of the complementary principle 2 validation of the exponential function using observations at 21 fluxnet stations suggests that this function can accurately simulate the actual daily evaporation 3 a comparison with the functions proposed in previous studies suggests that the exponential function is more reasonable and flexible than the widely used polynomial function however because the exponential function and the sigmoid function follow different frameworks further analysis of the reasonability of the existing frameworks for the complementary principle is required in future studies credit authorship contribution statement bing gao conceptualization methodology

4981,recent studies report that the extreme rainfall characteristics in most parts of the globe exhibit temporal non stationarity therefore modeling the nonstationary behavior of extreme rainfall for different water resources applications is vital when modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series previous studies consider a single threshold value in the peaks over threshold pot approach to extract extreme rainfall series however extreme rainfall series extracted with different threshold values may have a different degree of non stationarity consequently it is essential to understand the effect of threshold selection in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series this study aims at quantifying the threshold uncertainty i e uncertainty in extreme rainfall return levels due to the choice of the threshold in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series using the generalized pareto distribution gpd to study the threshold uncertainty extreme rainfall series over india from the india meteorological department s high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily rainfall dataset is used for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series different indices representing four physical processes namely global warming el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and local temperature anomaly are linked with the scale parameter of the gpd uncertainties in extreme rainfall return levels calculated over india indicate that the uncertainty created due to the choice of threshold is 54 higher under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition keywords extreme rainfall frequency analysis generalized pareto distribution non stationary peaks over threshold approach threshold selection 1 introduction flooding is the greatest water related natural disaster known to the human race its human material and ecological costs can be devastating for sustainable development teegavarapu 2012 more than 63 of floods that occurred during the years 1885 2009 are due to heavy extreme rainfall and it indicates that extreme rainfall events are the primary cause of flooding teegavarapu 2012 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2019 consequently modeling the characteristics of extreme rainfall events is indispensable in flood risk management decisions the word extreme may refer to many different things in the climate literature and there is no unique climatological definition for it stephenson 2008 however in the case of precipitation an extreme can be reasonably well defined referring to the values in the tails of the distribution that would be expected to occur infrequently zeng and zwires 2013 the annual maximum and peaks over threshold pot are commonly used approaches to extract extreme quantiles for modeling extreme rainfall many studies use annual maximum series because of its simplicity cheng and aghakouchak 2014 panagoulia et al 2014 dyrrdal et al 2014 paixao et al 2015 sun et al 2015 vasiliades et al 2015 wang et al 2016 rulfová et al 2016 even though the pot approach removes some of the limitations of the annual maximum method it remains underused beguería 2005 the main reason for this is the selection of an appropriate threshold value for extracting extreme rainfall series under the stationary condition i e exceedance probability of an extreme event is assumed to be time invariant beguería 2005 studied the uncertainties in partial duration series modeling of extremes related to the choice of the threshold value and reported that the small changes in the threshold value could cause significant modification on the lower part of the distribution and the minor changes on the left tail of the distribution could lead to significant differences in the estimated parameter on the other hand recent studies report that the extreme rainfall in many parts of the world is increasing day by day and exhibiting nonstationary behavior saidi et al 2015 bartolomeu et al 2016 hanel et al 2016 limsakul and singhruck 2016 zilli et al 2016 consequently many researchers modeled the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall series for the different applications such as developing nonstationary rainfall idf curves developing weather generator for a nonstationary extreme rainfall condition and for attributing the possible reasons for the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall series feng et al 2007 furrer and katz 2008 sugahara et al 2009 beguería et al 2011 villarini et al 2011 vasiliades et al 2015 villafuerte et al 2015 gao et al 2016 mondal and mujumdar 2015 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 similar to stationary condition most of the previous studies that aimed to model the extreme rainfall under nonstationary condition used the annual maximum method to extract extreme rainfall series cheng and aghakouchak 2014 vasiliades et al 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017b 2016 gao et al 2016 and only a few researchers used pot approach to extract extreme rainfall series mondal and mujumdar 2015 yilmaz et al 2014 when modeling extreme rainfall series using the pot approach under nonstationary conditions researchers used a single threshold value to extract extreme rainfall series for example beguería et al 2011 groisman et al 2005 mondal and mujumdar 2015 and gemmer et al 2011 chose the 90th percentile of daily rainfall as the threshold for obtaining extreme rainfall series using the pot approach however it is essential to note that the extreme rainfall series extracted with the different threshold value may have a different magnitude of trend different degree of non stationarity for instance extreme rainfall series extracted with the 95th percentile of rainfall as a threshold may have a steep increasing trend while the extreme rainfall series extracted with the 90th percentile of rainfall as a threshold may have a slight increasing decreasing trend or no trend hence change in threshold value can change the magnitude of the trend in extreme rainfall series or it can even change the sign i e from increasing to decreasing or vice versa consequently different threshold values may suggest different temporal changes in extreme rainfall characteristics therefore this work aims at answering questions like 1 what is the influence of threshold selection in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series 2 will the uncertainty created from the choice of threshold increase under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition till today no attempt has been made to answer these questions therefore this study aims to answer them 2 data 2 1 extreme rainfall data for this study a high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily rainfall dataset from 1901 to 2013 is used this dataset is prepared by the india meteorological department imd and the details about the preparation of this dataset can be obtained from pai et al 2014 this dataset is increasingly being used in studies on indian rainfall pai et al 2015 though the dataset is available from 1901 as the climate change signals are visible only towards the end of the 20th century mondal and mujumdar 2015 and the data density was relatively higher 3100 stations per day pai et al 2014 from 1951 the time period 1951 2013 63 years is considered for the current study to study the influence of threshold selection a set of threshold u values should be selected for each grid point to extract extreme rainfall series using the pot approach it is important to note that there is no globally accepted method for selecting a threshold value scarrott and macdonald 2012 miniussi and marani 2020 and the mean excess plot coles 2001 is widely used for threshold selection under the stationary condition when modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series or analyzing the trends in extreme rainfall series researchers generally prefer to choose the threshold by a standard definition based on the guidelines given in katz et al 2013 i e the threshold should be high enough for the values to be extreme but not so high as to retain only a few points in the analysis for example mondal and mujumdar 2015 chose the 90th percentile of daily rainfall as the threshold for obtaining extreme rainfall series using the pot approach studies that chose the 90th percentile of rainfall as a threshold include but are not limited to beguería et al 2011 groisman et al 2005 and gemmer et al 2011 further some studies chose the 95th percentile of rainfall as a threshold vittal et al 2013 haylock and nicholls 2000 as this study aims to quantify the influence of threshold selection in modeling nonstationary extreme rainfall series extracted using the pot approach there is a need to define a set of possible threshold values for each grid point in this direction the 90th percentile of daily rainfall of the grid is chosen as the starting threshold for each grid point then the threshold value is increased based on the rainfall events which are having an intensity higher than the 90th percentile of daily rainfall of the grid as the pot approach may be superior only if the number of exceedances is more than the sample size of the annual maximum series the end threshold of a grid is defined as the threshold which provides at least 63 sample size of the annual maximum series exceedances after declustering for each threshold value temporal dependence within each extreme rainfall spell should be removed to preserve the independence assumption coles 2001 and this process is termed as declustering consecutive rainy days when the rainfall is higher than the chosen threshold u is an extreme rainfall cluster and they are detached from each other by more than one day when the rainfall is below the chosen threshold towards declustering only the maximum value in each cluster is retained the process of defining a set of possible threshold values for each imd grid point is explained in the following steps the rainfall amount during wet days rainy days having rainfall amount over 1 mm of the grid is fitted with the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf and the 90th percentile rainfall is calculated from the empirical cdf as aforementioned this 90th percentile rainfall is used as the starting threshold value us of the grid all the rainfall values which are greater than us of the grid are extracted and the unique values are sorted in ascending order the threshold ue which provides at least 63 sample size of the annual maximum series exceedances after declustering is calculated now the set of possible threshold values are us all the unique rainfall values between us and ue ue for example if us is 30 mm day ue is 50 mm day and the rainfall values between us and ue are 31 35 35 40 45 45 and 49 mm day then the set of possible threshold values are 30 31 35 40 45 49 and 50 mm day the number of thresholds estimated by this method at each grid point over india is discussed in section 4 2 2 data for covariates for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series extracted with each threshold value discussed in section 2 1 there is a need for identifying a set of possible covariates generally a set of indices that represent the physical processes that are responsible for the nonstationary behavior of extreme rainfall are used as covariates agilan and umamahesh 2017b mondal and mujumdar 2015 in this study the physical processes which show a significant relationship with the indian region extreme rainfall characteristics are chosen based on available literature and previous studies agilan and umamahesh 2017b mondal and mujumdar 2015 global warming is generally considered as the dominant cause of the change in extreme rainfall characteristics agilan and umamahesh 2017b cai et al 2014b therefore indices that represent global warming are considered as covariates for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series particularly near surface temperature anomalies of the hadcrut4 dataset are used as indices that represent global warming these are monthly global temperature anomaly gta northern hemisphere temperature anomaly nta southern hemisphere temperature anomaly sta and tropics 30 deg s to 30 deg n temperature anomaly tta information about these datasets can be obtained at https www metoffice gov

a significant influence on extreme rainfall of most parts of the world sun et al 2015 villafuerte and matsumoto 2015 zhang et al 2010 kenyon and hegerl 2010 the enso cycle is represented by different indices multivariate enso index mei southern oscillation index soi and sea surface temperature sst are used by many previous studies to represent the enso cycle phases mondal and mujumdar 2015 used sst to represent the enso cycle in modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall characteristics over india however agilan and umamahesh 2018a agilan and umamahesh 2018b reported that the choice of enso index with appropriate lag creates a significant difference in modeling extreme rainfall intensity over india therefore we have considered all three enso indices mei sst and soi with up to twelve months lag the sst index used in this study is monthly sea surface temperature anomaly over nino 3 4 17oe 120ow 5os 5on region with respect to 1981 2010 mean this sst dataset is downloaded at http www

mei ext table ext html accessed on 01 march 2019 there are many studies that show a significant relationship between local temperature changes and extreme rainfall characteristics wasko and sharma 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2015 therefore local temperature anomalies are also considered as covariates for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall particularly three indices namely monthly mean temperature anomaly meta monthly maximum temperature anomaly mata and monthly minimum temperature anomaly mita are calculated for each 0 25 resolution grids rainfall grid resolution from 0 5 resolution cru ts version 4 01 temperature datasets and used as covariates the temperature data is re gridded using bilinear interpolation to get temperature anomaly at 0 25 resolution the details about the cru dataset can be obtained from harris et al 2014 and the temperature datasets are downloaded from https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 01 accessed on 01 april 2019 ajayamohan and rao 2008 reported that the extreme rainfall over india has a significant relationship with the indian ocean dipole iod mode and the greenhouse warming is also increasing the frequency of extreme iod events cai et al 2014b therefore an index representing iod is considered as a covariate in modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall the hadisst dataset based monthly dipole mode index dmi saji et al 1999 with lag up to 12 months is used to represent the iod and it is downloaded from http www jamstec go jp frcgc research d1 iod data dmi monthly txt accessed on 15 march 2019 in addition to these physical covariates most of the previous studies allowed the parameters of the distribution to vary linearly with year values when modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series yilmaz and perera 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 consequently standardized year values are used as a covariate which represents the linear trend in summary the indices representing the different physical processes used for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series extracted for each threshold are listed in table 1 note that the covariates used in this study are selected based on the previous studies agilan and umamahesh 2017b mondal and mujumdar 2015 and the availability of data over india therefore it is not the complete list of covariates that can be used to model the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall when the aim is to project the extreme rainfall for the future under non stationary conditions using covariates that have a consistent relationship with extreme rainfall over the entire study area may improve the projection roderick et al 2020 3 modeling non stationarity in the extreme rainfall series this study aims to quantify the influence of threshold selection in modeling nonstationary extreme rainfall series extracted using the pot approach in this section how the non stationarity in extreme rainfall series extracted with a single threshold u is modeled with a single covariate is briefly discussed the methodology adopted to understand the effect of threshold selection is discussed in section 4 extreme rainfall series x x1 x2 xn obtained using the pot approach converges asymptotically to the generalized pareto distribution gpd coles et al 2003 when we model the nonstationary extreme rainfall series we allow the parameters of the distribution to vary with time and the cumulative density function cdf of nonstationary gpd is given by eq 1 1 f x t σ t ξ t u t 1 1 x t u t σ t ξ t 1 ξ t σ t 0 1 x t u t σ t ξ t 0 1 exp x t u t σ t σ t 0 ξ t 0 here shape and scale parameters are denoted by ξ and σ respectively note that the parameters in the eq 1 are time variant and it can be achieved by linking the parameters with time varying covariate s it is theoretically possible to allow all the parameters of the distribution to vary with covariates however it is not suggested to allow the threshold u to vary with time as it creates numerical instabilities in maximization of the likelihood function furrer and katz 2007 also the shape parameter of the distribution is not allowed to vary with covariates as it is difficult to estimate it precisely coles 2001 as a result only the scale parameter of the distribution is allowed to vary with covariate when extreme rainfall series extracted with the pot approach is modeled with the generalized pareto distribution mondal and mujumdar 2015 yilmaz et al 2014 further parameters can be linked with covariates in different ways for example parameters can be allowed to vary with covariate s linearly or non linearly in general if the physical covariates are used to model the non stationarity parameters are allowed to vary linearly with covariates eq 2 shows the general form of allowing the scale parameter of the gpd to vary linearly with a time varying covariate c 2 σ t exp 1 c t σ 0 σ 1 intercept and slope parameters of this linear linking eq 2 are represented by σ 0 and σ 1 respectively since the scale parameter of the gpd cannot take a negative value to ensure the positive value of σ the exponential function is added in eq 2 instead a log function can also be used for the same purpose once the nonstationary parameters and the nonstationary setting the way of linking with covariate are decided the parameters can be estimated using the method of maximum likelihood appendix a the temporal changes in extreme rainfall behavior can be calculated from the constructed nonstationary gpd parameters however the significance of the trend parameter in the nonstationary model needs to be checked before using the nonstationary model as the nonstationary model can be constructed even for the stationary time series which is not correct the likelihood ratio lr appendix b test can be used to evaluate the statistical significance of the trend parameter in the nonstationary model in this study for each extreme rainfall series extracted with a threshold value we have constructed 60 non stationary models refer table 1 and a stationary model when the number of nonstationary models constructed for the given extreme rainfall series i e extreme rainfall series extracted with a threshold value is more than one the lr test can be conducted only for the best nonstationary model instead of repeating the lr test for all nonstationary models for selecting the best model among all models constructed for a given extreme rainfall series the akaike information criterion with small sample size correction aicc is generally used strupczewski et al 2001 and it is given by eq 3 3 aicc 2 log l 2 p 2 p p 1 n p 1 in eq 3 log l denotes the minimized negative log likelihood of the model p and n represent the number of parameters in the model and sample size respectively the model which has the lowest aicc value among all models is considered as the best model for the given time series if the trend parameter in the best nonstationary model is statistically significant the temporal variations of extreme rainfall return level can be calculated using parameters of the best nonstationary model the return levels for a given design return period q year can be estimated using eq 4 coles 2001 it is essential to note that the design probability of exceedance for a given return period is adjusted based on the number of exceedances 4 z q z 1 q z 2 q z n q u exp σ 0 σ 1 c i ξ ϕ q ξ 1 ξ 0 i 1 2 n u exp σ 0 σ 1 c i log ϕ q ξ 0 i 1 2 n 5 ϕ n n here n is the number of years and n is the number of exceedances 4 influence of threshold selection to quantify threshold uncertainty i e uncertainty in extreme rainfall return levels due to the choice of the threshold when modeling nonstationary extreme rainfall series extracted using the pot approach a set of possible threshold values is defined for each imd grid using the method described in section 2 1 the graphical overview of calculating threshold uncertainty of a single imd grid is plotted in fig 1 fig 2 shows the methodology that was adopted to calculate the threshold uncertainty the number of thresholds defined for each grid point over india is plotted in fig 3 a from the considered 4949 grids over india the average number of thresholds used to extract extreme rainfall series is 228 the methodology that was adopted to calculate the threshold uncertainty is discussed in the following steps step 1 for a given grid point extreme rainfall series is extracted using the pot approach with 90th percentile daily rainfall as the threshold step 2 the extreme rainfall series is declustered to preserve the independence assumption see section 2 1 if the number of exceedances is more than 63 sample size of annual maximum series step 3 is carried out otherwise step 1 is started with the next imd grid step 3 for the declustered series in addition to one stationary gpd 60 nonstationary gpds are constructed with the help of covariates discussed in section 2 2 and methodology presented in section 3 step 4 the best nonstationary model for the given extreme rainfall series is identified using the aicc value refer section 3 and the statistical significance of the trend parameter in the best nonstationary model is evaluated using the lr test at the significance level of 0 05 step 5 if the trend parameter in the best nonstationary model is statistically insignificant the extreme rainfall series is considered as a stationary series and the corresponding threshold value is not considered for calculating the threshold uncertainty then extreme rainfall series is extracted with the next possible threshold value and steps 2 6 are carried with new extreme rainfall series of the grid step 6 if the trend parameter of the best nonstationary model is statistically significant the cdfs of nonstationary return levels eq 4 for different design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year are calculated upon calculating the return levels cdfs the next extreme rainfall series of the grid with the next possible threshold value is extracted and steps 2 6 are carried with new extreme rainfall series of the grid the steps 1 to 6 are repeated for all 4949 imd grids over india for calculating the threshold uncertainty at each grid point it is not surprising that not all selected threshold values produced nonstationary extreme rainfall time series the number of thresholds that produced stationary extreme rainfall series is shown in fig 3 b and c shows the number of thresholds that produced nonstationary extreme rainfall series which are used to calculate the threshold uncertainty over india note that the number of thresholds that produced the nonstationary extreme rainfall time series is much higher 256 than the number of thresholds that produced stationary extreme rainfall series further we also observed that 4940 grids out of 4949 have at least one threshold value that produced a nonstationary series it implies that extreme rainfall series over india is mostly nonstationary which was also observed in a previous study mondal and mujumdar 2015 the threshold uncertainty in cdf of nonstationary rainfall return levels calculated for the 10 year design return period of a grid is plotted in fig 4 since it is not possible to show a similar plot for all 4949 grids and all return periods we have used control points t5l t5r t50l t50r t95l and t95r refer fig 4 on the cdf band to quantify the threshold uncertainty over india particularly the following values are calculated for all the grid points and for all design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year 13 t 5 t 5 r t 5 l t 50 t 50 r t 50 l t 95 t 95 r t 95 l here t5l is the 5th percentile lowest nonstationary return level t5r is the 5th percentile highest nonstationary return level t50l is the 50th percentile lowest nonstationary return level t50r is the 50th percentile highest nonstationary return level t95l is the 95th percentile lowest nonstationary return level and t95r is the 95th percentile highest nonstationary return level the definitions of t5l t5r t50l t50r t95l and t95r are with respect to the threshold uncertainty band of a grid refer fig 4 the spatial maps of threshold uncertainty t5 t50 and t95 for all design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year are shown in figs 5 7 respectively the box plots of threshold uncertainty t5 t50 and t95 for all design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year are shown in fig 8 from figs 5 8 it is observed that the threshold uncertainty is more for higher return periods when compared to lower return periods it is also seen that the threshold uncertainty at the 95th percentile of cdf t95 is higher than the threshold uncertainty at the 5th and 50th percentile t5 and t50 further to answer the question will the uncertainty created by choice of threshold increase under nonstationary condition we also modeled the threshold uncertainty under stationary condition in particular extreme rainfall series extracted with all threshold values see section 2 1 and fig 3 a are fitted with the stationary gpd and return levels for all return periods are calculated since the return level for a given return period is a single value for a threshold under the stationary condition the difference between maximum and minimum return level with respect to all threshold values is calculated for all return periods and grid points these differences are the uncertainty in the return levels due to the choice of threshold under the stationary condition the spatial maps of threshold uncertainty when the extreme rainfall series are modeled under the stationary condition in extreme rainfall return levels of 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year return period is plotted in fig 9 the box plots of threshold uncertainty under the stationary condition are shown in fig 10 generally the probability density function pdf of gpd obtained from the 50th percentile of nonstationary gpd parameters will be nearly equivalent to the pdf of gpd obtained from the stationary gpd parameters agilan and umamahesh 2017a therefore the threshold uncertainty calculated under the stationary condition figs 9 and 10 is compared with the t50 figs 6 and 8 b from the results it is calculated that the uncertainty created due to the choice of threshold is 54 average value for entire india and all return periods higher under the nonstationary condition when compared to modeling extreme rainfall under the stationary assumption further both in stationary and nonstationary conditions the uncertainty in return level due to the choice of threshold is more for higher return periods when compared to lower return periods 5 summary we studied the influence of threshold selection in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series using the generalized pareto distribution extreme rainfall series over india from 63 years 1951 2013 of india meteorological department s high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily rainfall dataset comprises of 4949 grid points is used to study the threshold uncertainty for each grid point a set of possible threshold values starting from the 90th percentile daily rainfall of the grid are first identified for the analysis once extreme rainfall series are extracted for each grid point based on the identified threshold values for the gird 60 nonstationary models and one stationary model is constructed for each extreme rainfall series however extreme rainfall series corresponding to different threshold values for which at least one statistically significant nonstationary model is available are used to study the threshold uncertainty of that grid further only the best nonstationary model out of 60 nonstationary models for the corresponding extreme rainfall series is used for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series different indices representing four physical processes namely global warming enso iod and local temperature anomaly are linked with the scale parameter of the gpd the uncertainties in extreme rainfall return levels calculated over india indicate that the uncertainty created due to the choice of threshold in modeling pot based extreme rainfall is 54 higher under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition for calculating threshold uncertainty under the stationary condition we have used all the threshold values which gives at least 63 exceedances after declustering for calculating the threshold uncertainty under the nonstationary condition only the threshold values which produced nonstationary extreme rainfall series are considered consequently the number of thresholds used to calculate threshold uncertainty under the stationary condition is higher than those that were used under the nonstationary condition the results show that the uncertainty created due to the choice of the threshold is more under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition it implies that the choice of threshold is more important under the nonstationary condition than the stationary condition consequently a tailor made threshold selection method for nonstationary extreme rainfall series is necessary however in the absence of a tailor made threshold selection method considering a set of threshold values and selecting a threshold that produces extreme rainfall series with maximum increasing trend would reduce the risk in calculating design return level of extreme rainfall under non stationary condition credit authorship contribution statement v agilan conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

4981,recent studies report that the extreme rainfall characteristics in most parts of the globe exhibit temporal non stationarity therefore modeling the nonstationary behavior of extreme rainfall for different water resources applications is vital when modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series previous studies consider a single threshold value in the peaks over threshold pot approach to extract extreme rainfall series however extreme rainfall series extracted with different threshold values may have a different degree of non stationarity consequently it is essential to understand the effect of threshold selection in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series this study aims at quantifying the threshold uncertainty i e uncertainty in extreme rainfall return levels due to the choice of the threshold in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series using the generalized pareto distribution gpd to study the threshold uncertainty extreme rainfall series over india from the india meteorological department s high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily rainfall dataset is used for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series different indices representing four physical processes namely global warming el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and local temperature anomaly are linked with the scale parameter of the gpd uncertainties in extreme rainfall return levels calculated over india indicate that the uncertainty created due to the choice of threshold is 54 higher under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition keywords extreme rainfall frequency analysis generalized pareto distribution non stationary peaks over threshold approach threshold selection 1 introduction flooding is the greatest water related natural disaster known to the human race its human material and ecological costs can be devastating for sustainable development teegavarapu 2012 more than 63 of floods that occurred during the years 1885 2009 are due to heavy extreme rainfall and it indicates that extreme rainfall events are the primary cause of flooding teegavarapu 2012 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2019 consequently modeling the characteristics of extreme rainfall events is indispensable in flood risk management decisions the word extreme may refer to many different things in the climate literature and there is no unique climatological definition for it stephenson 2008 however in the case of precipitation an extreme can be reasonably well defined referring to the values in the tails of the distribution that would be expected to occur infrequently zeng and zwires 2013 the annual maximum and peaks over threshold pot are commonly used approaches to extract extreme quantiles for modeling extreme rainfall many studies use annual maximum series because of its simplicity cheng and aghakouchak 2014 panagoulia et al 2014 dyrrdal et al 2014 paixao et al 2015 sun et al 2015 vasiliades et al 2015 wang et al 2016 rulfová et al 2016 even though the pot approach removes some of the limitations of the annual maximum method it remains underused beguería 2005 the main reason for this is the selection of an appropriate threshold value for extracting extreme rainfall series under the stationary condition i e exceedance probability of an extreme event is assumed to be time invariant beguería 2005 studied the uncertainties in partial duration series modeling of extremes related to the choice of the threshold value and reported that the small changes in the threshold value could cause significant modification on the lower part of the distribution and the minor changes on the left tail of the distribution could lead to significant differences in the estimated parameter on the other hand recent studies report that the extreme rainfall in many parts of the world is increasing day by day and exhibiting nonstationary behavior saidi et al 2015 bartolomeu et al 2016 hanel et al 2016 limsakul and singhruck 2016 zilli et al 2016 consequently many researchers modeled the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall series for the different applications such as developing nonstationary rainfall idf curves developing weather generator for a nonstationary extreme rainfall condition and for attributing the possible reasons for the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall series feng et al 2007 furrer and katz 2008 sugahara et al 2009 beguería et al 2011 villarini et al 2011 vasiliades et al 2015 villafuerte et al 2015 gao et al 2016 mondal and mujumdar 2015 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 similar to stationary condition most of the previous studies that aimed to model the extreme rainfall under nonstationary condition used the annual maximum method to extract extreme rainfall series cheng and aghakouchak 2014 vasiliades et al 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017b 2016 gao et al 2016 and only a few researchers used pot approach to extract extreme rainfall series mondal and mujumdar 2015 yilmaz et al 2014 when modeling extreme rainfall series using the pot approach under nonstationary conditions researchers used a single threshold value to extract extreme rainfall series for example beguería et al 2011 groisman et al 2005 mondal and mujumdar 2015 and gemmer et al 2011 chose the 90th percentile of daily rainfall as the threshold for obtaining extreme rainfall series using the pot approach however it is essential to note that the extreme rainfall series extracted with the different threshold value may have a different magnitude of trend different degree of non stationarity for instance extreme rainfall series extracted with the 95th percentile of rainfall as a threshold may have a steep increasing trend while the extreme rainfall series extracted with the 90th percentile of rainfall as a threshold may have a slight increasing decreasing trend or no trend hence change in threshold value can change the magnitude of the trend in extreme rainfall series or it can even change the sign i e from increasing to decreasing or vice versa consequently different threshold values may suggest different temporal changes in extreme rainfall characteristics therefore this work aims at answering questions like 1 what is the influence of threshold selection in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series 2 will the uncertainty created from the choice of threshold increase under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition till today no attempt has been made to answer these questions therefore this study aims to answer them 2 data 2 1 extreme rainfall data for this study a high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily rainfall dataset from 1901 to 2013 is used this dataset is prepared by the india meteorological department imd and the details about the preparation of this dataset can be obtained from pai et al 2014 this dataset is increasingly being used in studies on indian rainfall pai et al 2015 though the dataset is available from 1901 as the climate change signals are visible only towards the end of the 20th century mondal and mujumdar 2015 and the data density was relatively higher 3100 stations per day pai et al 2014 from 1951 the time period 1951 2013 63 years is considered for the current study to study the influence of threshold selection a set of threshold u values should be selected for each grid point to extract extreme rainfall series using the pot approach it is important to note that there is no globally accepted method for selecting a threshold value scarrott and macdonald 2012 miniussi and marani 2020 and the mean excess plot coles 2001 is widely used for threshold selection under the stationary condition when modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series or analyzing the trends in extreme rainfall series researchers generally prefer to choose the threshold by a standard definition based on the guidelines given in katz et al 2013 i e the threshold should be high enough for the values to be extreme but not so high as to retain only a few points in the analysis for example mondal and mujumdar 2015 chose the 90th percentile of daily rainfall as the threshold for obtaining extreme rainfall series using the pot approach studies that chose the 90th percentile of rainfall as a threshold include but are not limited to beguería et al 2011 groisman et al 2005 and gemmer et al 2011 further some studies chose the 95th percentile of rainfall as a threshold vittal et al 2013 haylock and nicholls 2000 as this study aims to quantify the influence of threshold selection in modeling nonstationary extreme rainfall series extracted using the pot approach there is a need to define a set of possible threshold values for each grid point in this direction the 90th percentile of daily rainfall of the grid is chosen as the starting threshold for each grid point then the threshold value is increased based on the rainfall events which are having an intensity higher than the 90th percentile of daily rainfall of the grid as the pot approach may be superior only if the number of exceedances is more than the sample size of the annual maximum series the end threshold of a grid is defined as the threshold which provides at least 63 sample size of the annual maximum series exceedances after declustering for each threshold value temporal dependence within each extreme rainfall spell should be removed to preserve the independence assumption coles 2001 and this process is termed as declustering consecutive rainy days when the rainfall is higher than the chosen threshold u is an extreme rainfall cluster and they are detached from each other by more than one day when the rainfall is below the chosen threshold towards declustering only the maximum value in each cluster is retained the process of defining a set of possible threshold values for each imd grid point is explained in the following steps the rainfall amount during wet days rainy days having rainfall amount over 1 mm of the grid is fitted with the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf and the 90th percentile rainfall is calculated from the empirical cdf as aforementioned this 90th percentile rainfall is used as the starting threshold value us of the grid all the rainfall values which are greater than us of the grid are extracted and the unique values are sorted in ascending order the threshold ue which provides at least 63 sample size of the annual maximum series exceedances after declustering is calculated now the set of possible threshold values are us all the unique rainfall values between us and ue ue for example if us is 30 mm day ue is 50 mm day and the rainfall values between us and ue are 31 35 35 40 45 45 and 49 mm day then the set of possible threshold values are 30 31 35 40 45 49 and 50 mm day the number of thresholds estimated by this method at each grid point over india is discussed in section 4 2 2 data for covariates for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series extracted with each threshold value discussed in section 2 1 there is a need for identifying a set of possible covariates generally a set of indices that represent the physical processes that are responsible for the nonstationary behavior of extreme rainfall are used as covariates agilan and umamahesh 2017b mondal and mujumdar 2015 in this study the physical processes which show a significant relationship with the indian region extreme rainfall characteristics are chosen based on available literature and previous studies agilan and umamahesh 2017b mondal and mujumdar 2015 global warming is generally considered as the dominant cause of the change in extreme rainfall characteristics agilan and umamahesh 2017b cai et al 2014b therefore indices that represent global warming are considered as covariates for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series particularly near surface temperature anomalies of the hadcrut4 dataset are used as indices that represent global warming these are monthly global temperature anomaly gta northern hemisphere temperature anomaly nta southern hemisphere temperature anomaly sta and tropics 30 deg s to 30 deg n temperature anomaly tta information about these datasets can be obtained at https www metoffice gov

mei ext table ext html accessed on 01 march 2019 there are many studies that show a significant relationship between local temperature changes and extreme rainfall characteristics wasko and sharma 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2015 therefore local temperature anomalies are also considered as covariates for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall particularly three indices namely monthly mean temperature anomaly meta monthly maximum temperature anomaly mata and monthly minimum temperature anomaly mita are calculated for each 0 25 resolution grids rainfall grid resolution from 0 5 resolution cru ts version 4 01 temperature datasets and used as covariates the temperature data is re gridded using bilinear interpolation to get temperature anomaly at 0 25 resolution the details

rao 2008 reported that the extreme rainfall over india has a significant relationship with the indian ocean dipole iod mode and the greenhouse warming is also increasing the frequency of extreme iod events cai et al 2014b therefore an index representing iod is considered as a covariate in modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall the hadisst dataset based monthly dipole mode index dmi saji et al 1999 with lag up to 12 months is used to represent the iod and it is downloaded from http www jamstec go jp frcgc research d1 iod data dmi monthly txt accessed on 15 march 2019 in addition to these physical covariates most of the previous studies allowed the parameters of the distribution to vary linearly with year values when modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series yilmaz and perera 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 consequently standardized year values are used as a covariate which represents the linear trend in summary the indices representing the different physical processes used for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series extracted for each threshold are listed in table 1 note that the covariates used in this study are selected based on the previous studies agilan and umamahesh 2017b mondal and mujumdar 2015 and the availability of data over india therefore it is not the complete list of covariates that can be used to model the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall when the aim is to project the extreme rainfall for the future under non stationary conditions using covariates that have a consistent relationship with extreme rainfall over the entire study area may improve the projection roderick et al 2020 3 modeling non stationarity in the extreme rainfall series this study aims to quantify the influence of threshold selection in modeling nonstationary extreme rainfall series extracted using the pot approach in this section how the non stationarity in extreme rainfall series extracted with a single threshold u is modeled with a single covariate is briefly discussed the methodology adopted to understand the effect of threshold selection is discussed in section 4 extreme rainfall series x x1 x2 xn obtained using the pot approach converges asymptotically to the generalized pareto distribution gpd coles et al 2003 when we model the nonstationary extreme rainfall series we allow the parameters of the distribution to vary with time and the cumulative density function cdf of nonstationary gpd is given by eq 1 1 f x t σ t ξ t u t 1 1 x t u t σ t ξ t 1 ξ t σ t 0 1 x t u t σ t ξ t 0 1 exp x t u t σ t σ t 0 ξ t 0 here shape and scale parameters are denoted by ξ and σ respectively note that the parameters in the eq 1 are time variant and it can be achieved by linking the parameters with time varying covariate s it is theoretically possible to allow all the parameters of the distribution to vary with covariates however it is not suggested to allow the threshold u to vary with time as it creates numerical instabilities in maximization of the likelihood function furrer and katz 2007 also the shape parameter of the distribution is not allowed to vary with covariates as it is difficult to estimate it precisely coles 2001 as a result only the scale parameter of the distribution is allowed to vary with covariate when extreme rainfall series extracted with the pot approach is modeled with the generalized pareto distribution mondal and mujumdar 2015 yilmaz et al 2014 further parameters can be linked with covariates in different ways for example parameters can be allowed to vary with covariate s linearly or non linearly in general if the physical covariates are used to model the non stationarity parameters are allowed to vary linearly with covariates eq 2 shows the general form of allowing the scale parameter of the gpd to vary linearly with a time varying covariate c 2 σ t exp 1 c t σ 0 σ 1 intercept and slope parameters of this linear linking eq 2 are represented by σ 0 and σ 1 respectively since the scale parameter of the gpd cannot take a negative value to ensure the positive value of σ the exponential function is added in eq 2 instead a log function can also be used for the same purpose once the nonstationary parameters and the nonstationary setting the way of linking with covariate are decided the parameters can be estimated using the method of maximum likelihood appendix a the temporal changes in extreme rainfall behavior can be calculated from the constructed nonstationary gpd parameters however the significance of the trend parameter in the nonstationary model needs to be checked before using the nonstationary model as the nonstationary model can be constructed even for the stationary time series which is not correct the likelihood ratio lr appendix b test can be used to evaluate the statistical significance of the trend parameter in the nonstationary model in this study for each extreme rainfall series extracted with a threshold value we have constructed 60 non stationary models refer table 1 and a stationary model when the number of nonstationary models constructed for the given extreme rainfall series i e extreme rainfall series extracted with a threshold value is more than one the lr test can be conducted only for the best nonstationary model instead of repeating the lr test for all nonstationary models for selecting the best model among all models constructed for a given extreme rainfall series the akaike information criterion with small sample size correction aicc is generally used strupczewski et al 2001 and it is given by eq 3 3 aicc 2 log l 2 p 2 p p 1 n p 1 in eq 3 log l denotes the minimized negative log likelihood of the model p and n represent the number of parameters in the model and sample size respectively the model which has the lowest aicc value among all models is considered as the best model for the given time series if the trend parameter in the best nonstationary model is statistically significant the temporal variations of extreme rainfall return level can be calculated using parameters of the best nonstationary model the return levels for a given design return period q year can be estimated using eq 4 coles 2001 it is essential to note that the design probability of exceedance for a given return period is adjusted based on the number of exceedances 4 z q z 1 q z 2 q z n q u exp σ 0 σ 1 c i ξ ϕ q ξ 1 ξ 0 i 1 2 n u exp σ 0 σ 1 c i log ϕ q ξ 0 i 1 2 n 5 ϕ n n here n is the number of years and n is the number of exceedances 4 influence of threshold selection to quantify threshold uncertainty i e uncertainty in extreme rainfall return levels due to the choice of the threshold when modeling nonstationary extreme rainfall series extracted using the pot approach a set of possible threshold values is defined for each imd grid using the method described in section 2 1 the graphical overview of calculating threshold uncertainty of a single imd grid is plotted in fig 1 fig 2 shows the methodology that was adopted to calculate the threshold uncertainty the number of thresholds defined for each grid point over india is plotted in fig 3 a from the considered 4949 grids over india the average number of thresholds used to extract extreme rainfall series is 228 the methodology that was adopted to calculate the threshold uncertainty is discussed in the following steps step 1 for a given grid point extreme rainfall series is extracted using the pot approach with 90th percentile daily rainfall as the threshold step 2 the extreme rainfall series is declustered to preserve the independence assumption see section 2 1 if the number of exceedances is more than 63 sample size of annual maximum series step 3 is carried out otherwise step 1 is started with the next imd grid step 3 for the declustered series in addition to one stationary gpd 60 nonstationary gpds are constructed with the help of covariates discussed in section 2 2 and methodology presented in section 3 step 4 the best nonstationary model for the given extreme rainfall series is identified using the aicc value refer section 3 and the statistical significance of the trend parameter in the best nonstationary model is evaluated using the lr test at the significance level of 0 05 step 5 if the trend parameter in the best nonstationary model is statistically insignificant the extreme rainfall series is considered as a stationary series and the corresponding threshold value is not considered for calculating the threshold uncertainty then extreme rainfall series is extracted with the next possible threshold value and steps 2 6 are carried with new extreme rainfall series of the grid step 6 if the trend parameter of the best nonstationary model is statistically significant the cdfs of nonstationary return levels eq 4 for different design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year are calculated upon calculating the return levels cdfs the next extreme rainfall series of the grid with the next possible threshold value is extracted and steps 2 6 are carried with new extreme rainfall series of the grid the steps 1 to 6 are repeated for all 4949 imd grids over india for calculating the threshold uncertainty at each grid point it is not surprising that not all selected threshold values produced nonstationary extreme rainfall time series the number of thresholds that produced stationary extreme rainfall series is shown in fig 3 b and c shows the number of thresholds that produced nonstationary extreme rainfall series which are used to calculate the threshold uncertainty over india note that the number of thresholds that produced the nonstationary extreme rainfall time series is much higher 256 than the number of thresholds that produced stationary extreme rainfall series further we also observed that 4940 grids out of 4949 have at least one threshold value that produced a nonstationary series it implies that extreme rainfall series over india is mostly nonstationary which was also observed in a previous study mondal and mujumdar 2015 the threshold uncertainty in cdf of nonstationary rainfall return levels calculated for the 10 year design return period of a grid is plotted in fig 4 since it is not possible to show a similar plot for all 4949 grids and all return periods we have used control points t5l t5r t50l t50r t95l and t95r refer fig 4 on the cdf band to quantify the threshold uncertainty over india particularly the following values are calculated for all the grid points and for all design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year 13 t 5 t 5 r t 5 l t 50 t 50 r t 50 l t 95 t 95 r t 95 l here t5l is the 5th percentile lowest nonstationary return level t5r is the 5th percentile highest nonstationary return level t50l is the 50th percentile lowest nonstationary return level t50r is the 50th percentile highest nonstationary return level t95l is the 95th percentile lowest nonstationary return level and t95r is the 95th percentile highest nonstationary return level the definitions of t5l t5r t50l t50r t95l and t95r are with respect to the threshold uncertainty band of a grid refer fig 4 the spatial maps of threshold uncertainty t5 t50 and t95 for all design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year are shown in figs 5 7 respectively the box plots of threshold uncertainty t5 t50 and t95 for all design return periods i e 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year are shown in fig 8 from figs 5 8 it is observed that the threshold uncertainty is more for higher return periods when compared to lower return periods it is also seen that the threshold uncertainty at the 95th percentile of cdf t95 is higher than the threshold uncertainty at the 5th and 50th percentile t5 and t50 further to answer the question will the uncertainty created by choice of threshold increase under nonstationary condition we also modeled the threshold uncertainty under stationary condition in particular extreme rainfall series extracted with all threshold values see section 2 1 and fig 3 a are fitted with the stationary gpd and return levels for all return periods are calculated since the return level for a given return period is a single value for a threshold under the stationary condition the difference between maximum and minimum return level with respect to all threshold values is calculated for all return periods and grid points these differences are the uncertainty in the return levels due to the choice of threshold under the stationary condition the spatial maps of threshold uncertainty when the extreme rainfall series are modeled under the stationary condition in extreme rainfall return levels of 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year return period is plotted in fig 9 the box plots of threshold uncertainty under the stationary condition are shown in fig 10 generally the probability density function pdf of gpd obtained from the 50th percentile of nonstationary gpd parameters will be nearly equivalent to the pdf of gpd obtained from the stationary gpd parameters agilan and umamahesh 2017a therefore the threshold uncertainty calculated under the stationary condition figs 9 and 10 is compared with the t50 figs 6 and 8 b from the results it is calculated that the uncertainty created due to the choice of threshold is 54 average value for entire india and all return periods higher under the nonstationary condition when compared to modeling extreme rainfall under the stationary assumption further both in stationary and nonstationary conditions the uncertainty in return level due to the choice of threshold is more for higher return periods when compared to lower return periods 5 summary we studied the influence of threshold selection in modeling peaks over threshold based nonstationary extreme rainfall series using the generalized pareto distribution extreme rainfall series over india from 63 years 1951 2013 of india meteorological department s high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily rainfall dataset comprises of 4949 grid points is used to study the threshold uncertainty for each grid point a set of possible threshold values starting from the 90th percentile daily rainfall of the grid are first identified for the analysis once extreme rainfall series are extracted for each grid point based on the identified threshold values for the gird 60 nonstationary models and one stationary model is constructed for each extreme rainfall series however extreme rainfall series corresponding to different threshold values for which at least one statistically significant nonstationary model is available are used to study the threshold uncertainty of that grid further only the best nonstationary model out of 60 nonstationary models for the corresponding extreme rainfall series is used for modeling non stationarity in extreme rainfall series different indices representing four physical processes namely global warming enso iod and local temperature anomaly are linked with the scale parameter of the gpd the uncertainties in extreme rainfall return levels calculated over india indicate that the uncertainty created due to the choice of threshold in modeling pot based extreme rainfall is 54 higher under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition for calculating threshold uncertainty under the stationary condition we have used all the threshold values which gives at least 63 exceedances after declustering for calculating the threshold uncertainty under the nonstationary condition only the threshold values which produced nonstationary extreme rainfall series are considered consequently the number of thresholds used to calculate threshold uncertainty under the stationary condition is higher than those that were used under the nonstationary condition the results show that the uncertainty created due to the choice of the threshold is more under the nonstationary condition when compared to the stationary condition it implies that the choice of threshold is more important under the nonstationary condition than the stationary condition consequently a tailor made threshold selection method for nonstationary extreme rainfall series is necessary however in the absence of a tailor made threshold selection method considering a set of threshold values and selecting a threshold that produces extreme rainfall series with maximum increasing trend would reduce the risk in calculating design return level of extreme rainfall under non stationary condition credit authorship contribution statement v agilan conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

4982,toxic cyanobacteria blooms such as anabaena aphanizomenon microcystis and oscillatoria are of critical concern for public health and environmental system globally an algal bloom is largely influenced by factors that jointly characterize the climatology e g water temperature hydraulics e g water velocity and nutrient concentrations e g phosphorus and nitrogen while a wide range of efforts has been made to predict a cyanobacterial bloom there is still a need for computational tools to characterize the bloom concentration effectively here we present a short term cyanobacteria forecasting model that not only predicts the occurrences of algal bloom but also provides their concentration conditional on the selected dominant environmental variables the prediction model operates in two stages in the first stage cyanobacterial occurrences are predicted using a first order markov model conditioned on a few selected environmental variables on occasions where a cyanobacterial occurrence is predicted the second stage predicts cyanobacterial cell counts again conditional on the selected environmental variables in an application using data for four major rivers in south korea a minimum threat score of 0 56 56 forecasting accuracy with a single environmental variable temperature is attained this simple model provides one week ahead probabilistic prediction of cyanobacteria occurrence and cell concentration making it easier to prioritize proactive measures based on the probability changes caused by relevant changes in the conditioning environmental variables keywords cyanobacterial bloom river probabilistic model markov chain stochastic sampling kernel density estimation 1 introduction the manifestation of an active cyanobacterial bloom has been a critical issue in the operation and maintenance of water systems worldwide brooks et al 2016 haakonsson et al 2020 hallegraeff 1993 paerl and huisman 2008 cyanobacteria is believed to be one of the first organisms to spread across the earth herrero et al 2008 and is known to recur when conditions are favorable anneville et al 2015 paerl and ustach 1982 in addition to its unattractive appearance and smelly odor cyanobacterial bloom worsens quality of water and generates toxins which can negatively impact humans and animals fleming et al 2002 huisman et al 2018 for instance liver and kidney can be damaged by direct ingestion of water contaminated with cyanobacteria an impact that occurs with humans and animals alike yunes 2019 unexpected outbreaks rare number of events and site specific characteristics present some of the obstacles in predicting algae accurately in advance as a result of which water authorities have mainly adopted follow up empirical approaches for prediction after the cyanobacterial bloom reaches a certain level with the increasing frequency of cyanobacterial blooms around the world glibert et al 2005 considerable research has gone into identifying drivers for both cyanobacteria outbreaks and propagation and formulating effective forecasting models although the specific conditions that lead to an algal bloom may be location or also event dependent it has been established that algal blooms are dominantly affected by some common conditions characterizing the climatology e g temperature and radiation hydraulics e g retention time and water velocity and nutrient concentrations e g nitrogen and phosphorus of the water system fornarelli et al 2013 o keeffe 2019 obenour et al 2014 paerl and otten 2013 kim et al 2020b studied data from south korea and concluded that out of dominant environmental variables water temperature is the most important factor for algal bloom growth this is in line with the findings of cha et al 2017 who also found that temperature and retention time are the key factors for algal bloom formation in korea the literature reports a variety of studies to develop forecasting models for cyanobacteria occurrences based on location specific process drivers mcgillicuddy 2010 analyzed various predictive models which loosely fall into the category of conceptual empirical and numerical models while numerical or dynamical models attempt to simulate the physics that leads to cyanobacterial evolution conceptual models characterize the evolution through a simplified data driven statistical stochastic model form that requires model parameters to be calibrated using observed data empirical models assume a causal relationship between the response and the process drivers but often use the data alone for characterization of the modelled response empirical models based on the artificial neural network have been developed and applied to forecast cyanobacteria occurrence and growth conditional on environmental variables such as temperature ph phosphorus and nitrogen bowden et al 2005a 2005b guzel 2019 may et al 2008 pyo et al 2020 sen et al 2018 srisuksomwong and pekkoh 2019 to avoid the time lag problem of the availability of real time algal bloom information ibelings et al 2003 used a modeling approach based on long term weather forecasts to predict surface water bloom formation they combined traditional numerical modeling based on differential equations with an expert system based on fuzzy logic zhang et al 2013 coupled the near real time remotely sensed algal bloom information with process based models to forecast bloom behavior over a period of days to weeks similarly cha et al 2014 used a bayesian hurdle poisson model to identify the conditions that affect the abundance of cyanobacteria relative to other phytoplankton and developed a model for cyanobacteria prediction zhao and huang 2014 identified significant environmental factors influencing cyanobacterial bloom occurrence using two probit models for short term forecasts of bloom occurrence in the hill dagong water area of lake tai in china lee and lee 2018 yi et al 2018 applied artificial neural network based machine learning techniques to predict chlorophyll a as a surrogate of cyanobacteria concentration in rivers in korea kim et al 2020b presented a binary forecasting model focusing on the occurrence or non occurrence of cyanobacteria in rivers in korea they used three dominant environmental factors to define bacterial growth in a dynamic manner apart from these empirical predictive models physical models for example environmental fluid dynamics code efdc a multidimensional water modelling system including hydrodynamic sediment contaminant and eutrophication components and ce qual w2 a water quality and hydrodynamic model for rivers estuaries lakes reservoirs and river basin systems represent conventional physical numerical models for water quality that have also been applied to this problem he et al 2011 although such physical models are shown to capture well the observed response in their study regions well they cannot be easily extended to other parts of the world because they require extensive data el shafie et al 2014 and fine tuning fitting of model parameters likewise although the binary predictive models are simple to implement and can easily be extended to other regions these can only predict bloom occurrence nonoccurrence and are of limited assistance when the aim is to control bloom concentration through engineering controls such as upstream water releases keeping these limitations in mind the present study proposes a probabilistic forecasting model for cyanobacteria concentration to assist with risk based management of the bloom by water authorities who can modulate pertinent environmental control variables the proposed model not only forecasts the occurrence probability of cyanobacteria but also provides quantitative forecasts using only a few environmental variables being simple and effective the model can be used for assessing proactive measures for the cyanobacterial bloom control by evaluating the changes in the probability distribution by adjusting environmental factors the model proposed here provides a one week ahead probabilistic forecast of cyanobacteria using the current values of cyanobacteria concentration and identified environmental predictors the model provides a one week ahead probabilistic forecast of cyanobacteria using the current values of cyanobacteria concentration and identified environmental predictors this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the datasets and the proposed probabilistic modelling framework are described section 3 explains and discusses the results obtained by using the proposed model finally in section 4 conclusions of this study are presented 2 data and method 2 1 study area and data this study uses data from the four major rivers of south

four distinct seasons spring summer autumn and winter in south korea belonging to east asian monsoonal region as a result of its geographical setting the region experiences a temperate climate savada and shaw 1997 the country has four major rivers han nakdong geum and yeongsan which most of the korean population and industries rely on as major water sources the overall catchment area of four rivers which cover almost 63 of south korea is about 63 016 km2 south korea ministry of environment 2003 with environmental and climatological conditions not significantly different to each other the selection of environmental variables is crucial and sensitive in our modelling strategy in an earlier study kim et al 2020b found four environmental variables t water temperature p total phosphorous n total nitrogen and v flow velocity as significant predictors of cyanobacteria occurrence in south korean rivers this study utilizes weekly water quality data for six years from january 2013 to december 2018 obtained from the water environment information system http water nier go kr run by the ministry of environment of south korea south korea ministry of environment 2012 in detail the datasets used in this study consist of observed measurements of water temperature t c total phosphorus p mg l total nitrogen n mg l cyanobacterial cell count c total number of cells ml and water flow rate m3 sec at 16 stations of these rivers fig 1a the minimum distance between two stations is 20 km and the environmental factors like velocity nutrient vary over the locations because of diverse elevations cross sections velocities and inflows from adjoining locations according to the types of data released in south korea the number of cyanobacteria cells denotes the overall cell counts sum of cell counts of the four toxic cyanobacteria species anabaena aphanizomenon microcystis and oscillatoria which are categorized into cyanobacterial toxins bartram and chorus 1999 creating a negative impact on the liver or nervous system according to world health organization 2001 nevertheless it should be noted that every cyanobacteria species acts differently and prefers different environmental conditions the measured water flow rate m3 sec is converted to water velocity m sec using hec ras model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system brunner 1995 which requires regular interval cross section roughness of each section and water flow rate to estimate mean cross sectional velocity at measurement points physical data such as cross sections and roughness are collected from the national river management plan of 2015 han river flood control office 2018 updated every five years for all korean major rivers by the south korea government mean daily flow rate of every measuring spots are collected from the mywater managed by k water state owned company in south korea https www water or kr 2 2 methodology cyanobacteria evolution proceeds through interaction with a variety of variables that constantly change in time and space making it difficult to physically model cyanobacterial occurrence and growth however one can simplify the relationship by casting this evolution in a probabilistic setting markov models are frequently used to synthesize the evidence available for any process finding uses in nearly every discipline as a result they assume that the random variable exhibits a finite order of dependence on its past occurrences an assumption that is often adapted by invoking exogenous variables that modulate the markovian process following this we propose a markov model of cyanobacteria growth which takes into account cyanobacteria concentration and associated exogenous factors the major factors that influence the growth of cyanobacteria are temperature velocity and the nutrient composition of the suspending medium transition probabilities of a markov model express the likelihood of cyanobacteria growth to change from one state to another the model described here is intended to provide a weekly probabilistic forecast of the cyanobacteria occurrence and concentration based on the cyanobacteria count and values of environmental variables at the previous time step thus the model can be considered as a short term probabilistic forecasting model the model ascertains the probability distribution of the one timestep ahead cyanobacterial occurrence or concentration characterizing the random variable as a markov chain and expressing its probability distribution using kernel density estimation kde the key reasoning for adopting markovian dependence originates from the bacterial growth mechanism which imparts cyanobacterial growth as a clear function of its preceding state kim et al 2020a 2020b tortora et al 2004 the kernel density estimation kde procedure is a non parametric means to define the probability density using a finite data sample used here to express the conditional probability distribution of cyanobacterial concentration in the approach outlined below cyanobacteria occurrences and counts are generated separately at each time step the probability of cyanobacteria occurrences in occurrence model is generated using a 1st order markov model conditional on the previous time step values of exogenous variables environmental variables in our case here and cell count of cyanobacteria on occasions where the occurrence model predicts an event the cell count or cyanobacterial concentration is ascertained using kde again conditional on previous time step values of exogenous predictors and cyanobacteria concentration the details of the occurrence and count stages of the model are presented next 2 2 1 cyanobacteria occurrence model hereinafter we denote a cyanobacterial occurrence amount at time t as ct and at the qth time step prior to the current as ct q it should be noted that the same notation ct is used both for cyanobacterial occurrence and amount and should be taken in the context of the issue being addressed also both single variables and parameters are defined as non bold while both multi variable vectors and matrices are presented as bold characters or symbols the cyanobacteria forecasting model can be viewed as the conditional prediction of ct z t 1 where z t 1 serves as a vector of variables at a given location at time t 1 and includes exogenous environmental control variables x t 1 along with cyanobacterial count occurrence c t 1 at the preceding time step the parameters in case of a binary response the transition probabilities of a first order markov model are defined by p c t c t 1 when z t 1 consists of c t 1 alone however if the conditioning vector z t 1 includes additional predictors x t 1 these transition probabilities would modify as p c t ct 1 x t 1 to estimate p c t ct 1 x t 1 the following parameterization is applied mehrotra and sharma 2007 1 p c t 1 c t 1 i x t 1 p c t 1 c t 1 i x t 1 p c t 1 i x t 1 f x t 1 c t 1 c t 1 i p c t 1 c t 1 i f x

subsets of the given cyanobacterial series and by calculating the conditional probabilities means variances and covariances for example μ 1 i is the mean of a subset of data formed by pooling out weeks when there is cyanobacteria occurrence noted ct 1000 for the cases where the assumption of a multivariate normal is violated conditional probability densities f xt 1 ct ct 1 and f xt 1 ct 1 of eq 1 may be estimated either using nonparametric alternatives for instance kernel density estimation or adopting more appropriate probability distributions for this study the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution is adopted 2 2 2 cyanobacterial count model the number of cyanobacterial count should be predicted for each time step by the occurrence model as an event the cyanobacterial count model is based on the kernel density procedure defined in previous studies harrold et al 2003 mehrotra and sharma 2007 sharma 2000 sharma and o neill 2002 sharma et al 1997 the model structure description described here is adopted from the above publications and is reproduced here for the sake of convenience of the readers the model is mentioned hereafter as the kernel density estimation kde model similar to the occurrence model the kde predicts the number of cyanobacterial counts conditional on the values of cyanobacteria count and the environmental variables at the preceding time step let the cyanobacterial count at time t be ct the conditioning vector be x t consisting of q predictor variables the conditional density estimates for week t for a multivariate gaussian kernel can be written as 3 f c t x t 1 i 1 n 1 2 π λ 2 s 1 2 w i e x p c t b i 2 2 λ 2 s where f ct x t 1 is the calculated conditional multivariate probability density for week t which is defined as a weighted sum of n gaussian density functions with bi mean and λ 2 s covariance here n is the total number of observations and s is a spread measure of the conditional density calculated as 4 s s rr s xr t s xx 1 s xr the covariance of ct x t 1 is defined as 5 c o v c t x t 1 s rr s xr t s xr s xx the contributed portion of each kernel in building the conditional probability density

2007 and sharma and o neill 2002 2 2 3 predictor sets with combinations of environmental variables in a so called leave one out validation framework we develop calibrate the model using data for 15 stations and test validate the developed model on the left out station this process is repeated 16 times by rotating the left out station to obtain the cross validated predictions at all 16 stations in addition at each time step 1000 predictions are made to form a probabilistic forecast at that time step in order to select an optimal set of predictors we form multiple predictor sets using all possible combinations of these four environmental variables e g m1 tpv m2 tv and m15 p as shown in fig 3 and use them to both occurrence and count models to predict the cyanobacteria occurrence probability and concentration and evaluate the results to quantitatively evaluate the performances of these predictor sets we apply a 2 2 contingency table wilks 2011 on the weekly forecasts both occurrence and count of our prediction model m 1 or 0 to assess if it matches with the observations o 1 or 0 therefore it is composed of four scalars hit m 1 and o 1 denoted as a false alarm m 1 and o 0 denoted as b miss m 0 and o 1 denoted as c and correct rejection m 0 and o 0 denoted as d while the occurrence calculation is performed based on the overall observed dataset count concentration is calculated on the reduced datasets where occurrence of cyanobacteria is noted i e o 1 for the occurrence assessment in fig 2 a for example a hit a is identified if the probability of occurrence model at a given time step is 50 out of 1000 forecasts i e m 1 and the observed cyanobacterial cell count also exceeds the threshold i e o 1 in the count assessment in fig 2b a hit a is captured when the observed cyanobacterial cell count is within the interquartile range of forecasting distribution formed from the 1000 forecasts at a certain time step here the threshold is defined as 1000 cells ml based on south korean government s algal alert system in place since 1997 srivastava et al 2015 we adopt two scores to evaluate the performance of cyanobacteria occurrences forecasts these are the proportional correct pc and threat score ts pc in eq 8 is the most direct and intuitive measure of the accuracy of a forecast for discrete events although pc is straightforward to calculate for rarer events like cyanobacterial bloom occurrences in our case about 18 6 event rate 932 out of 4992 datasets the score is significantly influenced by the large number of non events and inflates the model performance therefore ts is selected to complement the limitation of pc since it does not consider the correct rejections d in the calculations eq 9 perfect score of both metrics is 1 and the worst value is 0 8 p c a d a b c d 9 t s a a b c for the count assessment we use ts only as there is no d element in count assessment and therefore pc can t be calculated in addition to this for the count assessment we also calculate root mean square error rmse as an additional measure of the differences between the observed and forecast cell counts and defined it as 10 r m s e i 1 n o i s med i 2 n where o i is the observed cyanobacterial cell count and s med is the median value of model forecast at time step i 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis with controllable predictors in addition to estimating pc ts and rmse a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of individual environmental variables on the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence a predictor set consisting of temperature and velocity variables is selected for this sensitivity analysis since these variables could be controlled by external operations generally temperature of water at higher elevation is lower than at low elevations similarly water temperature of upstream dam is lower than that of downstream due to its geological location by releasing water from the upstream dam and by operating the weir gate instantaneously temperature and velocity can be varied in a controlled manner to possibly create unfavorable conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria to understand better how the occurrence model reacts when these environmental variables change three cases are assessed in the first two cases the changes in the occurrence probability are noted when temperature and velocity are reduced by a unit standard deviation 1σ 8 4 c 0 25 m s separately even though dropping water temperature by 8 4 c does not seem to be realistic data does exhibit these variations and it would help to visualize easily how the model reacts when a variable is modified in the last case these two variables are reduced together by one standard deviation results from these and other assessments are presented next 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation the modeled results and those obtained from the sensitivity analysis of parameters are presented in fig 3a and in table s1 of the supporting information hereafter the prefix s for figures and tables indicate those in the supporting information in addition fig s2 shows time series of predicted and observed cyanobacteria concentration over three representative stations gongju seungchon and gangjung in fig 3a the subscripts o and c in the description of pc and ts scores respectively represent the occurrence and count models all results represent validation performance using the leave one out cross validation procedure outlined before overall all datasets exhibit equally good performances except a few instances where these scores are low for example all datasets achieve a pc score of 0 86 at a minimum however as mentioned in section 2 2 3 many non bloom events about 81 3 of non event result in high score of correct rejections d i e non bloom in both observation and model leading to an inflated pc score as ts ignores the correct rejection term the score was lower than pc with an averaged value close to 0 50 except for three datasets p v nv and pv fig 3 when comparing the performances of the four single variable datasets i e t n v or p water temperature t comes up as the most dominant variable amongst the four for both occurrence and count models it shows comparable performance against datasets consisting of two or more variables fig 3 this finding highlights the importance of water temperature in the formulation of any predictive model cha et al 2017 kim et al 2020b the performance of datasets t and tn p and pv n and pn are almost identical probably because of the high joint dependence of the two variables considered pearson correlation coefficients are 0 45 between t and n 0 32 between p and n and 0 31 between v with p respectably finally tpv produces the best results whereas both tpn and tpnv less perform following these results the use of either tpv tn or tv dataset is likely to be recommended depending on the availability of data overall by including probabilistic results this model enables users to make a risk based decision in addition the model can also be viewed as an improved water quality model because it not only provides probabilistic output occurrence probability but also a deterministic count of cyanobacteria median value of count that physical models normally aim to simulate while a physical model requires considerable amount of time for calibration and running with large data requirements to specify current boundary and initial conditions the proposed model does a similar job with a few environmental variables and with a reasonable accuracy as a result of the model performance water authorities in the study area can benefit from various aspects such as simple and reliable forecasting evaluation of proactive measures and most influential environmental factors 3 2 tpv dataset performance conditional to preceding cyanobacterial count in this section we evaluate the predictive performance of the forecasting model under varying cyanobacteria concentration conditions to assess the stability of the approach we select the tpv dataset because it provides a more consistent performance across various conditions compared to other groups of datasets we divide the whole data into subsets based on cyanobacteria cell counts for the preceding time step for example ct 1 1000 in fig 3b means the subset when the cyanobacterial bloom did not happen at the preceding time step likewise ct 1 ct denotes the subset when the current cyanobacterial cell count is greater than the one in the preceding time step since calculating ts does not include correct rejections d occupying a high portion of the forecasting cases we only consider ts to provide an indication of model behavior under varying conditions overall the occurrence model performs well when ct 1 1 000 cells ml because it is based on first order markovian dependence with that threshold being used on the other hand a poor result is obtained when ct 1 1000 cells ml this is because of a relatively large number of false alarms b in calculating ts eq 9 specifically about 80 of total observed cell counts in this group showed greater than zero but 1000 cells ml because of which ts is likely to be higher if the threshold 1000 cells ml is lowered in the count model the tpv exhibits a good performance with fewer deviations across the cases 3 3 influence of controlled environmental variables on the model outcome in order to understand the influence of the externally controlled environmental variables on the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence sensitivity analysis is performed using the tv data alone this follows the reasoning that it is possible to control water temperature and velocity to some extent by releasing the water from upstream storages where feasible the change in probability resulting from changing the t v and both together as boxplots is presented in fig s1 by dropping temperature by one standard deviation 1σ 8 4 c occurrence probability decreases by about 19 median value on the other hand occurrence probability is reduced by about 7 median value by increasing the velocity by one standard deviation when changes in these two variables are applied together the occurrence probability drops by about 24 these results suggest that temperature is more effective than velocity and varying both variables together is much more effective in controlling the cyanobacteria occurrence 3 4 caveats and follow up studies this study used four easily assessable environmental variables water temperature t total phosphorus p total nitrogen n and flow velocity v our results show that all of them influence the occurrence and concentration of cyanobacterial blooms to a varying degree however other factors such as turbidity ph salinity irradiance electric conductivity can also influence the cyanobacteria occurrence these variables are not considered in the present study for the sake of simplicity and unavailability of data remote sensing information can also be used as a surrogate to supplement the ground information needed to study the cyanobacteria occurrence and concentration for example teta et al 2017 showed that remote sensing can be applied to identify initial cyanobacterial bloom by combining with aerial and in situ data in this study we assumed that the environmental conditions leading to cyanobacterial growth do not change across space within the study area this assumption is based on the relatively small spatial extent of the study area around 100 000 km2 where the environmental and climatological conditions do not vary significantly in space however it should be noted that the conditions of environmental variables that trigger algal bloom might differ depending on the regions or event since each location or outbreak has a unique and native environmental control if enough data is available this framework should ideally be applied separately to each location especially so if climatic and land use conditions are markedly different from each other the weekly time step applied in the model framework follows the weekly data sampling interval adopted by south korea south korea ministry of environment 2012 using data at finer temporal resolutions is expected to further improve the model performance the frequency of sampling is dictated by a number of factors including indented use the cost of monitoring the season and the growth rate of the cyanobacteria the guidance manual of global water research coalition newcombe 2012 recommends that sampling for high risk high security supplies i e drinking supplies should occur on at least a weekly basis and probably twice weekly when cyanobacterial count of 2000 cells ml is reached for supplies where the public health risk is deemed to be low i e low cell counts in non supply reservoirs fortnightly sampling may be adequate as duration of cyanobacterial blooms is usually greater than a month in temperate zones cyanobacteria can last 2 4 months whereas in tropical and subtropical regions they can continue all year round a weekly sampling interval is expected to provide a good idea of the cyanobacteria growth behavior sivonen and jones 1999 4 conclusion this paper demonstrated the applicability of a probabilistic short term forecasting model for cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and count the model works in two parts prediction of cyanobacteria occurrence and simulation of cyanobacteria counts following a positive simulation of occurrence the occurrence model simulates cyanobacterial bloom using a first order markov model conditional on environmental variables cyanobacterial counts are simulated based on a first order conditional kernel density based model results of a sensitivity analysis conducted using various combinations of four environmental control variables suggest tpv tn and tv as sets of optimal environmental variables for prediction of cyanobacteria over the study region a minimum pc score of 0 86 and conditional ts of 0 5 capturing rare occurrence events and stable results across various conditions and stations consolidate the performance of the proposed model the novel elements of this research include the idea of modelling the cyanobacteria growth rate conditional on the previous state of cyanobacteria occurrence and environmental variables under a markovian assumption water temperature is found to be the most dominant variable in the cyanobacteria predictions followed by the nutrients such as n and p the results of sensitivity analysis can help in identifying appropriate proactive measure required to control the cyanobacteria occurrence although the model is developed and applied using the data for south korea the logic adopted and the model structure followed is quite generic and it can easily be extended to other areas depending on the availability of environmental data care should however be taken to assess whether the same environmental control variables

4982,toxic cyanobacteria blooms such as anabaena aphanizomenon microcystis and oscillatoria are of critical concern for public health and environmental system globally an algal bloom is largely influenced by factors that jointly characterize the climatology e g water temperature hydraulics e g water velocity and nutrient concentrations e g phosphorus and nitrogen while a wide range of efforts has been made to predict a cyanobacterial bloom there is still a need for computational tools to characterize the bloom concentration effectively here we present a short term cyanobacteria forecasting model that not only predicts the occurrences of algal bloom but also provides their concentration conditional on the selected dominant environmental variables the prediction model operates in two stages in the first stage cyanobacterial occurrences are predicted using a first order markov model conditioned on a few selected environmental variables on occasions where a cyanobacterial occurrence is predicted the second stage predicts cyanobacterial cell counts again conditional on the selected environmental variables in an application using data for four major rivers in south korea a minimum threat score of 0 56 56 forecasting accuracy with a single environmental variable temperature is attained this simple model provides one week ahead probabilistic prediction of cyanobacteria occurrence and cell concentration making it easier to prioritize proactive measures based on the probability changes caused by relevant changes in the conditioning environmental variables keywords cyanobacterial bloom river probabilistic model markov chain stochastic sampling kernel density estimation 1 introduction the manifestation of an active cyanobacterial bloom has been a critical issue in the operation and maintenance of water systems worldwide brooks et al 2016 haakonsson et al 2020 hallegraeff 1993 paerl and huisman 2008 cyanobacteria is believed to be one of the first organisms to spread across the earth herrero et al 2008 and is known to recur when conditions are favorable anneville et al 2015 paerl and ustach 1982 in addition to its unattractive appearance and smelly odor cyanobacterial bloom worsens quality of water and generates toxins which can negatively impact humans and animals fleming et al 2002 huisman et al 2018 for instance liver and kidney can be damaged by direct ingestion of water contaminated with cyanobacteria an impact that occurs with humans and animals alike yunes 2019 unexpected outbreaks rare number of events and site specific characteristics present some of the obstacles in predicting algae accurately in advance as a result of which water authorities have mainly adopted follow up empirical approaches for prediction after the cyanobacterial bloom reaches a certain level with the increasing frequency of cyanobacterial blooms around the world glibert et al 2005 considerable research has gone into identifying drivers for both cyanobacteria outbreaks and propagation and formulating effective forecasting models although the specific conditions that lead to an algal bloom may be location or also event dependent it has been established that algal blooms are dominantly affected by some common conditions characterizing the climatology e g temperature and radiation hydraulics e g retention time and water velocity and nutrient concentrations e g nitrogen and phosphorus of the water system fornarelli et al 2013 o keeffe 2019 obenour et al 2014 paerl and otten 2013 kim et al 2020b studied data from south korea and concluded that out of dominant environmental variables water temperature is the most important factor for algal bloom growth this is in line with the findings of cha et al 2017 who also found that temperature and retention time are the key factors for algal bloom formation in korea the literature reports a variety of studies to develop forecasting models for cyanobacteria occurrences based on location specific process drivers mcgillicuddy 2010 analyzed various predictive models which loosely fall into the category of conceptual empirical and numerical models while numerical or dynamical models attempt to simulate the physics that leads to cyanobacterial evolution conceptual models characterize the evolution through a simplified data driven statistical stochastic model form that requires model parameters to be calibrated using observed data empirical models assume a causal relationship between the response and the process drivers but often use the data alone for characterization of the modelled response empirical models based on the artificial neural network have been developed and applied to forecast cyanobacteria occurrence and growth conditional on environmental variables such as temperature ph phosphorus and nitrogen bowden et al 2005a 2005b guzel 2019 may et al 2008 pyo et al 2020 sen et al 2018 srisuksomwong and pekkoh 2019 to avoid the time lag problem of the availability of real time algal bloom information ibelings et al 2003 used a modeling approach based on long term weather forecasts to predict surface water bloom formation they combined traditional numerical modeling based on differential equations with an expert system based on fuzzy logic zhang et al 2013 coupled the near real time remotely sensed algal bloom information with process based models to forecast bloom behavior over a period of days to weeks similarly cha et al 2014 used a bayesian hurdle poisson model to identify the conditions that affect the abundance of cyanobacteria relative to other phytoplankton and developed a model for cyanobacteria prediction zhao and huang 2014 identified significant environmental factors influencing cyanobacterial bloom occurrence using two probit models for short term forecasts of bloom occurrence in the hill dagong water area of lake tai in china lee and lee 2018 yi et al 2018 applied artificial neural network based machine learning techniques to predict chlorophyll a as a surrogate of cyanobacteria concentration in rivers in korea kim et al 2020b presented a binary forecasting model focusing on the occurrence or non occurrence of cyanobacteria in rivers in korea they used three dominant environmental factors to define bacterial growth in a dynamic manner apart from these empirical predictive models physical models for example environmental fluid dynamics code efdc a multidimensional water modelling system including hydrodynamic sediment contaminant and eutrophication components and ce qual w2 a water quality and hydrodynamic model for rivers estuaries lakes reservoirs and river basin systems represent conventional physical numerical models for water quality that have also been applied to this problem he et al 2011 although such physical models are shown to capture well the observed response in their study regions well they cannot be easily extended to other parts of the world because they require extensive data el shafie et al 2014 and fine tuning fitting of model parameters likewise although the binary predictive models are simple to implement and can easily be extended to other regions these can only predict bloom occurrence nonoccurrence and are of limited assistance when the aim is to control bloom concentration through engineering controls such as upstream water releases keeping these limitations in mind the present study proposes a probabilistic forecasting model for cyanobacteria concentration to assist with risk based management of the bloom by water authorities who can modulate pertinent environmental control variables the proposed model not only forecasts the occurrence probability of cyanobacteria but also provides quantitative forecasts using only a few environmental variables being simple and effective the model can be used for assessing proactive measures for the cyanobacterial bloom control by evaluating the changes in the probability distribution by adjusting environmental factors the model proposed here provides a one week ahead probabilistic forecast of cyanobacteria using the current values of cyanobacteria concentration and identified environmental predictors the model provides a one week ahead probabilistic forecast of cyanobacteria using the current values of cyanobacteria concentration and identified environmental predictors this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the datasets and the proposed probabilistic modelling framework are described section 3 explains and discusses the results obtained by using the proposed model finally in section 4 conclusions of this study are presented 2 data and method 2 1 study area and data this study uses data from the four major rivers of south korea to illustrate the proposed modelling approach as shown in fig 1 a the study area is located in the southern part of the korean peninsula latitude 33 n 39 n and longitude 124 e 130 e there are four distinct seasons spring summer autumn and winter in south korea belonging to east asian monsoonal region as a result of its geographical setting the region experiences a temperate climate savada and shaw 1997 the country has four major rivers han nakdong geum and yeongsan which most of the korean population and industries rely on as major water sources the overall catchment area of four rivers which cover almost 63 of south korea is about 63 016 km2 south korea ministry of environment 2003 with environmental and climatological conditions not significantly different to each other the selection of environmental variables is crucial and sensitive in our modelling strategy in an earlier study kim et al 2020b found four environmental variables t water temperature p total phosphorous n total nitrogen and v flow velocity as significant predictors of cyanobacteria occurrence in south korean rivers this study utilizes weekly water quality data for six years from january 2013 to december 2018 obtained from the water environment information system http water nier go kr run by the ministry of environment of south korea south korea ministry of environment 2012 in detail the datasets used in this study consist of observed measurements of water temperature t c total phosphorus p mg l total nitrogen n mg l cyanobacterial cell count c total number of cells ml and water flow rate m3 sec at 16 stations of these rivers fig 1a the minimum distance between two stations is 20 km and the environmental factors like velocity nutrient vary over the locations because of diverse elevations cross sections velocities and inflows from adjoining locations according to the types of data released in south korea the number of cyanobacteria cells denotes the overall cell counts sum of cell counts of the four toxic cyanobacteria species anabaena aphanizomenon microcystis and oscillatoria which are categorized into cyanobacterial toxins bartram and chorus 1999 creating a negative impact on the liver or nervous system according to world health organization 2001 nevertheless it should be noted that every cyanobacteria species acts differently and prefers different environmental conditions the measured water flow rate m3 sec is converted to water velocity m sec using hec ras model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system brunner 1995 which requires regular interval cross section roughness of each section and water flow rate to estimate mean cross sectional velocity at measurement points physical data such as cross sections and roughness are collected from the national river management plan of 2015 han river flood control office 2018 updated every five years for all korean major rivers by the south korea government mean daily flow rate of every measuring spots are collected from the mywater managed by k water state owned company in south korea https www water or kr 2 2 methodology cyanobacteria evolution proceeds through interaction with a variety of variables that constantly change in time and space making it difficult to physically model cyanobacterial occurrence and growth however one can simplify the relationship by casting this evolution in a probabilistic setting markov models are frequently used to synthesize the evidence available for any process finding uses in nearly every discipline as a result they assume that the random variable exhibits a finite order of dependence on its past occurrences an assumption that is often adapted by invoking exogenous variables that modulate the markovian process following this we propose a markov model of cyanobacteria growth which takes into account cyanobacteria concentration and associated exogenous factors the major factors that influence the growth of cyanobacteria are temperature velocity and the nutrient composition of the suspending medium transition probabilities of a markov model express the likelihood of cyanobacteria growth to change from one state to another the model described here is intended to provide a weekly probabilistic forecast of the cyanobacteria occurrence and concentration based on the cyanobacteria count and values of environmental variables at the previous time step thus the model can be considered as a short term probabilistic forecasting model the model ascertains the probability distribution of the one timestep ahead cyanobacterial occurrence or concentration characterizing the random variable as a markov chain and expressing its probability distribution using kernel density estimation kde the key reasoning for adopting markovian dependence originates from the bacterial growth mechanism which imparts cyanobacterial growth as a clear function of its preceding state kim et al 2020a 2020b tortora et al 2004 the kernel density estimation kde procedure is a non parametric means to define the probability density using a finite data sample used here to express the conditional probability distribution of cyanobacterial concentration in the approach outlined below cyanobacteria occurrences and counts are generated separately at each time step the probability of cyanobacteria occurrences in occurrence model is generated using a 1st order markov model conditional on the previous time step values of exogenous variables environmental variables in our case here and cell count of cyanobacteria on occasions where the occurrence model predicts an event the cell count or cyanobacterial concentration is ascertained using kde again conditional on previous time step values of exogenous predictors and cyanobacteria concentration the details of the occurrence and count stages of the model are presented next 2 2 1 cyanobacteria occurrence model hereinafter we denote a cyanobacterial occurrence amount at time t as ct and at the qth time step prior to the current as ct q it should be noted that the same notation ct is used both for cyanobacterial occurrence and amount and should be taken in the context of the issue being addressed also both single variables and parameters are defined as non bold while both multi variable vectors and matrices are presented as bold characters or symbols the cyanobacteria forecasting model can be viewed as the conditional prediction of ct z t 1 where z t 1 serves as a vector of variables at a given location at time t 1 and includes exogenous environmental control variables x t 1 along with cyanobacterial count occurrence c t 1 at the preceding time step the parameters in case of a binary response the transition probabilities of a first order markov model are defined by p c t c t 1 when z t 1 consists of c t 1 alone however if the conditioning vector z t 1 includes additional predictors x t 1 these transition probabilities would modify as p c t ct 1 x t 1 to estimate p c t ct 1 x t 1 the following parameterization is applied mehrotra and sharma 2007 1 p c t 1 c t 1 i x t 1 p c t 1 c t 1 i x t 1 p c t 1 i x t 1 f x t 1 c t 1 c t 1 i p c t 1 c t 1 i f x

1 c t 1 i the first term of eq 1 p ct ct 1 represents the standard transition probabilities of a first order markov model the second term presents the additional effects introduced by the predictor set xt 1 in the conditioning vector zt 1 in the most simplified form xt 1 is assumed to be consisting of environmental variables which are normally distributed under this assumption the associated conditional probability density f xt 1 ct 1 ct 1 i can be approximated as a multivariate normal as a result p ct ct 1 xt 1 can be simplified as 2 p 1 i 1 d e t v 1 i 1 2 e x p 1 2 x t 1 μ 1 i v 1 i 1 x t 1 μ 1 i 1 d e t v 1 i 1 2 e x p 1 2 x t 1 μ 1 i v 1 i 1 x t 1 μ 1 i p 1 i 1 d e t v 0 i 1 2 e x p 1 2 x t 1 μ 0 i v 0 i 1 x t 1 μ 0 i p 1 i where μ 1 i is the conditional mean vector of x when ct 1 ct 1 i and μ 0 i when ct 1 i and ct 0 likewise v1 i and v0 i are the corresponding variance covariance matrixes p1i represents the transition probabilities of a first order markov model p ct 1 ct 1 i and det represents the determinant operation in eq 2 μ 0 v0 μ 1 v1 and p1i are the parameters of the modified markov model for p ct ct 1 xt 1 these can be derived by forming different conditional subsets of the given cyanobacterial series and by calculating the conditional probabilities means variances and covariances for example μ 1 i is the mean of a subset of data formed by pooling out weeks when there is cyanobacteria occurrence noted ct 1000 for the cases where the assumption of a multivariate normal is violated conditional probability densities f xt 1 ct ct 1 and f xt 1 ct 1 of eq 1 may be estimated either using nonparametric alternatives for instance kernel density estimation or adopting more appropriate probability distributions for this study the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution is adopted 2 2 2 cyanobacterial count model the number of cyanobacterial count should be predicted for each time step by the occurrence model as an event the cyanobacterial count model is based on the kernel density procedure defined in previous studies harrold et al 2003 mehrotra and sharma 2007 sharma 2000 sharma and o neill 2002 sharma et al 1997 the model structure description described here is adopted from the above publications and is reproduced here for the sake of convenience of the readers the model is mentioned hereafter as the kernel density estimation kde model similar to the occurrence model the kde predicts the number of cyanobacterial counts conditional on the values of cyanobacteria count and the environmental variables at the preceding time step let the cyanobacterial count at time t be ct the conditioning vector be x t consisting of q predictor variables the conditional density estimates for week t for a multivariate gaussian kernel can be written as 3 f c t x t 1 i 1 n 1 2 π λ 2 s 1 2 w i e x p c t b i 2 2 λ 2 s where f ct x t 1 is the calculated conditional multivariate probability density for week t which is defined as a weighted sum of n gaussian density functions with bi mean and λ 2 s covariance here n is the total number of observations and s is a spread measure of the conditional density calculated as 4 s s rr s xr t s xx 1 s xr the covariance of ct x t 1 is defined as 5 c o v c t x t 1 s rr s xr t s xr s xx the contributed portion of each kernel in building the conditional probability density is assigned weight wi and is expressed as 6 ω i e x p 1 2 λ 2 x t 1 x i ψ t s xx 1 x t 1 x i ψ i 1 n 1 2 λ 2 x t 1 x i ψ t s xx 1 x t 1 x i ψ where ψ is the diagonal matrix of influence weights mehrotra and sharma 2006 it incorporates the relative influence of each predictor in forming the conditional probability density λ a kernel bandwidth is a spread measure and bi is the conditional mean related to each kernel described as 7 b i c i s xr t s xx 1 x t 1 x i ψ basic principles of eqs 3 to 7 and detailed discussions about the kernel density procedure are described in mehrotra and sharma 2007 and sharma and o neill 2002 2 2 3 predictor sets with combinations of environmental variables in a so called leave one out validation framework we develop calibrate the model using data for 15 stations and test validate the developed model on the left out station this process is repeated 16 times by rotating the left out station to obtain the cross validated predictions at all 16 stations in addition at each time step 1000 predictions are made to form a probabilistic forecast at that time step in order to select an optimal set of predictors we form multiple predictor sets using all possible combinations of these four environmental variables e g m1 tpv m2 tv and m15 p as shown in fig 3 and use them to both occurrence and count models to predict the cyanobacteria occurrence probability and concentration and evaluate the results to quantitatively evaluate the performances of these predictor sets we apply a 2 2 contingency table wilks 2011 on the weekly forecasts both occurrence and count of our prediction model m 1 or 0 to assess if it matches with the observations o 1 or 0 therefore it is composed of four scalars hit m 1 and o 1 denoted as a false alarm m 1 and o 0 denoted as b miss m 0 and o 1 denoted as c and correct rejection m 0 and o 0 denoted as d while the occurrence calculation is performed based on the overall observed dataset count concentration is calculated on the reduced datasets where occurrence of cyanobacteria is noted i e o 1 for the occurrence assessment in fig 2 a for example a hit a is identified if the probability of occurrence model at a given time step is 50 out of 1000 forecasts i e m 1 and the observed cyanobacterial cell count also exceeds the threshold i e o 1 in the count assessment in fig 2b a hit a is captured when the observed cyanobacterial cell count is within the interquartile range of forecasting distribution formed from the 1000 forecasts at a certain time step here the threshold is defined as 1000 cells ml based on south korean government s algal alert system in place since 1997 srivastava et al 2015 we adopt two scores to evaluate the performance of cyanobacteria occurrences forecasts these are the proportional correct pc and threat score ts pc in eq 8 is the most direct and intuitive measure of the accuracy of a forecast for discrete events although pc is straightforward to calculate for rarer events like cyanobacterial bloom occurrences in our case about 18 6 event rate 932 out of 4992 datasets the score is significantly influenced by the large number of non events and inflates the model performance therefore ts is selected to complement the limitation of pc since it does not consider the correct rejections d in the calculations eq 9 perfect score of both metrics is 1 and the worst value is 0 8 p c a d a b c d 9 t s a a b c for the count assessment we use ts only as there is no d element in count assessment and therefore pc can t be calculated in addition to this for the count assessment we also calculate root mean square error rmse as an additional measure of the differences between the observed and forecast cell counts and defined it as 10 r m s e i 1 n o i s med i 2 n where o i is the observed cyanobacterial cell count and s med is the median value of model forecast at time step i 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis with controllable predictors in addition to estimating pc ts and rmse a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of individual environmental variables on the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence a predictor set consisting of temperature and velocity variables is selected for this sensitivity analysis since these variables could be controlled by external operations generally temperature of water at higher elevation is lower than at low elevations similarly water temperature of upstream dam is lower than that of downstream due to its geological location by releasing water from the upstream dam and by operating the weir gate instantaneously temperature and velocity can be varied in a controlled manner to possibly create unfavorable conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria to understand better how the occurrence model reacts when these environmental variables change three cases are assessed in the first two cases the changes in the occurrence probability are noted when temperature and velocity are reduced by a unit standard deviation 1σ 8 4 c 0 25 m s separately even though dropping water temperature by 8 4 c does not seem to be realistic data does exhibit these variations and it would help to visualize easily how the model reacts when a variable is modified in the last case these two variables are reduced together by one standard deviation results from these and other assessments are presented next 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation the modeled results and those obtained from the sensitivity analysis of parameters are presented in fig 3a and in table s1 of the supporting information hereafter the prefix s for figures and tables indicate those in the supporting information in addition fig s2 shows time series of predicted and observed cyanobacteria concentration over three representative stations gongju seungchon and gangjung in fig 3a the subscripts o and c in the description of pc and ts scores respectively represent the occurrence and count models all results represent validation performance using the leave one out cross validation procedure outlined before overall all datasets exhibit equally good performances except a few instances where these scores are low for example all datasets achieve a pc score of 0 86 at a minimum however as mentioned in section 2 2 3 many non bloom events about 81 3 of non event result in high score of correct rejections d i e non bloom in both observation and model leading to an inflated pc score as ts ignores the correct rejection term the score was lower than pc with an averaged value close to 0 50 except for three datasets p v nv and pv fig 3 when comparing the performances of the four single variable datasets i e t n v or p water temperature t comes up as the most dominant variable amongst the four for both occurrence and count models it shows comparable performance against datasets consisting of two or more variables fig 3 this finding highlights the importance of water temperature in the formulation of any predictive model cha et al 2017 kim et al 2020b the performance of datasets t and tn p and pv n and pn are almost identical probably because of the high joint dependence of the two variables considered pearson correlation coefficients are 0 45 between t and n 0 32 between p and n and 0 31 between v with p respectably finally tpv produces the best results whereas both tpn and tpnv less perform following these results the use of either tpv tn or tv dataset is likely to be recommended depending on the availability of data overall by including probabilistic results this model enables users to make a risk based decision in addition the model can also be viewed as an improved water quality model because it not only provides probabilistic output occurrence probability but also a deterministic count of cyanobacteria median value of count that physical models normally aim to simulate while a physical model requires considerable amount of time for calibration and running with large data requirements to specify current boundary and initial conditions the proposed model does a similar job with a few environmental variables and with a reasonable accuracy as a result of the model performance water authorities in the study area can benefit from various aspects such as simple and reliable forecasting evaluation of proactive measures and most influential environmental factors 3 2 tpv dataset performance conditional to preceding cyanobacterial count in this section we evaluate the predictive performance of the forecasting model under varying cyanobacteria concentration conditions to assess the stability of the approach we select the tpv dataset because it provides a more consistent performance across various conditions compared to other groups of datasets we divide the whole data into subsets based on cyanobacteria cell counts for the preceding time step for example ct 1 1000 in fig 3b means the subset when the cyanobacterial bloom did not happen at the preceding time step likewise ct 1 ct denotes the subset when the current cyanobacterial cell count is greater than the one in the preceding time step since calculating ts does not include correct rejections d occupying a high portion of the forecasting cases we only consider ts to provide an indication of model behavior under varying conditions overall the occurrence model performs well when ct 1 1 000 cells ml because it is based on first order markovian dependence with that threshold being used on the other hand a poor result is obtained when ct 1 1000 cells ml this is because of a relatively large number of false alarms b in calculating ts eq 9 specifically about 80 of total observed cell counts in this group showed greater than zero but 1000 cells ml because of which ts is likely to be higher if the threshold 1000 cells ml is lowered in the count model the tpv exhibits a good performance with fewer deviations across the cases 3 3 influence of controlled environmental variables on the model outcome in order to understand the influence of the externally controlled environmental variables on the probability of cyanobacteria occurrence sensitivity analysis is performed using the tv data alone this follows the reasoning that it is possible to control water temperature and velocity to some extent by releasing the water from upstream storages where feasible the change in probability resulting from changing the t v and both together as boxplots is presented in fig s1 by dropping temperature by one standard deviation 1σ 8 4 c occurrence probability decreases by about 19 median value on the other hand occurrence probability is reduced by about 7 median value by increasing the velocity by one standard deviation when changes in these two variables are applied together the occurrence probability drops by about 24 these results suggest that temperature is more effective than velocity and varying both variables together is much more effective in controlling the cyanobacteria occurrence 3 4 caveats and follow up studies this study used four easily assessable environmental variables water temperature t total phosphorus p total nitrogen n and flow velocity v our results show that all of them influence the occurrence and concentration of cyanobacterial blooms to a varying degree however other factors such as turbidity ph salinity irradiance electric conductivity can also influence the cyanobacteria occurrence these variables are not considered in the present study for the sake of simplicity and unavailability of data remote sensing information can also be used as a surrogate to supplement the ground information needed to study the cyanobacteria occurrence and concentration for example teta et al 2017 showed that remote sensing can be applied to identify initial cyanobacterial bloom by combining with aerial and in situ data in this study we assumed that the environmental conditions leading to cyanobacterial growth do not change across space within the study area this assumption is based on the relatively small spatial extent of the study area around 100 000 km2 where the environmental and climatological conditions do not vary significantly in space however it should be noted that the conditions of environmental variables that trigger algal bloom might differ depending on the regions or event since each location or outbreak has a unique and native environmental control if enough data is available this framework should ideally be applied separately to each location especially so if climatic and land use conditions are markedly different from each other the weekly time step applied in the model framework follows the weekly data sampling interval adopted by south korea south korea ministry of environment 2012 using data at finer temporal resolutions is expected to further improve the model performance the frequency of sampling is dictated by a number of factors including indented use the cost of monitoring the season and the growth rate of the cyanobacteria the guidance manual of global water research coalition newcombe 2012 recommends that sampling for high risk high security supplies i e drinking supplies should occur on at least a weekly basis and probably twice weekly when cyanobacterial count of 2000 cells ml is reached for supplies where the public health risk is deemed to be low i e low cell counts in non supply reservoirs fortnightly sampling may be adequate as duration of cyanobacterial blooms is usually greater than a month in temperate zones cyanobacteria can last 2 4 months whereas in tropical and subtropical regions they can continue all year round a weekly sampling interval is expected to provide a good idea of the cyanobacteria growth behavior sivonen and jones 1999 4 conclusion this paper demonstrated the applicability of a probabilistic short term forecasting model for cyanobacterial bloom occurrence and count the model works in two parts prediction of cyanobacteria occurrence and simulation of cyanobacteria counts following a positive simulation of occurrence the occurrence model simulates cyanobacterial bloom using a first order markov model conditional on environmental variables cyanobacterial counts are simulated based on a first order conditional kernel density based model results of a sensitivity analysis conducted using various combinations of four environmental control variables suggest tpv tn and tv as sets of optimal environmental variables for prediction of cyanobacteria over the study region a minimum pc score of 0 86 and conditional ts of 0 5 capturing rare occurrence events and stable results across various conditions and stations consolidate the performance of the proposed model the novel elements of this research include the idea of modelling the cyanobacteria growth rate conditional on the previous state of cyanobacteria occurrence and environmental variables under a markovian assumption water temperature is found to be the most dominant variable in the cyanobacteria predictions followed by the nutrients such as n and p the results of sensitivity analysis can help in identifying appropriate proactive measure required to control the cyanobacteria occurrence although the model is developed and applied using the data for south korea the logic adopted and the model structure followed is quite generic and it can easily be extended to other areas depending on the availability of environmental data care should however be taken to assess whether the same environmental control variables or variables indicative of localized conditions climate and land use are to be used credit authorship contribution statement seungbeom kim validation formal analysis investigation writing original

4983,hydrological behavior of an ombrogenous raised peat bog has been observed and described in many studies however not in complexity with other soils this research deals with the hydrological function of peat bog in a catchment where peat bog formed by histosol or other hydromorphic soils covers only a part of the area 40 60 two soil types creating two main hillslopes of the experimental catchment in this study form the dominant soil types podzol and histosol in the šumava mountains czechia a modified hbv model was used to estimate the contribution of each soil type to common outflow and for the estimation of the water balance according to previous research and field observations dominant hydrological processes were described for each hillslope soil the hbv model was used for the quantification of a ratio between fast and slow flow at peat bog hillslope and podzol hillslope at peat bog hillslope the majority of outflow 67 was formed from the upper soil layer acrotelm in the mineral soil hillslope a larger portion of runoff was generated from the lower soil layers or bedrock interface 61 peat bog contributes to a stream mainly during rainfall events however the model showed also significant deep percolation at the peat bog hillslope and considerable contribution to baseflow during a year generally more precipitation water was turned by the model into runoff at the peat bog hillslope which was also exhibited by a lower rate of actual evapotranspiration 21 of precipitation compared to 29 in the case of podzol hillslope if we consider land use changes in this locality in terms of expanding or reducing peat areas draining drains damming droughts etc this model could sufficiently estimate the hydrological behavior of local streams and thus can be potentially used in hydrological planning by local authorities keywords water balance hydrological model runoff formation šumava mts peat bog hillslope podzol hillslope 1 introduction theories on the effect of peat bogs on runoff formation under varying conditions differ widely and repeatedly among researchers the problems of drainage especially diking of former drainage channels have become the field for broad debates within the literature baird 1997 conway millar 1960 mcdonald 1973 most of the studies have been carried out in catchments covered only by histosols peat which are the dominant soil type creating peat bogs streamflow in peaty catchments is characterised by its rapid rises and falls that is very low baseflow during dry periods and spiky storm hydrographs caused by heavy rainfall events this behaviour has been described in detail in many hydrological studies e g bragg 2002 evans et al 1999 holden et al 2001 holden burt 2003 contrary to common mineral soils cambisols podzol etc peat histosol is known for frequent overland flow or near surface flow which transfer quickly rainfall event to a stream however most of the above mentioned studies have focused on peat areas only and studies exploring the hydrological behaviour of peat bog in comparison with adjacent mineral soil are missing nevertheless catchments are predominantly comprised of several types of soil or vegetation which can lead to varied subsurface flow and runoff formation hümann et al 2011 one of the most common locations in czechia where peat bogs occur is the šumava mts where they affect both water quality and hydrological regime čurda et al 2011 ferda et al 1971 janský kocum 2008 kocum et al 2016 vlček et al 2016 vlček et al 2017 peat bogs cover approximately 20 35 of the catchment areas in this region bufková et al 2010 but a larger proportion of these catchments is covered by mineral soils such as podzol although peat bogs do not dominate the catchment area their hydrological regime can determine runoff processes of the whole catchment namely in terms of flashy hydrographs and reduced outflow in rain less periods vlček et al 2012 kocum et al 2016 moreover the contribution of peat bogs to the total annual runoff remains unrevealed in these mixed areas many studies confirmed that in catchments formed by several soil types with their unique hydrological regimes it is important to understand each system because each one could have its impact on water storage or water chemical properties kirchner 2016 mcdonnell et al 2007 robinson et al 2013 uhlenbrook et al 2008 therefore several studies focus mainly on waterlogged riparian zones which represent connectivity areas between hillslopes and streams seibert et al 2009 von freyberg et al 2014 riparian zones in the šumava mts ore mts or jizerské mts form rather thin peaty buffers along streams with low water storage and flow delay several experimental catchments were also found where peat histosol creates only a part of a whole soil cover dick et al 2018 lessels et al 2016 scheliga et al 2019 šanda et al 2014 2018 tetzlaff et al 2007 compare to our catchment peat covers concave parts of a valley in this study ombrogenous raised peat bog formed by histosol and mineral soil podzol creates two separate hillslopes for a better evaluation of the peat bog impact on the catchment hydrology several catchments with various peat bog coverage but similar topography need to be compared or the utilization of a hydrological model suitable for two hydrologically different hillslopes is necessary rainfall runoff relationships can be predicted by a wide range of hydrological models abbott et al 1986 arnold et al 1998 bergström 1992 beven kirkby 1979 however models tailored to the characterisation of the hydrological regime of peat bogs are scarce price et al 2005 some attempts have been made by dunn and mackay 1996 using the shetran model to investigate the effect of drainage ditches lane et al 2004 utilised a modified topmodel benefitting from the high resolution digital elevation model for the prediction of saturation of the blanket peat environment lane and milledge 2012 used several topmodel modifications for the estimation of the peat drains influence on runoff generation ballard et al 2012 also used a simplified physically based model to simulate the runoff reaction and water table fluctuations of drained peatland in the uk in most cases the model performance was poorer in dry conditions lewis et al 2013 used a physically based geotop model for the identification of the hydrological response to afforestation in a small ireland catchment nevertheless the correct quantification of the runoff generation and particular water balance components is still encouraging in the peat bog environment because the models usually do not respect the acrotelm catotelm scheme holden burt 2003 the use of a box model such as hbv bergström 1992 is therefore an option because the box models compared to physically based ones seem to be favourable for the algorithmic convenience but as pointed out by mcdonnell 2003 they may also represent the way forward to match the appropriate level of understanding and behaviour of the hydrological systems the hbv is a semi distributed model where the catchment can be separated into different elevation zones as well as into different subcatchments the particular water fluxes are represented by different routines within each zone estimating snowaccumulation snowmelt evapotranspiration soil water storage groundwater level and runoff the total runoff equals to the sums of outflow out of all zones in particular subcatchments the objectives of this study are to identify runoff formation at the small experimental catchment at the vydra river headwater with emphasis on the following aspects i prove that mineral podzol hillslopes contributes more to the outflow during rain less periods and less during wet periods compared to peat bog hillslopes ii the annual outflow from peat bog hillslope is lower than from mineral podzol hillslope based on studies kocum et al 2016 and evans et al 1999 iii confirm that the simple box model can be used to predict runoff in the catchment formed simultaneously by peat bog and podzol hillslopes these aims were conducted using a newly designed box model representing the hydrological behaviour of the peat bog hillslope pb as well as the mineral soil podzol hillslope pb represented by an hbv light model the hydrological model is based on extensive measurements of the water regime in the peat bog environment during the six years 2014 19 additionally the pb hillslope water balance was estimated and contrasted with the adjacent hillslope formed by podzol soil the interest in hydrological behaviour of the peat bog areas is given by the ongoing effort to recover these environmentally important places and by other research topics concerning potential impact of climate change or bark beetle outbreak on hydrological processes at the šumava national park 2 site description the experimental catchment is located in the central šumava mts as a part of the vydra river headwaters area fig 1 the climate in this area is variable subject to both oceanic and continental influence using the köppen climate classification the site lies in the dfc climate zone tolasz 2007 which is characterised by a subarctic climate with an approximately uniform precipitation distribution the annual amount of precipitation from the nearby meteorological station at a similar altitude equals 1695 mm yr 1 1981 2010 starostová 2012 and the average daily air temperature is 4 8 c ca 15 km the rokytka catchment ro occupies 3 8 km2 and about 30 of the area is covered by peat or other hydromorphic soils fig 1a for a better understanding of local hydrological processes a small tributary of rokytka rp has been selected rp has an area of 0 65 km2 where more than 60 is covered by peat fig 1a red border and 1b the rp catchment was also selected for its special morphology it is divided into two main hillslopes in east west directions each site with different vegetation and soil cover the soil cover of the ro catchment 3 8 km2 is a typical example of šumava mts soils where a vertical sequence of several soil types with histosols is common the area is mostly covered by entic podzol and organic soils mainly histosol in certain concave parts of the catchment gleysol can be found vlček et al 2016 the soil cover of the small rp catchment 0 65 km2 is more homogeneous and differs in two dominant hillslopes the soil profiles are similar throughout each hillslope without a clear gradient towards the stream the soil type of western pz hillslope has been identified as an entic podzol with a shallow organic top layer 5 cm and similar soil texture to a depth of 1 m some small parts of the pz hillslope are covered by haplic podzol but these areas are hardly identifiable without an excavation neither there was a sharp transition between the mineral soil and the bedrock well weathered gneiss or granite perceptible with electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements nor a persistent groundwater level could be detected vlček et al 2017 supplements fig s1 the eastern pb hillslope is created by a well developed raised ombrogenous peat bog with dominant soil type histosol with depth varies from 0 5 m lower part to ca 6 m top part both hillslopes of the small rp catchment can be nicely visible by the vegetation cover while vegetation relates closely to soils fig 2 b the western mineral soil podzol hillslope is covered by beech stands at the upper hillslope zone dead spruce stands picea abies l karst with healthy seedlings cover the lower hillslope zone and the addition of fir abies alba mill and beech fagus sylvatica l due to the bark beetle calamity outbreak most of the spruce stands deceased the forest is being filled slowly mainly by spruce seedlings and grasses the eastern hillslope is created by a well developed raised ombrogenous peat bog where three vegetation subsections can be found the upper subsection of the peat bog is covered mostly by cotton grass eriophorum l or moss sphagnum l with many small lakes the middle subsection has the lowest water table fluctuation and the vegetation cover consists of pine pinus mugo blueberry and moss the lowest subsection occupies the bottom of the valley and is covered by waterlogged spruce forest with blueberry and moss some of the spruce trees are also affected by bark beetle bufková 2009 3 methodology 3 1 field measurements the experimental site is equipped with an automatic system for measuring meteorological variables with wireless data transmission the fundamental measurements necessary for this study were composed of air temperature and relative humidity fiedler rv12 rk5 cze which were measured directly in the ro catchment the global radiation kipp zonen cmp3 nl precipitation and wind speed fiedler cze were available from the modrava meteorological station located 5 7 km from the catchment divide all the above mentioned data were measured at 10 minute intervals fig 3 during years 2013 19 the snow pillow located in the ro catchment was used to measure snow water equivalent and snow depth in a one hour time step since the winter 2015 2016 data available for the last four winters 2016 19 the snow pillow located in the ro catchment was used to measure snow water equivalent swe and snow depth in a one hour time step in two winters 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 soil water regime was measured at the pz hillslope at two places upper and lower part at two depths 20 and 60 cm by soil tensiometers t8 ums company their position was chosen according to previous soil survey and the vegetation cover described above the volumetric soil water content was inferred from the pressure heads by means soil water retention curves that were determined by the pressure apparatus soilmoisture usa in the laboratory the parameters of the soil water retention curves are documented in table 1 and more thoroughly in the previous study vlček et al 2017 fig 3c shows the average values of volumetric soil water contents at 20 and 60 cm respectively groundwater level fig 3d was measured by a tsh22 hydrostatic submersible level probe fiedler cze and represents the average value of all three measured sites which were placed uniformly at the pb hillslope groundwater level fluctuates between the surface 0 cm and a depth of 40 cm below the surface the average value of the groundwater level was 18 cm below the surface catchment outlets were equipped with automatic measuring stations fiedler ams company at both catchments rp ro water levels in 10 min step were measured at ro outlet by ultrasonic level probe us3200 at rp outlet by pressure sensor with hydro logger h40 water level data was then transferred to discharge by rating curves for each profile 3 2 hydrological processes used in the model the structure of the model is based on an estimation of dominant preferential flow according to boorman et al 1995 and scherrer and naef 2003 moreover it is supplemented and modified according to the authorś field experiences from the local study sites and other studies dealing with similar research topics explained further the model consists of two main systems which represent two hillslopes with dominant soil types podzol histosol respectively table 2 each hillslope is divided into several sub basins which are connected by links corresponding to real hydrological processes or dominant preferential flows in this case we use the term sub basin as a soil layer soil part with similar hydro pedological processes or water regime the structure of hydrological processes at each dominant hillslope of the rp catchment described below is visible in fig 2a 3 3 podzol hillslope pz pz1 upper sub basin pz1 represents a soil layer entic podzol the overland flow was not recognised at this hillslope even during heavy rainfall events 40 mm day 1 near surface biomat flow gerke et al 2015 was proved by water sampling from different soil horizons in an excavated profile and by sprinkling experiment vlček et al 2017 from sub basin pz1 water flows into two sub basins both representing regolith with different flow delay sub basin pz2 represents macropore flow proved at this locality by vlček et al 2017 sub basin pz3 shows a deep percolation with a slow flow velocity which could be estimated by hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil layer 0 3 mm h 1 the transition between soil and a regolith is gradual since ert measurements did not find any visible change in electrical resistivity except solitaire rocks 3 4 peat bog hillslope pb peat bogs contain in general two main hydropedological layers acrotelm and catotelm their hydrological behaviour was nicely described besides others by holden and burt 2003 and also at the ro catchment by vlček et al 2017 while acrotelm can form a fast shallow subsurface flow or biomat flow it is hard to distinguish between biomat flow and saturated overland flow therefore we joined these processes together in one fast shallow or surface flow the main hydrological process of pb hillslope is situated by the model in sub basin pb1 which represents acrotelm and a thin upper part layer of catotelm a shallow subsurface flow biomat flow was estimated as a dominant process not only in this locality vlček et al 2017 but also in other peaty areas evans et al 1999 holden burt 2003 overland flow occurs when an acrotelm gets fully saturated with water the saturated overland flow was visible during heavy rainfall also at the rokytka pb hillslope in general most of peat bog springs can dry up during summer while they are fed by a shallow layer of soil especially by an acrotelm and or a thin upper layer of catotelm in the case of the non drying spring catotelm caused a continuous flow this hydrological process is enhanced at drained peat bogs where drain bottoms lay below groundwater level the hydrological behaviour of springs precisely water level fluctuation was used in the model as another flow process from sub basin pb1 at the range between acrotelm and catotelm fig 2 the lower border of the pb1 sub basin cannot be unfortunately exactly determined while it depends on a groundwater level morphology or slope of a peat bog except for the two above mentioned flows from the pb1 sub basin overland biomat flow and flow from springs the other two possible downward flows could be found the first sub basin pb2 means a fast flow a quick response to a rainfall event called a pipe flow as discussed by jones 1997 holden and burt 2003 and uchida et al 2005 pipes extend horizontally while they are created mainly by partly decayed wood or by big pores originated from peat drying or erosion the second slow flow pb3 sub basin corresponds to a deep percolation with a flow velocity similar to the hydraulic conductivity of the peat in catotelm 1 cm day 1 field in situ measurements holden et al 2001 the downwards direction is driven by gravity forces and could be called a piston flow water flows from pb and pz hillslope into the stream creating an outflow from the catchment both hillslopes are also affected by evapotranspiration from the upper sub basins at each site pz1 and pb1 3 5 model description the utilised model is based on the hbv scheme bergström 1992 which was for the peat bog domain modified to be in line with the acrotelm catotelm concept as proposed by ingram 1978 the modelling domain was split into two different zones representing two distinct parts of the catchment pb hillslope modified hbv and pz hillslope standard hbv scheme each domain was represented by its model structure differing mainly in the character of the runoff reaction to rainfall for the estimation of the total catchment runoff the outflow of both zones was summed with respect to the areal distribution of both domains peat covering 60 of the area before the hbv model modification several restricting assumptions were defined the flashiness of the hydrograph episodic measurements of the spring discharge from the mineral soil and peat bog parts of the catchment in the case of the peat bog the difference between the maximum 2 1 l s 1 pz hillslope 19 1 l s 1 pb hillslope and minimum discharge 0 01 l s 1 pz hillslope 0 8 l s 1 pb hillslope was 10 times higher than from mineral soil hence if a better value of an objective function was obtained during the calibration and this ratio was outside the interval from 9 to 10 then the parameter set was omitted threshold relation between groundwater level in the peat bog and observed discharge the small contribution of the peat bog water to the total runoff during low flow periods kocum et al 2016 reported an approximately 10 contribution of the peat bog water to the total flow in the area based on isotope analyses evapotranspiration takes places only from the acrotelm

soil domain pz hillslope covering 40 of the catchment the only modification was that the water was allowed to form runoff from the soil box following the relative permeability equation brooks corey

accurate results for longwave radiation balance and subsequently pet values kofroňová et al 2019 the snow accumulation and snowmelt were modelled based on the degree day method gupta 2001 as the necessary data for the radiation balance approach were not available 3 6 model calibration the model was calibrated in the rp catchment using the data from the period of hydrological years 2014 2016 the three following years 2017 2019 were used for the validation all the parameters were determined using the genetic algorithm with the rmse as an objective function before the calibration the sensitivity analyses sa was conducted in order to investigate the influence of particular coefficients on the model performance the sa procedure was based on changing one parameter at a time with the remaining ones being fixed pianosi et al 2016 the initial fixed values of model parameters were obtained from the very first calibration of the model the sensitivity of the discharge to the changes in the input model parameters was observed by calculating the rate of change of the objective function rmse in our case supplements fig s2 the results indicated that the model is sensitive especially to

the surface runoff in the pb domain and k4 parameter governing the contribution of the lower groundwater box to the runoff in pb domain the sensitivity and ranges recommended in the hbv manual of particular parameters are shown in the supplementary materials fig s2 and table s1 the model calibration was conducted in three steps as it was necessary to determine 22 model parameters in particular steps the selected parameters were calibrated with respect to observed values of snow water equivalent step 1 soil moisture content groundwater level height step 2 and discharge step 3 respectively first four parameters were necessary to estimate snow accumulation and snowmelt step 1 these were tsnow threshold snowfall temperature tmelt threshold snowmelt temperature cfmax snowmelt rate and sfcf snowfall correction factor these parameters were optimised to match the course of snow water equivalent obtained from the snow pillow second the parameters influencing the water regime in the soil pz1 and acrotelm pb1 were calibrated against measurements of four tensiometers placed in the mineral soil and three piezometers in the peat bog step 2 these measured datasets were compared to pz1 and pb1

the estimation of runoff step 3 three coefficients were necessary for the podzol hillslope k1 and k2 storage coefficients and the non linearity coefficient αpz three storage coefficients k2 k5 and non linearity coefficient αpb were required for the outflow of the lower groundwater storage zones one for pz and one for pb domain additionally two thresholds suzsurq pb and uzl governing the runoff formation from acrotelm were needed all the parameters in step 3 were optimised with respect to observed discharge 4 results 4 1 climate and hydrological characteristics of the studied period the studied period included two years with above average 2014 2016 and four years with below average precipitation 2015 2017 2019 the precipitation records showed years 2014 and 2016 were wetter than average by 5 and 13 respectively contrarily the years 2015 and 2017 2019 attained only 56 90 of the long term precipitation amounts all these long term data originate from the liz station operating since 1976 in the distance of 20 km from the rp catchment as there is no climate station operating longer than 30 years at a insufficient distance storm hydrographs at the catchments rp 0 65 km2 and ro 3 8 km2 were highly variable and could be characterised by quick and steep rising and falling limbs the hydrological response to rainfall events was fast and the recession to antecedent base flow occurred rather quickly fig 3e f in the study period the mean daily runoff equalled to 3 6 mm day 1 1329 mm y 1 at the ro outlet the rp attained an average runoff of 3 4 mm day 1 1297 mm y 1 mean annual maximum flow mhq of ro was 7 1 mm day 1 and mean annual minimum flow mnq was 1 4 mm day 1 mhq of rp was 8 3 mm day 1 and mnq equalled to 1 3 mm day 1 the difference in maximum and minimum flow between ro 3 8 km2 and rp 0 65 km2 is possibly caused by a difference in peat coverage ro 30 peat bog coverage rp 60 and it confirms the hydrologic behaviour of local streams ferda et al 1971 čurda et al 2011 kocum et al 2016 the differences in annual discharges between ro and ro are discussed more in chapter 5 3 4 2 hydrological simulation the nash sutcliffe coefficient reached 0 64 in the model calibration 2014 2016 and the rmse was 3 0 mm day 1 the nash sutcliffe ranged between 0 58 and 0 71 if the errors originating in the timing of the major snowmelt events were omitted excluding 10 values out of 1558 simulated days then the rmse would decrease approximately to 2 4 mm day 1 and nash sutcliffe would rise to the value of 0 72 hence the model performance statistics were strongly influenced by the estimation of the snow accumulation and melt during four winter periods also proved by the sa in the validation period 2017 2019 the nash sutcliffe coefficient equalled to 0 56 however it was again strongly influenced by the wrongly estimated snowmelt episodes if these were omitted then the nash sutcliffe would rice to more than 0 60 the rmses of the soil water content in the pz domain and groundwater level in the pb domain are shown in fig 4 in the validation period the rmse increased to 14 3 mm concerning the soil water content from 12 0 mm in the calibration period and from 10 5 mm to 15 2 mm considering the groundwater level in acrotelm moreover the model performance was checked by extending the simulated area to the entire ro catchment covering 3 8 km2 having the different percentage of catchment covered by peat bog 30 compared to 60 in the case of rp the average nash sutcliffe coefficient reached 0 66 which is also asatisfactory value hence the model can predict runoff formation from the catchments with different coverage of the peat bog the rmses of the soil water content in the pz domain and groundwater level in the pb domain are shown in fig 4 in the validation period the rmse of the soil water content increased to 14 3 mm from 12 0 mm in the calibration period and to 15 2 mm from 10 5 mm in the case of groundwater level in acrotelm the comparison of outflow and groundwater level data from the peat bog hillslope area usually shows that an increase in outflow appears at times of higher groundwater level fig 5 for a specific threshold which is formed by an interface between an acrotelm and a catotelm groundwater level stops increasing while outflow discharge starts increasing some measurements are however quite far from the most common shape the same behaviour was observed in simulated data fig 5 right model hbv estimated the threshold between an acrotelm and a catotelm to be slightly higher than observed moreover during the full saturation the model estimated lower discharge events than were observed altogether the simulated discharges correspond sufficiently to the observed data for both modelled catchments rp fig 6 upper and ro fig 6 lower nevertheless thesimulation of peaks high discharges and snowmelt periods is a weak point in the calibration period thirteen peak discharges higher than 20 mm day 1 were underestimated on 34 1 on average this underestimation rose to 48 0 in the validation period 11 events the snow water equivalent was estimated with the average daily rmse equal to 21 7 mm in the calibration period the average value was 111 4 mm eventhough this was a better efficiency than showed e g by šípek and tesař 2017 focused on the nearby liz experimental catchment when seasonal rmse ranged from 5 9 to 10 8 mm with the annual average observed swe equal to 18 6 mm the representativeness of the snow pillow measurements concetnin the spatial extend of the rp catchment remained a key issue as the timing of the observed runoff occasionally slightly shifted from the simulated values based on calibrated swe finally even though fig 6 contains comparisons of two catchments with different sizes of peat coverage ro and rp the errors in simulated discharges is of the same character regardless the percentage of peat coverage 4 3 contribution of pb hillslope to the streamflow the pb hillslope generally contributes higher annual runoff volume to the total runoff than pz hillslope by 175 mm i e 17 in the period 2014 2019 fig 7 however this higher runoff was restricted to events with higher observed discharge in these events the contribution of pb hillslope to the total flow was often over 80 with a maximum of 98 on the other hand the ratio of pb hillslope contribution to total outflow was low during low flow periods when pb hillslope formed up to 15 of the total flow the results document the propensity of peat bog to generate runoff when higher precipitation falls on well saturated organic soil on the other hand in periods without significant precipitation the runoff was dominated by the outflow from the mineral soil albeit forming a smaller portion of total flow volume on average altogether higher runoff from pb hillslope was observed in 17 of the simulated days 4 4 simulated water balance the simulated runoff differed from the observed runoff on average by 6 7 in the period of hydrological years 2014 2019 the highest difference was observed in the year 2015 simulated runoff was lower by 24 which was the warmest year with the lowest amount of precipitation table 3 the simulated and observed runoff coefficients equalled 74 9 and 80 3 respectively this indicated the importance of the upper mountain regions in terms of runoff formation as the average runoff coefficient equalled 26 8 in czechia tolasz 2007 the estimated average annual actual evapotranspiration equalled 489 mm yr 1 for the mineral soil 81 of pet fig 7 and 319 mm yr 1 for the peat bog area 59 of pet on average the actual evapotranspiration of the whole rp catchment was 386 mm yr 1 and its annual course corresponded to the observed precipitation amounts i e was highest in 2016 and lowest in 2015 5 discussion models can estimate answers to hydrological questions where standard field measurements among reasons such as short time of measurements or any spatial restrictions are not sufficient in the case of the rokytka catchment ro previous measurements could not evaluate sufficiently the shallow and deep subsurface flow contribution to the total runoff at both slopes nor could they estimate the pb hillslope contribution to the outflow during low flow periods the input data as well as the performance of the hydrological model can be biased with several uncertainties first the amount of available precipitation can be underestimated with standard rain gauges the reason is that the measurements from the rain gauges may contain significant errors especially in the winter period dingman 2015 thus even the corrected amount of winter precipitation is still uncertain because the estimation of precipitation in mountains is accompanied by several deficiencies sevruk 2005 then major drawback in the model performance was given by the snowmelt and the snow accumulation melt routine based on the degree day approach in general this approach was insufficient in the estimation of the timing of the snowmelt causing significant errors in the model s prediction of spring discharge the degree day approach is a standard method used in several hydrological models to estimate the evolution of snow cover however nevertheless the overall performance of the modified hbv model both in the calibration and validation period corresponded to the median of error statistics for 59 czech catchments with variable spatial extend reported recently by jeníček and ledvinka 2020 using the same model similar model efficiencies were presented by hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2015 in four catchments in norway contrarily better model performance can be found in studies by etter et al 2017 or jeníček et al 2018 focusing mainly on significantly larger catchments moreover the hbv model efficiency proved to be dependent on the chosen calibration period merz et al 2011 water content in the upper soil layers seemed to be simulated reliably in both domains especially in the mineral soil the model s prediction of the water regime in acrotelm was slightly less efficient than expected which is mainly due to the micro topography of the peat bog the soil water regime in acrotelm was characterised using water level measurements obtained from three piezometers each of them placed in a different part of the bog hence we used their arithmetical average which might not accurately represent the behaviour of the entire peat bog the different behaviour of the groundwater level measurements in a single peat bog probe was reported by kellner and halldin 2002 finally the determination of the runoff pathways was a result of the model design using the runoff generation mechanisms obtained from the literature without the use of tracer experiments or isotope analyses the ratio among them is still uncertain and will be an object of our further research nevertheless as the sensitivity of the runoff separation to model parameters were inspected the percentage of fast shallow subsurface flow in each domain was found to be determined strictly and unambiguously by the values of rmse and the required ratio of pb pz peak discharges the most influential parameters characterised the water regime in the soil pz1 and acrotelm pb1 fcpb pz βpb pz ks and θr their influence on the fast subsurface flow ratio is shown in supplementary materials fig s3 all remaining model parameters affected the fast shallow subsurface flow only in terms of single percents one of the major results of this study was the estimation of the peat bog water balance and its contrast with the adjacent mineral soil more accurate estimation of the rate of evapotranspiration was missing at the site it was based on the observed soil water regime in both modelling domains however the results can be masked by the uncertain determination of the fluxes in different flow pathways several authors have focused on the estimation of aet in the peat bog environment but as far as the authors know no study contrasted its value with the nearby mineral soil the annual evapotranspiration of the pb hillslope at the rp catchment ranged from 279 to 348 mm 18 28 of available precipitation which is a lower amount than reported in the nearby albeit located at lower altitude forest environment 50 šípek tesař 2017 it is also lower than previously reported ratios of aet to precipitation by lafleur et al 2005 however the annual rate and daily averages 1 1 mm day 1 and maxima 3 5 mm day 1 correspond to those found by sottocornola and kiely 2010 the most pronounced reason probably lies in the reduced evapotranspiration of peat bog due to the formation of a crust when dry likely isolating the peat top from lower wet layers as documented by sottocornola and kiely 2010 the formation of the surface crust was observed during field surveys in dry periods furthermore cloud water as a significant amount of precipitation can also reduce the rate of aet heal et al 2004 eliáš et al 1995 described the influence of cloud water on the water balance in the nearby lower lying site to be around 7 10 of the total precipitation moreover the differences may be also caused by the different occurrence of the vegetation and free water surface in the peat bog which was stressed by sottocornola and kiely 2010 it must be noted that the ratio of peat bog histosol and podzol soil evapotranspiration may be affected by the number of dry or wet years in the study 5 1 podzol hillslope hydrological processes simulated outflow from podzol hillslope 1083 mm per year fig 7 is divided by the model in a fast preferential flow and slow percolation fast preferential flow includes shallow subsurface flow or biomat flow defined by gerke et al 2015 as the surface flow was not recognised at this site almost all water from rainfall infiltrates into the soil however a sprinkling experiment vlček et al 2017 identified near surface lateral flow fast runoff process at mineral soil hillslope was estimated to be 338 mm of the total fig 7 thus not a dominant hydrological process the sprinkling experiment showed a biomat flow as a dominant preferential flow in local mineral soil except deep percolation however the experiment covers only a small area 2 25 m2 and a near sub surface flow can reduce by variable soil topography such as small depressions these surface segmentations caused by fallen and uprooted trees could affect outflow during rain events by forming small storage spaces with a low infiltration capacity field observation slow flow nicely correlated with infiltration tests where the infiltration capacity was estimated in an order of less than mm h 1 jačka et al 2014 vlček et al 2017 geophysical surveys ert measurements did not show any visible threshold or barrier to possible vertical flow together with surface topographic variability available observed patterns and measured chosen features section 3 2 indicated that the dominant hillslope runoff process should be a slow deep percolation into regolith or bedrock this type of runoff process creates water supply for springs during rainless periods our model confirms a dominant slow percolation on the mineral hillslope 777 mm of a total 1115 mm yr 1 5 2 peat bog hillslope hydrological processes compared to mineral soil peat bog is known for its quick response of saturated overland flow events holden burt 2003 similar runoff formation is visible at the ro catchments peat bog side during a period of high groundwater level and heavy rainfall this is also proven by the shape of the groundwater level runoff chart fig 5 and in the study done by evans et al 1999 a quick response of an outflow from a peat bog to a rainfall event could be caused by overland flow near surface flow in an acrotelm or pipe flow through a whole peat bog holden burt 2002 jones 1997 uchida et al 2005 these mentioned runoff processes were joined to the fast flow and were estimated as the dominant runoff formation processes with the contribution of 969 mm to the total outflow fig 7 a slow runoff process at the pb hillslope was formed by a deep percolation to bedrock and a small contribution to the stream from the upper layer acrotelm and thin upper part of the catotelm the first mentioned process percolation is driven by the hydrological conductivity of peat the mass of water in a peat bog can also cause a pressure height condition in a lower layer of a peat bog and could cause a piston flow into an underlying substrate the second mentioned process small contribution to a stream is visible at banks of a stream or drainage channels or at places where sites with higher slope occur water is therefore forced to leak out from the peat similar processes can be found in drained peatlands schot et al 2004 in some cases this outflow leads to spring formation however this process is strictly dependent on the depth of the groundwater level worrall et al 2007 these two above mentioned hydrological processes form a minor but significant slow runoff formation at the pb hillslope the contribution of slow processes to the total outflow from the rp catchment was estimated to be 325 mm fig 7 5 3 hillslopes contribution to the total runoff a discharge from a peat bog is unstable with a high quick response to rainfall events and visible spring drying during drought as compared to discharge from mineral soil evans et al 1999 ferda et al 1971 janský kocum 2008 it was also shown in measured data from the rp catchment in the comparison of measured and modelled annual discharges from this study pb hillslope at the rp catchment contributed to the outflow with an annual 1294 mm on average more than outflow from the pz hillslope fig 7 however the decision on the question from which soil flows more water is not so clear it depends mainly on soil saturation depth of groundwater level or an amount of rainfall evans et al 1999 showed that discharge in a peatland starts increasing at a specific depth of groundwater level this hydrological behaviour was also confirmed in the rp catchment fig 5 some studies such as blažková et al 2002 work also with a spatial variability of the saturated area in time in the case of rp and ro catchments water table depth have influenced the hydrological regime more while the size of waterlogged areas varies very little in general during wet years when a peat bog is saturated higher outflow occurs from a peaty area then from mineral soils while dry periods can cause drying of spring from peat histosol mean annual minimum flow rp 1 3 mm day 1 ro 1 4 mm day 1 and mean annual maximum flow rp 16 0 mm day 1 ro 13 6 mm day 1 from experimental catchments rp and ro moreover based on the hydrological soil type and its dominant runoff formation process boorman et al 1995 scherrer naef 2003 peat histosols transfers faster rainwater during rainfall event into a stream compare to mineral soil such as podzol 6 conclusion this study estimated the hydrological contribution of two hillslopes with two dominant soil types having different hydrological regimes field observations experiments and monitoring of soil moisture at the podzol hillslope groundwater level at the peat bog hillslope and streamflow were analysed to describe the water regime of each hillslope moreover hydrological models hbv were modified and used in this research to distinguish fast and slow flow at each hillslope the model confirms previous studies that peat bog is characterised by a quick response to a rainfall event however it also contributed to the stream via slow flow 36 of the flow from the peat bog hillslope this slow flow was determined as a piston flow through peat at the mineral soil podzol hillslope the dominant subsurface flow was estimated to be deep percolation reaching 71 of the mineral soil outflow in general raised ombrogenous peat bog contributes slightly more than mineral soil podzol to the outflow while its evapotranspiration is lower during years with an excess of precipitation more water flows from the peat bog hillslope but during dry years more water is drained from the mineral soil podzol hillslope this analysis therefore improves our knowledge about how soils contribute to a stream during rainfall events base flow and drought periods 7 data availability

4983,hydrological behavior of an ombrogenous raised peat bog has been observed and described in many studies however not in complexity with other soils this research deals with the hydrological function of peat bog in a catchment where peat bog formed by histosol or other hydromorphic soils covers only a part of the area 40 60 two soil types creating two main hillslopes of the experimental catchment in this study form the dominant soil types podzol and histosol in the šumava mountains czechia a modified hbv model was used to estimate the contribution of each soil type to common outflow and for the estimation of the water balance according to previous research and field observations dominant hydrological processes were described for each hillslope soil the hbv model was used for the quantification of a ratio between fast and slow flow at peat bog hillslope and podzol hillslope at peat bog hillslope the majority of outflow 67 was formed from the upper soil layer acrotelm in the mineral soil hillslope a larger portion of runoff was generated from the lower soil layers or bedrock interface 61 peat bog contributes to a stream mainly during rainfall events however the model showed also significant deep percolation at the peat bog hillslope and considerable contribution to baseflow during a year generally more precipitation water was turned by the model into runoff at the peat bog hillslope which was also exhibited by a lower rate of actual evapotranspiration 21 of precipitation compared to 29 in the case of podzol hillslope if we consider land use changes in this locality in terms of expanding or reducing peat areas draining drains damming droughts etc this model could sufficiently estimate the hydrological behavior of local streams and thus can be potentially used in hydrological planning by local authorities keywords water balance hydrological model runoff formation šumava mts peat bog hillslope podzol hillslope 1 introduction theories on the effect of peat bogs on runoff formation under varying conditions differ widely and repeatedly among researchers the problems of drainage especially diking of former drainage channels have become the field for broad debates within the literature baird 1997 conway millar 1960 mcdonald 1973 most of the studies have been carried out in catchments covered only by histosols peat which are the dominant soil type creating peat bogs streamflow in peaty catchments is characterised by its rapid rises and falls that is very low baseflow during dry periods and spiky storm hydrographs caused by heavy rainfall events this behaviour has been described in detail in many hydrological studies e g bragg 2002 evans et al 1999 holden et al 2001 holden burt 2003 contrary to common mineral soils cambisols podzol etc peat histosol is known for frequent overland flow or near surface flow which transfer quickly rainfall event to a stream however most of the above mentioned studies have focused on peat areas only and studies exploring the hydrological behaviour of peat bog in comparison with adjacent mineral soil are missing nevertheless catchments are predominantly comprised of several types of soil or vegetation which can lead to varied subsurface flow and runoff formation hümann et al 2011 one of the most common locations in czechia where peat bogs occur is the šumava mts where they affect both water quality and hydrological regime čurda et al 2011 ferda et al 1971 janský kocum 2008 kocum et al 2016 vlček et al 2016 vlček et al 2017 peat bogs cover approximately 20 35 of the catchment areas in this region bufková et al 2010 but a larger proportion of these catchments is covered by mineral soils such as podzol although peat bogs do not dominate the catchment area their hydrological regime can determine runoff processes of the whole catchment namely in terms of flashy hydrographs and reduced outflow in rain less periods vlček et al 2012 kocum et al 2016 moreover the contribution of peat bogs to the total annual runoff remains unrevealed in these mixed areas many studies confirmed that in catchments formed by several soil types with their unique hydrological regimes it is important to understand each system because each one could have its impact on water storage or water chemical properties kirchner 2016 mcdonnell et al 2007 robinson et al 2013 uhlenbrook et al 2008 therefore several studies focus mainly on waterlogged riparian zones which represent connectivity areas between hillslopes and streams seibert et al 2009 von freyberg et al 2014 riparian zones in the šumava mts ore mts or jizerské mts form rather thin peaty buffers along streams with low water storage and flow delay several experimental catchments were also found where peat histosol creates only a part of a whole soil

peat bog formed by histosol and mineral soil podzol creates two separate hillslopes for a better evaluation of the peat bog impact on the catchment hydrology several catchments with various peat bog coverage but similar topography need to be compared or the utilization of a hydrological model suitable for two hydrologically different hillslopes is necessary rainfall runoff relationships can be predicted by a wide range of hydrological models abbott et al 1986 arnold et al 1998 bergström 1992 beven kirkby 1979 however models tailored to the characterisation of the hydrological regime of peat bogs are scarce price et al 2005 some attempts have been made by dunn and mackay 1996 using the shetran model to investigate the effect of drainage ditches lane et al 2004 utilised a modified topmodel benefitting from the high resolution digital elevation model for the prediction of saturation of the blanket peat environment lane and milledge 2012 used several topmodel modifications for the estimation of the peat drains influence on runoff generation ballard et al 2012 also used a simplified physically based model to simulate the runoff reaction and water table fluctuations of drained peatland in the uk in most cases the model performance was poorer in dry conditions lewis et al 2013 used a physically based geotop model for the identification of the hydrological response to afforestation in a small ireland catchment nevertheless the correct quantification of the runoff generation and particular water balance components is still encouraging in the peat bog environment because the models usually do not respect the acrotelm catotelm scheme holden burt 2003 the use of a box model such as hbv bergström 1992 is therefore an option because the box models compared to physically based ones seem to be favourable for the algorithmic convenience but as pointed out by mcdonnell 2003 they may also represent the way forward to match the appropriate level of understanding and behaviour of the hydrological systems the hbv is a semi distributed model where the catchment can be separated into different elevation zones as well as into different subcatchments the particular water fluxes are represented by different routines within each zone estimating snowaccumulation snowmelt evapotranspiration soil water storage groundwater level and runoff the total runoff equals to the sums of outflow out of all zones in particular subcatchments the objectives of this study are to identify runoff formation at the small experimental catchment at the vydra river headwater with emphasis on the following aspects i prove that mineral podzol hillslopes contributes more to the outflow during rain less periods and less during wet periods compared to peat bog hillslopes ii the annual outflow from peat bog hillslope is lower than from mineral podzol hillslope based on studies kocum et al 2016 and evans et al 1999 iii confirm that the simple box model can be used to predict runoff in the catchment formed simultaneously by peat bog and podzol hillslopes these aims were conducted using a newly designed box model representing the hydrological behaviour of the peat bog hillslope pb as well as the mineral soil podzol hillslope pb represented by an hbv light model the hydrological model is based on extensive measurements of the water regime in the peat bog environment during the six years 2014 19 additionally the pb hillslope water balance was estimated and contrasted with the adjacent hillslope formed by podzol soil the interest in hydrological behaviour of the peat bog areas is given by the ongoing effort to recover these environmentally important places and by other research topics concerning potential impact of climate change or bark beetle outbreak on hydrological processes at the šumava national park 2 site description the experimental catchment is located in the central šumava mts as a part of the vydra river headwaters area fig 1 the climate in this area is variable subject to both oceanic and continental influence using the köppen climate classification the site lies in the dfc climate zone tolasz 2007 which is characterised by a subarctic climate with an approximately uniform precipitation distribution the annual amount of precipitation from the nearby meteorological station at a similar altitude equals 1695 mm yr 1 1981 2010 starostová 2012 and the average daily air temperature is 4 8 c ca 15 km the rokytka catchment ro occupies 3 8 km2 and about 30 of the area is covered by peat or other hydromorphic soils fig 1a for a better understanding of local hydrological processes a small tributary of rokytka rp has been selected rp has an area of 0 65 km2 where more than 60 is covered by peat fig 1a red border and 1b the rp catchment was also selected for its special morphology it is divided into two main hillslopes in east west directions each site with different vegetation and soil cover the soil cover of the ro catchment 3 8 km2 is a typical example of šumava mts soils where a vertical sequence of several soil types with histosols is common the area is mostly covered by entic podzol and organic soils mainly histosol in certain concave parts of the catchment gleysol can be found vlček et al 2016 the soil cover of the small rp catchment 0 65 km2 is more homogeneous and differs in two dominant hillslopes the soil profiles are similar throughout each hillslope without a clear gradient towards the stream the soil type of western pz hillslope has been identified as an entic podzol with a shallow organic top layer 5 cm and similar soil texture to a depth of 1 m some small parts of the pz hillslope are covered by haplic podzol but these areas are hardly identifiable without an excavation neither there was a sharp transition between the mineral soil and the bedrock well weathered gneiss or granite perceptible with electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements nor a persistent groundwater level could be detected vlček et al 2017 supplements fig s1 the eastern pb hillslope is created by a well developed raised ombrogenous peat bog with dominant soil type histosol with depth varies from 0 5 m lower part to ca 6 m top part both hillslopes of the small rp catchment can be nicely visible by the vegetation cover while vegetation relates closely to soils fig 2 b the western mineral soil podzol hillslope is covered by beech stands at the upper hillslope zone dead spruce stands picea abies l karst with healthy seedlings cover the lower hillslope zone and the addition of fir abies alba mill and beech fagus sylvatica l due to the bark beetle calamity outbreak most of the spruce stands deceased the forest is being filled slowly mainly by spruce seedlings and grasses the eastern hillslope is created by a well developed raised ombrogenous peat bog where three vegetation subsections can be found the upper subsection of the peat bog is covered mostly by cotton grass eriophorum l or moss sphagnum l with many small lakes the middle subsection has the lowest water table fluctuation and the vegetation cover consists of pine pinus mugo blueberry and moss the lowest subsection occupies the bottom of the valley and is covered by waterlogged spruce forest with blueberry and moss some of the spruce trees are also affected by bark beetle bufková 2009 3 methodology 3 1 field measurements the experimental site is equipped with an automatic system for measuring meteorological variables with wireless data transmission the fundamental measurements necessary for this study were composed of air temperature and relative humidity fiedler rv12 rk5 cze which were measured directly in the ro catchment the global radiation kipp zonen cmp3 nl precipitation and wind speed fiedler cze were available from the modrava meteorological station located 5 7 km from the catchment divide all the above mentioned data were measured at 10 minute intervals fig 3 during years 2013 19 the snow pillow located in the ro catchment was used to measure snow water equivalent and snow depth in a one hour time step since the winter 2015 2016 data available for the last four winters 2016 19 the snow pillow located in the ro catchment was used to measure snow water equivalent swe and snow depth in a one hour time step in two winters 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 soil water regime was measured at the pz hillslope at two places upper and lower part at two depths 20 and 60 cm by soil tensiometers t8 ums company their position was chosen according to previous soil survey and the vegetation cover described above the volumetric soil water content was inferred from the pressure heads by means soil water retention curves that were determined by the pressure apparatus soilmoisture usa in the laboratory the parameters of the soil water retention curves are documented in table 1 and more thoroughly in the previous study vlček et al 2017 fig 3c shows the average values of volumetric soil water contents at 20 and 60 cm respectively groundwater level fig 3d was measured by a tsh22 hydrostatic submersible level probe fiedler cze and represents the average value of all three measured sites which were placed uniformly at the pb hillslope groundwater level fluctuates between the surface 0 cm and a depth of 40 cm below the surface the average value of the groundwater level was 18 cm below the surface catchment outlets were equipped with automatic measuring stations fiedler ams company at both catchments rp ro water levels in 10 min step were measured at ro outlet by ultrasonic level probe us3200 at rp outlet by pressure sensor with hydro logger h40 water level data was then transferred to discharge by rating curves for each profile 3 2 hydrological processes used in the model the structure of the model is based on an estimation of dominant preferential flow according to boorman et al 1995 and scherrer and naef 2003 moreover it is supplemented and modified according to the authorś field experiences from the local study sites and other studies dealing with similar research topics explained further the model consists of two main systems which represent two hillslopes with dominant soil types podzol histosol respectively table 2 each hillslope is divided into several sub basins which are connected by links corresponding to real hydrological processes or dominant preferential flows in this case we use the term sub basin as a soil layer soil part with similar hydro pedological processes or water regime the structure of hydrological processes at each dominant hillslope of the rp catchment described below is visible in fig 2a 3 3 podzol hillslope pz pz1 upper sub basin pz1 represents a soil layer entic podzol the overland flow was not recognised at this hillslope even during heavy rainfall events 40 mm day 1 near surface biomat flow gerke et al 2015 was proved by water sampling from different soil horizons in an excavated profile and by sprinkling experiment vlček et al 2017 from sub basin pz1 water flows into two sub basins both representing regolith with different flow delay sub basin pz2 represents macropore flow proved at this locality by vlček et al 2017 sub basin pz3 shows a deep percolation with a slow flow velocity which could be estimated by hydraulic conductivity of the lower soil layer 0 3 mm h 1 the transition between soil and a regolith is gradual since ert measurements did not find any visible change in electrical resistivity except solitaire rocks 3 4 peat bog hillslope pb peat bogs contain in general two main hydropedological layers acrotelm and catotelm their hydrological behaviour was nicely described besides others by holden and burt 2003 and also at the ro catchment by vlček et al 2017 while acrotelm can form a fast shallow subsurface flow or biomat flow it is hard to distinguish between biomat flow and saturated overland flow therefore we joined these processes together in one fast shallow or surface flow the main hydrological process of pb hillslope is situated by the model in sub basin pb1 which represents acrotelm and a thin upper part layer of catotelm a shallow subsurface flow biomat flow was estimated as a dominant process not only in this locality vlček et al 2017 but also in other peaty areas evans et al 1999 holden burt 2003 overland flow occurs when an acrotelm gets fully saturated with water the saturated overland flow was visible during heavy rainfall also at the rokytka pb hillslope in general most of peat bog springs can dry up during summer while they are fed by a shallow layer of soil especially by an acrotelm and or a thin upper layer of catotelm in the case of the non drying spring catotelm caused a continuous flow this hydrological process is enhanced at drained peat bogs where drain bottoms lay below groundwater level the hydrological behaviour of springs precisely water level fluctuation was used in the model as another flow process from sub basin pb1 at the range between acrotelm and catotelm fig 2 the lower border of the pb1 sub basin cannot be unfortunately exactly determined while it depends on a groundwater level morphology or slope of a peat bog except for the two above mentioned flows from the pb1 sub basin overland biomat flow and flow from springs the other two possible downward flows could be found the first sub basin pb2 means a fast flow a quick response to a rainfall event called a pipe flow as discussed by jones 1997 holden and burt 2003 and uchida et al 2005 pipes extend horizontally while they are created mainly by partly decayed wood or by big pores originated from peat drying or erosion the second slow flow pb3 sub basin corresponds to a deep percolation with a flow velocity similar to the hydraulic conductivity of the peat in catotelm 1 cm day 1 field in situ measurements holden et al 2001 the downwards direction is driven by gravity forces and could be called a piston flow water flows from pb and pz hillslope into the stream creating an outflow from the catchment both hillslopes are also affected by evapotranspiration from the upper sub basins at each site pz1 and pb1 3 5 model description the utilised model is based on the hbv scheme bergström 1992 which was for the peat bog domain modified to be in line with the acrotelm catotelm concept as proposed by ingram 1978 the modelling domain was split into two different zones representing two distinct parts of the catchment pb hillslope modified hbv and pz hillslope standard hbv scheme each domain was represented by its model structure differing mainly in the character of the runoff reaction to rainfall for the estimation of the total catchment runoff the outflow of both zones was summed with respect to the areal distribution of both domains peat covering 60 of the area before the hbv model modification several restricting assumptions were defined the flashiness of the hydrograph episodic measurements of the spring discharge from the mineral soil and peat bog parts of the catchment in the case of the peat bog the difference between the maximum 2 1 l s 1 pz hillslope 19 1 l s 1 pb hillslope and minimum discharge 0 01 l s 1 pz hillslope 0 8 l s 1 pb hillslope was 10 times higher than from mineral soil hence if a better value of an objective function was obtained during the calibration and this ratio was outside the interval from 9 to 10 then the parameter set was omitted threshold relation between groundwater level in the peat bog and observed discharge the small contribution of the peat bog water to the total runoff during low flow periods kocum et al 2016 reported an approximately 10 contribution of the peat bog water to the total flow in the area based on isotope analyses evapotranspiration takes places only from the acrotelm and catotelm generally has invariable water content holden burt 2003 the average specific yield from the peat bog should range between 0 2 and 0 3 respecting the study of bourgault et al 2017 who quantified the specific yield of moss the standard model in the hbv light scheme seibert vis 2012 with a soil box pz1 and two groundwater storages upper pz2 and lower pz3 was used for the pz mineral soil domain pz hillslope covering 40 of the catchment the only modification was that the water was allowed to form runoff from the soil box following the relative permeability equation brooks corey 1964 eq 1 hence runoff is produced as a sum of outflows from the soil box pz1 qpz1 eq 1 and both groundwater storages pz2 and pz3 qpz2 and qpz3 eqs 2 and 3 actual evapotranspiration aet is allowed to take place only from the soil box pz1 and is proportional to the saturation of the soil profile and pet eq 4 rainfall is divided into the part that enters the soil box and the one immediately

and gwrchrg is the part of precipitation directly percolating to pz2 or pb3 the pb domain 60 of the rp catchment was based on two subsurface storages representing acrotelm and catotelm in which the rainfall was split into based on eq 5 as in the original hbv model the upper acrotelm box pb1 was subject to evapotranspiration eq 6 and generated three forms of the runoff first overland flow and biomatflow qsurq occur when soil is saturated and all water from the precipitation is immediately drained to the stream eq 7 second water from acrotelm and an upper part of catotelm feeds springs

activated potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated for both hillslopes in the same way using the combined method of penman monteith monteith 1965 eq 11 fig 3b besides the meteorological variables such as air temperature wind speed and vapour pressure the net radiation represents one of the fundamental inputs in this approach the potential evapotranspiration was calculated as follows

daily average sums of radiation net radiation consists of shortwave and longwave radiation balance while shortwave radiation is available at the site kipp zonen cmp3 netherlands the fao56 allen et al 1998 approach was used to calculate longwave radiation to avoid calculation errors due to using of default sets of coefficients in the fao56 equation we used calibrated coefficients that lead to more accurate results for longwave radiation balance and subsequently pet values kofroňová et al 2019 the snow accumulation and snowmelt were modelled based on the degree day method gupta 2001 as the necessary data for the radiation balance approach were not available 3 6 model calibration the model was calibrated in the rp catchment using the data from the period of hydrological years 2014 2016 the three following years 2017 2019 were used for the validation all the parameters were determined using the genetic algorithm with the rmse as an objective function before the calibration the sensitivity analyses sa was conducted in order to investigate the influence of particular coefficients on the model performance the sa procedure was based on changing one parameter at a time with the remaining ones being fixed pianosi et al 2016 the initial fixed values of model parameters were obtained from the very first calibration of the model the sensitivity of the discharge to the changes in the input model parameters was observed by calculating the rate of change of the objective function rmse in our case supplements fig s2 the results indicated that the model is sensitive especially to the changes of snow parameters especially the temperature thresholds field capacity and relative contribution of rainfall to runoff of the pb domain fcpb βpb suzsurq pb determining the threshold for the surface runoff in the pb domain and k4 parameter governing the contribution of the lower groundwater box to the runoff in pb domain the sensitivity and ranges recommended in the hbv manual of particular parameters are shown in the supplementary materials fig s2 and table s1 the model calibration was conducted in three steps as it was necessary to determine 22 model parameters in particular steps the selected parameters were calibrated with respect to observed values of snow water equivalent step 1 soil moisture content groundwater level height step 2 and discharge step 3 respectively first four parameters were necessary to estimate snow accumulation and snowmelt step 1 these were tsnow threshold snowfall temperature tmelt threshold snowmelt temperature cfmax snowmelt rate and sfcf snowfall correction factor these parameters were optimised to match the course of snow water equivalent obtained from the snow pillow second the parameters influencing the water regime in the soil pz1 and acrotelm pb1 were calibrated against measurements of four tensiometers placed in the mineral soil and three piezometers in the peat bog step 2 these measured datasets were compared to pz1 and pb1 boxes in the model three parameters were common for both domains but were calibrated separately fc field capacity lp soil moisture value above which aet reaches pet β a parameter that determines the relative contribution to runoff from rain or snowmelt for the podzol hillslope three additional parameters were necessary ks saturated hydraulic conductivity θr residual soil water content and θs saturated soil water in the second step the parameters from the first step were kept fixed at the optimised values the same applied for the final third step with the parameters from the first two for the estimation of runoff step 3 three coefficients were necessary for the podzol hillslope k1 and k2 storage coefficients and the non linearity coefficient αpz three storage coefficients k2 k5 and non linearity coefficient αpb were required for the outflow of the lower groundwater storage zones one for pz and one for pb domain additionally two thresholds suzsurq pb and uzl governing the runoff formation from acrotelm were needed all the parameters in step 3 were optimised with respect to observed discharge 4 results 4 1 climate and hydrological characteristics of the studied period the studied period included two years with above average 2014 2016 and four years with below average precipitation 2015 2017 2019 the precipitation records showed years 2014 and 2016 were wetter than average by 5 and 13 respectively contrarily the years 2015 and 2017 2019 attained only 56 90 of the long term precipitation amounts all these long term data originate from the liz station operating since 1976 in the distance of 20 km from the rp catchment as there is no climate station operating longer than 30 years at a insufficient distance storm hydrographs at the catchments rp 0 65 km2 and ro 3 8 km2 were highly variable and could be characterised by quick and steep rising and falling limbs the hydrological response to rainfall events was fast and the recession to antecedent base flow occurred rather quickly fig 3e f in the study period the mean daily runoff equalled to 3 6 mm day 1 1329 mm y 1 at the ro outlet the rp attained an average runoff of 3 4 mm day 1 1297 mm y 1 mean annual maximum flow mhq of ro was 7 1 mm day 1 and mean annual minimum flow mnq was 1 4 mm day 1 mhq of rp was 8 3 mm day 1 and mnq equalled to 1 3 mm day 1 the difference in maximum and minimum flow between ro 3 8 km2 and rp 0 65 km2 is possibly caused by a difference in peat coverage ro 30 peat bog coverage rp 60 and it confirms the hydrologic behaviour of local streams ferda et al 1971 čurda et al 2011 kocum et al 2016 the differences in annual discharges between ro and ro are discussed more in chapter 5 3 4 2 hydrological simulation the nash sutcliffe coefficient reached 0 64 in the model calibration 2014 2016 and the rmse was 3 0 mm day 1 the nash sutcliffe ranged between 0 58 and 0 71 if the errors originating in the timing of the major snowmelt events were omitted excluding 10 values out of 1558 simulated days then the rmse would decrease approximately to 2 4 mm day 1 and nash sutcliffe would rise to the value of 0 72 hence the model performance statistics were strongly influenced by the estimation of the snow accumulation and melt during four winter periods also proved by the sa in the validation period 2017 2019 the nash sutcliffe coefficient equalled to 0 56 however it was again strongly influenced by the wrongly estimated snowmelt episodes if these were omitted then the nash sutcliffe would rice to more than 0 60 the rmses of the soil water content in the pz domain and groundwater level in the pb domain are shown in fig 4 in the validation period the rmse increased to 14 3 mm concerning the soil water content from 12 0 mm in the calibration period and from 10 5 mm to 15 2 mm considering the groundwater level in acrotelm moreover the model performance was checked by extending the simulated area to the entire ro catchment covering 3 8 km2 having the different percentage of catchment covered by peat bog 30 compared to 60 in the case of rp the average nash sutcliffe coefficient reached 0 66 which is also asatisfactory value hence the model can predict runoff formation from the catchments with different coverage of the peat bog the rmses of the soil water content in the pz domain and groundwater level in the pb domain are shown in fig 4 in the validation period the rmse of the soil water content increased to 14 3 mm from 12 0 mm in the calibration period and to 15 2 mm from 10 5 mm in the case of groundwater level in acrotelm the comparison of outflow and groundwater level data from the peat bog hillslope area usually shows that an increase in outflow appears at times of higher groundwater level fig 5 for a specific threshold which is formed by an interface between an acrotelm and a catotelm groundwater level stops increasing while outflow discharge starts increasing some measurements are however quite far from the most common shape the same behaviour was observed in simulated data fig 5 right model hbv estimated the threshold between an acrotelm and a catotelm to be slightly higher than observed moreover during the full saturation the model estimated lower discharge events than were observed altogether the simulated discharges correspond sufficiently to the observed data for both modelled catchments rp fig 6 upper and ro fig 6 lower nevertheless thesimulation of peaks high discharges and snowmelt periods is a weak point in the calibration period thirteen peak discharges higher than 20 mm day 1 were underestimated on 34 1 on average this underestimation rose to 48 0 in the validation period 11 events the snow water equivalent was estimated with the average daily rmse equal to 21 7 mm in the calibration period the average value was 111 4 mm eventhough this was a better efficiency than showed e g by šípek and tesař 2017 focused on the nearby liz experimental catchment when seasonal rmse ranged from 5 9 to 10 8 mm with the annual average observed swe equal to 18 6 mm the representativeness of the snow pillow measurements concetnin the spatial extend of the rp catchment remained a key issue as the timing of the observed runoff occasionally slightly shifted from the simulated values based on calibrated swe finally even though fig 6 contains comparisons of two catchments with different sizes of peat coverage ro and rp the errors in simulated discharges is of the same character regardless the percentage of peat coverage 4 3 contribution of pb hillslope to the streamflow the pb hillslope generally contributes higher annual runoff volume to the total runoff than pz hillslope by 175 mm i e 17 in the period 2014 2019 fig 7 however this higher runoff was restricted to events with higher observed discharge in these events the contribution of pb hillslope to the total flow was often over 80 with a maximum of 98 on the other hand the ratio of pb hillslope contribution to total outflow was low during low flow periods when pb hillslope formed up to 15 of the total flow the results document the propensity of peat bog to generate runoff when higher precipitation falls on well saturated organic soil on the other hand in periods without significant precipitation the runoff was dominated by the outflow from the mineral soil albeit forming a smaller portion of total flow volume on average altogether higher runoff from pb hillslope was observed in 17 of the simulated days 4 4 simulated water balance the simulated runoff differed from the observed runoff on average by 6 7 in the period of hydrological years 2014 2019 the highest difference was observed in the year 2015 simulated runoff was lower by 24 which was the warmest year with the lowest amount of precipitation table 3 the simulated and observed runoff coefficients equalled 74 9 and 80 3 respectively this indicated the importance of the upper mountain regions in terms of runoff formation as the average runoff coefficient equalled 26 8 in czechia tolasz 2007 the estimated average annual actual evapotranspiration equalled 489 mm yr 1 for the mineral soil 81 of pet fig 7 and 319 mm yr 1 for the peat bog area 59 of pet on average the actual evapotranspiration of the whole rp catchment was 386 mm yr 1 and its annual course corresponded to the observed precipitation amounts i e was highest in 2016 and lowest in 2015 5 discussion models can estimate answers to hydrological questions where standard field measurements among reasons such as short time of measurements or any spatial restrictions are not sufficient in the case of the rokytka catchment ro previous measurements could not evaluate sufficiently the shallow and deep subsurface flow contribution to the total runoff at both slopes nor could they estimate the pb hillslope contribution to the outflow during low flow periods the input data as well as the performance of the hydrological model can be biased with several uncertainties first the amount of available precipitation can be underestimated with standard rain gauges the reason is that the measurements from the rain gauges may contain significant errors especially in the winter period dingman 2015 thus even the corrected amount of winter precipitation is still uncertain because the estimation of precipitation in mountains is accompanied by several deficiencies sevruk 2005 then major drawback in the model performance was given by the snowmelt and the snow accumulation melt routine based on the degree day approach in general this approach was insufficient in the estimation of the timing of the snowmelt causing significant errors in the model s prediction of spring discharge the degree day approach is a standard method used in several hydrological models to estimate the evolution of snow cover however nevertheless the overall performance of the modified hbv model both in the calibration and validation period corresponded to the median of error statistics for 59 czech catchments with variable spatial extend reported recently by jeníček and ledvinka 2020 using the same model similar model efficiencies were presented by hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2015 in four catchments in norway contrarily better model performance can be found in studies by etter et al 2017 or jeníček et al 2018 focusing mainly on significantly larger catchments moreover the hbv model efficiency proved to be dependent on the chosen calibration period merz et al 2011 water content in the upper soil layers seemed to be simulated reliably in both domains especially in the mineral soil the model s prediction of the water regime in acrotelm was slightly less efficient than expected which is mainly due to the micro topography of the peat bog the soil water regime in acrotelm was characterised using water level measurements obtained from three piezometers each of them placed in a different part of the bog hence we used their arithmetical average which might not accurately represent the behaviour of the entire peat bog the different behaviour of the groundwater level measurements in a single peat bog probe was reported by kellner and halldin 2002 finally the determination of the runoff pathways was a result of the model design using the runoff generation mechanisms obtained from the literature without the use of tracer experiments or isotope analyses the ratio among them is still uncertain and will be an object of our further research nevertheless as the sensitivity of the runoff separation to model parameters were inspected the percentage of fast shallow subsurface flow in each domain was found to be determined strictly and unambiguously by the values of rmse and the required ratio of pb pz peak discharges the most influential parameters characterised the water regime in the soil pz1 and acrotelm pb1 fcpb pz βpb pz ks and θr their influence on the fast subsurface flow ratio is shown in supplementary materials fig s3 all remaining model parameters affected the fast shallow subsurface flow only in terms of single percents one of the major results of this study was the estimation of the peat bog water balance and its contrast with the adjacent mineral soil more accurate estimation of the rate of evapotranspiration was missing at the site it was based on the observed soil water regime in both modelling domains however the results can be masked by the uncertain determination of the fluxes in different flow pathways several authors have focused on the estimation of aet in the peat bog environment but as far as the authors know no study contrasted its value with the nearby mineral soil the annual evapotranspiration of the pb hillslope at the rp catchment ranged from 279 to 348 mm 18 28 of available precipitation which is a lower amount than reported in the nearby albeit located at lower altitude forest environment 50 šípek tesař 2017 it is also lower than previously reported ratios of aet to precipitation by lafleur et al 2005 however the annual rate and daily averages 1 1 mm day 1 and maxima 3 5 mm day 1 correspond to those found by sottocornola and kiely 2010 the most pronounced reason probably lies in the reduced evapotranspiration of peat bog due to the formation of a crust when dry likely isolating the peat top from lower wet layers as documented by sottocornola and kiely 2010 the formation of the surface crust was observed during field surveys in dry periods furthermore cloud water as a significant amount of precipitation can also reduce the rate of aet heal et al 2004 eliáš et al 1995 described the influence of cloud water on the water balance in the nearby lower lying site to be around 7 10 of the total precipitation moreover the differences may be also caused by the different occurrence of the vegetation and free water surface in the peat bog which was stressed by sottocornola and kiely 2010 it must be noted that the ratio of peat bog histosol and podzol soil evapotranspiration may be affected by the number of dry or wet years in the study 5 1 podzol hillslope hydrological processes simulated outflow from podzol hillslope 1083 mm per year fig 7 is divided by the model in a fast preferential flow and slow percolation fast preferential flow includes shallow subsurface flow or biomat flow defined by gerke et al 2015 as the surface flow was not recognised at this site almost all water from rainfall infiltrates into the soil however a sprinkling experiment vlček et al 2017 identified near surface lateral flow fast runoff process at mineral soil hillslope was estimated to be 338 mm of the total fig 7 thus not a dominant hydrological process the sprinkling experiment showed a biomat flow as a dominant preferential flow in local mineral soil except deep percolation however the experiment covers only a small area 2 25 m2 and a near sub surface flow can reduce by variable soil topography such as small depressions these surface segmentations caused by fallen and uprooted trees could affect outflow during rain events by forming small storage spaces with a low infiltration capacity field observation slow flow nicely correlated with infiltration tests where the infiltration capacity was estimated in an order of less than mm h 1 jačka et al 2014 vlček et al 2017 geophysical surveys ert measurements did not show any visible threshold or barrier to possible vertical flow together with surface topographic variability available observed patterns and measured chosen features section 3 2 indicated that the dominant hillslope runoff process should be a slow deep percolation into regolith or bedrock this type of runoff process creates water supply for springs during rainless periods our model confirms a dominant slow percolation on the mineral hillslope 777 mm of a total 1115 mm yr 1 5 2 peat bog hillslope hydrological processes compared to mineral soil peat bog is known for its quick response of saturated overland flow events holden burt 2003 similar runoff formation is visible at the ro catchments peat bog side during a period of high groundwater level and heavy rainfall this is also proven by the shape of the groundwater level runoff chart fig 5 and in the study done by evans et al 1999 a quick response of an outflow from a peat bog to a rainfall event could be caused by overland flow near surface flow in an acrotelm or pipe flow through a whole peat bog holden burt 2002 jones 1997 uchida et al 2005 these mentioned runoff processes were joined to the fast flow and were estimated as the dominant runoff formation processes with the contribution of 969 mm to the total outflow fig 7 a slow runoff process at the pb hillslope was formed by a deep percolation to bedrock and a small contribution to the stream from the upper layer acrotelm and thin upper part of the catotelm the first mentioned process percolation is driven by the hydrological conductivity of peat the mass of water in a peat bog can also cause a pressure height condition in a lower layer of a peat bog and could cause a piston flow into an underlying substrate the second mentioned process small contribution to a stream is visible at banks of a stream or drainage channels or at places where sites with higher slope occur water is therefore forced to leak out from the peat similar processes can be found in drained peatlands schot et al 2004 in some cases this outflow leads to spring formation however this process is strictly dependent on the depth of the groundwater level worrall et al 2007 these two above mentioned hydrological processes form a minor but significant slow runoff formation at the pb hillslope the contribution of slow processes to the total outflow from the rp catchment was estimated to be 325 mm fig 7 5 3 hillslopes contribution to the total runoff a discharge from a peat bog is unstable with a high quick response to rainfall events and visible spring drying during drought as compared to discharge from mineral soil evans et al 1999 ferda et al 1971 janský kocum 2008 it was also shown in measured data from the rp catchment in the comparison of measured and modelled annual discharges from this study pb hillslope at the rp catchment contributed to the outflow with an annual 1294 mm on average more than outflow from the pz hillslope fig 7 however the decision on the question from which soil flows more water is not so clear it depends mainly on soil saturation depth of groundwater level or an amount of rainfall evans et al 1999 showed that discharge in a peatland starts increasing at a specific depth of groundwater level this hydrological behaviour was also confirmed in the rp catchment fig 5 some studies such as blažková et al 2002 work also with a spatial variability of the saturated area in time in the case of rp and ro catchments water table depth have influenced the hydrological regime more while the size of waterlogged areas varies very little in general during wet years when a peat bog is saturated higher outflow occurs from a peaty area then from mineral soils while dry periods can cause drying of spring from peat histosol mean annual minimum flow rp 1 3 mm day 1 ro 1 4 mm day 1 and mean annual maximum flow rp 16 0 mm day 1 ro 13 6 mm day 1 from experimental catchments rp and ro moreover based on the hydrological soil type and its dominant runoff formation process boorman et al 1995 scherrer naef 2003 peat histosols transfers faster rainwater during rainfall event into a stream compare to mineral soil such as podzol 6 conclusion this study estimated the hydrological contribution of two hillslopes with two dominant soil types having different hydrological regimes field observations experiments and monitoring of soil moisture at the podzol hillslope groundwater level at the peat bog hillslope and streamflow were analysed to describe the water regime of each hillslope moreover hydrological models hbv were modified and used in this research to distinguish fast and slow flow at each hillslope the model confirms previous studies that peat bog is characterised by a quick response to a rainfall event however it also contributed to the stream via slow flow 36 of the flow from the peat bog hillslope this slow flow was determined as a piston flow through peat at the mineral soil podzol hillslope the dominant subsurface flow was estimated to be deep percolation reaching 71 of the mineral soil outflow in general raised ombrogenous peat bog contributes slightly more than mineral soil podzol to the outflow while its evapotranspiration is lower during years with an excess of precipitation more water flows from the peat bog hillslope but during dry years more water is drained from the mineral soil podzol hillslope this analysis therefore improves our knowledge about how soils contribute to a stream during rainfall events base flow and drought periods 7 data availability

4984,riverine co2 outgassing constitutes the important vertical conduit in global carbon cycle and affects climate change in order to investigate the factors that control riverine pco2 and co2 diffusion rate fco2 river water samples were collected in the mainstream and 42 tributaries of xijiang river a karst river during the dry season in 2015 the pco2 varied from 260 to 6354μatm with a mean value of 1765μatm indicating most of the samples were oversaturated with respect to co2 compared to atmosphere the ph pco2 and hco3 exhibited clearly spatial distribution pattern that ph and hco3 decreased along the flow direction while the pco2 increased along the flow direction theoretical calculation indicated that the water temperature fluctuation bio degradation respiration photosynthetic activities and anthropogenic acidic inputs were not the reasonable explanations the lithologic differences essentially predominated the riverine ph pco2 and hco3 the upper reaches of xijiang river flow through karst carbonate terrain and thus exhibited high ph hco3 concentrations meanwhile low pco2 the spatial distribution of ph pco2 and hco3 became visible as the continuous addition of silicate weathering products with low ph and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations the mixing calculation indicated the dic concentrations of silicate weathering should lower than 0 5 mmol l the calculated fco2 of xijiang river ranged between 38 6 and 1579 8 mmol m2 d with a mean value of 574 8 mmol m2 d and median value of 410 9 mmol m2 d fco2 exhibited obviously lower values in karst terrain compared that in silicate terrains because carbonate weathering results in high ph of karst rivers which caused the low relative proportion of pco2 in dic more estimations of co2 outgassing rate from the karst rivers are required due to the unique characteristics and geochemical process in karst landform keywords riverine carbon flux partial pressure of co2 co2 outgassing xijiang river karst 1 introduction rivers transport abundant terrestrial carbon to the oceans constituting the lateral channel of the globe carbon cycle gaillardet et al 1999 regnier et al 2013 the riverine carbon flux comprises dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc particulate inorganic carbon pic and particulate organic carbon poc among which dic is the important component and makes up 45 of globally total flux meybeck 1987 dic is the sum of the h2co3 i e the sum of aqueous co2 and hydrated co2 hco3 bicarbonate and co3 2 carbonate their relative concentrations at equilibrium are controlled by ph and temperature clark and fritz 1997 the high partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in river water compared to that in the atmosphere causes the co2 outgassing from river water to atmosphere which gets a growing interest in global carbon cycle butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 the present day bulk c input to freshwater was estimated 2 7 2 9 pg petagrams of carbon per year while the co2 evasion from inland waters is estimated 1 8 pg c per year with large uncertains raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 co2 diffusion flux links the continental atmospheric and oceanic c pools and can largely affect the global climate change and earth s energy budget berner and kothavala 2001 friedlingstein et al 2001 the co2 outgassing is controlled by turbulent energy exchange across the interface and the concentration differences between the gas in river water and atmosphere zappa et al 2007 the turbulent energy exchange can be expressed by a constant gas transfer velocity which is affected by the environmental variables such as temperature river run off flow velocity water depth and wind speed alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 recent studies also revealed that gas transfer velocities of rivers may be predicted over a large range of spatial scales by using these environmental variables alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 riverine pco2 reflects the carbon dynamics and terrestrial biogeochemical processes and also reveals the relative source or sink of river c pool for atmospheric c pool li et al 2012 yao et al 2007 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a generally the controlling factors of riverine pco2 are complex the production and transport of soil co2 chemical weathering products influx and instream bio degradation respiration and photosynthetic activities can affect the riverine pco2 abril et al 2005 pu et al 2017 raymond et al 1997 telmer and veizer 1999 yao et al 2007 calculation of dataset indicated that over 96 of inland waters are oversaturated with respect to co2 compared to atmosphere and 82 have the pco2 at least twice that of atmosphere regnier et al 2013 for example previous studies examined the rivers system such as amazon mississippi yangtze river and found that the pco2 in river water was much higher than that in atmosphere indicating a violent co2 outgassing alin et al 2011 dubois et al 2010 wang et al 2011a the riverine carbon emission data in asia is relatively deficient especially the karst rivers li et al 2012 richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 thus to get a better understanding of riverine carbon dynamics intensive sampling and scrupulous analysis of the riverine pco2 and co2 outgassing needs to be conducted the xijiang river basin is characterized by its wide distributed karst terrain the geochemical and hydrologic processes have been well examined by the previous studies li et al 2008 liu and han 2020a 2020b wang et al 2019 2020b zeng and han 2020a 2020b to our knowledge only yao et al 2007 have examined pco2 and co2 outgassing in small sub watershed of xijiang river basin yao et al 2007 few studies have systematically examined pco2 and co2 outgassing of different channels and tributaries in the whole river basin this study completed an extensive sampling campaign that collected mainstream and 42 tributaries in xijiang river during the dry season the objectives of this study are to investigate the controlling factors of riverine pco2 as well as to calculate the co2 outgassing rate of the whole river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the xijiang river located in the southeast asian karst region originates from maxiong mountain on the yunnan guizhou plateau and then flows through four provinces and discharges into the south china sea xu and liu 2007 yao et al 2007 as the largest tributary of zhujiang river pearl river xijiang river is the second largest river water system with a drainage area of 3 5 105 km2 21 31 26 49 n 102 14 e 115 53 e liu and han 2020a 2020b controlled by the sub tropic monsoon climate the majority of rainfalls 70 concentrated in the wet season from march to september the annual rainfall varied from 1200 to 2200 mm year the annual mean air temperature ranges between 14 and 22 zeng and han 2020b zhen et al 2016 xijiang river can be divided into the following channel the nanpanjiang river the beipanjiang river beipanjiang river is largest tributary in upper reaches of xijiang river the hongshuihe river the qianjiang river the xunjiang river and the xijiang river fig 1 the upper reaches comprise the nanpanjiang river the beipanjiang river the hongshuihe river which the lower reaches consist of the qianjiang river the xunjiang river and the xijiang river both the largest tributary of zhujiang river and the river near the estuary of zhujiang river delta are called xijiang river there are distinct lithologic and topographical differences between the upper reaches and lower reaches han et al 2018 the upper reaches of xijiang river flow through the bedrock mainly composed of permian and triassic sulfide rich limestones and dolomites where the karst topography is well developed li et al 2008 2010a the area of karst topography in xijiang river basin is 155 000 km2 and accounts for 45 area of the total watershed liu and han 2020b the territory is mountains and hills with the altitude ranging between 200 and 2000 m while in the lower reaches the basin mostly contains precambrian metamorphic rocks gneiss and magmatic rocks granite the territory is fairly flat with the altitude varying from 0 to 80 m 2 2 sampling and analyses strategies the sampling covering 24 sampling sites in mainstream and 67 sampling sites in the tributary 42 tributaries in total were conducted in the xijiang river basin between 12th jan 2015 and 27th jan 2015 during the dry season the geographical distribution of sampling sites was exhibited in fig 1and supplementary table 1 2 table s1 and table s2 there were not stormsorheavyrainfall occurring during the sampling period the weathering in most sample sites were sunny all the samples were collected in daytime to avoid the effect of diel sunlight and temperature variation the hydrologic conditions from 2011 to 2015 including run off water level water temperature and precipitation were shown in figure s1 the sampling period had clearly low run off water level and precipitation all these facts indicated the samples can represent the hydrologic condition under base flow season the water samples were collected under a depth about 50 cm from the center of the river from bridges and ferries the pre cleaned polyethylene bottles were used to store samples the physical chemical parameters including water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were determined in situ by using a multi parameter meter wtw multi 3320 germany the ph value was determined in situ by ph meter orion 230a ph temp meter with a precision of 0 02ph the ph meter was calibrated against buffering solutions of ph of 6 86 and 9 18 the alkalinity was titrated by 0 02 m hcl by titration ph meter and filtrated sample water on the sampling day samples were filtered through pre cleaned 0 22 μm millipore membrane replicate measurements were conducted with a precision of 0 03 unit for ph 0 1 c for t and 2 relative deviation of alkalinity respectively 2 3 calculation and data quality 2 3 1 dic and alkalinity calculation dic species comprise hco3 biocarbonate co3 2 carbonate h2co3 carbonate acid and aqueous co2 co2aq their relative proportions are controlled by the ph and water temperature clark and fritz 1997 the equilibrium between dic and atmosphere co2 can be described by temperature dependent dissociation constants and henry s law as eq 1 3 clark and fritz 1997 1 k co 2 h 2 co 3 p c o 2 1 0 7 1 0 5 t 2 0 016 t 1 11 2 k 1 h hco 3 h 2 co 3 1 0 1 1 1 0 4 t 2 0 012 t 6 58 3 k 2 h co 3 2 hco 3 1 0 9 1 0 5 t 2 0 0137 t 10 62 where h2co3 is the sum of co2aq and h2co3 ki are temperature dependent dissociation constants clark and fritz 1997 thus the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 and respective concentrations of dic species can be calculated by the measured ta total alkalinity water temperature ph the calculation is given as following eq 4 7 4 h c o 3 t a 1 0 p h 1 0 p h 2 k 2 5 p c o 2 h 2 c o 3 k c o 2 1 0 p h h c o 3 k c o 2 k 1 6 h 2 c o 3 1 0 p h h c o 3 k 1 7 c o 3 2 k 2 h c o 3 1 0 p h the calculation results are listed in the supplementary table 1 the calculation was also completed and checked by co2sys lewis et al 1998 the results were close to the above calculation because of the precision of ta ph and temperature measurement the relative uncertainty of the pco2 is about 3 however the non carbonate alkalinity nc alk such as nitrogen phosphors silicate and dissolved organic matters also contribute to the ta values hunt et al 2011 our previous study found that in xijiang river the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din was mainly composed of no3 90 and the dissolved phosphorus 10 μmol l and dissolved silicate exhibited low concentrations 0 15 mmol l compared to ta values 2 5 mmol l liu and han 2020b the dissolved organic carbon doc in xijiang river varied from 80 μmol l to 1100 μmol l with a mean value of 400 μmol l zou 2017 assuming the nc alk representing 36 of doc concentration hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 doc will contribute less than 5 of ta in fact previous studies indicate that the nc alk can be neglected when the river water is alkaline ph 7 4 hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 in xijiang river 90 samples presented ph value 7 4 thus the ta values in this study can be assumed all from carbonate indicating the above calculation is reasonable 2 3 2 co2 outgassing calculation the concentration difference between the gas in river water and atmosphere will cause a violent co2 diffusion the diffusion flux f can be calculated as eq 8 8 fc o 2 c o 2 water c o 2 air k where co2 water and co2 air are co2 concentrations in river water and atmosphere respectively k d z is the gas transfer velocity which is dominated by turbulent dissipation rate thus the diffusive flux is controlled by concentration gradient and turbulent dissipation rate cole et al 2007 zappa et al 2007 the k value used largely decides the calculation results and always is converted to a common schmidt number of 600 k600 raymond et al 2012 this value varies greatly 0 120 cm h because it can be affect by temperature river run off flow velocity water depth and wind speed alin et al 2011 aucour et al 1999 doctor et al 2008 marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 for the sampling sites located in the mainstream rivers 100 m wide the k600 value can be expressed as the following equation eq 9 9 k 600 4 46 7 11 u 10 where u10 is the average wind speed at 10 m for the sampling sites in tributaries the k600 value can be expressed as the following equation eq 10 10 k 600 13 82 7 11 w where w denotes water current velocity the relationships between k600 and environmental parameters u10 and w were report in alin et al 2011 to get the k values in different temperatures the k600 can be convert to kt using the eqs 11 12 11 k t k 600 600 s c t 0 5 12 s c t 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0 04132 t 3 where kt is the corrected k value at the in situ temperature t sct is the schmidt number for temperature t the wind speed in xijiang river ranged between 0 7 and 3 4 m s we assumed the average wind speed was 1 7 m s which was agreeswiththe previous local study by yao et al 2007 and the collected world large river data by alin et al 2011 the detail hydrologic data of xijiang river can be found in pearl river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources http www zwswj

statistics of dic and physic chemical parameters were shown in table 1 and fig 2 to compare dispersion between different datasets with different orders of magnitude the standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv were employed the sd and cv values indicated that the dispersion of parameters between the mainstream and tributary was similar the mean concentrations values of ec hco3 and pco2 had been influenced by the outliers thus both the mean concentration and median concentration were listed and discussed the water temperature had a wider range in the tributary varying from 10 2 to 26 6 compared that in the mainstream ranging between 11 4 and 18 8 the mean value and median value of temperature between mainstream and tributary are similar table 1 water temperature of most samples ranged between 14 0 and 20 0 fig 2 ph values in mainstream between 7 52 and 8 35 with a mean value of 7 97 and median value of 7 96 in the tributaries ph values varied from 6 96 and 8 75 with a mean value of 7 51 and median value of 7 80 this result demonstrated that the xijiang river water system was slightly alkaline and the samples in mainstream were more alkaline compared to that in tributary fig 2 when ph value ranged between 7 0 and 8 7 the dic species were predominated in the hco3 supplementary table s1 the concentrations of hco3 in most sampling sites ranged between 2000 and 3000 μmol l fig 2 the median value of hco3 was 2349 μmol l in the mainstream while 2424 μmol l in the tributary for most sampling sites the dissolved oxygen do level was below saturation do values varied from 81 7 to 122 7 in the mainstream with the median value of 93 2 from 68 2 to 116 6 in the tributaries with the median values of 94 2 respectively most of pco2 in xijiang river were above the atmospheric level fig 2 the pco2 in mainstream ranged between 523 and 3674μatm with a mean value of 1591μatm and median value of 1488μatm in the tributaries pco2 values presented a wide range between 260 and 6354μatm with a mean value of 1475μatm and median value of 2424μatm the cv values were higher than 0 40 indicating the pco2 in some sites exhibited extremely high or low level to better show the spatial variations of temperature ph pco2 hco3 dic and do along the flow direction the data was plotted against the distance from head water to the estuary in fig 3 the ph temperature dic hco3 and pco2 exhibited obviously spatial distribution pattern both in the mainstream and tributary the temperature and pco2 increased along the flow direction while ph and dic hco3 decrease along the flow direction the do did not show clearly spatial distribution 3 2 the diffusion rate of co2 the calculated co2 outgassing rate was shown in supplementary table s1 briefly fco2 in mainstream varied between 19 8 and 521 0 mmol m2 d with a mean value of 190 7 mmol m2 d and median value of 172 8 mmol m2 d in the tributaries fco2 was clearly higher than that in the mainstream it presented a wide range between 38 6 and 1579 8 mmol m2 d with a mean value of 574 8 mmol m2 d and median value of 410 9 mmol m2 d both in the mainstream and tributary the cv values were higher than 0 40 indicating the fco2 varied greatly in the xijiang river the difference of fco2 between the tributary and mainstream resulted from both the differences of pco2 levels and k values fig 4 exhibited that fco2 also increased along the flow direction 4 discussions 4 1 controlling factors of riverine pco2 generally the riverine pco2 or dic is essentially affected by the following geochemical processes 1 influx of weathering products or and soil co2 barth et al 2003 cartwright 2010 polsenaere and abril 2012 2 riverine bio degradation and respiration barth et al 2003 3 photosynthetic activities robinson et al 1999 4 co2 outgassing abril et al 2005 yao et al 2007 generally the influences of biologic effects are considered relatively limited during the base flow season because of the less light and low temperature compared to the wet season barth et al 2003 bianchi et al 2013 van geldern et al 2015 wang et al 2011b yao et al 2007 however previous study found that the primary production of aquatic phototrophs in xijiang river was lower in the wet season compared to the dry season because the large amount of suspended matter led to high turbidity that blocked the sunlight in the wet season yang et al 2016 the effect of photosynthetic activities is similar as co2 outgassing which will increase the ph decreased riverine pco2 and hco3 between the ph range observed in the xijiang river abril 2009 however similar relationship between the ph hco3 and pco2 were not observed in this study in fact the buffering capacity of carbonate system may also obscure the variation tobias and böhlke 2010 butman and raymond 2011 held that less than 5 of the co2 outgassing comes from the in stream biologic processes butman and raymond 2011 hotchkiss et al 2015 indicated that in stream processes contributes to co2 outgassing with a proportion from 14 to 39 hotchkiss et al 2015 additionally our previous study indicated that the bio degradation respiration and photosynthetic activities were not the controlling factors of riverine dic variations by using c stable isotope li et al 2008 liu and han 2020b thus in xijiang river the co2 outgassing bio degradation respiration or photosynthetic activities which simply removes or adds co2 to river water should not be predominant factor of this observed spatial pattern of ph hco3 and pco2 fig 3 exhibited that the water temperature and pco2 increased along the flow direction while ph and dic hco3 decreased along the flow direction the water temperature can affect the dissociation constants further the distribution of dic species as eq 1 3 to examine the influence of water temperature on riverine pco2 the variation of pco2 caused by temperature change at different ph and hco3 concentrations were given in fig 5 the increase of pco2 derived from temperature change is limited compared to the observed variation when ph is relatively high 8 5 the temperature related variation of pco2 are less than 100μatm when ph is relatively low less than8 0 and hco3 concentration is relatively high 2 mmol l at the temperature range observed in study area the increase of pco2 is still less than 500μatm additionally the clear ph decrease along the flow direction in xijiang river can t be explained by the temperature change thus though the temperature increase can theoretically increase the riverine pco2 levels it can t account for the spatial distribution of ph hco3 and pco2 the anthropogenic inputs including the industrial and domestic wastes with low ph can result in extra pco2 and ph decrease barth et al 2003 duarte et al 2008 finlay et al 2009 li et al 2012 in order to examine whether the spatial distribution can be explained by the acidic pollutant inputs a simple calculation model was conducted it is assumed that the input of pollutants can continuously decrease ph and do not significantly affect the discharge which means dic concentration will keep unchanged the initial condition was the highest ph and dic concentration observed in headwater of xijiang river with the addition of acidic matters the ph and hco3 will decrease while the pco2 will increase which fits the spatial distribution observed in xijiang river the changes of hco3 and pco2 in different water temperature are given in fig 6 at the assumed condition the hco3 concentration decreases from 4 mmol l to 3 mmol l and pco2 increases from 500μatm to 20000μatm when ph decreases from 8 7 to 7 0 the difference of water temperature will slightly affect the final condition where the higher water temperature will lead to higher hco3 concentrations and pco2 fig 6 though it exhibited the similar relationship between pco2 hco3 and ph the simulated curve still had a clear deviation from samples indicating the input of pollutants was not the reasonable reason for the spatial distribution of pco2 hco3 and ph the obvious decrease of hco3 reflects that there are other processes dominate the riverine dic the spatial distribution pattern in xijiang river may essentially reflect the lithology control on river chemistry as shown in the fig 1 the carbonate bedrock and karst topography are located in the upper reaches of xijiang river while the lower reaches are overlain by silicate bedrock generally the river draining karst carbonate terrains will exhibited relatively higher ph dic concentrations compared to other lithologic terrain because much faster dissolution rate and the developed subterranean landscapes chetelat et al 2008 doctor et al 2008 gaillardet et al 1999 roy et al 1999 suchet et al 2003 tipper et al 2006

muti isotope found that the carbonate weathering in the karst landform most likely occurred under the open condition while the silicate weathering in the lower reaches occurred under the closed condition which leads to the much high dic and ph values in the rivers flowing though the karst landform in the upper reaches compared to than in the silicate terrain liu and han 2020a 2020b this significant difference of dic concentrations and ph between the upper reaches and lower reaches have also been reported by previous studies li et al 2008 qin et al 2020 2019 thus the spatial distribution of ph pco2 and hco3 may result from the mixing between carbonate weathering product with high ph and dic concentrations and silicate weathering products along the flow direction which indicated the dwindlingph and hco3 concentration along the flow direction may result from the soil influx that comes from silicate weathering and has low ph and dic concentration to quantify the ph hco3 pco2 variation during the mixing between carbonate and silicate weathering products the mixing model were employed by using phreeqc the initial condition was the highest ph and dic concentration observed in headwater of xijiang river the final state is the lowest concentration or ph observed in mainstream the curves in fig 7 described the ph hco3 pco2 variations with additions of assumed soil fluxes with low ph and dic concentrations considering the reported pco2 in soil influx 4000 40000 μmol l marfia et al 2004 marx et al 2017 the pco2 in assumed influx ranged between 1000 and 33000 μmol l as shown in fig 7 if the influx has lower ph and higher dic concentrations when ph reaches the same value the solution will have higher hco3 concentrations and pco2 the samples exhibited similar trend as the assumed curves and were distributed between these curves however samples had relatively wide distribution range and did not scatter around any particular curve this result reflected that the soil influx may have a relatively wide range of ph and dic concentrations generally the ph and dic concentration of influx derived from silicate mineral dissolution are controlled by flow rate temperature mineral surface areas water saturation and soil pco2 maher 2011 maher et al 2006 winnick and maher 2018 the differences of the above parameters leaded to the differences of mineral dissolution which resulted in a wide range of ph and dic concentrations of soil influx fig 7 indicated that the soil influx should have relatively high ph 5 and low dic concentrations less than0 5 mmol l if not the river water after mixing should have noticeably high pco2 and hco3 concentration previous studies reported that the river draining silicate terrain can produce such ranges of ph and dic concentrations deirmendjian and abril 2018 kanduč et al 2007 polsenaere and abril 2012 van geldern et al 2015 this result indicated that the spatial distribution of pco2 hco3 and ph was derived from the continuous addition of soil influx with low ph and dic concentration it must be emphasized that the mixing relationship showed in this study is theoretical condition it indicates the preliminary relationship between ph hco3 and pco2 more studies are need to investigate the accurate mixing and variation relationship between ph hco3 and pco2 which will help better understand the carbon cycle in river water 4 2 co2 outgassing in xijiang river basin in xijiang river basin most samples had the pco2 higher than that of atmosphere the mean value 1765μatm and median value 1661μatm of pco2 were lower than the global average value 3100μatm raymond et al 2013 richey et al 2002 compared to other rivers in table 2 the k values used in this study were relatively higher than many previous studies raymond et al 1997 wang et al 2011a wang and wang 2006 yao et al 2007 because the recent studies indicated the previous studies had a considerable underestimation of k hotchkiss et al 2015 marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 2012 the mean value and median value of fco2 in xijiang river were 339 mmol m2 d and 261 mmol m2 d respectively xijiang river had relatively high diffusion rates compared to other world rivers table 2 fco2 were slightly higher than some large rivers such as mun river 240 mmol m2 d li et al 2019 mississippi river 269 mmol m2 d dubois et al 2010 mekong river 195 mmol m2 d li et al 2013 while clearly higher than ottawa river 80 8 mmol m2 d telmer and veizer 1999 hudson river 16 1 37 0 mmol m2 d raymond et al 1997 compared to the largest river in china changjiang yangtze river the xijiang river had clearly higher pco2 and fco2 the mean fco2 was much higher than that in changjiang river during 1960 1990 s when the dissolved co2 concentrations in the changjiang river water have sharply declined wang and wang 2006 the fco2 was also higher than that in the estuary of changjiang river zhai et al 2007 4 3 effect of karst landform on riverine pco2 and fco2 the fco2 in the upper reaches located in karst landform exhibited relatively lower value compared that in the silicate terrain however the dic concentrations in the upper reaches were clearly higher than that in the lower reaches fig 3 the river drains karst terrain will always show higher dic concentration and ph which essentially control the riverine pco2 and fco2 kanduč et al 2007 li et al 2010b qin et al 2019 the dic concentrations in the headwater of xijiang river reached 4 0 mmol l which was obviously higher than most rivers in the world gaillardet et al 1999 meybeck 1987 the high ph value observed in karst river accounts for the lower riverine pco2 and fco2 when ph higher than 8 0 h2co3 only accounts for less than 2 5 of the dic while ph lower than 7 0 h2co3 will take up 20 of the total dic thus though the dic concentrations were higher in the upper reaches the high ph value caused pco2 taking up a small proportion of dic the high ph in karst river leads to a relatively low pco2 and fco2 and partially prevents co2 outgassing however with the soil flux with low ph and dic concentration discharges into river water in the lower reaches the dic concentrations decreased because of the mixing meanwhile the relative proportion of pco2 has a significant increase due to the decreasing ph which caused the pco2 increase along the flow direction in xijiang river thus though the riverine high ph lead to a relatively low pco2 and fco2 once the river is added by the silicate weathering products or even rainwater with low ph and dic concentration the pco2 and fco2 will have an obvious increase in fact if karst rivers with high dic concentrations are added by the silicate weathering products both the dic and pco2 will keep relatively high concentrations which is distinct from the typical karst river with high dic concentrations and low pco2 or river draining silicate terrains with low dic concentrations and high pco2 considering the wide covering area of karst terrain the karst terrain may have a considerable influence on the riverine co2 outgassing and further the global carbon cycle bakalowicz 2005 our work also shows that the chemical weathering plays an important part in riverine dic species the weathering products largely affects these dissolved loads additional proxies clearly affected by chemical weathering such as major ions and their isotopic compositions will help to better determine and understand the influence of chemical weathering in river water 5 conclusion in this study the pco2 and co2 outgassing rate in xijiang river basin involving the mainstream and tributaries during the based flow season were presented the controlling factors of spatial distribution of pco2 were determined based on the stoichiometry and statistical method the influences of water temperature anthropogenic acidic inputs and soil influx on riverine pco2 were presented quantitatively the co2 outgassing rate of xijiang river were calculated and compared with other published data the effect of karst terrain on co2 outgassing were discussed in detail the following conclusions can be drawn the dic and ph decreased while pco2 increased along the flow direction in xijiang river which essentially reflected the lithologic control on water chemistry this spatial distribution was not controlled by the variation of water temperature and anthropogenic acidic inputs the mixing between carbonate weathering products and silicate weathering products predominated the riverine dic ph and pco2 the continuous addition of soil flux with low ph and dic concentrations caused this distribution pattern for most samples the riverine pco2 were higher than that in atmosphere indicating the co2 outgassing from river water to the atmosphere the fco2 of xijiang river was averaged 339 mmol m2 d which was similar as other large rivers such as mekong river and mississippi river the carbonate weathering in karst terrain resulted in high ph of karst rivers which caused relatively low pco2 and fco2 in karst regions credit authorship contribution statement jinke liu conceptualization methodology software validation data curation

4984,riverine co2 outgassing constitutes the important vertical conduit in global carbon cycle and affects climate change in order to investigate the factors that control riverine pco2 and co2 diffusion rate fco2 river water samples were collected in the mainstream and 42 tributaries of xijiang river a karst river during the dry season in 2015 the pco2 varied from 260 to 6354μatm with a mean value of 1765μatm indicating most of the samples were oversaturated with respect to co2 compared to atmosphere the ph pco2 and hco3 exhibited clearly spatial distribution pattern that ph and hco3 decreased along the flow direction while the pco2 increased along the flow direction theoretical calculation indicated that the water temperature fluctuation bio degradation respiration photosynthetic activities and anthropogenic acidic inputs were not the reasonable explanations the lithologic differences essentially predominated the riverine ph pco2 and hco3 the upper reaches of xijiang river flow through karst carbonate terrain and thus exhibited high ph hco3 concentrations meanwhile low pco2 the spatial distribution of ph pco2 and hco3 became visible as the continuous addition of silicate weathering products with low ph and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations the mixing calculation indicated the dic concentrations of silicate weathering should lower than 0 5 mmol l the calculated fco2 of xijiang river ranged between 38 6 and 1579 8 mmol m2 d with a mean value of 574 8 mmol m2 d and median value of 410 9 mmol m2 d fco2 exhibited obviously lower values in karst terrain compared that in silicate terrains because carbonate weathering results in high ph of karst rivers which caused the low relative proportion of pco2 in dic more estimations of co2 outgassing rate from the karst rivers are required due to the unique characteristics and geochemical process in karst landform keywords riverine carbon flux partial pressure of co2 co2 outgassing xijiang river karst 1 introduction rivers transport abundant terrestrial carbon to the oceans constituting the lateral channel of the globe carbon cycle gaillardet et al 1999 regnier et al 2013 the riverine carbon flux comprises dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc particulate inorganic carbon pic and particulate organic carbon poc among which dic is the important component and makes up 45 of globally total flux meybeck 1987 dic is the sum of the h2co3 i e the sum of aqueous co2 and hydrated co2 hco3 bicarbonate and co3 2 carbonate their relative concentrations at equilibrium are controlled by ph and temperature clark and fritz 1997 the high partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in river water compared to that in the atmosphere causes the co2 outgassing from river water to atmosphere which gets a growing interest in global carbon cycle butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 the present day bulk c input to freshwater was estimated 2 7 2 9 pg petagrams of carbon per year while the co2 evasion from inland waters is estimated 1 8 pg c per year with large uncertains raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 co2 diffusion flux links the continental atmospheric and oceanic c pools and can largely affect the global climate change and earth s energy budget berner and kothavala 2001 friedlingstein et al 2001 the co2 outgassing is controlled by turbulent energy exchange across the interface and the concentration differences between the gas in river water and atmosphere zappa et al 2007 the turbulent energy exchange can be expressed by a constant gas transfer velocity which is affected by the environmental variables such as temperature river run off flow velocity water depth and wind speed alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 recent studies also revealed that gas transfer velocities of rivers may be predicted over a large range of spatial scales by using these environmental variables alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 riverine pco2 reflects the carbon dynamics and terrestrial biogeochemical processes and also reveals the relative source or sink of river c pool for atmospheric c pool li et al 2012 yao et al 2007 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a generally the controlling factors of riverine pco2 are complex the production and transport of soil co2 chemical weathering products influx and instream bio degradation respiration and photosynthetic activities can affect the riverine pco2 abril et al 2005 pu et al 2017 raymond et al 1997 telmer and veizer 1999 yao et al 2007 calculation of dataset indicated that over 96 of inland waters are oversaturated with respect to co2 compared to atmosphere and 82 have the pco2 at least twice that of atmosphere regnier et al 2013 for example previous studies examined the rivers system such as amazon mississippi yangtze river and found that the pco2 in river water was much higher than that in atmosphere indicating a violent co2 outgassing alin et al 2011 dubois et al 2010 wang et al 2011a the riverine carbon emission data in asia is relatively deficient especially the karst rivers li et al 2012 richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 thus to get a better understanding of riverine carbon dynamics intensive sampling and scrupulous analysis of the riverine pco2 and co2 outgassing needs to be conducted the xijiang river basin is characterized by its wide distributed karst terrain the geochemical and hydrologic processes have been well examined by the previous studies li et al 2008 liu and han 2020a 2020b wang et al 2019 2020b zeng and han 2020a 2020b to our knowledge only yao et al 2007 have examined pco2 and co2 outgassing in small sub watershed of xijiang river basin yao et al 2007 few studies have systematically examined pco2 and co2 outgassing of different channels and tributaries in the whole river basin this study completed an extensive sampling campaign that collected mainstream and 42 tributaries in xijiang river during the dry season the objectives of this study are to investigate the controlling factors of riverine pco2 as well as to calculate the co2 outgassing rate of the whole river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the xijiang river located in the southeast asian karst region originates from maxiong mountain on the yunnan guizhou plateau and then flows through four provinces and discharges into the south china sea xu and liu 2007 yao et al 2007 as the largest tributary of zhujiang river pearl river xijiang river is the second largest river water system with a drainage area of 3 5 105 km2 21 31 26 49 n 102 14 e 115 53 e liu and han 2020a 2020b controlled by the sub tropic monsoon climate the majority of rainfalls 70 concentrated in the wet season from march to september the annual rainfall varied from 1200 to 2200 mm year the annual mean air temperature ranges between 14 and 22 zeng and han 2020b zhen et al 2016 xijiang river can be divided into the following channel the nanpanjiang river the beipanjiang river beipanjiang river is largest tributary in upper reaches of xijiang river the hongshuihe river the qianjiang river the xunjiang river and the xijiang river fig 1 the upper reaches comprise the nanpanjiang river the beipanjiang river the hongshuihe river which the lower reaches consist of the qianjiang river the xunjiang river and the xijiang river both the largest tributary of zhujiang river and the river near the estuary of zhujiang river delta are called xijiang river there are distinct lithologic and topographical differences between the upper reaches and lower reaches han et al 2018 the upper reaches of xijiang river flow through the bedrock mainly composed of permian and triassic sulfide rich limestones and dolomites where the karst topography is well developed li et al 2008 2010a the area of karst topography in xijiang river basin is 155 000 km2 and accounts for 45 area of the total watershed liu and han 2020b the territory is mountains and hills with the altitude ranging between 200 and 2000 m while in the lower reaches the basin mostly contains precambrian metamorphic rocks gneiss and magmatic rocks granite the territory is fairly flat with the altitude varying from 0 to 80 m 2 2 sampling and analyses strategies the sampling covering 24 sampling sites in mainstream and 67 sampling sites in the tributary 42 tributaries in total were conducted in the xijiang river basin between 12th jan 2015 and 27th jan 2015 during the dry season the geographical distribution of sampling sites was exhibited in fig 1and supplementary table 1 2 table s1 and table s2 there were not stormsorheavyrainfall occurring during the sampling period the weathering in most sample sites were sunny all the samples were collected in daytime to avoid the effect of diel sunlight and temperature variation the hydrologic conditions from 2011 to 2015 including run off water level water temperature and precipitation were shown in figure s1 the sampling period had clearly low run off water level and precipitation all these facts indicated the samples can represent the hydrologic condition under base flow season the water samples were collected under a depth about 50 cm from the center of the river from bridges and ferries the pre cleaned polyethylene bottles were used to store samples the physical chemical parameters including water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were determined in situ by using a multi parameter meter wtw multi 3320 germany the ph value was determined in situ by ph meter orion 230a ph temp meter with a precision of 0 02ph the ph meter was calibrated against buffering solutions of ph of 6 86 and 9 18 the alkalinity was titrated by 0 02 m hcl by titration ph meter and filtrated sample water on the sampling day samples were filtered through pre cleaned 0 22 μm millipore membrane replicate measurements were conducted with a precision of 0 03 unit for ph 0 1 c for t and 2 relative deviation of alkalinity respectively 2 3 calculation and data quality 2 3 1 dic and alkalinity calculation dic species comprise hco3 biocarbonate co3 2 carbonate h2co3 carbonate acid and aqueous co2 co2aq their relative proportions are controlled by the ph and water temperature clark and fritz 1997 the equilibrium between dic and atmosphere co2 can be described by temperature dependent dissociation constants and henry s law as eq 1 3 clark and fritz 1997 1 k co 2 h 2 co 3 p c o 2 1 0 7 1 0 5 t 2 0 016 t 1 11 2 k 1 h hco 3 h 2 co 3 1 0 1 1 1 0 4 t 2 0 012 t 6 58 3 k 2 h co 3 2 hco 3 1 0 9 1 0 5 t 2 0 0137 t 10 62 where h2co3 is the sum of co2aq and h2co3 ki are temperature dependent dissociation constants clark and fritz 1997 thus the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 and respective concentrations of dic species can be calculated by the measured ta total alkalinity water temperature ph the calculation is given as following eq 4 7 4 h c o 3 t a 1 0 p h 1 0 p h 2 k 2 5 p c o 2 h 2 c o 3 k c o 2 1 0 p h h c o 3 k c o 2 k 1 6 h 2 c o 3 1 0 p h h c o 3 k 1 7 c o 3 2 k 2 h c o 3 1 0 p h the calculation results are listed in the supplementary table 1 the calculation was also completed and checked by co2sys lewis et al 1998 the results were close to the above calculation because of the precision of ta ph and temperature measurement the relative uncertainty of the pco2 is about 3 however the non carbonate alkalinity nc alk such as nitrogen phosphors silicate and dissolved organic matters also contribute to the ta values hunt et al 2011 our previous study found that in xijiang river the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din was mainly composed of no3 90 and the dissolved phosphorus 10 μmol l and dissolved silicate exhibited low concentrations 0 15 mmol l compared to ta values 2 5 mmol l liu and han 2020b the dissolved organic carbon doc in xijiang river varied from 80 μmol l to 1100 μmol l with a mean value of 400 μmol l zou 2017 assuming the nc alk representing 36 of doc concentration hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 doc will contribute less than 5 of ta in fact previous studies indicate that the nc alk can be neglected when the river water is alkaline ph 7 4 hunt et al 2011 li et al 2012 in xijiang river 90 samples presented ph value 7 4 thus the ta values in this study can be assumed all from carbonate indicating the above calculation is reasonable 2 3 2 co2 outgassing calculation the concentration difference between the gas in river water and atmosphere will cause a violent co2 diffusion the diffusion flux f can be calculated as eq 8 8 fc o 2 c o 2 water c o 2 air k where co2 water and co2 air are co2 concentrations in river water and atmosphere respectively k d z is the gas transfer velocity which is dominated by turbulent dissipation rate thus the diffusive flux is controlled by concentration gradient and turbulent dissipation rate cole et al 2007 zappa et al 2007 the k value used largely decides the calculation results and always is converted to a common schmidt number of 600 k600 raymond et al 2012 this value varies greatly 0 120 cm h because it can be affect by temperature river run off flow velocity water depth and wind speed alin et al 2011 aucour et al 1999 doctor et al 2008 marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 for the sampling sites located in the mainstream rivers 100 m wide the k600 value can be expressed as the following equation eq 9 9 k 600 4 46 7 11 u 10 where u10 is the average wind speed at 10 m for the sampling sites in tributaries the k600 value can be expressed as the following equation eq 10 10 k 600 13 82 7 11 w where w denotes water current velocity the relationships between k600 and environmental parameters u10 and w were report in alin et al 2011 to get the k values in different temperatures the k600 can be convert to kt using the eqs 11 12 11 k t k 600 600 s c t 0 5 12 s c t 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0 04132 t 3 where kt is the corrected k value at the in situ temperature t sct is the schmidt number for temperature t the wind speed in xijiang river ranged between 0 7 and 3 4 m s we assumed the average wind speed was 1 7 m s which was agreeswiththe previous local study by yao et al 2007 and the collected world large river data by alin et al 2011 the detail hydrologic data of xijiang river can be found in pearl river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources http www zwswj com zwsw2011 asp syqxx main syqxx asp 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of ph temperature dissolved oxygen and dic table s1 presented the dataset of dic physic chemical parameters of xijiang river the statistics of dic and physic chemical parameters were shown in table 1 and fig 2 to compare dispersion between different datasets with different orders of magnitude the standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv were employed the sd and cv values indicated that the dispersion of parameters between the mainstream and tributary was similar the mean concentrations values of ec hco3 and pco2 had been influenced by the outliers thus both the mean concentration and median concentration were listed and discussed the water temperature had a wider range in the tributary varying from 10 2 to 26 6 compared that in the mainstream ranging between 11 4 and 18 8 the mean value and median value of temperature between mainstream and tributary are similar table 1 water temperature of most samples ranged between 14 0 and 20 0 fig 2 ph values in mainstream between 7 52 and 8 35 with a mean value of 7 97 and median value of 7 96 in the tributaries ph values varied from 6 96 and 8 75 with a mean value of 7 51 and median value of 7 80 this result demonstrated that the xijiang river water system was slightly alkaline and the samples in mainstream were more alkaline compared to that in tributary fig 2 when ph value ranged between 7 0 and 8 7 the dic species were predominated in the hco3 supplementary table s1 the concentrations of hco3 in most sampling sites ranged between 2000 and 3000 μmol l fig 2 the median value of hco3 was 2349 μmol l in the mainstream while 2424 μmol l in the tributary for most sampling sites the dissolved oxygen do level was below saturation do values varied from 81 7 to 122 7 in the mainstream with the median value of 93 2 from 68 2 to 116 6 in the tributaries with the median values of 94 2 respectively most of pco2 in xijiang river were above the atmospheric level fig 2 the pco2 in mainstream ranged between 523 and 3674μatm with a mean value of 1591μatm and median value of 1488μatm in the tributaries pco2 values presented a wide range between 260 and 6354μatm with a mean value of 1475μatm and median value of 2424μatm the cv values were higher than 0 40 indicating the pco2 in some sites exhibited extremely high or low level to better show the spatial variations of temperature ph pco2 hco3 dic and do along the flow direction the data was plotted against the distance from head water to the estuary in fig 3 the ph temperature dic hco3 and pco2 exhibited obviously spatial distribution pattern both in the mainstream and tributary the temperature and pco2 increased along the flow direction while ph and dic hco3 decrease along the flow direction the do did not show clearly spatial distribution 3 2 the diffusion rate of co2 the calculated co2 outgassing rate was shown in supplementary table s1 briefly fco2 in mainstream varied between 19 8 and 521 0 mmol m2 d with a mean value of 190 7 mmol m2 d and median value of 172 8 mmol m2 d in the tributaries fco2 was clearly higher than that in the mainstream it presented a wide range between 38 6 and 1579 8 mmol m2 d with a mean value of 574 8 mmol m2 d and median value of 410 9 mmol m2 d both in the mainstream and tributary the cv values were higher than 0 40 indicating the fco2 varied greatly in the xijiang river the difference of fco2 between the tributary and mainstream resulted from both the differences of pco2 levels and k values fig 4 exhibited that fco2 also increased along the flow direction 4 discussions 4 1 controlling factors of riverine pco2 generally the riverine pco2 or dic is essentially affected by the following geochemical processes 1 influx of weathering products or and soil co2 barth et al 2003 cartwright 2010 polsenaere and abril 2012 2 riverine bio degradation and respiration barth et al 2003 3 photosynthetic activities robinson et al 1999 4 co2 outgassing abril et al 2005 yao et al 2007 generally the influences of biologic effects are considered relatively limited during the base flow season because of the less light and low temperature compared to the wet season barth et al 2003 bianchi et al 2013 van geldern et al 2015 wang et al 2011b yao et al 2007 however previous study found that the primary production of aquatic phototrophs in xijiang river was lower in the wet season compared to the dry season because the large amount of suspended matter led to high turbidity that blocked the sunlight in the wet season yang et al 2016 the effect of photosynthetic activities is similar as co2 outgassing which will increase the ph decreased riverine pco2 and hco3 between the ph range observed in the xijiang river abril 2009 however similar relationship between the ph hco3 and pco2 were not observed in this study in fact the buffering capacity of carbonate system may also obscure the variation tobias and böhlke 2010 butman and raymond 2011 held that less than 5 of the co2 outgassing comes from the in stream biologic processes butman and raymond 2011 hotchkiss et al 2015 indicated that in stream processes contributes to co2 outgassing with a proportion from 14 to 39 hotchkiss et al 2015 additionally our previous study indicated that the bio degradation respiration and photosynthetic activities were not the controlling factors of riverine dic variations by using c stable isotope li et al 2008 liu and han 2020b thus in xijiang river the co2 outgassing bio degradation respiration or photosynthetic activities which simply removes or adds co2 to river water should not be predominant factor of this observed spatial pattern of ph hco3 and pco2 fig 3 exhibited that the water temperature and pco2 increased along the flow direction while ph and dic hco3 decreased along the flow direction the water temperature can affect the dissociation constants further the distribution of dic species as eq 1 3 to examine the influence of water temperature on riverine pco2 the variation of pco2 caused by temperature change at different ph and hco3 concentrations were given in fig 5 the increase of pco2 derived from temperature change is limited compared to the observed variation when ph is relatively high 8 5 the temperature related variation of pco2 are less than 100μatm when ph is relatively low less than8 0 and hco3 concentration is relatively high 2 mmol l at the temperature range observed in study area the increase of pco2 is still less than 500μatm additionally the clear ph decrease along the flow direction in xijiang river can t be explained by the temperature change thus though the temperature increase can theoretically increase the riverine pco2 levels it can t account for the spatial distribution of ph hco3 and pco2 the anthropogenic inputs including the industrial and domestic wastes with low ph can result in extra pco2 and ph decrease barth et al 2003 duarte et al 2008 finlay et al 2009 li et al 2012 in order to examine whether the spatial distribution can be explained by the acidic pollutant inputs a simple calculation model was conducted it is assumed that the input of pollutants can continuously decrease ph and do not significantly affect the discharge which means dic concentration will keep unchanged the initial condition was the highest ph and dic concentration observed in headwater of xijiang river with the addition of acidic matters the ph and hco3 will decrease while the pco2 will increase which fits the spatial distribution observed in xijiang river the changes of hco3 and pco2 in different water temperature are given in fig 6 at the assumed condition the hco3 concentration decreases from 4 mmol l to 3 mmol l and pco2 increases from 500μatm to 20000μatm when ph decreases from 8 7 to 7 0 the difference of water temperature will slightly affect the final condition where the higher water temperature will lead to higher hco3 concentrations and pco2 fig 6 though it exhibited the similar relationship between pco2 hco3 and ph the simulated curve still had a clear deviation from samples indicating the input of pollutants was not the reasonable reason for the spatial distribution of pco2 hco3 and ph the obvious decrease of hco3 reflects that there are other processes dominate the riverine dic the spatial distribution pattern in xijiang river may essentially reflect the lithology control on river chemistry as shown in the fig 1 the carbonate bedrock and karst topography are located in the upper reaches of xijiang river while the lower reaches are overlain by silicate bedrock generally the river draining karst carbonate terrains will exhibited relatively higher ph dic concentrations compared to other lithologic terrain because much faster dissolution rate and the developed subterranean landscapes chetelat et al 2008 doctor et al 2008 gaillardet et al 1999 roy et al 1999 suchet et al 2003 tipper et al 2006 van geldern et al 2015 white et al 1999 especially in the dry season with low run off i e chemostatic pattern or metastable equilibrium maher 2011 winnick and maher 2018 our previous studies using muti isotope found that the carbonate weathering in the karst landform most likely occurred under the open condition while the silicate weathering in the lower reaches occurred under the closed condition which leads to the much high dic and ph values in the rivers flowing though the karst landform in the upper reaches compared to than in the silicate terrain liu and han 2020a 2020b this significant difference of dic concentrations and ph between the upper reaches and lower reaches have also been reported by previous studies li et al 2008 qin et al 2020 2019 thus the spatial distribution of ph pco2 and hco3 may result from the mixing between carbonate weathering product with high ph and dic concentrations and silicate weathering products along the flow direction which indicated the dwindlingph and hco3 concentration along the flow direction may result from the soil influx that comes from silicate weathering and has low ph and dic concentration to quantify the ph hco3 pco2 variation during the mixing between carbonate and silicate weathering products the mixing model were employed by using phreeqc the initial condition was the highest ph and dic concentration observed in headwater of xijiang river the final state is the lowest concentration or ph observed in mainstream the curves in fig 7 described the ph hco3 pco2 variations with additions of assumed soil fluxes with low ph and dic concentrations considering the reported pco2 in soil influx 4000 40000 μmol l marfia et al 2004 marx et al 2017 the pco2 in assumed influx ranged between 1000 and 33000 μmol l as shown in fig 7 if the influx has lower ph and higher dic concentrations when ph reaches the same value the solution will have higher hco3 concentrations and pco2 the samples exhibited similar trend as the assumed curves and were distributed between these curves however samples had relatively wide distribution range and did not scatter around any particular curve this result reflected that the soil influx may have a relatively wide range of ph and dic concentrations generally the ph and dic concentration of influx derived from silicate mineral dissolution are controlled by flow rate temperature mineral surface areas water saturation and soil pco2 maher 2011 maher et al 2006 winnick and maher 2018 the differences of the above parameters leaded to the differences of mineral dissolution which resulted in a wide range of ph and dic concentrations of soil influx fig 7 indicated that the soil influx should have relatively high ph 5 and low dic concentrations less than0 5 mmol l if not the river water after mixing should have noticeably high pco2 and hco3 concentration previous studies reported that the river draining silicate terrain can produce such ranges of ph and dic concentrations deirmendjian and abril 2018 kanduč et al 2007 polsenaere and abril 2012 van geldern et al 2015 this result indicated that the spatial distribution of pco2 hco3 and ph was derived from the continuous addition of soil influx with low ph and dic concentration it must be emphasized that the mixing relationship showed in this study is theoretical condition it indicates the preliminary relationship between ph hco3 and pco2 more studies are need to investigate the accurate mixing and variation relationship between ph hco3 and pco2 which will help better understand the carbon cycle in river water 4 2 co2 outgassing in xijiang river basin in xijiang river basin most samples had the pco2 higher than that of atmosphere the mean value 1765μatm and median value 1661μatm of pco2 were lower than the global average value 3100μatm raymond et al 2013 richey et al 2002 compared to other rivers in table 2 the k values used in this study were relatively higher than many previous studies raymond et al 1997 wang et al 2011a wang and wang 2006 yao et al 2007 because the recent studies indicated the previous studies had a considerable underestimation of k hotchkiss et al 2015 marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 2012 the mean value and median value of fco2 in xijiang river were 339 mmol m2 d and 261 mmol m2 d respectively xijiang river had relatively high diffusion rates compared to other world rivers table 2 fco2 were slightly higher than some large rivers such as mun river 240 mmol m2 d li et al 2019 mississippi river 269 mmol m2 d dubois et al 2010 mekong river 195 mmol m2 d li et al 2013 while clearly higher than ottawa river 80 8 mmol m2 d telmer and veizer 1999 hudson river 16 1 37 0 mmol m2 d raymond et al 1997 compared to the largest river in china changjiang yangtze river the xijiang river had clearly higher pco2 and fco2 the mean fco2 was much higher than that in changjiang river during 1960 1990 s when the dissolved co2 concentrations in the changjiang river water have sharply declined wang and wang 2006 the fco2 was also higher than that in the estuary of changjiang river zhai et al 2007 4 3 effect of karst landform on riverine pco2 and fco2 the fco2 in the upper reaches located in karst landform exhibited relatively lower value compared that in the silicate terrain however the dic concentrations in the upper reaches were clearly higher than that in the lower reaches fig 3 the river drains karst terrain will always show higher dic concentration and ph which essentially control the riverine pco2 and fco2 kanduč et al 2007 li et al 2010b qin et al 2019 the dic concentrations in the headwater of xijiang river reached 4 0 mmol l which was obviously higher than most rivers in the world gaillardet et al 1999 meybeck 1987 the high ph value observed in karst river accounts for the lower riverine pco2 and fco2 when ph higher than 8 0 h2co3 only accounts for less than 2 5 of the dic while ph lower than 7 0 h2co3 will take up 20 of the total dic thus though the dic concentrations were higher in the upper reaches the high ph value caused pco2 taking up a small proportion of dic the high ph in karst river leads to a relatively low pco2 and fco2 and partially prevents co2 outgassing however with the soil flux with low ph and dic concentration discharges into river water in the lower reaches the dic concentrations decreased because of the mixing meanwhile the relative proportion of pco2 has a significant increase due to the decreasing ph which caused the pco2 increase along the flow direction in xijiang river thus though the riverine high ph lead to a relatively low pco2 and fco2 once the river is added by the silicate weathering products or even rainwater with low ph and dic concentration the pco2 and fco2 will have an obvious increase in fact if karst rivers with high dic concentrations are added by the silicate weathering products both the dic and pco2 will keep relatively high concentrations which is distinct from the typical karst river with high dic concentrations and low pco2 or river draining silicate terrains with low dic concentrations and high pco2 considering the wide covering area of karst terrain the karst terrain may have a considerable influence on the riverine co2 outgassing and further the global carbon cycle bakalowicz 2005 our work also shows that the chemical weathering plays an important part in riverine dic species the weathering products largely affects these dissolved loads additional proxies clearly affected by chemical weathering such as major ions and their isotopic compositions will help to better determine and understand the influence of chemical weathering in river water 5 conclusion in this study the pco2 and co2 outgassing rate in xijiang river basin involving the mainstream and tributaries during the based flow season were presented the controlling factors of spatial distribution of pco2 were determined based on the stoichiometry and statistical method the influences of water temperature anthropogenic acidic inputs and soil influx on riverine pco2 were presented quantitatively the co2 outgassing rate of xijiang river were calculated and compared with other published data the effect of karst terrain on co2 outgassing were discussed in detail the following conclusions can be drawn the dic and ph decreased while pco2 increased along the flow direction in xijiang river which essentially reflected the lithologic control on water chemistry this spatial distribution was not controlled by the variation of water temperature and anthropogenic acidic inputs the mixing between carbonate weathering products and silicate weathering products predominated the riverine dic ph and pco2 the continuous addition of soil flux with low ph and dic concentrations caused this distribution pattern for most samples the riverine pco2 were higher than that in atmosphere indicating the co2 outgassing from river water to the atmosphere the fco2 of xijiang river was averaged 339 mmol m2 d which was similar as other large rivers such as mekong river and mississippi river the carbonate weathering in karst terrain resulted in high ph of karst rivers which caused relatively low pco2 and fco2 in karst regions credit authorship contribution statement jinke liu conceptualization methodology software validation data curation
