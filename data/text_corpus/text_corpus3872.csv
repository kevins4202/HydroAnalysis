19360,stable isotope probing sip is a cultivation independent approach identifying the functional microbes in their natural habitats possibly linking their identities to functions dna sip is well established but suffers from the shift of 12c dna into the heavy dna 13c dna fraction which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy in this study we coupled magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi and dna sip namely mmi sip to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from pah contaminated wastewater microbes affiliated to pseudomonas and sphingobium were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism from the sip results and pigmentiphaga was only unraveled for phenanthrene degradation in the mmi and mmi sip microcosms mmi sip also significantly increased the enrichment of the above microbes and genes encoding the alpha subunit of the pah ring hydroxylating dioxygenase pah rhdα in the heavy dna fractions our findings suggest that mmi sip is a powerful tool with higher resolution and accuracy to distinguish the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism in the wastewater provide a more precise map of functional microbial communities and offer suggestions for effective management for wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords stable isotope probing sip magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi mmi sip active microbes for phenanthrene degradation pah rhdα genes 1 introduction owing to the rapid economic industrial and agricultural development numerous industrial and agricultural chemicals have been released into the environment causing serious water pollution brebbia and anagnostopoulos 1991 colin and michael 2012 kozaki et al 2017 various recalcitrant compounds in the effluent are a major source of toxic pollutants to aquatic and nearby environments causing one of the major concerns over long term sustainability of the environment adenuga et al 2006 verma and samanta 2017 of them polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are carcinogenic song et al 2016 several endeavors have been made to resolve the water pollution and biological treatment is a commonly used method for treating contaminated wastewater li et al 2017a however only a small proportion of microbes in the wastewater communities have the direct functions of eliminating pahs li et al 2017b it is therefore important to identify and isolate those functional microbes involved in the degradation of pahs which can help explore their metabolic characteristics and enhance their performance in wastewater treatment plants nevertheless the majority of microorganisms present in the natural environment are yet to be cultivated questioning effective approaches to investigate their physiological features and functions jiang et al 2018 rappé and giovannoni 2003 it is always a great challenge when using traditional approaches to isolate an axenic culture with defined and artificial medium to reveal the in situ ecological functions of yet to be cultivated microorganisms cultivation independent methods which enrich or isolate the functional microbes in their natural habitats have been developed for identifying yet to be cultivated bacteria in the last few decades high throughput sequencing gives an unprecedented view of the diversity of microbial communities in environmental samples by providing higher resolution of microbial taxa compared with conventional cloning techniques gutierrez 2011 however it cannot directly identify the metabolism or functions of the microorganisms stable isotope probing sip is an another cultivation independent technique to assess metabolic responses and provides the opportunity to link the identities of microorganisms to their functions in their natural habitats dumont and murrell 2005 radajewski et al 2000 this method introduces substrates labeled with stable isotopes e g 13c or 15n to monitor their flow from substrates to biomolecules and identify the functional microbes sip relies on the incorporation of stable isotopes into different intracellular components dna rna or proteins of microbial cells dumont and murrell 2005 which are able to be separated to identify the isotope incorporated fraction namely dna sip rna sip and protein sip dna is more stable than rna and is the most informative biomarker providing the highest taxonomical resolution and capable of identifying a broad spectrum of microorganisms involved in a specific metabolic process in the environment dumont and murrell 2005 jiang et al 2018 although rna and protein sip is more sensitive than dna sip lueders et al 2004 2016 manefield et al 2002 2007 they are questioned for lower taxonomic resolution in comparison with dna sip lueders et al 2016 accordingly dna sip is most frequently used in environmental microbiology and ecology jiang et al 2018 however dna sip suffers from the shift of 12c dna into the heavy dna 13c dna fraction which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy in distinguishing the functional microbes particularly in complex microbial communities li et al 2017a magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi is a recently developed method that can separate living active functional microbes from complex microbiota without substrate labeling zhang et al 2015 this method magnetizes all the microbes of the whole microbial community with biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles mnps and then separates the active microbes which gradually divide and ultimately lose their magnetic attraction from the non dividing bacteria maintaining magnetism via external magnet lin et al 2015 to date mmi has been used successfully to separate and characterize the active degraders of cellulose zhao et al 2016 alkanes wang et al 2016 and phenol zhang et al 2015 helping in unraveling their physiological and metabolic characteristics although dna sip was used to confirm the functions of the microbes isolated via mmi zhang et al 2015 no previous study has coupled mmi with dna sip for identifying the functional microbes simultaneously which might provide a new approach with higher resolution and accuracy to eliminate the potential interference from 12c dna in the heavy dna fraction to address this issue we developed a novel cultivation independent technique coupling mmi and sip in this study namely mmi sip to identify and isolate the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from pah contaminated wastewater phenanthrene was chosen as the target chemical since it is a model pah compound with the fused ring structure in an angular fashion and has ubiquity in nature the microbes responsible for in situ assimilation of carbon from phenanthrene in the wastewater microcosm were successfully characterised using dna sip mmi and mmi sip respectively high throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were applied for a more complete understanding of the bacterial communities and functional genes contributing to phenanthrene degradation the results showed that mmi sip significantly increased the resolution in distinguishing the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation compared to sip and mmi individually and provided a more accurate and complete map of the active phenanthrene degrading community our findings suggest that mmi sip is a powerful tool to identify and isolate the active microbes responsible for assimilating carbon from phenanthrene from a complex microbial community with higher resolution and accuracy and is potentially feasible to distinguish and separate functional microbes responsible for other organic chemical metabolism or carbon cycle in natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection wastewater sample was collected from an untreated industrial wastewater at an oil refinery located in shandong province 37 52 n 118 25 e china this wastewater was directly discharged into river nearby accordingly identifying the active microbes in wastewater responsible for phenanthrene degradation was important for designing the wastewater treatment plant after transport to the laboratory in iceboxes portions of the samples were stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction and the remaining samples were immediately stored at 4 c before sip mmi and mmi sip experiments the contents of pahs in the wastewater were quantified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry gc ms as described in section 2 7 and listed in table s1 electronic supporting information esi 2 2 mnps synthesis and functionalization of wastewater the synthesis of mnps was carried out according to previous instructions zhang et al 2011 2015 after wastewater samples 1 0 l were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min the cell pellets were re suspended in the same volume of deionized water and then mixed with 50 ml of biocompatible mnps stock solution after shaking 150 rpm for 20 min at room temperature the mnps functionalized bacteria were separated from the aqueous phase by a permanent magnet after removing the residual magnetic free cells the harvested cell pellets were further washed with filter sterilized wastewater for three times and finally re suspended in 1 0 l filter sterilized wastewater 2 3 sip mmi and mmi sip microcosms the sip microcosms were constructed in a 150 ml serum bottle containing 50 ml of the original wastewater unlabeled phenanthrene 99 cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa or 13c labeled phenanthrene 13c14 phenanthrene 99 cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa was added to the above bottles with a rubber stopper and an aluminium cap using a gas tight syringe at a final concentration of 10 mg l the sterile control was prepared by adding unlabeled phenanthrene in filter sterilized wastewater to evaluate the phenanthrene degradation under abiotic conditions each treatment was carried out in triplicates all the microcosms were incubated in the dark with shaking at 120 rpm and room temperature 25 c as previously described li et al 2017a the mmi microcosms were prepared by adding unlabeled phenanthrene 10 mg l into the filter sterilized wastewater with mnps functionalized bacteria after 3 day incubation the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism divided and eventually lost magnetism by magnetic harvesting they were separated from the inert microbes and remained in aqueous phase as magnetic free cell mfc suspension portions of the mfc suspensions were either stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction or added with unlabeled phenanthrene to explore their ability to degrade phenanthrene to prepare the mmi sip microcosms the 50 ml of collected mfcs were transferred into a 150 ml serum bottle added with unlabeled or 13c phenanthrene to a final concentration of 10 mg l the experimental procedures and incubation conditions were the same as the sip microcosms in total five biotic treatments were carried out as 12c sip original wastewater with 12c phenanthrene 12c mmi sip mfc with 12c phenanthrene 13c sip original wastewater with 13c phenanthrene 13c mmi sip mfc with 13c phenanthrene and mmi biocompatible mnps functionalized bacteria with 12c phenanthrene fig 1 from the analysis of residual phenanthrene phenanthrene degradation efficiency achieved over 60 on day 3 and almost 100 on day 6 table s2 to collect bacterial cells with a higher stable isotope labelling ratio and avoid cross feeding all the samples were taken on day 3 for dna extraction 2 4 nucleic acid extraction ultracentrifugation and sequencing the total nucleic acids were extracted from each sample of all the treatments proportions of dna extracted from all the microcosms were directly sequenced the rest dna from 12c and 13c phenanthrene amended microcosms were subjected to ultracentrifugation fractionation and high throughput sequencing of each fraction according to previously described methods song et al 2016 the hypervariable v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments was amplified using the 515f 806r primer set table 1 sequenced using 2 250 bp pe technology on an illumina miseq sequencer and analyzed by mothur caporaso et al 2010 schloss et al 2009 in the sip and mmi sip microcosms the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism were identified by otus enriched in the 13c dna fractions from the 13c sip comparing to the 12c sip and the 13c mmi sip comparing to the 12c mmi sip respectively for the mmi treatments the otus enriched in the mfc suspension comparing to the whole microbial community were responsible for in situ phenanthrene degradation all the details for nucleic acid extraction ultracentrifugation and sequencing are provided in esi 2 5 detection of genes encoding the alpha subunit of the pah ring hydroxylating dioxygenase pah rhdα pah rhdα gene is usually used as the biomarker to quantify the pah degrading bacteria cebron et al 2008 the pah rhdα genes in the mfc suspension and the heavy dna fractions from the 13c sip or 13c mmi sip microcosms were amplified using two primer sets for gram positive gp 642f 933r and gram negative gn 610f 911r degraders respectively table 1 cebron et al 2008 gradient pcr and the amplification reactions were performed as described previously li et al 2017a in the present study only one strong and specific amplicon was produced with pah rhdα gn primer set and selected for following analysis the pcr products were gel purified using a gel extraction kit d2500 01 omega bio tek norcross ga usa purified amplicons were cloned and sequenced according to jiang s method jiang et al 2015 the phylogenetic dendrogram was prepared using the method described above the genbank accession number for the partial pah rhdα gn gene sequence is mg806915 the partial 16s rrna gene sequences obtained are available in genbank with the following accession numbers mg800821 for otu 32 mg800822 for otu 16 mg800823 for otu 53 mg800824 for otu 35 and mg800825 for otu 10 2 6 quantitative pcr qpcr the abundances of bacterial 16s rrna and pah rhdα gn genes in each treatment were determined by qpcr with a bacterial universal primer pair of bac519f bac907r and the pah rhdα gn primer pair of 610f 911r respectively table 1 the qpcr reactions were performed following the process described in our previous work li et al 2017b two standard curves were obtained by producing a 10 fold serial dilution of plasmid pgem t easy vector sequences 102 108 copies promega containing the 16s rrna and pah rhdα gn genes respectively at the end of the qpcr a melt curve was obtained by heating from 60 to 95 c at a rate of 0 2 c cycle 2 7 chemical analysis phenanthrene in wastewater from each microcosm day 0 3 and 6 after incubation was analyzed by gas chromatograph model 7890 agilent santa clara ca usa using a capillary column db 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm and a mass spectrometer msd model 5975 agilent as previously described li et al 2017a briefly the water samples were spiked with 1000 ng deuterated pahs and extracted twice with dichloromethane after purification with a silica gel alumina column 8 mm i d the eluent was concentrated to approximately 50 μl using a gentle stream of n2 and 1000 ng hexamethylbenzene was added as an internal standard to all the samples before the instrumental analysis the concentrations of deuterated pahs pahs standards and internal standard are listed in table s3 3 results 3 1 active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation as revealed by sip the phenanthrene degradation efficiencies in 12c sip and 13c sip microcosms were shown in table s2 the residual phenanthrene in the sterile control exhibited less decrease than those in the biotic treatments residual phenanthrene was 32 37 in sip microcosms after 3 day incubation and no significant difference p 0 05 was observed between the 12c sip and 13c sip treatments the whole community structure at genus level showed only slight difference between 12c sip and 13c sip treatments fig 2 the dominant bacteria 5 total abundance included members of the genera kaistobacter rhodanobacter sphingobacterium unclassified comamonadaceae enterobacteriaceae and xanthomonadaceae the dna in the fractions with buoyant densities bds of 1 7198 and 1 7556 g ml were selected as light and heavy dna fractions respectively from both 12c sip and 13c sip microcosms which was supported by our concentration bd curves fig s1 additionally the active microbes responsible for 13c assimilation were analyzed by comparing the relative abundances of otus in the 12c sip and 13c sip treatments from each fraction as shown in fig s2a the relative abundances of otu 32 and otu 16 at higher bd 1 7556 g ml were higher in the 13c sip microcosms than those in the 12c sip samples in contrast no such enrichment or similar trend was detected in the dna fractions with lower bd the results indicated that microorganisms represented by these two otus played a primary role in phenanthrene degradation fig 3 shows the phylogenetic information for the identified active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism otu 32 belonging to the genus pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria class gammaproteobacteria order pseudomonadales family pseudomonadaceae exhibits 100 similarity to the partial 16s rrna gene sequence of pseudomonas strains such as uncultured pseudomonas sp clone otu 1378 kr832662 1 pseudomonas nitroreducens aimst ehe20 jq312053 1 and pseudomonas sp dn30 ay581447 1 and forms a subclade with a high bootstrap value of 99 otu 16 is assigned to the genus sphingobium phylum proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria order sphingomonadales family sphingomonadaceae and shares 99 similarity with sphingobium sp dba 3 gq176409 1 3 2 active microbes responsible for phenanthrene metabolism as revealed by mmi the mmi microcosms had a similar phenanthrene degradation performance as the sip microcosms table s2 the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism were evaluated by comparing the ratio of the relative abundances of top 100 otus in the mfc suspension to those in the inert microbial community five otus were enriched and their enrichment ratios were 2 28 otu 16 4 92 otu 32 4 45 otu 53 2 34 otu 5 and 2 81 otu 10 respectively table s4 and fig s3 among them otu 16 and otu 32 were also identified as the active microbes responsible for assimilating carbon from phenanthrene in the 13c sip microcosms and our mmi results further confirmed their involvement in phenanthrene metabolism of three new otus otu 53 otu 5 and otu 10 otu 53 is assigned to the genus pigmentiphaga phylum proteobacteria class betaproteobacteria order burkholderiales family alcaligenaceae and shares 99 similarity with pigmentiphaga sp h8 mf193477 1 fig 3 otu 10 belongs to the genus sphingobacterium phylum bacteroidetes class sphingobacteriia order sphingobacteriales family sphingobacteriaceae and otu 5 is unclassified comamonadaceae phylum proteobacteria class betaproteobacteria order burkholderiales as these microorganisms represented by otu 53 otu 5 and otu 10 were not enriched in the heavy dna fraction of the 13c sip treatments figs s2 and s4 their roles in phenanthrene degradation were suspected they might be the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation but not distinguished in the sip microcosms due to their extremely low abundance or microbes utilizing other carbon sources in wastewater with higher growth rate than other bacteria 3 3 active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism as revealed by mmi sip the phenanthrene degradation in the 12c mmi sip and 13c mmi sip treatments was similar table s2 the residual phenanthrene after 3 days 14 18 was significantly lower p 0 05 than those in the sip and mmi microcosms achieving 18 19 increase of phenanthrene degradation efficiency slight difference was observed in the indigenous microbial communities between the 12c mmi sip and 13c mmi sip treatments consistent with our results in the sip microcosms fig 2 the composition of the whole microbial communities behaved significantly different between sip and mmi sip microcosms in the mmi sip microcosms the relative abundance of the genus pseudomonas 61 1 increased and was much higher than those in the sip microcosms 3 71 whereas the relative abundances of the genera kaistobacter rhodanobacter sphingobacterium unclassified comamonadaceae enterobacteriaceae and xanthomonadaceae were significantly lower table s5 three otus enriched in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms included two identified ones in the sip microcosms otu 32 otu 16 and one otu 53 in the mmi treatments fig s2b similarly the relative abundances of otu 32 otu 16 and otu 53 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip treatments 41 1 13 6 and 2 75 respectively were significantly higher than those in the 12c mmi sip microcosms 15 8 2 38 and 0 28 respectively meanwhile otu 5 and otu 10 which were enriched in mmi treatments were not incorporated with 13c phenanthrene assimilation owing to their low enrichment in the heavy dna fraction fig s5 suggesting that microorganisms represented by these two otus were not the active bacteria involved in phenanthrene degradation 3 4 differences in microbial community and active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism among the mfc and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip and 13c mmi sip microcosms the microbial community structure was significantly different between the mfc suspension and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms in the mfc suspension the relative abundances of the genera pseudomonas sphingobacterium and unclassified comamonadaceae increased and were significantly higher than those in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms fig s6 whereas the relative abundance of the genus kaistobacter was much lower table s6 in the mmi sip microcosms the relative abundances of the genera pseudomonas and sphingobium remarkably increased whereas the relative abundances of the genera kaistobacter sphingobacterium unclassified comamonadaceae enterobacteriaceae and xanthomonadaceae behaved oppositely table s6 the microorganisms represented by otu 32 otu 16 and otu 53 were confirmed for phenanthrene metabolism after 3 days their relative abundances were 1 52 otu 32 0 51 otu 16 and 0 02 otu 53 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms 5 18 otu 32 1 03 otu 16 and 0 16 otu 53 in the mfc suspension and 41 13 otu 32 13 56 otu 16 and 2 75 otu 53 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms accordingly these active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism were significantly more enriched in the 13c mmi sip microcosms than both mmi and 13c sip treatments fig 4 a moreover the above three otus were better enriched in the heavy dna fractions of 13c mmi sip microcosms than those of 13c sip treatments fig 4b accordingly mmi alone had a higher resolution in identifying the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism comparing to sip 5 otus vs 2 otus but microorganisms represented by otu 10 and otu 5 did not participate in phenanthrene metabolism owing to the poor enrichment in the heavy dna fraction from 13c mmi sip microcosms these results suggested that mmi sip could identify the active microbes responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism with higher accuracy comparing to sip and mmi the microbial structure had significant changes across the 12c sip 13c sip mmi 12c mmi sip 13c mmi sip mfc and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip and 13c mmi sip microcosms pcoa score plot fig 2b illustrated that all the bacterial communities exhibited a dramatic shift from the location of original wastewater community the groups of 12c sip 13c sip and the heavy dna fractions of 13c sip were located closer to the original wastewater than the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation in contrast the group of the mfc suspension shifted directly towards the active community involved in phenanthrene degradation indicating that mmi could separate the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism further coupling with sip the community structures from both 12c mmi sip and 13c mmi sip were much closer to the active community involved in phenanthrene degradation moreover the microbial community structure of the heavy dna fraction from the 13c mmi sip was located closest to the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation indicating that mmi sip can provide a more precise map of the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation from complex microbiota than sip or mmi individually 3 5 occurrence and quantification of pah rhdα genes involved in phenanthrene metabolism the pah rhdα gn genes were analyzed in the mfc the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip and 13c mmi sip microcosms in the present study in all the microcosms the pah rhdɑ gene sequences are identical and share 98 similarity with that of uncultured pseudomonas sp clone berre6a3b 3 am743143 1 fig s8 the pah rhdɑ genes in the sip and mmi sip treatments were quantified against each density resolved fraction fig s9 a remarkable enrichment in the heavy dna fractions highlighted in grey was observed in both 13c sip and 13c mmi sip treatments indicating that the pah rhdɑ genes were labeled with the assimilated 13c accordingly the pah rhdɑ genes detected in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c phenanthrene microcosms were associated with phenanthrene metabolism in addition the copy number of pah rhdɑ genes was 0 32 104 1 09 104 and 2 46 104 copies ng dna in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms mfc suspension and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms fig 5 a it indicated that mmi sip and mmi could enrich pah rhdɑ genes in the pah contaminated wastewater via separating the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism moreover the enrichment ratio of pah rhdɑ gene was 8 82 in the heavy dna fractions of the mmi sip microcosms remarkably higher than that in the sip microcosms 3 54 fig 5b 4 discussion water is a fundamental source for human subsistence and the increasing water pollution is therefore an imperative problem severely affecting human health worldwide sevda et al 2018 conventional biological treatment is considered as a cost effective and eco friendly approach for treating pah contaminated wastewater li et al 2018 but suffering from a critical drawback that the majority of microbes responsible for in situ pahs degradation are yet to be cultivated new approaches are required to properly estimate the diversity and functions of the active microbes involved in pahs metabolism in wastewater sip relies on the incorporation of a stable isotope enriched substrate into the active microorganisms as dna is the most informative taxonomic biomarkers dumont and murrell 2005 dna sip is increasingly applied in attempts to link the identities of microorganisms to their functions in natural habitats heavy dna labeled with stable isotope could be separated from unlabeled light dna by density gradient centrifugation dumont and murrell 2005 they are further used as templates to amplify the target genes for bacterial identity 16s rrna genes or functions functional genes neufeld et al 2007b dna sip has been successfully applied to study the active populations with specific functions in environment samples such as pah degrading bacteria jiang et al 2015 li et al 2017b song et al 2016 and methane oxidizing microbes morris et al 2002 it shows a better prospect recently when properly coupled with metagenomic analysis chemerys et al 2014 ziels et al 2018 however dna sip has an inevitable limitation that the light 12c dna always shifts into the heavy 13c dna fraction which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy in distinguishing the functional microbes particularly in complex microbial communities li et al 2017a although many previous studies have successfully applied dna sip to investigate the active functional microorganisms eyice et al 2015 jones et al 2011 the identified microbes were normally of high abundance 5 in the 13c dna heavy fractions esson et al 2016 eyice et al 2015 johnston et al 2017 and the lowest abundance was above 0 1 eyice et al 2015 li et al 2017a 2017b it is still not clear whether extremely rare microorganisms 0 1 involved in assimilating stable isotope labeled substrates could be enriched and identified in the heavy dna fraction alternatively mmi is a recently developed technique that can effectively separate functional microbes by magnetic fields zhang et al 2015 unlike dna sip targeting isotope labeled dna fragments mmi does not require substrate labeling and dna fractionation wang et al 2016 thus mmi is considered as a promising tool for identifying the active functional cells in complex environmental media however mmi cannot accurately specify the functional microorganisms owing to the contamination from fast growing bacteria such as microorganisms represented by otu 10 and otu 5 in this study accordingly we hypothesized that mmi coupling with sip can solve the challenges of either approach mentioned above as a powerful tool to identify the active functional bacteria from a complex microbial community with higher resolution and accuracy comparing to either sip or mmi individually in our novel mmi sip approach mmi behaves as a pre screening tool to separate the active functional microorganisms raising the enrichment ratio of 13c labeled dna and increasing the resolution to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism fig 1 sip tracks the flow of stable isotope from 13c phenantherene into the active microbes and confirmed their functions for phenanthrene metabolism dumont and murrell 2005 zhang et al 2015 in the present study the relative abundance of extremely rare microorganisms otu 53 0 02 in original wastewater increased to 2 75 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms proving that mmi sip could separate extremely rare microorganisms responsible for in situ phenanthrene degradation accordingly mmi sip significantly improves the resolution and accuracy for identifying the active functional bacteria here only one consecutive incubation was applied in mmi sip treatments to compare the active phenanthrene degraders identified by mmi sip and mmi sip since mmi treatments might enrich phenanthrene degrading bacteria and increase their assimilation of 13c phenantherene another pre enrichment with phenanthrene of the wastewater community without mmi is suggested before conducting sip and it will be improved in our future studies it is worth mentioning that mmi sip could also provide a more precise map of the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation than mmi or sip individually fig 2 less than 2 of the bacterial populations in the original wastewater were separated in mmi sip suggesting that only a minor proportion of all the microorganisms in wastewater were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism it was concordant with our previous work reporting that only rare species with low abundance were responsible for metabolizing phenanthrene in the whole microbiota li et al 2017a 2017b since sip could only identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism with abundance 0 1 and the enrichment ratio was poor the microbial community structure of the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms is therefore significantly different from the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation and shows a huge distance in pcoa score plot fig 2 although mmi has higher resolution in separating the active functional bacteria its low accuracy sets the barrier to achieve the precise characterization of the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation our proposed mmi sip approach successfully resolves the problems of both sip and mmi and the microbial structure of the heavy dna fraction from the 13c mmi sip microcosms was very similar to the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation fig 2 the active microorganisms responsible for in situ phenanthrene degradation are affiliated to pseudomonas sphingobium and pigmentiphaga pseudomonas is a well known pahs degrading bacterial lineage and members of this genus contain pah rhdα genes encoding the pahs degradative pathway thomas et al 2016 sphingobium can also metabolise a wide range of pahs cunliffe and kertesz 2006 the degradation of phenanthrene by pseudomonas and sphingobium has been previously reported otto et al 2016 members of the genus pigmentiphaga possess versatile metabolic capabilities such as the pathways for degrading benzoxazolinone acetamiprid and chlorothalonil dong et al 2018 however limited studies have addressed their ability to metabolise pahs the only one example to our knowledge has confirmed that pigmentiphaga were associated with naphthalene and phenanthrene degradation jones et al 2011 our mmi sip results provide direct evidence that members of the genus pigmentiphaga are responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism in pah contaminated wastewater besides higher resolution in identifying the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism mmi sip enriched the relative abundance of pah rhdα genes in the heavy dna fraction fig 5 the abundance of the rhdα genes was reported to correlate with pahs degradation efficiency ding et al 2010 and the temporal changes in the activities of the pah degraders bearing pah rhdα genes during pahs degradation process demonstrated its strong link with bacterial degradation capability guo et al 2017 in the present study the relative abundance of pah rhdα genes was positively correlated with that of the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism hinting that they might belong to pseudomonas sphingobium or pigmentiphaga in the 13c mmi sip microcosms many studies have successfully amplified functional genes using pcr primers from 13c dna neufeld et al 2007a uhlik et al 2009 however it is difficult to determine the affiliation of the functional gene sequences to 16s rrna genes neufeld et al 2007a future work is suggested to directly link the identities of the active microbes responsible for phenanthrene degradation to their metabolisms via metagenomics and protein sip jehmlich et al 2016 5 conclusions a novel mmi sip method was developed and employed to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism from pah contaminated wastewater microbes affiliated to pseudomonas and sphingobium were responsible for phenanthrene metabolism from the sip results mmi sip significantly increased the abundance of pseudomonas and sphingobium in the heavy dna fractions and found one more pigmentiphaga involved in phenanthrene metabolism further evidence was also found from the higher enrichment of pah rhdα genes in the heavy dna fraction of the 13c mmi sip than that in the 13c sip microcosms our results suggested that mmi sip is a reliable cultivation independent approach to identify functional microbes from complex microbiota with higher resolution and accuracy comparing to mmi or sip alone additionally mmi sip successfully separated the active phenanthrene degrading consortium and significantly increased the phenanthrene removal efficiency our study indicates that mmi sip approach is a successful tool to distinguish the in situ active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation it might provide a more precise map and new mechanisms of the active microbes involved in the biodegradation of other organic pollutants and help in understanding their ecological roles and influential factors during the microbial degradation processes

isolation mmi and dna sip namely mmi sip to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from pah contaminated wastewater microbes affiliated to pseudomonas and sphingobium were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism from the sip results and pigmentiphaga was only unraveled for phenanthrene degradation in the mmi and mmi sip microcosms mmi sip also significantly increased the enrichment of the above microbes and genes encoding the alpha subunit of the pah ring hydroxylating dioxygenase pah rhdα in the heavy dna fractions our findings suggest that mmi sip is a powerful tool with higher resolution and accuracy to distinguish the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism in the wastewater provide a more precise map of functional microbial communities and offer suggestions for effective management for wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords stable isotope probing sip magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi mmi sip active microbes for phenanthrene degradation pah rhdα genes 1 introduction owing to the rapid economic industrial and agricultural development numerous industrial and agricultural chemicals have been released into the environment causing serious water pollution brebbia and anagnostopoulos 1991 colin and michael 2012 kozaki et al 2017 various recalcitrant compounds in the effluent are a major source of toxic pollutants to aquatic and nearby environments causing one of the major concerns over long term sustainability of the environment adenuga et al 2006 verma and samanta 2017 of them polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are carcinogenic song et al 2016 several endeavors have been made to resolve the water pollution and biological treatment is a commonly used method for treating contaminated wastewater li et al 2017a however only a small proportion of microbes in the wastewater communities have the direct functions of eliminating pahs li et al 2017b it is therefore important to identify and isolate those functional microbes involved in the degradation of pahs which can help explore their metabolic characteristics and enhance their performance in wastewater treatment plants nevertheless the majority of microorganisms present in the natural environment are yet to be cultivated questioning effective approaches to investigate their physiological features and functions jiang et al 2018 rappé and giovannoni 2003 it is always a great challenge when using traditional approaches to isolate an axenic culture with defined and artificial medium to reveal the in situ ecological functions of yet to be cultivated microorganisms cultivation independent methods which enrich or isolate the functional microbes in their natural habitats have been developed for identifying yet to be cultivated bacteria in the last few decades high throughput sequencing gives an unprecedented view of the diversity of microbial communities in environmental samples by providing higher resolution of microbial taxa compared with conventional cloning techniques gutierrez 2011 however it cannot directly identify the metabolism or functions of the microorganisms stable isotope probing sip is an another cultivation independent technique to assess metabolic responses and provides the opportunity to link the identities of microorganisms to their functions in their natural habitats dumont and murrell 2005 radajewski et al 2000 this method introduces substrates labeled with stable isotopes e g 13c or 15n to monitor their flow from substrates to biomolecules and identify the functional microbes sip relies on the incorporation of stable isotopes into different intracellular components dna rna or proteins of microbial cells dumont and murrell 2005 which are able to be separated to identify the isotope incorporated fraction namely dna sip rna sip and protein sip dna is more stable than rna and is the most informative biomarker providing the highest taxonomical resolution and capable of identifying a broad spectrum of microorganisms involved in a specific metabolic process in the environment dumont and murrell 2005 jiang et al 2018 although rna and protein sip is more sensitive than dna sip lueders et al 2004 2016 manefield et al 2002 2007 they are questioned for lower taxonomic resolution in comparison with dna sip lueders et al 2016 accordingly dna sip is most frequently used in environmental microbiology and ecology jiang et al 2018 however dna sip suffers from the shift of 12c dna into the heavy dna 13c dna fraction which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy in distinguishing the functional microbes particularly in complex microbial communities li et al 2017a magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi is a recently developed method that can separate living active functional microbes from complex microbiota without substrate labeling zhang et al 2015 this method magnetizes all the microbes of the whole microbial community with biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles mnps and then separates the active microbes which gradually divide and ultimately lose their magnetic attraction from the non dividing bacteria maintaining magnetism via external magnet lin et al 2015 to date mmi has been used successfully to separate and characterize the active degraders of cellulose zhao et al 2016 alkanes wang et al 2016 and phenol zhang et al 2015 helping in unraveling their physiological and metabolic characteristics although dna sip was used to confirm the functions of the microbes isolated via mmi zhang et al 2015 no previous study has coupled mmi with dna sip for identifying the functional microbes simultaneously which might provide a new approach with higher resolution and accuracy to eliminate the potential interference from 12c dna in the heavy dna fraction to address this issue we developed a novel cultivation independent technique coupling mmi and sip in this study namely mmi sip to identify and isolate the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from pah contaminated wastewater phenanthrene was chosen as the target chemical since it is a model pah compound with the fused ring structure in an angular fashion and has ubiquity in nature the microbes responsible for in situ assimilation of carbon from phenanthrene in the wastewater microcosm were successfully characterised using dna sip mmi and mmi sip respectively high throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were applied for a more complete understanding of the bacterial communities and functional genes contributing to phenanthrene degradation the results showed that mmi sip significantly increased the resolution in distinguishing the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation compared to sip and mmi individually and provided a more accurate and complete map of the active phenanthrene degrading community our findings suggest that mmi sip is a powerful tool to identify and isolate the active microbes responsible for assimilating carbon from phenanthrene from a complex microbial community with higher resolution and accuracy and is potentially feasible to distinguish and separate functional microbes responsible for other organic chemical metabolism or carbon cycle in natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection wastewater sample was collected from an untreated industrial wastewater at an oil refinery located in shandong province 37 52 n 118 25 e china this wastewater was directly discharged into river nearby accordingly identifying the active microbes in wastewater responsible for phenanthrene degradation was important for designing the wastewater treatment plant after transport to the laboratory in iceboxes portions of the samples were stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction and the remaining samples were immediately stored at 4 c before sip mmi and mmi sip experiments the contents of pahs in the wastewater were quantified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry gc ms as described in section 2 7 and listed in table s1 electronic supporting information esi 2 2 mnps synthesis and functionalization of wastewater the synthesis of mnps was carried out according to previous instructions zhang et al 2011 2015 after wastewater samples 1 0 l were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min the cell pellets were re suspended in the same volume of deionized water and then mixed with 50 ml of biocompatible mnps stock solution after shaking 150 rpm for 20 min at room temperature the mnps functionalized bacteria were separated from the aqueous phase by a permanent magnet after removing the residual magnetic free cells the harvested cell pellets were further washed with filter sterilized wastewater for three times and finally re suspended in 1 0 l filter sterilized wastewater 2 3 sip mmi and mmi sip microcosms the sip microcosms were constructed in a 150 ml serum bottle containing 50 ml of the original wastewater unlabeled phenanthrene 99 cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa or 13c labeled phenanthrene 13c14 phenanthrene 99 cambridge isotope laboratories inc usa was added to the above bottles with a rubber stopper and an aluminium cap using a gas tight syringe at a final concentration of 10 mg l the sterile control was prepared by adding unlabeled phenanthrene in filter sterilized wastewater to evaluate the phenanthrene degradation under abiotic conditions each treatment was carried out in triplicates all the microcosms were incubated in the dark with shaking at 120 rpm and room temperature 25 c as previously described li et al 2017a the mmi microcosms were prepared by adding unlabeled phenanthrene 10 mg l into the filter sterilized wastewater with mnps functionalized bacteria after 3 day incubation the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism divided and eventually lost magnetism by magnetic harvesting they were separated from the inert microbes and remained in aqueous phase as magnetic free cell mfc suspension portions of the mfc suspensions were either stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction or added with unlabeled phenanthrene to explore their ability to degrade phenanthrene to prepare the mmi sip microcosms the 50 ml of collected mfcs were transferred into a 150 ml serum bottle added with unlabeled or 13c phenanthrene to a final concentration of 10 mg l the experimental procedures and incubation conditions were the same as the sip microcosms in total five biotic treatments were carried out as 12c sip original wastewater with 12c phenanthrene 12c mmi sip mfc with 12c phenanthrene 13c sip original wastewater with 13c phenanthrene 13c mmi sip mfc with 13c phenanthrene and mmi biocompatible mnps functionalized bacteria with 12c phenanthrene fig 1 from the analysis of residual phenanthrene phenanthrene degradation efficiency achieved over 60 on day 3 and almost 100 on day 6 table s2 to collect bacterial cells with a higher stable isotope labelling ratio and avoid cross feeding all the samples were taken on day 3 for dna extraction 2 4 nucleic acid extraction ultracentrifugation and sequencing the total nucleic acids were extracted from each sample of all the treatments proportions of dna extracted from all the microcosms were directly sequenced the rest dna from 12c and 13c phenanthrene amended microcosms were subjected to ultracentrifugation fractionation and high throughput sequencing of each fraction according to previously described methods song et al 2016 the hypervariable v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments was amplified using the 515f 806r primer set table 1 sequenced using 2 250 bp pe technology on an illumina miseq sequencer and analyzed by mothur caporaso et al 2010 schloss et al 2009 in the sip and mmi sip microcosms the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism were identified by otus enriched in the 13c dna fractions from the 13c sip comparing to the 12c sip and the 13c mmi sip comparing to the 12c mmi sip respectively for the mmi treatments the otus enriched in the mfc suspension comparing to the whole microbial community were responsible for in situ phenanthrene degradation all the details for nucleic acid extraction ultracentrifugation and sequencing are provided in esi 2 5 detection of genes encoding the alpha subunit of the pah ring hydroxylating dioxygenase pah rhdα pah rhdα gene is usually used as the biomarker to quantify the pah degrading bacteria cebron et al 2008 the pah rhdα genes in the mfc suspension and the heavy dna fractions from the 13c sip or 13c mmi sip microcosms were amplified using two primer sets for gram positive gp 642f 933r and gram negative gn 610f 911r degraders respectively table 1 cebron et al 2008 gradient pcr and the amplification reactions were performed as described previously li et al 2017a in the present study only one strong and specific amplicon was produced with pah rhdα gn primer set and selected for following analysis the pcr products were gel purified using a gel extraction kit d2500 01 omega bio tek norcross ga usa purified amplicons were cloned and sequenced according to jiang s method jiang et al 2015 the phylogenetic dendrogram was prepared using the method described above the genbank accession number for the partial pah rhdα gn gene sequence is mg806915 the partial 16s rrna gene sequences obtained are available in genbank with the following accession numbers mg800821 for otu 32 mg800822 for otu 16 mg800823 for otu 53 mg800824 for otu 35 and mg800825 for otu 10 2 6 quantitative pcr qpcr the abundances of bacterial 16s rrna and pah rhdα gn genes in each treatment were determined by qpcr with a bacterial universal primer pair of bac519f bac907r and the pah rhdα gn primer pair of 610f 911r respectively table 1 the qpcr reactions were performed following the process described in our previous work li et al 2017b two standard curves were obtained by producing a 10 fold serial dilution of plasmid pgem t easy vector sequences 102 108 copies promega containing the 16s rrna and pah rhdα gn genes respectively at the end of the qpcr a melt curve was obtained by heating from 60 to 95 c at a rate of 0 2 c cycle 2 7 chemical analysis phenanthrene in wastewater from each microcosm day 0 3 and 6 after incubation was analyzed by gas chromatograph model 7890 agilent santa clara ca usa using a capillary column db 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm and a mass spectrometer msd model 5975 agilent as previously described li et al 2017a briefly the water samples were spiked with 1000 ng deuterated pahs and extracted twice with dichloromethane after purification with a silica gel alumina column 8 mm i d the eluent was concentrated to approximately 50 μl using a gentle stream of n2 and 1000 ng hexamethylbenzene was added as an internal standard to all the samples before the instrumental analysis the concentrations of deuterated pahs pahs standards and internal standard are listed in table s3 3 results 3 1 active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation as revealed by sip the phenanthrene degradation efficiencies in 12c sip and 13c sip microcosms were shown in table s2 the residual phenanthrene in the sterile control exhibited less decrease than those in the biotic treatments residual phenanthrene was 32 37 in sip microcosms after 3 day incubation and no significant difference p 0 05 was observed between the 12c sip and 13c sip treatments the whole community structure at genus level showed only slight difference between 12c sip and 13c sip treatments fig 2 the dominant bacteria 5 total abundance included members of the genera kaistobacter rhodanobacter sphingobacterium unclassified comamonadaceae enterobacteriaceae and xanthomonadaceae the dna in the fractions with buoyant densities bds of 1 7198 and 1 7556 g ml were selected as light and heavy dna fractions respectively from both 12c sip and 13c sip microcosms which was supported by our concentration bd curves fig s1 additionally the active microbes responsible for 13c assimilation were analyzed by comparing the relative abundances of otus in the 12c sip and 13c sip treatments from each fraction as shown in fig s2a the relative abundances of otu 32 and otu 16 at higher bd 1 7556 g ml were higher in the 13c sip microcosms than those in the 12c sip samples in contrast no such enrichment or similar trend was detected in the dna fractions with lower bd the results indicated that microorganisms represented by these two otus played a primary role in phenanthrene degradation fig 3 shows the phylogenetic information for the identified active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism otu 32 belonging to the genus pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria class gammaproteobacteria order pseudomonadales family pseudomonadaceae exhibits 100 similarity to the partial 16s rrna gene sequence of pseudomonas strains such as uncultured pseudomonas sp clone otu 1378 kr832662 1 pseudomonas nitroreducens aimst ehe20 jq312053 1 and pseudomonas sp dn30 ay581447 1 and forms a subclade with a high bootstrap value of 99 otu 16 is assigned to the genus sphingobium phylum proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria order sphingomonadales family sphingomonadaceae and shares 99 similarity with sphingobium sp dba 3 gq176409 1 3 2 active microbes responsible for phenanthrene metabolism as revealed by mmi the mmi microcosms had a similar phenanthrene degradation performance as the sip microcosms table s2 the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism were evaluated by comparing the ratio of the relative abundances of top 100 otus in the mfc suspension to those in the inert microbial community five otus were enriched and their enrichment ratios were 2 28 otu 16 4 92 otu 32 4 45 otu 53 2 34 otu 5 and 2 81 otu 10 respectively table s4 and fig s3 among them otu 16 and otu 32 were also identified as the active microbes responsible for assimilating carbon from phenanthrene in the 13c sip microcosms and our mmi results further confirmed their involvement in phenanthrene metabolism of three new otus otu 53 otu 5 and otu 10 otu 53 is assigned to the genus pigmentiphaga phylum proteobacteria class betaproteobacteria order burkholderiales family alcaligenaceae and shares 99 similarity with pigmentiphaga sp h8 mf193477 1 fig 3 otu 10 belongs to the genus sphingobacterium phylum bacteroidetes class sphingobacteriia order sphingobacteriales family sphingobacteriaceae and otu 5 is unclassified comamonadaceae phylum proteobacteria class betaproteobacteria order burkholderiales as these microorganisms represented by otu 53 otu 5 and otu 10 were not enriched in the heavy dna fraction of the 13c sip treatments figs s2 and s4 their roles in phenanthrene degradation were suspected they might be the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation but not distinguished in the sip microcosms due to their extremely low abundance or microbes utilizing other carbon sources in wastewater with higher growth rate than other bacteria 3 3 active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism as revealed by mmi sip the phenanthrene degradation in the 12c mmi sip and 13c mmi sip treatments was similar table s2 the residual phenanthrene after 3 days 14 18 was significantly lower p 0 05 than those in the sip and mmi microcosms achieving 18 19 increase of phenanthrene degradation efficiency slight difference was observed in the indigenous microbial communities between the 12c mmi sip and 13c mmi sip treatments consistent with our results in the sip microcosms fig 2 the composition of the whole microbial communities behaved significantly different between sip and mmi sip microcosms in the mmi sip microcosms the relative abundance of the genus pseudomonas 61 1 increased and was much higher than those in the sip microcosms 3 71 whereas the relative abundances of the genera kaistobacter rhodanobacter sphingobacterium unclassified comamonadaceae enterobacteriaceae and xanthomonadaceae were significantly lower table s5 three otus enriched in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms included two identified ones in the sip microcosms otu 32 otu 16 and one otu 53 in the mmi treatments fig s2b similarly the relative abundances of otu 32 otu 16 and otu 53 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip treatments 41 1 13 6 and 2 75 respectively were significantly higher than those in the 12c mmi sip microcosms 15 8 2 38 and 0 28 respectively meanwhile otu 5 and otu 10 which were enriched in mmi treatments were not incorporated with 13c phenanthrene assimilation owing to their low enrichment in the heavy dna fraction fig s5 suggesting that microorganisms represented by these two otus were not the active bacteria involved in phenanthrene degradation 3 4 differences in microbial community and active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism among the mfc and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip and 13c mmi sip microcosms the microbial community structure was significantly different between the mfc suspension and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms in the mfc suspension the relative abundances of the genera pseudomonas sphingobacterium and unclassified comamonadaceae increased and were significantly higher than those in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms fig s6 whereas the relative abundance of the genus kaistobacter was much lower table s6 in the mmi sip microcosms the relative abundances of the genera pseudomonas and sphingobium remarkably increased whereas the relative abundances of the genera kaistobacter sphingobacterium unclassified comamonadaceae enterobacteriaceae and xanthomonadaceae behaved oppositely table s6 the microorganisms represented by otu 32 otu 16 and otu 53 were confirmed for phenanthrene metabolism after 3 days their relative abundances were 1 52 otu 32 0 51 otu 16 and 0 02 otu 53 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms 5 18 otu 32 1 03 otu 16 and 0 16 otu 53 in the mfc suspension and 41 13 otu 32 13 56 otu 16 and 2 75 otu 53 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms accordingly these active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism were significantly more enriched in the 13c mmi sip microcosms than both mmi and 13c sip treatments fig 4 a moreover the above three otus were better enriched in the heavy dna fractions of 13c mmi sip microcosms than those of 13c sip treatments fig 4b accordingly mmi alone had a higher resolution in identifying the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism comparing to sip 5 otus vs 2 otus but microorganisms represented by otu 10 and otu 5 did not participate in phenanthrene metabolism owing to the poor enrichment in the heavy dna fraction from 13c mmi sip microcosms these results suggested that mmi sip could identify the active microbes responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism with higher accuracy comparing to sip and mmi the microbial structure had significant changes across the 12c sip 13c sip mmi 12c mmi sip 13c mmi sip mfc and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip and 13c mmi sip microcosms pcoa score plot fig 2b illustrated that all the bacterial communities exhibited a dramatic shift from the location of original wastewater community the groups of 12c sip 13c sip and the heavy dna fractions of 13c sip were located closer to the original wastewater than the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation in contrast the group of the mfc suspension shifted directly towards the active community involved in phenanthrene degradation indicating that mmi could separate the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism further coupling with sip the community structures from both 12c mmi sip and 13c mmi sip were much closer to the active community involved in phenanthrene degradation moreover the microbial community structure of the heavy dna fraction from the 13c mmi sip was located closest to the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation indicating that mmi sip can provide a more precise map of the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation from complex microbiota than sip or mmi individually 3 5 occurrence and quantification of pah rhdα genes involved in phenanthrene metabolism the pah rhdα gn genes were analyzed in the mfc the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip and 13c mmi sip microcosms in the present study in all the microcosms the pah rhdɑ gene sequences are identical and share 98 similarity with that of uncultured pseudomonas sp clone berre6a3b 3 am743143 1 fig s8 the pah rhdɑ genes in the sip and mmi sip treatments were quantified against each density resolved fraction fig s9 a remarkable enrichment in the heavy dna fractions highlighted in grey was observed in both 13c sip and 13c mmi sip treatments indicating that the pah rhdɑ genes were labeled with the assimilated 13c accordingly the pah rhdɑ genes detected in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c phenanthrene microcosms were associated with phenanthrene metabolism in addition the copy number of pah rhdɑ genes was 0 32 104 1 09 104 and 2 46 104 copies ng dna in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms mfc suspension and the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms fig 5 a it indicated that mmi sip and mmi could enrich pah rhdɑ genes in the pah contaminated wastewater via separating the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism moreover the enrichment ratio of pah rhdɑ gene was 8 82 in the heavy dna fractions of the mmi sip microcosms remarkably higher than that in the sip microcosms 3 54 fig 5b 4 discussion water is a fundamental source for human subsistence and the increasing water pollution is therefore an imperative problem severely affecting human health worldwide sevda et al 2018 conventional biological treatment is considered as a cost effective and eco friendly approach for treating pah contaminated wastewater li et al 2018 but suffering from a critical drawback that the majority of microbes responsible for in situ pahs degradation are yet to be cultivated new approaches are required to properly estimate the diversity and functions of the active microbes involved in pahs metabolism in wastewater sip relies on the incorporation of a stable isotope enriched substrate into the active microorganisms as dna is the most informative taxonomic biomarkers dumont and murrell 2005 dna sip is increasingly applied in attempts to link the identities of microorganisms to their functions in natural habitats heavy dna labeled with stable isotope could be separated from unlabeled light dna by density gradient centrifugation dumont and murrell 2005 they are further used as templates to amplify the target genes for bacterial identity 16s rrna genes or functions functional genes neufeld et al 2007b dna sip has been successfully applied to study the active populations with specific functions in environment samples such as pah degrading bacteria jiang et al 2015 li et al 2017b song et al 2016 and methane oxidizing microbes morris et al 2002 it shows a better prospect recently when properly coupled with metagenomic analysis chemerys et al 2014 ziels et al 2018 however dna sip has an inevitable limitation that the light 12c dna always shifts into the heavy 13c dna fraction which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy in distinguishing the functional microbes particularly in complex microbial communities li et al 2017a although many previous studies have successfully applied dna sip to investigate the active functional microorganisms eyice et al 2015 jones et al 2011 the identified microbes were normally of high abundance 5 in the 13c dna heavy fractions esson et al 2016 eyice et al 2015 johnston et al 2017 and the lowest abundance was above 0 1 eyice et al 2015 li et al 2017a 2017b it is still not clear whether extremely rare microorganisms 0 1 involved in assimilating stable isotope labeled substrates could be enriched and identified in the heavy dna fraction alternatively mmi is a recently developed technique that can effectively separate functional microbes by magnetic fields zhang et al 2015 unlike dna sip targeting isotope labeled dna fragments mmi does not require substrate labeling and dna fractionation wang et al 2016 thus mmi is considered as a promising tool for identifying the active functional cells in complex environmental media however mmi cannot accurately specify the functional microorganisms owing to the contamination from fast growing bacteria such as microorganisms represented by otu 10 and otu 5 in this study accordingly we hypothesized that mmi coupling with sip can solve the challenges of either approach mentioned above as a powerful tool to identify the active functional bacteria from a complex microbial community with higher resolution and accuracy comparing to either sip or mmi individually in our novel mmi sip approach mmi behaves as a pre screening tool to separate the active functional microorganisms raising the enrichment ratio of 13c labeled dna and increasing the resolution to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism fig 1 sip tracks the flow of stable isotope from 13c phenantherene into the active microbes and confirmed their functions for phenanthrene metabolism dumont and murrell 2005 zhang et al 2015 in the present study the relative abundance of extremely rare microorganisms otu 53 0 02 in original wastewater increased to 2 75 in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c mmi sip microcosms proving that mmi sip could separate extremely rare microorganisms responsible for in situ phenanthrene degradation accordingly mmi sip significantly improves the resolution and accuracy for identifying the active functional bacteria here only one consecutive incubation was applied in mmi sip treatments to compare the active phenanthrene degraders identified by mmi sip and mmi sip since mmi treatments might enrich phenanthrene degrading bacteria and increase their assimilation of 13c phenantherene another pre enrichment with phenanthrene of the wastewater community without mmi is suggested before conducting sip and it will be improved in our future studies it is worth mentioning that mmi sip could also provide a more precise map of the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation than mmi or sip individually fig 2 less than 2 of the bacterial populations in the original wastewater were separated in mmi sip suggesting that only a minor proportion of all the microorganisms in wastewater were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism it was concordant with our previous work reporting that only rare species with low abundance were responsible for metabolizing phenanthrene in the whole microbiota li et al 2017a 2017b since sip could only identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism with abundance 0 1 and the enrichment ratio was poor the microbial community structure of the heavy dna fractions of the 13c sip microcosms is therefore significantly different from the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation and shows a huge distance in pcoa score plot fig 2 although mmi has higher resolution in separating the active functional bacteria its low accuracy sets the barrier to achieve the precise characterization of the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation our proposed mmi sip approach successfully resolves the problems of both sip and mmi and the microbial structure of the heavy dna fraction from the 13c mmi sip microcosms was very similar to the active microbial community responsible for phenanthrene degradation fig 2 the active microorganisms responsible for in situ phenanthrene degradation are affiliated to pseudomonas sphingobium and pigmentiphaga pseudomonas is a well known pahs degrading bacterial lineage and members of this genus contain pah rhdα genes encoding the pahs degradative pathway thomas et al 2016 sphingobium can also metabolise a wide range of pahs cunliffe and kertesz 2006 the degradation of phenanthrene by pseudomonas and sphingobium has been previously reported otto et al 2016 members of the genus pigmentiphaga possess versatile metabolic capabilities such as the pathways for degrading benzoxazolinone acetamiprid and chlorothalonil dong et al 2018 however limited studies have addressed their ability to metabolise pahs the only one example to our knowledge has confirmed that pigmentiphaga were associated with naphthalene and phenanthrene degradation jones et al 2011 our mmi sip results provide direct evidence that members of the genus pigmentiphaga are responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism in pah contaminated wastewater besides higher resolution in identifying the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism mmi sip enriched the relative abundance of pah rhdα genes in the heavy dna fraction fig 5 the abundance of the rhdα genes was reported to correlate with pahs degradation efficiency ding et al 2010 and the temporal changes in the activities of the pah degraders bearing pah rhdα genes during pahs degradation process demonstrated its strong link with bacterial degradation capability guo et al 2017 in the present study the relative abundance of pah rhdα genes was positively correlated with that of the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism hinting that they might belong to pseudomonas sphingobium or pigmentiphaga in the 13c mmi sip microcosms many studies have successfully amplified functional genes using pcr primers from 13c dna neufeld et al 2007a uhlik et al 2009 however it is difficult to determine the affiliation of the functional gene sequences to 16s rrna genes neufeld et al 2007a future work is suggested to directly link the identities of the active microbes responsible for phenanthrene degradation to their metabolisms via metagenomics and protein sip jehmlich et al 2016 5 conclusions a novel mmi sip method was developed and employed to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism from pah contaminated wastewater microbes affiliated to pseudomonas and sphingobium were responsible for phenanthrene metabolism from the sip results mmi sip significantly increased the abundance of pseudomonas and sphingobium in the heavy dna fractions and found one more pigmentiphaga involved in phenanthrene metabolism further evidence was also found from the higher enrichment of pah rhdα genes in the heavy dna fraction of the 13c mmi sip than that in the 13c sip microcosms our results suggested that mmi sip is a reliable cultivation independent approach to identify functional microbes from complex microbiota with higher resolution and accuracy comparing to mmi or sip alone additionally mmi sip successfully separated the active phenanthrene degrading consortium and significantly increased the phenanthrene removal efficiency our study indicates that mmi sip approach is a successful tool to distinguish the in situ active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation it might provide a more precise map and new mechanisms of the active microbes involved in the biodegradation of other organic pollutants and help in understanding their ecological roles and influential factors during the microbial degradation processes

solution and initial concentration of 5 fu on the process efficiency a comparison of the decomposition rate of all the tested drugs showed a decrease in the pseudo first order rate constants in the following order k imb k mtx k cf k if k 5 fu mineralization current efficiency mce was determined for all the drugs based on the removal amount of total organic carbon toc and their values decreased in the same order as values of drug degradation rate k based on the identified degradation products electrochemical oxidation pathways of the decomposed drugs were proposed in the case of cf if and 5 fu the degradation process occurred mainly through ketonization hydroxylation and dehalogenation while mtx and imb were decomposed by attack of hydroxyl radicals on benzyl position in parent compounds an important part of the research was the evaluation of eco toxicity of electrochemically treated drug solutions against lemna minor toxicity of initial 5 fu and mtx solutions towards l minor were observed but after electrochemical treatment its toxicity decreased the opposite trend was observed for cf and if in this case no significant toxicity was observed for the initial solutions of these drugs while after electrochemical treatment an increase in growth inhibition of l minor was found graphical abstract image 1 keywords anticancer drug electrochemical oxidation degradation pathway eco toxicity 1 introduction cytostatic drugs are widely used in anticancer therapy due to the increasing number of cancer incidence year by year the consumption of these drugs is also increasing mahnik et al 2007 nussbaumer et al 2011 chemotherapy drugs mostly act by damage to dna or prevent chromosomal replication by disrupting critical cell processes which lead to cell death these drugs act not only on cancer cells but may also cause unwanted effects in healthy cells toolaram et al 2014 what is more some of them are characterized by carcinogen teratogen and mutagen properties therefore they may pose a risk if they were discharged to the environment so far the presence of anticancer drugs have been detected in surface waters at a concentration level of ng l 1 in countries such as switzerland romania uk and spain česen et al 2016 booker et al 2014 kosjek and heath 2011 zhang et al 2013 moreover most anticancer drugs are resistant to water self purification processes such as hydrolysis biodegradation or photolysis kosjek and heath 2011 toolaram et al 2014 the main source of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment were hospital or municipal wastewaters insufficiently treated by conventional treatment processes it was confirmed by the presence of similar concentrations of the drugs in influents and effluents zhang et al 2013 from wastewater treatment plants in such a case the effective elimination of cytostatic drugs from wastewater is a significant challenge advanced oxidation processes aops are promising methods of effective removal of these drugs from wastewater and water but so far there are not many studies describing such an application of aops an alternative for the conventional water and wastewater treatment can be the advanced electrochemical processes belonging to aops benefiting from advantages such as versatility environmental compatibility amenability of automation potential cost effectiveness and safety because of mild operating conditions martínez huitle and brillas 2009 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 panizza and cerisola 2009 an electrochemical oxidation at anode is one of the processes used for removal of poorly biodegradable organic pollutants this method was successfully used for degradation of dyes mohan et al 2007 morsi et al 2011 santos et al 2008 singh et al 2013 pesticides balci et al 2009 bouya et al 2012 polcaro et al

oxidized by direct electron transfer to the anode or by chemical reaction with electrogenerated active oxygen species at the anode surface formed by water discharge martínez huitle and brillas 2009 the decomposition of organic matter with active oxygen species is frequently much more effective in wastewater treatment than the direct oxidation of organic pollutants the types of reaction involved in the removal of the pollutants are strongly dependent on the electrode material panizza and cerisola 2009 among all known materials the boron doped diamond bdd thin film is best for the indirect electrochemical oxidation martínez huitle and brillas 2009 at bdd anode hydroxyl radicals formed by reaction eq 1 react poorly with the electrode surface allowing an easy reaction with organic compounds eq 2 leading to their mineralization additionally the bdd anode has unique properties such as high o2 evolution overvoltage remarkable corrosion stability even in strongly acidic media inert

it has been reported that the decomposition rate and current efficiency for electrochemical oxidation of organic compounds with bdd depend on several operating parameters such as current density ph of treated solution temperature and pollutant concentration fabiańska et al 2015 2014 pieczyńska et al 2015 santos et al 2008 in search for the best operating conditions which can be applied for effective removal of the relevant pollutants detailed studies of these variables are necessary over the last years many studies have reported good performance of the application of electrochemical oxidation with bdd to degrade pharmaceutical compounds such as sulfamethoxazole sulfachloropyridazine trimethoprim and ketoprofen de amorim et al 2013 domínguez et al 2010 el ghenymy et al 2013a haidar et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge there have not been any studies on the electrochemical oxidation of cytostatic drugs from water solutions using bdd electrode except ours fabiańska et al 2015 the aim of this study was to evaluate the electrochemical degradation with bdd electrode of the widely used in chemotherapy drugs i e 5 fluorouracil 5 fu ifosfamide if cyclophosphamide cf methotrexate mtx and imatinib imb imatinib is a new generation anticancer drug which has been used in targeted therapy since 2004 while the other studied drugs were applied in medicine in the 50s the influence of different experimental conditions such as ph current density temperature and the initial concentration of drug on the electrolysis of the 5 fu was studied the most preferred conditions were applied to remove five anticancer drugs 5 fu if cf mtx and imb based on the degradation products identified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry lc esi ms the electrochemical degradation pathways of treated drugs were proposed furthermore the eco toxicity of cytostatic drug solutions during the electrochemical oxidation was tested on duckweed lemna

to fabiańska et al 2014 the growth inhibition induced by pure electrolyte na2so4 and hclo was measured the solutions of cytostatic drugs 50 mg l 1 of each before and during degradation were diluted 1 10 v v with the sterile steinberg medium each experiment was repeated at least twice with six controls consisting of pure steinberg medium 3 results 3 1 the influence of experimental variables on electrochemical oxidation of 5 fu it is known that the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants by electrochemical decomposition strongly depends on operating conditions therefore in the first step the influence of current density initial ph of solution temperature and concentration of 5 fu was investigated the applied current density was the first parameter which was examined it regulates the equilibrium between the amount of hydroxyl radicals production and o2 evolution as a waste energy side reaction at bdd electrode electrochemical oxidation of 5 fu was conducted at 5 10 and 16 ma cm 2 all studied values of current densities were higher than the limiting current density i ilim 1 1 ma cm 2 fabiańska et al 2015 therefore the oxidation processes were under the mass transport control the initial concentration of 5 fu solution was 5 mg l 1 at ph 6 and temperature of 20 c as can be seen in fig 1 a at the highest current density larger amounts of hydroxyl radicals were generated and elevated degradation rate of 5 fu was obtained el ghenymy et al 2014 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 the same behavior was observed in degradation of ifosfamide fabiańska et al 2015 and sulfonamides fabiańska et al 2014 on bdd electrode in our previous work other research groups using electrochemical oxidation in pharmaceuticals removal from solution at concentrations ranging from 100 mg l 1 to 1930 mg l 1 also found such a trend ammar et al 2016 brinzila et al 2012 el ghenymy et al 2013a salazar et al 2016 in experiments with different current density the 5 fu decomposition occurs under pseudo first order reaction the reaction rate constant obtained for 16 ma cm 2 k 0 0361 min 1 was 3 5 times higher than the rate constant obtained for 5 ma cm 2 k 0 0102 min 1 and as it is shown in fig a1 supplementary data at both current densities the same amount of specific electrical charge q which passed through the solution destroyed the same amount of drug in all the cases a complete drug removal was observed at q of 2 ah l 1 this suggested that the applied energy even at the highest value of current density 16 ma cm 2 was wasted in the same amount for o2 evolution side reaction because the drug decomposition was quickest at 16 ma cm 2 this current density was selected for further study the effect of temperature on the electrochemical oxidation of 5 mg l 1 5 fu solution was investigated at 20 40 and 50 c with 16 ma cm 2 at ph 6 as can be seen in fig 1b the increase in temperature significantly accelerated the degradation rate the pseudo first order rate constants k 0 0361 min 1 obtained for 5 fu degradation at 20 c was 1 75 times lower than k 0 0633 min 1 at 40 c and 3 8 times lower than k 0 1376 min 1 at 50 c additionally after half an hour of electrochemical decomposition of 5 fu at 50 c degradation efficiency was 100 while at 40 and 20 c it was 81 and 64 respectively this can be explained by the mass transfer coefficient increase and enhancement of hydroxyl radicals generation with temperature ozcan et al 2008 yahiaoui et al 2013 what is more the stability of organics decreases with growing temperature complex temperature effect on the 5 fu oxidation was suggested by not linear correlation r2 0 9091 between ln k versus 1 t in temperature range of 20 50 c as reported by fabiańska et al 2014 ph of solutions treated by electrochemical oxidation can influence the efficiency of the pharmaceuticals removal due to the presence of various ionized forms of the drugs the pka value of 5 fu was 8 2 zhang et al 2013 therefore in ph below pka 5 fu exists in a neutral form while in ph above pka 5 fu appears mainly as an anion the role of the initial ph of solution in the decomposition of drug was studied for two ph values below pka 3 4 6 0 and ph of 9 4 above pka of 5 fu the obtained results are presented in fig 1c the fastest decomposition rate of 5 fu was observed at ph of 6 0 k 0 0361 min 1 in an alkaline medium a decrease in degradation efficiency and degradation rate k 0 0111 min 1 was observed the same correlation under electrochemical degradation of metronidazole was observed by ammar et al 2016 as a result of the lowest amount and lowest potential oxidation of generated hydroxyl radicals additionally in an alkaline medium the generation of hydroperoxide anion ho2 which acts as a oh scavenger and the side reaction of oxygen evaluation are more promoted than in acidic conditions lebik elhadi et al 2018 murugananthan et al 2011 those phenomena degrease generation of hydroxyl radicals and makes compounds diffusion to electrode surface difficult on the other hand the slower degradation rate k 0 0177 min 1 at ph 3 than 6 can result of few factors as it was reported 5 fu in neutral form which exist in acidic solution is less attractive to radicals attack than the ionized form which occurs in alkaline conditions legay et al 2014 at ph 6 5 fu partially occurs in the ionized form is less stable and it decomposition is quicker than in acidic conditions the slower degradation in an acidic medium was also observed by murugananthan et al 2007 during the electrochemical oxidation of 17β estradiol at ph 2 what was explained by neutralization of hydroxyl radicals by h in an acidic solution the fastest drug decomposition at ph close to neutral is beneficial from both the economic and environmental point of view in the wastewater the drug residues occurred in a wide range of concentrations dependently on their source therefore the drug concentration influence on the electrochemical oxidation efficiency and degradation rate was examined for the initial concentration range of 5 fu from 1 to 50 mg l 1 the variation of 5 fu concentration in time is presented in fig 1d as can be seen a complete removal from solution of 50 mg l 1 of 5 fu took 6 h while complete degradation of 1 mg l 1 of 5 fu took half an hour the rate constants k 0 0813 min 1 obtained for 5 fu decomposition in concentration of 1 mg l 1was 2 25 and 10 times higher than k 0 0361 min 1 calculated respectively for solution with concentration of 5 mg l 1 and k 0 0086 min 1 for solution with concentration of 50 mg l 1 however at a given period of time a higher amount of 5 fu was removed at a greater concentration of it making the process more efficient for example at 30 min of the process 1 mg l 1 2 5 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 of 5 fu was removed starting from 1 mg l 1 5 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 initial drug concentration respectively this behavior is associated with a mass transfer controlled process at applied current density ammar et al 2016 fabiańska et al 2015 3 2 electrochemical degradation of selected anticancer drugs the selected experimental conditions for the 5 fu electrochemical oxidation current density 16 ma cm 2 ph 6 and temperature 20 c were applied to investigate the electrochemical efficiency and degradation pathway of the other cytostatic drugs five drugs 5 fu if cf mtx imb which were characterized by a different structure of molecules and physicochemical properties were used in the study zhang et al 2013 mtx and imb were multi aromatic ring compounds with pyrimidine pyridine and benzene molecules 5 fu possessed one pyrimidine ring with fluorine atom while if and cp are heteroatom cyclic compounds with aliphatic chains containing chlorine atoms electrochemical degradation of drugs in a solution with concentration of 50 mg l 1 was carried out the experiments revealed that the values of k table 1 decreased in the following order k imb k mtx k cf k if k 5 fu the pseudo first order rate constants determined for imb were 2 2 5 7 5 7 and 6 5 times higher than k for mtx if cf and 5 fu respectively this can be explained by the fact that hydroxyl radicals are electrophiles and prefer to attack places in compounds with a high number of electrons such as benzyl position therefore compounds with extensive structures having more electro donor places such as imb and mtx were characterized by faster electrochemical degradation than aliphatic compounds like if cp and small molecules as 5 fu as can be seen in fig 2 a a complete removal of 50 mg l 1 of imb was performed in 60 min of electrolysis while the decomposition of the same amount of mtx took twice as long a total oxidation of 50 mg l 1 of if cf and 5 fu took more than 300 min during electrochemical oxidation of anticancer drugs cod removal was investigated fig 2b however in the case of cod elimination a different trend was observed in the first part of mtx and imb decomposition process a 10 increase in the initial cod value was found and after that a steady decline in cod was observed these phenomena can be a result of better chemical oxidation of generated products in cod determination conditions than the native compounds this is confirmed by the fact that the initial experimental cod is lower than the theoretical oxygen demand thod 10 for mtx and 25 for imb the faster cod removal was obtained for cf if and mtx than for 5 fu and imb slower cod elimination in the case of 5 fu and imb may be due to more stable intermediates produced during the oxidation which was also observed by zhang et al during the direct photolysis of 5 fu zhang et al 2017 it is worth noting that after 6 h of electrochemical oxidation despite the complete removal of drugs mineralization was incomplete for all the cytostatic compounds table 2 additionally a higher removal efficiency of cod than toc was observed the toc reduction of 77 was reached for if and imb followed in order by mtx and 5 fu with 71 and 69 while the lowest value of 65 was obtained for cf a different dependence was observed in the case of cod removal efficiency where the highest value 100 was obtained for cf and if lower amounts 96 89 and 81 were found for mtx 5 fu and imb respectively the toc value includes the whole organic matter amount present in the sample while small highly oxidized compounds such as carboxylic acids resistant to electrochemical oxidation have insignificantly influenced the values of cod during the electrochemical decomposition of all the drugs nitrogen was released at a high rate 100 for mtx cf and if 85 for imb and 78 for 5 fu it indicates that the degradation products of 5 fu and imb left after the processes contained organic nitrogen the released inorganic nitrogen were in too form ammonium and nitrates nitrates were generated in 35 48 62 69 and 88 of released n respectively for if 5 fu imb mtx and cf it is worth pointing out that even though if and cf have similar structure and decomposed at similar rates constants cf was much slower in mineralization the results indicate that cf was mainly decomposed to small molecular carboxylic acids high toc low cod while if was mineralized to co2 to a larger extend than cf low toc low cod moreover in cf case much more nitrogen was generated as nitrates compered to if where inorganic nitrogen were in the form of ammonium it demonstrated that cfs organic intermediates are less susceptible to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals than ammonium the differences in mineralization and oxidation of released nitrogen between cf and if confirm our previous assumptions fabiańska et al 2015 about different electrochemical degradation pathway of these drugs based on the amount of toc removed mce values for each drug were calculated table 1 the values of mineralization current efficiency decreased in the following order mce imb mce mtx mce if mce cf mce 5 fu these results were analogous to the order of drug degradation rate it means that the higher the mce the less energy was wasted on side reaction in the case of compounds with extensive structure susceptible to hydroxyl radicals attack 3 3 degradation pathway for the identification of organic degradation products liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in a positive and negative mode was used it should be noted that for the first time electrochemical oxidation pathways of anticancer drug such as imb and mtx were presented 3 3 1 imb degradation pathway seven major intermediates of imb with m h 340 264 253 245 219 and m h 380 261 formed during electrochemical oxidation are presented in fig 3 the main decomposition pathway was recognized to involve hydroxyl radicals attack on benzyl positions in imb particle the effect of this pathway was oxidative cleavage of piperazine ring from imb molecule forming intermediate with m h 380 in turn a degradation product with m h 340 was obtained by breaking n c bond and losing both pyridine and pyrimidine rings from the parent compound further attack of oh radicals on benzyl position of m h 340 led to the formation of three intermediates with m h 219 253 264 the product m h 380 which was identified as n 4 methyl 3 4 pyridin 3 yl pyrimidin 2 ylamino phenyl benzamide was decomposed by removal of benzoic acid amide to m h 261 and by benzene and pyridine rings cleavage to m h 245 the similar pathway including in the first stage an attack of oh radicals on benzyl positions resulting in detachment of aromatic rings was found by palma goyes et al and singh et al during electrochemical oxidation of dyes crystal violet palma goyes et al 2010 and malachite green singh et al 2013 moreover there was no observed direct attack of hydroxyl radicals on the aromatic rings as was in the case of sulfonamides oxidation fabiańska et al 2014 this confirms that the benzyl position is more preferred by the hydroxyl radical attack than the aromatic rings most likely further degradation leads to the formation of multiple substituted benzene pyridine pyrimidine and piperazine by products later the ring opening leads to the formation of low molecular weight organics which were partly oxidized to co2 and inorganic ions which confirms the release of 85 of inorganic nitrogen after 6 h of the process the rest 15 of nitrogen is included in the organic intermediates table 1 the degradation pathway proposed based on the identified byproducts is presented in fig 3 3 3 2 mtx degradation pathway in the case of mtx six degradation products were identified four of them were identified for the first time the proposed decomposition pathway of mtx is presented in fig 4 as can be seen two main degradation steps can be observed the first group of products with m h 471 485 503 were formed by hydroxylation and ketonization of benzyl position and benzene ring next m h 383 and m h 281 were produced by the detachment of propionic acid and pteridine ring from mtx respectively in turn intermediates with m h 284 were formed by cleavage of pteridine ring and simultaneously hydroxylation of benzene ring calza et al 2014 and lutterbeck et al 2015a presented the photochemical and photocatalytic degradation pathway of mtx the intermediates m h 471 and m h 281 reported by the authors were also identified in our study this may be due to the main role played by hydroxyl radicals in these processes further electrochemical oxidation leads to releasing 85 of inorganic nitrogen table 1 probably as a result of decomposition of pteridine ring the remaining organic intermediates representing 29 of the initial toc probably include small molecular compounds like carboxylic acids low cod value and a small amount of organic amines 15 of nitrogen left in organic form 3 3 3 5 fu decomposition pathway the applied electrochemical oxidation led to the formation of 5 fu intermediates with m h 143 165 159 and m h 145 175 as can be seen in fig 5 the first step of 5 fu decomposition was the addition of hydroxyl groups to the pyrimidine ring and fluorine atom substitution similar degradation products were observed by lutterbeck et al 2016 and kosjek et al 2013 during uv photolysis and photocatalysis in the next stage of electrochemical oxidation cleavage of the ring was observed an analysis of inorganic ions after 6 h of the process showed that the 100 of f and almost 80 of inorganic nitrogen were released table 1 from the drug which means that the remaining organic degradation products contain 31 of the initial toc 20 of initial tn and without fluorine atoms in their structure the 5 fu decay pathway is presented in fig 5 3 3 4 if and cp pathways decomposition fig 6 and fig 7 shown electrochemical degradation pathways of if and cf in our previews paper fabiańska et al 2015 two degradation products of cf with m h 259 275 and three of if with m h 275 277 279 were already presented in the case of both drugs additional products were identified these were m h 241 249 and m h 221 233 compounds after cf decomposition and m h 249 for if treated solution they were obtained by dechlorination process there were also observed ketonization and hydroxylation of the cyclic part of cp leading to intermediates with m h 291 275 249 m h 233 in an analogous way if intermediates with m h 165 249 275 277 were formed further these products decayed by detachment of aliphatic chains m h 165 and by opening the cyclic part of drugs molecules m h 279 277 the next group of identified intermediates of if and cf were m h 139 and m h 195 formed acyclic compounds an analysis of different inorganic ions after 6 h of electrochemical oxidation of if and cf showed a release of 80 and 65 of p po4 3 respectively and 100 of nitrogen in both cases table 1 this means that organic intermediates did not contain nitrogen however they can contain phosphorous in their molecules the organic intermediates in drug solution expressed as toc after 6 h of electrochemical process included low molecular weight carboxylic acids because the cod value was very low moreover negligible amount of released chloride ions were observed during both if and cf degradation this indicated the formation of chlorinoorganic intermediates or oxidation of released cl to cl2 hclo directly on bdd surface or by hydroxyl radicals fabiańska et al 2015 murugananthan et al 2011 both electrochemical and photocatalytic degradation pathways lai et al 2015 fiszka borzyszkowska et al 2016 observed in this and our previous study included ketonization and hydroxylation of cf and if moreover dechloration was also observed in both processes however in the case of the electrochemical process oxidation of chloride was possible the further study should be focused on the difference of po4 3 released from cf and if 3 4 eco toxicity evaluation for the first time duckweed lemna minor was used to evaluate eco toxicity of anticancer drug solution treated by eaops so far only the marine bacteria vibrio fischeri were used to test the other aops effluents lai et al 2015 lin and lin 2014 lutterbeck et al 2016 2015a 2015b l minor test was chosen because the water plants may be exposed to the drugs occurrence in aquatic environmental additionally in previous study this test was more sensitive than vibrio fischeri or daphnia magna to 5 fu and mtx białk bielińska et al 2017 as it was done in the previous research fabiańska et al 2014 samples from electrochemical oxidation were diluted in steinberg medium which is necessary for proper growth of duckweed during the test at the same time toxicity of na2so4 the electrolyte in the electrochemical degradation was investigated which showed a marginal inhibition of l minor growth in the range of used concentrations fig 8 presents the relation between the toxicity of electrochemical oxidation of anticancer drugs and time as can be seen toxicity of imb in electrolysis time varied only slightly and after a few hours slightly increased fig 8a the non toxicity of the initial imb solution of 5 mg l 1 concentration was found due to the 10 times lower drug concentration than the ec50 61 05 mg l 1 białk bielińska et al 2017 while the low toxicity of electrochemically treated effluent indicated that the degradation products od imb formed during the process are also biologically inactive in the case of mtx and 5 fu the initial solutions were toxic towards l minor and during the time of electrolysis toxicity dropped with decreasing concentrations of the drugs fig 8b and c these results suggest lower toxicity of formed intermediates than native compounds the same relations of decreasing toxicity to v fischeri during photocatalytic degradation of 5 fu and mtx were reported by lutterbeck et al lutterbeck et al 2015a 2015b moreover lutterbek et al lutterbeck et al 2015b identified in effluent only the degradation products which according to the in silico toxicity prediction may not show mutagenic and genotoxic properties the opposite situation was observed for cf and if where solutions before electrochemical degradation did not inhibit lemna minor growth which was expected taking into account the drug concentration of 5 mg l 1 in the initial solution ec50 for if as well as cf presented in the previous research białk bielińska et al 2017 were more than 100 mg l 1 however toxicity of effluents increased in electrolysis time for both if and cf fig 8d and e inhibition of duckweed growth was observed all the time even after 6 h of electrolysis when the cod was removed in 100 for both drugs and toc elimination was 77 and 65 for if and cf respectively these results suggest that during the electrochemical oxidation of nitrogen mustard derivatives toxic degradation products were formed according to lai et al 2015 who also observed increasing luminescence inhibition of vibrio fischeri bacteria during if and cf photocatalytic degradation the increase in toxicity was connected with chlorinated organic byproducts formation on the other hand the released cl ions theoretically even 13 3 mg l 1 from these drugs decomposition may be oxidized at bdd anode to perchlorates according to the reaction 8 10 fabiańska et al 2015 8 2cl bdd cl2 2e 9 cl2 h2o hocl h cl 10 hocl h ocl therefore the toxicity test was carried out for hclo solution it showed that concentration lower than 2 mg l 1 hocl inhibited 75 of l minor growth data not shown therefore the increased toxicity observed during electrochemical oxidation of if and cf can be a result of synergic effect of both chloroorganics and inorganic chlorine active species generation toxicity experiments have shown that the toxicity of treated solutions strongly depends not only on drug removal efficiency but also on the toxicity of degradation products and presence of inorganic ions therefore toxicity monitoring of effluents from aops is significant information on the safety of the process 4 conclusion in the present study the influence of current density temperature ph of solution and initial concentration of 5 fu on electrochemical oxidation efficiency were investigated the obtained results indicate that the higher the current density and temperature the faster degradation was observed the highest 5 fu degradation rate was determined for ph 6 what is more the higher concentration of the drug used the more time for removal of this compound was needed in the next step electrochemical oxidation in the best experimental conditions was applied to selected anticancer drug degradation the studies have shown that the compounds with extensive structures such as mtx and imb are more attractive to hydroxyl radicals attack than the compounds with smaller molecules cf if 5 fu because of the greater number of electro donor places moreover mce of electrochemical oxidation suggested that cp is most resistant to electrochemical oxidation due to the transformation to small molecular carboxylic acids as a by product for none of the tested drugs a complete mineralization was observed after 6 h of the process furthermore based on the identified degradation products for the first time the electrochemical oxidation pathway of the tested anticancer drugs was proposed the investigation of imb and mtx decomposition products showed an attack of radicals on benzyl position of the compounds and oxidative cleavage of aromatic rings at a later stage of the process the aromatic rings are decayed by the release of an inorganic form of nitrogen in the case of 5 fu cf and if the ketonization and hydroxylation processes formed the main degradation products what is more dehalogenation of if cf and 5 fu was observed finally the eco toxicity of solutions treated by electrochemical degradation against l minor was demonstrated the results showed a decrease in l minor growth inhibition with decreasing concentration of 5 fu and mtx during electrochemical oxidation an opposite situation occurred in the case of if and cf where an increased toxicity of the effluents was observed this probably results from the formation of reactive chlorine species like hclo and chloroorganic products acknowledgment financial

electrode was investigated in the first step the operating parameters of electrolysis were optimized studies have demonstrated a significant influence of applying current density temperature ph of

following order k imb k mtx k cf k if k 5 fu mineralization current efficiency mce was determined for all the drugs based on the removal amount of total organic carbon toc and their values decreased in the same order as values of drug degradation rate k based on the identified degradation products electrochemical oxidation pathways of the decomposed drugs were proposed in the case of cf if and 5 fu the degradation process occurred mainly through ketonization hydroxylation and dehalogenation while mtx and imb were decomposed by attack of hydroxyl radicals on benzyl position in parent compounds an important part of the research was the evaluation of eco toxicity of electrochemically treated drug solutions against lemna minor toxicity of initial 5 fu and mtx solutions towards l minor were observed but after electrochemical treatment its toxicity decreased the opposite trend was observed for cf and if in this case no significant toxicity was observed for the initial solutions of these drugs while after electrochemical treatment an increase in growth inhibition of l minor was found graphical abstract image 1 keywords anticancer drug electrochemical oxidation degradation pathway eco toxicity 1 introduction cytostatic drugs are widely used in anticancer therapy due to the increasing number of cancer incidence year by year the consumption of these drugs is also increasing mahnik et al 2007 nussbaumer et al 2011 chemotherapy drugs mostly act by damage to dna or prevent chromosomal replication by disrupting critical cell processes which lead to cell death these drugs act not only on cancer cells but may also cause unwanted effects in healthy cells toolaram et al 2014 what is more some of them are characterized by carcinogen teratogen and mutagen properties therefore they may pose a risk if they were discharged to the environment so far the presence of anticancer drugs have been detected in surface waters at a concentration level of ng l 1 in countries such as switzerland romania uk and spain česen et al 2016 booker et al 2014 kosjek and heath 2011 zhang et al 2013 moreover most anticancer drugs are resistant to water self purification processes such as hydrolysis biodegradation or photolysis kosjek and heath 2011 toolaram et al 2014 the main source of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment were hospital or municipal wastewaters insufficiently treated by conventional treatment processes it was confirmed by the presence of similar concentrations of the drugs in influents and effluents zhang et al 2013 from wastewater treatment plants in such a case the effective elimination of cytostatic drugs from wastewater is a significant challenge advanced oxidation processes aops are promising methods of effective removal of these drugs from wastewater and water but so far there are not many studies describing such an application of aops an alternative for the conventional water and wastewater treatment can be the advanced electrochemical processes

oxidized by direct electron transfer to the anode or by chemical reaction with electrogenerated active oxygen species at the anode surface formed by water discharge martínez huitle and brillas 2009 the decomposition of organic matter with active oxygen species is frequently much more effective in wastewater treatment than the direct oxidation of organic pollutants the types of reaction involved

fabiańska et al 2015 the aim of this study was to evaluate the electrochemical degradation with bdd electrode of the widely used in chemotherapy drugs i e 5 fluorouracil 5 fu ifosfamide if cyclophosphamide cf methotrexate mtx and imatinib imb imatinib is a new generation anticancer drug which has been used in targeted therapy since 2004 while the other studied drugs were applied in medicine in the 50s the influence of different experimental conditions such as ph current density temperature and the initial concentration of drug on the electrolysis of the 5 fu was studied the most preferred conditions were applied to remove five anticancer drugs 5 fu if cf mtx and imb based on the degradation products identified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry lc esi ms

to fabiańska et al 2014 the growth inhibition induced by pure electrolyte na2so4 and hclo was measured the solutions of cytostatic drugs 50 mg l 1 of each before and during degradation were diluted 1 10 v v with the sterile steinberg medium each experiment was repeated at least twice with six controls consisting of pure steinberg medium 3 results 3 1 the influence of experimental variables on electrochemical oxidation of 5 fu it is known that the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants by electrochemical decomposition strongly depends on operating conditions therefore in the first step the influence of current density initial ph of solution temperature and concentration of 5 fu was investigated the applied current density was the first parameter which was examined it regulates the equilibrium between the amount of hydroxyl radicals production and o2 evolution as a waste energy side reaction at bdd electrode electrochemical oxidation of 5 fu was conducted at 5 10 and 16 ma cm 2 all studied values of current densities were higher than the limiting current density i ilim 1 1 ma cm 2 fabiańska et al 2015 therefore the oxidation processes were under the mass transport control the initial concentration of 5 fu solution was 5 mg l 1 at ph 6 and temperature of 20 c as can be seen in fig 1 a at the highest current density larger amounts of hydroxyl radicals were generated and elevated degradation rate of 5 fu was obtained el ghenymy et al 2014 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 the same behavior was observed in degradation of ifosfamide fabiańska et al 2015 and sulfonamides fabiańska et al 2014 on bdd electrode in our previous work other research groups using electrochemical oxidation in pharmaceuticals removal from solution at concentrations ranging from 100 mg l 1 to 1930 mg l 1 also found such a trend ammar et al 2016 brinzila et al 2012 el ghenymy et al 2013a salazar et al 2016 in experiments with different current density the 5 fu decomposition occurs under pseudo first order reaction the reaction rate constant obtained for 16 ma cm 2 k 0 0361 min 1 was 3 5 times higher than the rate constant obtained for 5 ma cm 2 k 0 0102 min 1 and as it is shown in fig a1 supplementary data at both current densities the same amount of specific electrical charge q which passed through the solution destroyed the same amount of drug in all the cases a complete drug removal was observed at q of 2 ah l 1 this suggested that the applied energy even at the highest value of current density 16 ma cm 2 was wasted in the same amount for o2 evolution side reaction because the drug decomposition was quickest at 16 ma cm 2 this current density was selected for further study the effect of temperature on the electrochemical oxidation of 5 mg l 1 5 fu solution was investigated at 20 40 and 50 c with 16 ma cm 2 at ph 6 as can be seen in fig 1b the increase in temperature significantly accelerated the degradation rate the pseudo first order rate constants k 0 0361 min 1 obtained for 5 fu degradation at 20 c was 1 75 times lower than k 0 0633 min 1 at 40 c and 3 8 times lower than k 0 1376 min 1 at 50 c additionally after half an hour of electrochemical decomposition of 5 fu at 50 c degradation efficiency was 100 while at 40 and 20 c it was 81 and 64 respectively this can be explained by the mass transfer coefficient increase and enhancement of hydroxyl radicals generation with temperature ozcan et al 2008 yahiaoui et al 2013 what is more the stability of organics decreases with growing temperature complex temperature effect on the 5 fu oxidation was suggested by not linear correlation r2 0 9091 between ln k versus 1 t in temperature range of 20 50 c as reported by fabiańska et al 2014 ph of solutions treated by electrochemical oxidation can influence the efficiency of the pharmaceuticals removal due to the presence of various ionized forms of the drugs the pka value of 5 fu was 8 2 zhang et al 2013 therefore in ph below pka 5 fu exists in a neutral form while in ph above pka 5 fu appears mainly as an anion the role of the initial ph of solution in the decomposition of drug was studied for two ph values below pka 3 4 6 0 and ph of 9 4 above pka of 5 fu the obtained results are presented in fig 1c the fastest decomposition rate of 5 fu was observed at ph of 6 0 k 0 0361 min 1 in an alkaline medium a decrease in degradation efficiency and degradation rate k 0 0111 min 1 was observed the same correlation under electrochemical degradation of metronidazole was observed by ammar et al 2016 as a result of the lowest amount and lowest potential oxidation of generated hydroxyl radicals additionally in an alkaline medium the generation of hydroperoxide anion ho2 which acts as a oh scavenger and the side reaction of oxygen evaluation are more promoted than in acidic conditions lebik elhadi et al 2018 murugananthan et al 2011 those phenomena degrease generation of hydroxyl radicals and makes compounds diffusion to electrode surface difficult on the other hand the slower degradation rate k 0 0177 min 1 at ph 3 than 6 can result of few factors as it was reported 5 fu in neutral form which exist in acidic solution is less attractive to radicals attack than the ionized form which occurs in alkaline conditions legay et al 2014 at ph 6 5 fu partially occurs in the ionized form is less stable and it decomposition is quicker than in acidic conditions the slower degradation in an acidic medium was also observed by murugananthan et al 2007 during the electrochemical oxidation of 17β estradiol at ph 2 what was explained by neutralization of hydroxyl radicals by h in an acidic solution the fastest drug decomposition at ph close to neutral is beneficial from both the economic and environmental point of view in the wastewater the drug residues occurred in a wide range of concentrations dependently on their source therefore the drug concentration influence on the electrochemical oxidation efficiency and degradation rate was examined for the initial concentration range of 5 fu from 1 to 50 mg l 1 the variation of 5 fu concentration in time is presented in fig 1d as can be seen a complete removal from solution of 50 mg l 1 of 5 fu took 6 h while complete degradation of 1 mg l 1 of 5 fu took half an hour the rate constants k 0 0813 min 1 obtained for 5 fu decomposition in concentration of 1 mg l 1was 2 25 and 10 times higher than k 0 0361 min 1 calculated respectively for solution with concentration of 5 mg l 1 and k 0 0086 min 1 for solution with concentration of 50 mg l 1 however at a given period of time a higher amount of 5 fu was removed at a greater concentration of it making the process more efficient for example at 30 min of the process 1 mg l 1 2 5 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 of 5 fu was removed starting from 1 mg l 1 5 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 initial drug concentration respectively this behavior is associated with a mass transfer controlled process at applied current density ammar et al 2016 fabiańska et al 2015 3 2 electrochemical degradation of selected anticancer drugs the selected experimental conditions for the 5 fu electrochemical oxidation current density 16 ma cm 2 ph 6 and temperature 20 c were applied to investigate the electrochemical efficiency and degradation pathway of the other cytostatic drugs five drugs 5 fu if cf mtx imb which were characterized by a different structure of molecules and physicochemical properties were used in the study zhang et al 2013 mtx and imb were multi aromatic ring compounds with pyrimidine pyridine and benzene molecules 5 fu possessed one pyrimidine ring with fluorine atom while if and cp are heteroatom cyclic compounds with aliphatic chains containing chlorine atoms electrochemical degradation of drugs in a solution with concentration of 50 mg l 1 was carried out the experiments revealed that the values of k table 1 decreased in the following order k imb k mtx k cf k if k 5 fu the pseudo first order rate constants determined for imb were 2 2 5 7 5 7 and 6 5 times higher than k for mtx if cf and 5 fu respectively this can be explained by the fact that hydroxyl radicals are electrophiles and prefer to attack places in compounds with a high number of electrons such as benzyl position therefore compounds with extensive structures having more electro donor places such as imb and mtx were characterized by faster electrochemical degradation than aliphatic compounds like if cp and small molecules as 5 fu as can be seen in fig 2 a a complete removal of 50 mg l 1 of imb was performed in 60 min of electrolysis while the decomposition of the same amount of mtx took twice as long a total oxidation of 50 mg l 1 of if cf and 5 fu took more than 300 min during electrochemical oxidation of anticancer drugs cod removal was investigated fig 2b however in the case of cod elimination a different trend was observed in the first part of mtx and imb decomposition process a 10 increase in the initial cod value was found and after that a steady decline in cod was observed these phenomena can be a result of better chemical oxidation of generated products in cod determination conditions than the native compounds this is confirmed by the fact that the initial experimental cod is lower than the theoretical oxygen demand thod 10 for mtx and 25 for imb the faster cod removal was obtained for cf if and mtx than for 5 fu and imb slower cod elimination in the case of 5 fu and imb may be due to more stable intermediates produced during the oxidation which was also observed by zhang et al during the direct photolysis of 5 fu zhang et al 2017 it is worth noting that after 6 h of electrochemical oxidation despite the complete removal of drugs mineralization was incomplete for all the cytostatic compounds table 2 additionally a higher removal efficiency of cod than toc was observed the toc reduction of 77 was reached for if and imb followed in order by mtx and 5 fu with 71 and 69 while the lowest value of 65 was obtained for cf a different dependence was observed in the case of cod removal efficiency where the highest value 100 was obtained for cf and if lower amounts 96 89 and 81 were found for mtx 5 fu and imb respectively the toc value includes the whole organic matter amount present in the sample while small highly oxidized compounds such as carboxylic acids resistant to electrochemical oxidation have insignificantly influenced the values of cod during the electrochemical decomposition of all the drugs nitrogen was released at a high rate 100 for mtx cf and if 85 for imb and 78 for 5 fu it indicates that the degradation products of 5 fu and imb left after the processes contained organic nitrogen the released inorganic nitrogen were in too form ammonium and nitrates nitrates were generated in 35 48 62 69 and 88 of released n respectively for if 5 fu imb mtx and cf it is worth pointing out that even though if and cf have similar structure and decomposed at similar rates constants cf was much slower in mineralization the results indicate that cf was mainly decomposed to small molecular carboxylic acids high toc low cod while if was mineralized to co2 to a larger extend than cf low toc low cod moreover in cf case much more nitrogen was generated as nitrates compered to if where inorganic nitrogen were in the form of ammonium it demonstrated that cfs organic intermediates are less susceptible to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals than ammonium the differences in mineralization and oxidation of released nitrogen between cf and if confirm our previous assumptions fabiańska et al 2015 about different electrochemical degradation pathway of these drugs based on the amount of toc removed mce values for each drug were calculated table 1 the values of mineralization current efficiency decreased in the following order mce imb mce mtx mce if mce cf mce 5 fu these results were analogous to the order of drug degradation rate it means that the higher the mce the less energy was wasted on side reaction in the case of compounds with extensive structure susceptible to hydroxyl radicals attack 3 3 degradation pathway for the identification of organic degradation products liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in a positive and negative mode was used it should be noted that for the first time electrochemical oxidation pathways of anticancer drug such as imb and mtx were presented 3 3 1 imb degradation pathway seven major intermediates of imb with m h 340 264 253 245 219 and m h 380 261 formed during electrochemical oxidation are presented in fig 3 the main decomposition pathway was recognized to involve hydroxyl radicals attack on benzyl positions in imb particle the effect of this pathway was oxidative cleavage of piperazine ring from imb molecule forming intermediate with m h 380 in turn a degradation product with m h 340 was obtained by breaking n c bond and losing both pyridine and pyrimidine rings from the parent compound further attack of oh radicals on benzyl position of m h 340 led to the formation of three intermediates with m h 219 253 264 the product m h 380 which was identified as n 4 methyl 3 4 pyridin 3 yl pyrimidin 2 ylamino phenyl benzamide was decomposed by removal of benzoic acid amide to m h 261 and by benzene and pyridine rings cleavage to m h 245 the similar pathway including in the first stage an attack of oh radicals on benzyl positions resulting in detachment of aromatic rings was found by palma goyes et al and singh et al during electrochemical oxidation of dyes crystal violet palma goyes et al 2010 and malachite green singh et al 2013 moreover there was no observed direct attack of hydroxyl radicals on the aromatic rings as was in the case of sulfonamides oxidation fabiańska et al 2014 this confirms that the benzyl position is more preferred by the hydroxyl radical attack than the aromatic rings most likely further degradation leads to the formation of multiple substituted benzene pyridine pyrimidine and piperazine by products later the ring opening leads to the formation of low molecular weight organics which were partly oxidized to co2 and inorganic ions which confirms the release of 85 of inorganic nitrogen after 6 h of the process the rest 15 of nitrogen is included in the organic intermediates table 1 the degradation pathway proposed based on the identified byproducts is presented in fig 3 3 3 2 mtx degradation pathway in the case of mtx six degradation products were identified four of them were identified for the first time the proposed decomposition pathway of mtx is presented in fig 4 as can be seen two main degradation steps can be observed the first group of products with m h 471 485 503 were formed by hydroxylation and ketonization of benzyl position and benzene ring next m h 383 and m h 281 were produced by the detachment of propionic acid and pteridine ring from mtx respectively in turn intermediates with m h 284 were formed by cleavage of pteridine ring and simultaneously hydroxylation of benzene ring calza et al 2014 and lutterbeck et al 2015a presented the photochemical and photocatalytic degradation pathway of mtx the intermediates m h 471 and m h 281 reported by the authors were also identified in our study this may be due to the main role played by hydroxyl radicals in these processes further electrochemical oxidation leads to releasing 85 of inorganic nitrogen table 1 probably as a result of decomposition of pteridine ring the remaining organic intermediates representing 29 of the initial toc probably include small molecular compounds like carboxylic acids low cod value and a small amount of organic amines 15 of nitrogen left in organic form 3 3 3 5 fu decomposition pathway the applied electrochemical oxidation led to the formation of 5 fu intermediates with m h 143 165 159 and m h 145 175 as can be seen in fig 5 the first step of 5 fu decomposition was the addition of hydroxyl groups to the pyrimidine ring and fluorine atom substitution similar degradation products were observed by lutterbeck et al 2016 and kosjek et al 2013 during uv photolysis and photocatalysis in the next stage of electrochemical oxidation cleavage of the ring was observed an analysis of inorganic ions after 6 h of the process showed that the 100 of f and almost 80 of inorganic nitrogen were released table 1 from the drug which means that the remaining organic degradation products contain 31 of the initial toc 20 of initial tn and without fluorine atoms in their structure the 5 fu decay pathway is presented in fig 5 3 3 4 if and cp pathways decomposition fig 6 and fig 7 shown electrochemical degradation pathways of if and cf in our previews paper fabiańska et al 2015 two degradation products of cf with m h 259 275 and three of if with m h 275 277 279 were already presented in the case of both drugs additional products were identified these were m h 241 249 and m h 221 233 compounds after cf decomposition and m h 249 for if treated solution they were obtained by dechlorination process there were also observed ketonization and hydroxylation of the cyclic part of cp leading to intermediates with m h 291 275 249 m h 233 in an analogous way if intermediates with m h 165 249 275 277 were formed further these products decayed by detachment of aliphatic chains m h 165 and by opening the cyclic part of drugs molecules m h 279 277 the next group of identified intermediates of if and cf were m h 139 and m h 195 formed acyclic compounds an analysis of different inorganic ions after 6 h of electrochemical oxidation of if and cf showed a release of 80 and 65 of p po4 3 respectively and 100 of nitrogen in both cases table 1 this means that organic intermediates did not contain nitrogen however they can contain phosphorous in their molecules the organic intermediates in drug solution expressed as toc after 6 h of electrochemical process included low molecular weight carboxylic acids because the cod value was very low moreover negligible amount of released chloride ions were observed during both if and cf degradation this indicated the formation of chlorinoorganic intermediates or oxidation of released cl to cl2 hclo directly on bdd surface or by hydroxyl radicals fabiańska et al 2015 murugananthan et al 2011 both electrochemical and photocatalytic degradation pathways lai et al 2015 fiszka borzyszkowska et al 2016 observed in this and our previous study included ketonization and hydroxylation of cf and if moreover dechloration was also observed in both processes however in the case of the electrochemical process oxidation of chloride was possible the further study should be focused on the difference of po4 3 released from cf and if 3 4 eco toxicity evaluation for the first time duckweed lemna minor was used to evaluate eco toxicity of anticancer drug solution treated by eaops so far only the marine bacteria vibrio fischeri were used to test the other aops effluents lai et al 2015 lin and lin 2014 lutterbeck et al 2016 2015a 2015b l minor test was chosen because the water plants may be exposed to the drugs occurrence in aquatic environmental additionally in previous study this test was more sensitive than vibrio fischeri or daphnia magna to 5 fu and mtx białk bielińska et al 2017 as it was done in the previous research fabiańska et al 2014 samples from electrochemical oxidation were diluted in steinberg medium which is necessary for proper growth of duckweed during the test at the same time toxicity of na2so4 the electrolyte in the electrochemical degradation was investigated which showed a marginal inhibition of l minor growth in the range of used concentrations fig 8 presents the relation between the toxicity of electrochemical oxidation of anticancer drugs and time as can be seen toxicity of imb in electrolysis time varied only slightly and after a few hours slightly increased fig 8a the non toxicity of the initial imb solution of 5 mg l 1 concentration was found due to the 10 times lower drug concentration than the ec50 61 05 mg l 1 białk bielińska et al 2017 while the low toxicity of electrochemically treated effluent indicated that the degradation products od imb formed during the process are also biologically inactive in the case of mtx and 5 fu the initial solutions were toxic towards l minor and during the time of electrolysis toxicity dropped with decreasing concentrations of the drugs fig 8b and c these results suggest lower toxicity of formed intermediates than native compounds the same relations of decreasing toxicity to v fischeri during photocatalytic degradation of 5 fu and mtx were reported by lutterbeck et al lutterbeck et al 2015a 2015b moreover lutterbek et al lutterbeck et al 2015b identified in effluent only the degradation products which according to the in silico toxicity prediction may not show mutagenic and genotoxic properties the opposite situation was observed for cf and if where solutions before electrochemical degradation did not inhibit lemna minor growth which was expected taking into account the drug concentration of 5 mg l 1 in the initial solution ec50 for if as well as cf presented in the previous research białk bielińska et al 2017 were more than 100 mg l 1 however toxicity of effluents increased in electrolysis time for both if and cf fig 8d and e inhibition of duckweed growth was observed all the time even after 6 h of electrolysis when the cod was removed in 100 for both drugs and toc elimination was 77 and 65 for if and cf respectively these results suggest that during the electrochemical oxidation of nitrogen mustard derivatives toxic degradation products were formed according to lai et al 2015 who also observed increasing luminescence inhibition of vibrio fischeri bacteria during if and cf photocatalytic degradation the increase in toxicity was connected with chlorinated organic byproducts formation on the other hand the released cl ions theoretically even 13 3 mg l 1 from these drugs decomposition may be oxidized at bdd anode to perchlorates according to the reaction 8 10 fabiańska et al 2015 8 2cl bdd cl2 2e 9 cl2 h2o hocl h cl 10 hocl h ocl therefore the toxicity test was carried out for hclo solution it showed that concentration lower than 2 mg l 1 hocl inhibited 75 of l minor growth data not shown therefore the increased toxicity observed during electrochemical oxidation of if and cf can be a result of synergic effect of both chloroorganics and inorganic chlorine active species generation toxicity experiments have shown that the toxicity of treated solutions strongly depends not only on drug removal efficiency but also on the toxicity of degradation products and presence of inorganic ions therefore toxicity monitoring of effluents from aops is significant information on the safety of the process 4 conclusion in the present study the influence of current density temperature ph of solution and initial concentration of 5 fu on electrochemical oxidation efficiency were investigated the obtained results indicate that the higher the current density and temperature the faster degradation was observed the highest 5 fu degradation rate was determined for ph 6 what is more the higher concentration of the drug used the more time for removal of this compound was needed in the next step electrochemical oxidation in the best experimental conditions was applied to selected anticancer drug degradation the studies have shown that the compounds with extensive structures such as mtx and imb are more attractive to hydroxyl radicals attack than the compounds with smaller molecules cf if 5 fu because of the greater number of electro donor places moreover mce of electrochemical oxidation suggested that cp is most resistant to electrochemical oxidation due to the transformation to small molecular carboxylic acids as a by product for none of the tested drugs a complete mineralization was observed after 6 h of the process furthermore based on the identified degradation products for the first time the electrochemical oxidation pathway of the tested anticancer drugs was proposed the investigation of imb and mtx decomposition products showed an attack of radicals on benzyl position of the compounds and oxidative cleavage of aromatic rings at a later stage of the process the aromatic rings are decayed by the release of an inorganic form of nitrogen in the case of 5 fu cf and if the ketonization and hydroxylation processes formed the main degradation products what is more dehalogenation of if cf and 5 fu was observed finally the eco toxicity of solutions treated by electrochemical degradation against l minor was demonstrated the results showed a decrease in l minor growth inhibition with decreasing concentration of 5 fu and mtx during electrochemical oxidation an opposite situation occurred in the case of if and cf where an increased toxicity of the effluents was observed this probably results from the formation of reactive chlorine species like hclo and chloroorganic products acknowledgment financial

19362,benzotriazoles bts are regarded as contaminants of emerging concern however their transformation products bttps in aquifers remains poorly characterized the present study is the first detailed report on profiles of the bttps in an urban oxic intergranular aquifer related to water type land use and the aquifer s depth the 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole 2 mebt and 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt were quantified using the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analytical technique based on internal standards for the first time the relationship between the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt concentrations was studied in sampled water and discussed with respect to the different flow paths and sources of contamination three main sources of bttps were determined in urban groundwater bts and bttps included in the outflow of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and energy producing facilities into surface streams that recharge the aquifer and in the leaking effluents from industrial and public wastewater pipelines the results confirm that the bttps are transformed from parent compounds in the aquifer s unsaturated zone in the case when the effluents are temporally stored in sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity which is indicated with the highest median concentrations of bttps referring to the perched aquifers where the bttps proportions were 92 99 bttps dominated over the parent bts also in groundwater the highest concentrations of bttps up to 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt ng l 1 respectively were measured in groundwater abstracted from the upper parts of the aquifer in the area where the losses from industrial wastewater pipelines were evidenced the 2 4 dmebt dominated over the 2 mebt in the bttps originating from bts included in the industrial effluents which is the opposite to the case when their origin is in the municipal effluents the median sum concentration of the bttps in drinking water resources 2 0 ng l 1 is lower than the quality criterion recommended for bts so far nevertheless the abundance of bts in the environment and the apparent environmental relevance of the bttps in urban groundwater indicate the need for a risk assessment of bttps with respect to health and the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords intergranular aquifer urban groundwater benzotriazoles transformation products profiles 1 introduction significant progress has been made in the science of urban hydrogeology over recent decades with respect to the protection of drinking groundwater resources from contamination this is closely linked to the classification and characterization of contaminants of emerging concern cecs that might be candidates for future regulation anderson et al 2012 benzotriazoles are regarded as cecs because they are widespread and persistent in the aquatic environment cantwell et al 2015 dummer 2014 giraudo et al 2017 richardson and ternes 2014 the 1h benzotriazole bt parent compound and its derivatives 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 mebt and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5 mebt that are used as a technical mixture called tolytriazole tt are the most widely employed benzotriazoles bts hart et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2010 as an effective corrosion inhibitor bts have a broad range of industrial domestic and commercial applications finšgar and milošev 2010 janna et al 2011 kadar et al 2010 kim et al 2011 vetter and lorenz 2013 they have recently been detected in tap water janna et al 2011 wang et al 2016 human urine asimakopoulos et al 2013 wang et al 2016 and in human adipose tissues wang et al 2015 so far australia has implemented drinking water guidelines for bts including a threshold level of 7 ng l 1 for tt nrmmc et al 2006 whereas the danish ministry of the environment beltoft et al 2013 has recommended a quality criterion of 20 μg l 1 for the bts the occurrence and concentration of bts in urban waters are known alotaibi et al 2015a cantwell et al 2015 careghini et al 2015 giger et al 2006 herrero et al 2014 kiss and fries 2009 2012 liu et al 2011 2013 despite this information about their fate in aquifers remains poorly characterized no proof of the bts transformation products bttps could be found in an anaerobic aquifer that was contaminated by de icing fluids from an abandoned airport breedveld et al 2003 the bttps were detected for the first time in an oxic intergranular aquifer situated under an industrial zone in ljubljana the capital of slovenia with the median sum concentration of the bttps ranging between 10 and 120 ng l 1 trček et al 2018 the constant input of a bt pollutant load from a sewer system was shown to result in environmentally relevant bttps formed via methylation and tautomerization under perched aquifer conditions the major transformation products were identified as 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole 2 mebt for the degradation of the bt and as 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt and 1 4 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole for the degradation of 4 mebt and most probably also 5 mebt afterwards the presence of bttps was examined in an aquatic environment in the city of maribor a distance of 120 km in the framework of micro organic contaminants monitoring cerar and mali 2016 koroša et al 2016 the results pointed to 2 4 dmebt as a typical indicator of urban pollution the median sum concentration of the bttps was determined to be 20 and 7 ng l 1 in groundwater and surface water respectively the mentioned findings prompted a detailed study of the occurrence and distribution of bttps in an urban intergranular aquifer in ljubljana that supplies approximately 300 000 city dwellers with water that is essential for their drinking and sanitation needs the research was based on the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analytical technique the concentrations were determined for two of the most abundant bttps i e 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt trček et al 2018 with the aim being to elucidate their origin and transport related to the water type i e groundwater drinking water surface water perched water land uses i e residential commercial industrial agricultural and green space and the aquifer s depth i e unsaturated zone upper and lower parts of the aquifer for the first time the relationship between the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt concentrations was analysed in sampled water and discussed with respect to the different flow paths and sources of contamination to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first detailed report on bttp profiles in urban groundwaters that improves our understanding of the fate of bts in an aquatic urban environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the municipality of ljubljana is located approximately 300 m above sea level in an alluvial basin filled by pleistocene and holocene fluvial and lacustrine deposits fig 1 fig s1 the basement of the depression is composed of very low permeable carboniferous and permian sediments that also form the basin s edges and isolated hills the ljubljana field in the north the ljubljana moor in the south and the dravlje valley in the west of the ljubljana basin are characterized by the sava ljubljanica and gradščica surface streams with an alpine karstic and dolomite catchment respectively fig 1 the ljubljanica river is a tributary of the sava river the fluvial sediments form an urban intergranular aquifer that is opened in the ne part of the study site al ša and t wq1 sediments in fig 1 the sediments composed mainly of carbonates and silicates uhan and krajnc 2003 are very heterogeneous the upper strata consist mostly of sands and gravels and the lower mostly of conglomerates bračič železnik et al 2005 fig s2 the impermeable or low permeable clay and sandy clay layers cover the aquifer in other parts of the study site šg a and p mq2 sediments in fig 1 in the vicinity of the šišenski hrib hill fig 1 lenses of these sediments locally divide the aquifer into the upper and lower parts and give rise to perched aquifer conditions janža and šram 2014 trček 2017 vizintin et al 2009 the study site occupies approximately 270 km2 including residential industrial and commercial areas that are surrounded by green spaces and agricultural land uses see fig 3 the majority of groundwater for the public water supply and industrial use is abstracted from the unconfined ljubljana field aquifer fig 1 it is remarkable with highly productive aquifer stores approximately 400 million m3 of groundwater and high velocities of groundwater that can exceed 20 m day 1 janža et al 2005 the unsaturated zone is 20 m deep on average whereas the aquifer thickness is up to 100 m the aquifer receives a natural recharge from precipitation and the sava river 2 2 and 2 3 m3 s 1 respectively janža 2015 vizintin et al 2009 as well as via a lateral inflow from the ljubljana moor aquifer in the south 0 3 m3 s 1 vizintin et al 2009 which is reflected in the groundwater flow directions fig 1 the ljubljanica river recharges the aquifer only in the south eastern part of the study site the city of ljubljana has a relatively well regulated sewage system that is 1134 km long the network includes 22 8 of foul sewers 24 7 of pluvial drainage systems 52 3 of combined systems and 0 2 of overflow channels prestor et al 2014 it is old and leaking in some places some 53 4 and 40 1 of the losses result from concrete pipes built before 1975 representing 34 of the total length and between 1975 and 1995 representing 39 of the total length respectively prestor et al 2014 the wastewater is discharged to a central treatment plant in the eastern part of the city fig 1 it contains 11 and 62 of the industrial and municipal effluents respectively jp vodovod kanalizacija url http www vo ka si

were selected according to the water type and land use samples were taken from piezometers or abstraction wells that penetrate layers of the perched aquifers 5 locations of the upper aquifer parts 41 locations of the lower aquifer parts 2 locations or both of them 17 locations the sava river was sampled from 2 piezometers at the riverbank filtration lj 48 and lj57 in fig 1 in total 24 7 14 12 and 8 sampling locations are situated in residential commercial industrial and agricultural areas and in green spaces respectively further information are found in fig 3 and table 1 and table 2 fifty eight sampling locations represent groundwater of which 4 are drinking water resources the sampling locations for the drinking water supply include 2 5 wells close to each other all the wells were sampled however the number of samples is too low for separate data processing hence the collected samples refer to the sampling locations for drinking water abstraction that penetrate the upper and lower parts of the aquifer although some wells penetrate only the lower parts the water samples were taken from the abstraction wells during their continuous production from built in taps the submerged pump was installed in piezometer screens 10 and 40 m below the water table to obtain other water samples the samples were taken after five times the volume of the borehole was pumped out and the ph t and sec had stabilized while pumping parallelly the redox conditions were measured redox potential and dissolved oxygen do2 a total of 320 water samples were collected all the samples were stored in 1 l brown glass bottles without any treatment the bottles were pre cleaned with a bt free detergent and deionized water and baked in a drying oven at 300 c the samples were immediately transported to the accredited laboratory of the public water supply company vodovod kanalizacija slovenia where they were extracted within 24 h of the sampling the concentrations were quantified and semi quantified for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively with the gc ms technique the gc ms qualitative analyses of water samples were also performed three times to monitor the relationship between bttps and their parent compounds 2 3 chemical analysis 2 3 1 chemicals all the chemicals were purchased with the highest available purity as described in the supplementary material 2 3 2 gc ms quantitative analyses of water samples 1 15 l of the water sample the standard calibration solution and the control sample were extracted using the solid phase extraction spe cartridges at a sample flow rate of 3 5 ml min 1 the cartridges were washed alternately with 10 ml of acetone 10 ml of methanol and 10 ml of spring water they were dried by anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for no longer than 3 days the cartridges were eluted with 10 ml of dichloromethane dcm the dcm extract was concentrated to 1 ml and 100 μl of it was taken for the first gc ms run for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt analysis the remaining dcm extract was evaporated to dryness by nitrogen for the second chromatographic run for analysis of pesticides and drugs the eluate was re dissolved in acetone containing 1 ml of the 400 μg l 1 hexachlorobenzene hcb solution it was used for analysis of pesticides and drugs the sample extracts were analyzed with the modified gc ms method described in auersperger et al 2005 the internal standard method was used for determination of the 2 mebt the internal standard 1 methyl 1h benzotriazole d4 was synthesized from the 1h benzotriazole d4 by methylation with iodomethane since there is no available source of the pure 2 4 dmebt the concentrations of 2 4 dmebt were reported relative to the response for 2 mebt based on the most abundant fragments m z 133 and m z 147 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively firstly 100 μl of the dcm extract was injected split less into the gc ms agilent gc6900 qp5890 usa with the gerstel autosampler germany and the injection liners with the silanized glass wool sge international pty ltd australia the db 5ms ultra inert column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm thickness was used with helium as a cerium gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the oven initially fast heated was programed from 50 c 1 min to 270 c with a total run time of 45 min the scan mode was used between m z 40 and 350 the injector and detector temperatures were set to 280 and 300 c respectively and a capillary voltage to 1 7 kv the same protocol was repeated for the second chromatographic run when 100 μl of the dcm hcb extract was injected fig s1a the data station operating software was turbomass perkin elmer waltham usa and the spectral library was nist 2008 regular spiked quality control samples processed on the same way they were analyzed with each chromatographic run including blanks of spring water used for the calibration field blanks were prepared according to the epa 525 2 method eicheelberger et al 1995 a calibration curve of the overall procedure was calculated by a linear regression within the calibration range determined on the filed samples fig s1b the recovery of 2 dmebt was more than 90 and the r coefficient of the calibration curve was better than 0 99 the response calculation factor was used for the extrapolation towards the lod and above the upper calibration limit the extrapolation accuracy was verified with the control samples the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were 1 0 and 3 3 ng l 1 respectively 2 3 3 gc ms qualitative analyses of water samples the qualitative gc ms analytical method is described in detail in trček et al 2018 2 4 data analysis statistical processing of the bttp data was performed with statistica 7 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa concentrations below the lod were replaced with one half of the method s detection limit parajulee et al 2017 the correlations between the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt concentrations in sampled waters were tested using a pearson correlation analysis the data were transformed into natural logarithmic ln values as has been the practice with bt data processing wang et al 2016 a value of p 0 05 was considered significant the scan data from the gc ms qualitative analyses were used to define the proportion between bts and bttps as well as the relationship between bts the calculations were carried out by the area ratios between the investigated compounds and the internal standard a ais to take into account the injection error tukey s boxplots were applied for the graphical data analysis helsel and hirsch 2002 the whiskers extend only to the last observation within one step beyond either end of the box a step equals 1 5 times the interquartile range observations between one and two steps from the box in either direction are plotted individually as outside values occurring fewer than once in 100 times for data from a normal distribution and as far out values occurring fewer than once in 300 000 times for a normal distribution in the case when they are farther than two steps beyond the box land use classification was based on the data of corine land cover 18 5 1 copernicus url https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc 2012 the spatial distribution of the bttps was performed using qgis 2 18 16 qgis development team url https qgis org en site 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of the bttps in urban water the measured concentrations of bttps in the surface water perched water and groundwater are summarirized in table 1 together with data on do2 the proportions between bts and bttps and the relationship between bts the bttps prevailed in water samples abstracted from 61 locations the bts dominated only in groundwater abstracted from lj 4 lj 32 lj 36 and one well in the pumping station lj 49 fig 1 table 1 these specific conditions could be related with the flow traps unfavorable for transformation the latter three locations lie in the same flow path although the oxic redox conditions were measured in groundwater do2 is higher than 1 mg l 1 a reduction environment could prevail in the aquifer s unsaturated zone where the degradation processes are favorable morris et al 2003 this could be inferred from data of the nearby piezometers lj 4 and lj 6 the latter penetrates layers of the perched aquifer with reduction conditions otherwise the reduction environment tables 1 and 2 was recorded only in groundwater in the doorstep s area between the ljubljanica and sava river catchments lj 6 7 8 12 13 and 16 in fig 1 the lowest range of bttp concentrations was detected in the sava river median values of 2 6 and 3 1 ng l 1 were calculated for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively the highest median concentrations refer to water that is temporarily stored in perched aquifers with the ranges of 2 9 47 3 and 1 62 4 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively this indicates an important pollution medium by far the largest range of bttp concentrations was measured in groundwater lod 174 and lod 144 ng l 1 with median values of 2 0 and 4 8 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively some 25 of the groundwater samples refer to drinking water resources where the median values of 1 5 and 0 5 ng l 1 were calculated for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively the data set is graphically analysed in fig 2 a the outside and far out values result from the sampling location lj 34 fig 1 where the 2 4 dmebt concentrations were 2 5 10 times higher in comparison with the others ranging between 0 9 and 10 7 ng l 1 increased values are also observed in the sampling location lj 52 this highlights the urban pollution seeing that other sampling locations are settled at the beginning of the city considering the groundwater flow direction fig 1 and the prevailing tt parent compounds in the source of contamination consequently the range of the 2 mebt concentration originating from the bt parent compound is similar in all the pumping stations fig 2a the median sum concentration of the bttps in drinking water resources 2 0 ng l 1 is lower than the quality criterion for bts recommended in australia nrmmc et al 2006 and denmark beltoft et al 2013 however the value is slightly exceeded at the sampling location lj 34 7 4 ng l 1 with respect to the australian recommendations for bts chemical and isotopic investigations indicated that the part of the sava river recharge is between 20 and 90 at all the pumping stations for drinking water supply depending on the well position and the depths of the screens cerar and urbanc 2013 urbanc and jamnik 1998 the boxplots of the river samples are illustrated in fig 2b the sampling locations lj 57 and lj 48 are situated at the beginning and at the end of the city respectively close to the pumping stations considering the groundwater flow direction fig 1 the source of bts and bttps in the sava river with the mean yearly discharge of 85 1 m3 s 1 strojan 2011 at the beginning of the city is attributed to the outflow from the upstream wastewater treatment plants alotaibi et al 2015b huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011 2013 the range of both bttps in the sampling location lj 57 shows that the sava river could be the source of bttps in the drinking water resources lj 56 and lj 49 50 on the other hand the range of the discussed bttps in the sampling location lj 48 indicates that the river could contribute the bttps to the drinking water resource lj 52 whereas its contribution to the drinking water resource lj 34 should be negligible in comparison to other pollution sources the vertical profile of the bttp concentrations in the aquifer is presented in fig 2c the outside and far out values of the bttps are characteristic for the sampling locations including the groundwater of the aquifer s upper parts which is attributed to different pollution sources and pathways the sava river has the lowest ranges and medians particularly for the 2 4 dmebt the highest bttp concentrations were measured in the aquifer upper parts 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt whereas the highest median values were calculated for the perched aquifers 12 2 and 8 5 for the two bttps respectively the lowest bttp concentration ranges and median values among the sampled groundwaters refer to the lower aquifer parts lod 4 4 ng l 1 and lod 8 6 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt with medinas of 1 5 and 2 1 ng l 1 respectively the comparison of the boxplots indicates the mixture of two types of water in the groundwater samples abstracted from the boreholes with screens in the aquifer s upper and lower parts the lower aquifer could be treated as unpolluted urban medium at least for now the presented information indicates the prevailing horizontal flow component in the aquifer s saturated zone and only the occasional vertical solute transport during significant precipitation events which was evidenced also with previous investigations trček et al 2018 the perched aquifers are highlighted as an important medium for bts transformation with the highest median values of bttps and ranges of the bttp proportions between 92 and 99 this confirms the well known fact that the contaminant degradation is the most significant in the aquifer s unsaturated zone morris et al 2003 the spatial distribution of the bttp concentrations in the groundwater was investigated to achieve a better insight into the mentioned processes the sampling locations referring to the aquifer s lower parts fig 1 were excluded seeing that they are not representative for the study site 3 2 spatial distribution of the bttps the study site was divided into 5 types of areas fig 3 7 residential r1 r7 2 commercial c1 c2 5 industrial i1 i5 4 agricultural a1 a4 areas and 4 green spaces g1 g4 in total 26 5 1 9 2 2 19 5 and 49 9 areas are residential commercial industrial agricultural and green spaces respectively the manufacturing of metal and non metal products and plastic prevails in i1 the food industry prevails in i2 i3 has been transformed mainly into the craft business the manufacturing of metal fabricated products machinery and equipment as well as the pharmaceutical industry which dominates in i4 whereas i5 could be characterized with the center for collecting transporting and recovering of useful waste and light industry the measured concentrations of bttps in the sampled groundwater are summarized in fig 3 and in table 2 together with data on do2 proportions between bts and bttps and the relationship between bts the highest values up to 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively were registered in industrial areas particularly in i2 i4 and i3 listed in descending concentrations in the western part of the study site that belongs to the unconfined ljubljana field aquifer fig 1 the range of bttp concentrations is significantly lower in i1 2 1 and 1 0 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively in the ljubljana moor aquifer that is protected by practically impermeable cover fig 1 the 2 4 dmebt concentrations prevailed over the 2 mebt in i2 and i4 which indicates the tt as a dominant bts in the source of contamination the two commercial areas are situated to the east of i2 and i4 in the direction of the groundwater flow fig 3 their bttp concentrations median values of 3 0 and 5 0 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively with a predominance of 2 4 dmebt over 2 mebt and sampling locations indicate the potential impact of i2 and i4 considering that the horizontal flow component prevails in the aquifer s saturated zone and dilution is the major process promoting the contaminant attenuation in this zone under unchangeable redox conditions this is discussed in the next subsection the 2 mebt median concentration ranges between 1 5 and 3 4 ng l 1 in the groundwater of the residential areas and those of the 2 4 dmebt between 0 8 and 10 8 ng l 1 fig 3 and table 2 the r3 values stand out not only with the highest concentrations of the bttps but also as the only residential area with higher 2 4 dmebt than 2 mebt concentrations in groundwater reflecting the tt as the dominant parent bts as with c1 and c2 the r3 is also situated in the direction of the groundwater flow from i2 and i4 which reflects their potential impact on the bttp concentrations lower ranges of the bttp concentrations are characteristic for residential areas of the ljubljana moor r1 and for areas with a significant contribution of the sava river recharge r4 and r7 the 2 mebt median concentration ranges between 0 5 and 2 8 ng l 1 in the groundwater of the green spaces whereas those for the 2 4 dmebt are between 1 0 and 4 0 ng l 1 fig 3 and table 2 it should be noted that the drinking water resource lj 52 is situated in g3 fig 1 fig 2a and b indicated the 2 4 dmebt as a tracer of the city urbanisation which should be reflected in other green spaces groundwater abstracted from a1 a2 and a3 is discussed in subsection 3 1 related to drinking water resources lj 56 lj 49 50 and lj 52 respectively fig 1 groundwater with the prevailing 2 4 dmebt concentrations was only abstracted from a3 median values of 1 7 and 5 0 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt fig 3 and table 2 according to the directions of the groundwater flow the a3 groundwater could be potentially impacted by the same pollution sources as r3 c1 and c2 which is discussed in the next subsection 3 3 relationship between the bttps in urban groundwater a strong linear correlation is determined between the natural logarithmic values of the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt nlv in groundwater samples from industrial areas r 0 82 fig s4a similar relationships were also observed between the natural logarithmic values of the bttp parent compounds in tap water from china and especially in surface waters from germany wang et al 2016 wolschke et al 2011 which indicates the representativeness of the investigated bttps their relationship highlights the similar pollution source as the one of the parent bts on the basis of the physical properties of the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt obtained with our previous investigations trček et al 2018 the transformation process between the two bttps is rejected in this regard the pollution source was attributed to the parent bts in effluents of the leaking industrial wastewater pipelines in the sampled areas which has already been reported as a problem of the western study site prestor et al 2014 vizintin et al 2009 that were transformed into bttps in the aquifer s unsaturated zone the solid grey line named the industrial line in fig 4 connects the median nlvs calculated for i1 i2 and i4 the median nlvs of the r1 and r5 groundwater follow the same line hence their bttps should also result from the transformed bts that were included in the leaking industrial effluents in r1 and r5 connected to i1 and i4 respectively fig 3 this is also evidenced by the results of the linear regression in fig s5a r 0 81 and s5b r 0 83 the same could be concluded for the drinking water resource lj 52 in g3 fig 4 according to the directions of the groundwater flow the majority of bttps most probably result from the bt input in i5 which was not included into the monitoring protocol fig 3 nevertheless an apparent linear correlation exists between the nlv data sets of groundwater sampled in g3 and the industrial areas r 0 76 fig s6 the slight deviation of the lj 52 point from the industrial line most probably reflects the dilution effect the strong liner correlation also occurs between the nlvs in samples of the sava river in g4 and of the drinking water resources lj 56 in a1 and lj 49 50 in a2 r 0 74 fig s4b the relationship indicates the similar pollution sources of bttps they are attributed to the parent bts included in effluents from leaking public wastewater pipelines in the area of sampling locations and in effluents from the wastewater treatment plants transported by the sava river that were transformed in the aquifer s unsaturated zone the dotted black line named the municipal line in fig 4 connects the median nlvs of the bttps of the discussed water the median nlvs of r2 r4 r6 and r7 follow the same line and reflects the same source of bttps as well as the values of the i3 groundwater and the sava river in g3 further information can be found in figs s7a and b the data demonstrate that the majority of their bttp concentrations result from the bts included in the municipal effluents the median nlvs of the r3 c1 g1 and g2 groundwaters and the drinking water resource lj 34 in a3 follow the black dashed line called the dilution line in fig 4 according to the directions of the groundwater flow fig 3 and the knowledge obtained from previous investigations prestor et al 2014 trček et al 2018 vizintin et al 2009 it was assumed that the source of bttps were the parent bts included in the leaking effluents of the industrial wastewater pipelines that were transformed in the aquifer s unsaturated zone in i2 and i4 this is evidenced by the strong linear correlations of the discussed data in fig s4c r 0 75 during transport the bttp concentrations were diluted which is reflected in the distribution of the median nlv along the dilution line in fig 4 this confirms the findings discussed in the subsection 3 1 and the results of our previous investigation trček et al 2018 indicating that the bts could be transformed into bttps in the aquifer but only if the leaking effluents are temporally stored in sediments of the unsaturated zone with a lower hydraulic conductivity the perched aquifers are present at different depths of i3 i4 and i2 and their vicinity as is illustrated in fig s7 they were sampled in the areas of r5 and r2 the concentrations of the bttps are increased particularly in the former area in the vicinity of i2 and i4 table 1 fig s9 the perched aquifers are not typical in the c2 area therefore the bttps had to be transported there however the median nlv does not follow the dilution line in fig 4 as it was expected according to the median nlvs of c1 and a3 fig 3 instead it follows the industrial line it is assumed that this value result from a significant recharge of the ljubljanica river with the mean yearly discharge of 55 6 m3 s 1 frantar 2008 that was unfortunately not included in the monitoring protocol south of c2 the ljubljanica river leaves the artificial canals fig 3 through which it flows through the city and receives undefined effluents including those related with energy producing facilities in the vicinity of the outflow the bts are used in the heat exchanger fluids as an anticorrosion additive their degradation studies indicated the need for spatial environmental conditions ilieva et al 2014 schmidt et al 2016 which is in accordance with the results of our previous investigations trček et al 2018 it is assumed that the caught river in the concrete canal becomes a medium that may stimulate the bt transformation processes the process may be encouraged by a the increased temperature due to the significant impacts of hot industrial effluents cheng et al 2006 puttanna et al 1999 trček et al 2018 particularly related with the transformation of the parent compound of 2 4 dmebt 4 mebt that was shown to degrade much slower than the other bts huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 or and b the reduction conditions in the unsaturated zone in the doorstep s area between the ljubljanica and sava river catchments the discussion in the subsection 3 1 this may explain a predominance of 2 4 dmebt over 2 mebt in the bttps originating from industrial effluents 4 conclusions the results of the bttp profiling in an urban aquifer are synthesized in fig 5 the main sources of bttps in the studied oxic urban groundwater were determined to be the bts and bttps included in the outflow of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and from energy producing facilities into surface streams that recharge the aquifer and in effluents from the leaking industrial and public wastewater pipelines our results confirm that the bttps could be transformed from parent compounds in the aquifer s unsaturated zone in the case when the effluents are temporally stored in sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity which is evidenced with the highest median values of bttp concentrations in samples abstracted from the perched aquifers and the bttp proportions ranging between 92 and 99 the bttps dominated over the parent bts also in groundwater the highest concentrations up to 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt with medians of 5 8 and 12 9 ng l 1 respectively were measured in groundwater abstracted from the upper parts of the oxic aquifer below the clay lances where the losses from the industrial wastewater pipelines were evidenced the 2 4 dmebt dominated over the 2 mebt in the bttps originating from industrial effluents assumable due to the increased temperature of industrial effluents and or reductive conditions in the unsaturated zone that may stimulate the transformation of the 4 mebt parent compound the proposed mechanism and transformation pathway should be subject to further investigations the median sum concentration of the bttps in drinking water resources 2 0 ng l 1 is lower than the recommended quality criterion for bts so far the results indicate the necessity for protecting drinking water resources stored in the lower aquifer parts seeing that a significant impact of the bttp transport from industrial areas is observed at one pumping station the bttps concentrations decrease the aquifer s saturated zone with the distance from the source locations due to the dilution process which depends on the hydrodynamic conditions residence time and the sorption characteristics of bttps the latter have not been discovered so far as well as the bttps toxic properties because of the abundance of bts in the environment and the apparent environmental relevance of the bttps a risk assessment of the bttps with respect to health and the environment is recommended

19362,benzotriazoles bts are regarded as contaminants of emerging concern however their transformation products bttps in aquifers remains poorly characterized the present study is the first detailed report on profiles of the bttps in an urban oxic intergranular aquifer related to water type land use and the aquifer s depth the 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole 2 mebt and 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt were quantified using the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analytical technique based on internal standards for the first time the relationship between the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt concentrations was studied in sampled water and discussed with respect to the different flow paths and sources of contamination three main sources of bttps were determined in urban groundwater bts and bttps included in the outflow of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and energy producing facilities into surface streams that recharge the aquifer and in the leaking effluents from industrial and public wastewater pipelines the results confirm that the bttps are transformed from parent compounds in the aquifer s unsaturated zone in the case when the effluents are temporally stored in sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity which is indicated with the highest median concentrations of bttps referring to the perched aquifers where the bttps proportions were 92 99 bttps dominated over the parent bts also in groundwater the highest concentrations of bttps up to 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt ng l 1 respectively were measured in groundwater abstracted from the upper parts of the aquifer in the area where the losses from industrial wastewater pipelines were evidenced the 2 4 dmebt dominated over the 2 mebt in the bttps originating from bts included in the industrial effluents which is the opposite to the case when their origin is in the municipal effluents the median sum concentration of the bttps in drinking water resources 2 0 ng l 1 is lower than the quality criterion recommended for bts so far nevertheless the abundance of bts in the environment and the apparent environmental relevance of the bttps in urban groundwater indicate the need for a risk assessment of bttps with respect to health and the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords intergranular aquifer urban groundwater benzotriazoles transformation products profiles 1 introduction significant progress has been made in the science of urban hydrogeology over recent decades with respect to the protection of drinking groundwater resources from contamination this is closely linked to the classification and characterization of contaminants of emerging concern cecs that might be candidates for future regulation anderson et al 2012 benzotriazoles are regarded as cecs because they are widespread and persistent in the aquatic environment cantwell et al 2015 dummer 2014 giraudo et al 2017 richardson and ternes 2014 the 1h benzotriazole bt parent compound and its derivatives 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 mebt and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5 mebt that are used as a technical mixture called tolytriazole tt are the most widely employed benzotriazoles bts hart et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2010 as an effective corrosion inhibitor bts have a broad range of industrial domestic and commercial applications finšgar and milošev 2010 janna et al 2011 kadar et al 2010 kim et al 2011 vetter and lorenz 2013 they have recently been detected in tap water janna et al 2011 wang et al 2016 human urine asimakopoulos et al 2013 wang et al 2016 and in human adipose tissues wang et al 2015 so far australia has implemented drinking water guidelines for bts including a threshold level of 7 ng l 1 for tt nrmmc et al 2006 whereas the danish ministry of the environment beltoft et al 2013 has recommended a quality criterion of 20 μg l 1 for the bts the occurrence and concentration of bts in urban waters are known alotaibi et al 2015a cantwell et al 2015 careghini et al 2015 giger et al 2006 herrero et al 2014 kiss and fries 2009 2012 liu et al 2011 2013 despite this information about their fate in aquifers remains poorly characterized no proof of the bts transformation products bttps could be found in an anaerobic aquifer that was contaminated by de icing fluids from an abandoned airport breedveld et al 2003 the bttps were detected for the first time in an oxic intergranular aquifer situated under an industrial zone in ljubljana the capital of slovenia with the median sum concentration of the bttps ranging between 10 and 120 ng l 1 trček et al 2018 the constant input of a bt pollutant load from a sewer system was shown to result in environmentally relevant bttps formed via methylation and tautomerization under perched aquifer conditions the major transformation products were identified as 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole 2 mebt for the degradation of the bt and as 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt and 1 4 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole for the degradation of 4 mebt and most probably also 5 mebt afterwards the presence of bttps was examined in an aquatic environment in the city of maribor a distance of 120 km in the framework of micro organic contaminants monitoring cerar and mali 2016 koroša et al 2016 the results pointed to 2 4 dmebt as a typical indicator of urban pollution the median sum concentration of the bttps was determined to be 20 and 7 ng l 1 in groundwater and surface water respectively the mentioned findings prompted a detailed study of the occurrence and distribution of bttps in an urban intergranular aquifer in ljubljana that supplies approximately 300 000 city dwellers with water that is essential for their drinking and sanitation needs the research was based on the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analytical technique the concentrations were determined for two of the most abundant bttps i e 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt trček et al 2018 with the aim being to elucidate their origin and transport related to the water type i e groundwater drinking water surface water perched water land uses i e residential commercial industrial agricultural and green space and the aquifer s depth i e unsaturated zone upper and lower parts of the aquifer for the first time the relationship between the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt concentrations was analysed in sampled water and discussed with respect to the different flow paths and sources of contamination to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first detailed report on bttp profiles in urban groundwaters that improves our understanding of the fate of bts in an aquatic urban environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the municipality of ljubljana is located approximately 300 m above sea level in an alluvial basin filled by pleistocene and holocene fluvial and lacustrine deposits fig 1 fig s1 the basement of the depression is composed of very low permeable carboniferous and permian sediments that also form the basin s edges and isolated hills the ljubljana field in the north the ljubljana moor in the south and the dravlje valley in the west of the ljubljana basin are characterized by the sava ljubljanica and gradščica surface streams with an alpine karstic and dolomite catchment respectively fig 1 the ljubljanica river is a tributary of the sava river the fluvial sediments form an urban intergranular aquifer that is opened in the ne part of the study site al ša and t wq1 sediments in fig 1 the sediments composed mainly of carbonates and silicates uhan and krajnc 2003 are very heterogeneous the upper strata consist mostly of sands and gravels and the lower mostly of conglomerates bračič železnik et al 2005 fig s2 the impermeable or low permeable clay and sandy clay layers cover the aquifer in other parts of the study site šg a and p mq2 sediments in fig 1 in the vicinity of the šišenski hrib hill fig 1 lenses of these sediments locally divide the aquifer into the upper and lower parts and give rise to perched aquifer conditions janža and šram 2014 trček 2017 vizintin et al 2009 the study site occupies approximately 270 km2 including residential industrial and commercial areas that are surrounded by green spaces and agricultural land uses see fig 3 the majority of groundwater for the public water supply and industrial use is abstracted from the unconfined ljubljana field aquifer fig 1 it is remarkable with highly productive aquifer stores approximately 400 million m3 of groundwater and high velocities of groundwater that can exceed 20 m day 1 janža et al 2005 the unsaturated zone is 20 m deep on average whereas the aquifer thickness is up to 100 m the aquifer receives a natural recharge from precipitation and the sava river 2 2 and 2 3 m3 s 1 respectively janža 2015 vizintin et al 2009 as well as via a lateral inflow from the ljubljana moor aquifer in the south 0 3 m3 s 1 vizintin et al 2009 which is reflected in the groundwater flow directions fig 1 the ljubljanica river recharges the aquifer only in the south eastern part of the study site the city of ljubljana has a relatively well regulated sewage system that is 1134 km long the network includes 22 8 of foul sewers 24 7 of pluvial drainage systems 52 3 of combined systems and 0 2 of overflow channels prestor et al 2014 it is old and leaking in some places some 53 4 and 40 1 of the losses result from concrete pipes built before 1975 representing 34 of the total length and between 1975 and 1995 representing 39 of the total length respectively prestor et al 2014 the wastewater is discharged to a central treatment plant in the eastern part of the city fig 1 it contains 11 and 62 of the industrial and municipal effluents respectively jp vodovod kanalizacija url http www vo ka si

were selected according to the water type and land use samples were taken from piezometers or abstraction wells that penetrate layers of the perched aquifers 5 locations of the upper aquifer parts 41 locations of the lower aquifer parts 2 locations or both of them 17 locations the sava river was sampled from 2 piezometers at the riverbank filtration lj 48 and lj57 in fig 1 in total 24 7 14 12 and 8 sampling locations are situated in residential commercial industrial and agricultural areas and in green spaces respectively further information are found in fig 3 and table 1 and table 2 fifty eight sampling locations represent groundwater of which 4 are drinking water resources the sampling locations for the drinking water supply include 2 5 wells close to each other all the wells were sampled however the number of samples is too low for separate data processing hence the collected samples refer to the sampling locations for drinking water abstraction that penetrate the upper and lower parts of the aquifer although some wells penetrate only the lower parts the water samples were taken from the abstraction wells during their continuous production from built in taps the submerged pump was installed in piezometer screens 10 and 40 m below the water table to obtain other water samples the samples were taken after five times the volume of the borehole was pumped out and the ph t and sec had stabilized while pumping parallelly the redox conditions were measured redox potential and dissolved oxygen do2 a total of 320 water samples were collected all the samples were stored in 1 l brown glass bottles without any treatment the bottles were pre cleaned with a bt free detergent and deionized water and baked in a drying oven at 300 c the samples were immediately transported to the accredited laboratory of the public water supply company vodovod kanalizacija slovenia where they were extracted within 24 h of the sampling the concentrations were quantified and semi quantified for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively with the gc ms technique the gc ms qualitative analyses of water samples were also performed three times to monitor the relationship between bttps and their parent compounds 2 3 chemical analysis 2 3 1 chemicals all the chemicals were purchased with the highest available purity as described in the supplementary material 2 3 2 gc ms quantitative analyses of water samples 1 15 l of the water sample the standard calibration solution and the control sample were extracted using the solid phase extraction spe cartridges at a sample flow rate of 3 5 ml min 1 the cartridges were washed alternately with 10 ml of acetone 10 ml of methanol and 10 ml of spring water they were dried by anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for no longer than 3 days the cartridges were eluted with 10 ml of dichloromethane dcm the dcm extract was concentrated to 1 ml and 100 μl of it was taken for the first gc ms run for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt analysis the remaining dcm extract was evaporated to dryness by nitrogen for the second chromatographic run for analysis of pesticides and drugs the eluate was re dissolved in acetone containing 1 ml of the 400 μg l 1 hexachlorobenzene hcb solution it was used for analysis of pesticides and drugs the sample extracts were analyzed with the modified gc ms method described in auersperger et al 2005 the internal standard method was used for determination of the 2 mebt the internal standard 1 methyl 1h benzotriazole d4 was synthesized from the 1h benzotriazole d4 by methylation with iodomethane since there is no available source of the pure 2 4 dmebt the concentrations of 2 4 dmebt were reported relative to the response for 2 mebt based on the most abundant fragments m z 133 and m z 147 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively firstly 100 μl of the dcm extract was injected split less into the gc ms agilent gc6900 qp5890 usa with the gerstel autosampler germany and the injection liners with the silanized glass wool sge international pty ltd australia the db 5ms ultra inert column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm thickness was used with helium as a cerium gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the oven initially fast heated was programed from 50 c 1 min to 270 c with a total run time of 45 min the scan mode was used between m z 40 and 350 the injector and detector temperatures were set to 280 and 300 c respectively and a capillary voltage to 1 7 kv the same protocol was repeated for the second chromatographic run when 100 μl of the dcm hcb extract was injected fig s1a the data station operating software was turbomass perkin elmer waltham usa and the spectral library was nist 2008 regular spiked quality control samples processed on the same way they were analyzed with each chromatographic run including blanks of spring water used for the calibration field blanks were prepared according to the epa 525 2 method eicheelberger et al 1995 a calibration curve of the overall procedure was calculated by a linear regression within the calibration range determined on the filed samples fig s1b the recovery of 2 dmebt was more than 90 and the r coefficient of the calibration curve was better than 0 99 the response calculation factor was used for the extrapolation towards the lod and above the upper calibration limit the extrapolation accuracy was verified with the control samples the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were 1 0 and 3 3 ng l 1 respectively 2 3 3 gc ms qualitative analyses of water samples the qualitative gc ms analytical method is described in detail in trček et al 2018 2 4 data analysis statistical processing of the bttp data was performed with statistica 7 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa concentrations below the lod were replaced with one half of the method s detection limit parajulee et al 2017 the correlations between the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt concentrations in sampled waters were tested using a pearson correlation analysis the data were transformed into natural logarithmic ln values as has been the practice with bt data processing wang et al 2016 a value of p 0 05 was considered significant the scan data from the gc ms qualitative analyses were used to define the proportion between bts and bttps as well as the relationship between bts the calculations were carried out by the area ratios between the investigated compounds and the internal standard a ais to take into account the injection error tukey s boxplots were applied for the graphical data analysis helsel and hirsch 2002 the whiskers extend only to the last observation within one step beyond either end of the box a step equals 1 5 times the interquartile range observations between one and two steps from the box in either direction are plotted individually as outside values occurring fewer than once in 100 times for data from a normal distribution and as far out values occurring fewer than once in 300 000 times for a normal distribution in the case when they are farther than two steps beyond the box land use classification was based on the data of corine land cover 18 5 1 copernicus url https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc 2012 the spatial distribution of the bttps was performed using qgis 2 18 16 qgis development team url https qgis org en site 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of the bttps in urban water the measured concentrations of bttps in the surface water perched water and groundwater are summarirized in table 1 together with data on do2 the proportions between bts and bttps and the relationship between bts the bttps prevailed in water samples abstracted from 61 locations the bts dominated only in groundwater abstracted from lj 4 lj 32 lj 36 and one well in the pumping station lj 49 fig 1 table 1 these specific conditions could be related with the flow traps unfavorable for transformation the latter three locations lie in the same flow path although the oxic redox conditions were measured in groundwater do2 is higher than 1 mg l 1 a reduction environment could prevail in the aquifer s unsaturated zone where the degradation processes are favorable morris et al 2003 this could be inferred from data of the nearby piezometers lj 4 and lj 6 the latter penetrates layers of the perched aquifer with reduction conditions otherwise the reduction environment tables 1 and 2 was recorded only in groundwater in the doorstep s area between the ljubljanica and sava river catchments lj 6 7 8 12 13 and 16 in fig 1 the lowest range of bttp concentrations was detected in the sava river median values of 2 6 and 3 1 ng l 1 were calculated for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively the highest median concentrations refer to water that is temporarily stored in perched aquifers with the ranges of 2 9 47 3 and 1 62 4 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively this indicates an important pollution medium by far the largest range of bttp concentrations was measured in groundwater lod 174 and lod 144 ng l 1 with median values of 2 0 and 4 8 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively some 25 of the groundwater samples refer to drinking water resources where the median values of 1 5 and 0 5 ng l 1 were calculated for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively the data set is graphically analysed in fig 2 a the outside and far out values result from the sampling location lj 34 fig 1 where the 2 4 dmebt concentrations were 2 5 10 times higher in comparison with the others ranging between 0 9 and 10 7 ng l 1 increased values are also observed in the sampling location lj 52 this highlights the urban pollution seeing that other sampling locations are settled at the beginning of the city considering the groundwater flow direction fig 1 and the prevailing tt parent compounds in the source of contamination consequently the range of the 2 mebt concentration originating from the bt parent compound is similar in all the pumping stations fig 2a the median sum concentration of the bttps in drinking water resources 2 0 ng l 1 is lower than the quality criterion for bts recommended in australia nrmmc et al 2006 and denmark beltoft et al 2013 however the value is slightly exceeded at the sampling location lj 34 7 4 ng l 1 with respect to the australian recommendations for bts chemical and isotopic investigations indicated that the part of the sava river recharge is between 20 and 90 at all the pumping stations for drinking water supply depending on the well position and the depths of the screens cerar and urbanc 2013 urbanc and jamnik 1998 the boxplots of the river samples are illustrated in fig 2b the sampling locations lj 57 and lj 48 are situated at the beginning and at the end of the city respectively close to the pumping stations considering the groundwater flow direction fig 1 the source of bts and bttps in the sava river with the mean yearly discharge of 85 1 m3 s 1 strojan 2011 at the beginning of the city is attributed to the outflow from the upstream wastewater treatment plants alotaibi et al 2015b huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011 2013 the range of both bttps in the sampling location lj 57 shows that the sava river could be the source of bttps in the drinking water resources lj 56 and lj 49 50 on the other hand the range of the discussed bttps in the sampling location lj 48 indicates that the river could contribute the bttps to the drinking water resource lj 52 whereas its contribution to the drinking water resource lj 34 should be negligible in comparison to other pollution sources the vertical profile of the bttp concentrations in the aquifer is presented in fig 2c the outside and far out values of the bttps are characteristic for the sampling locations including the groundwater of the aquifer s upper parts which is attributed to different pollution sources and pathways the sava river has the lowest ranges and medians particularly for the 2 4 dmebt the highest bttp concentrations were measured in the aquifer upper parts 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt whereas the highest median values were calculated for the perched aquifers 12 2 and 8 5 for the two bttps respectively the lowest bttp concentration ranges and median values among the sampled groundwaters refer to the lower aquifer parts lod 4 4 ng l 1 and lod 8 6 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt with medinas of 1 5 and 2 1 ng l 1 respectively the comparison of the boxplots indicates the mixture of two types of water in the groundwater samples abstracted from the boreholes with screens in the aquifer s upper and lower parts the lower aquifer could be treated as unpolluted urban medium at least for now the presented information indicates the prevailing horizontal flow component in the aquifer s saturated zone and only the occasional vertical solute transport during significant precipitation events which was evidenced also with previous investigations trček et al 2018 the perched aquifers are highlighted as an important medium for bts transformation with the highest median values of bttps and ranges of the bttp proportions between 92 and 99 this confirms the well known fact that the contaminant degradation is the most significant in the aquifer s unsaturated zone morris et al 2003 the spatial distribution of the bttp concentrations in the groundwater was investigated to achieve a better insight into the mentioned processes the sampling locations referring to the aquifer s lower parts fig 1 were excluded seeing that they are not representative for the study site 3 2 spatial distribution of the bttps the study site was divided into 5 types of areas fig 3 7 residential r1 r7 2 commercial c1 c2 5 industrial i1 i5 4 agricultural a1 a4 areas and 4 green spaces g1 g4 in total 26 5 1 9 2 2 19 5 and 49 9 areas are residential commercial industrial agricultural and green spaces respectively the manufacturing of metal and non metal products and plastic prevails in i1 the food industry prevails in i2 i3 has been transformed mainly into the craft business the manufacturing of metal fabricated products machinery and equipment as well as the pharmaceutical industry which dominates in i4 whereas i5 could be characterized with the center for collecting transporting and recovering of useful waste and light industry the measured concentrations of bttps in the sampled groundwater are summarized in fig 3 and in table 2 together with data on do2 proportions between bts and bttps and the relationship between bts the highest values up to 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively were registered in industrial areas particularly in i2 i4 and i3 listed in descending concentrations in the western part of the study site that belongs to the unconfined ljubljana field aquifer fig 1 the range of bttp concentrations is significantly lower in i1 2 1 and 1 0 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively in the ljubljana moor aquifer that is protected by practically impermeable cover fig 1 the 2 4 dmebt concentrations prevailed over the 2 mebt in i2 and i4 which indicates the tt as a dominant bts in the source of contamination the two commercial areas are situated to the east of i2 and i4 in the direction of the groundwater flow fig 3 their bttp concentrations median values of 3 0 and 5 0 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively with a predominance of 2 4 dmebt over 2 mebt and sampling locations indicate the potential impact of i2 and i4 considering that the horizontal flow component prevails in the aquifer s saturated zone and dilution is the major process promoting the contaminant attenuation in this zone under unchangeable redox conditions this is discussed in the next subsection the 2 mebt median concentration ranges between 1 5 and 3 4 ng l 1 in the groundwater of the residential areas and those of the 2 4 dmebt between 0 8 and 10 8 ng l 1 fig 3 and table 2 the r3 values stand out not only with the highest concentrations of the bttps but also as the only residential area with higher 2 4 dmebt than 2 mebt concentrations in groundwater reflecting the tt as the dominant parent bts as with c1 and c2 the r3 is also situated in the direction of the groundwater flow from i2 and i4 which reflects their potential impact on the bttp concentrations lower ranges of the bttp concentrations are characteristic for residential areas of the ljubljana moor r1 and for areas with a significant contribution of the sava river recharge r4 and r7 the 2 mebt median concentration ranges between 0 5 and 2 8 ng l 1 in the groundwater of the green spaces whereas those for the 2 4 dmebt are between 1 0 and 4 0 ng l 1 fig 3 and table 2 it should be noted that the drinking water resource lj 52 is situated in g3 fig 1 fig 2a and b indicated the 2 4 dmebt as a tracer of the city urbanisation which should be reflected in other green spaces groundwater abstracted from a1 a2 and a3 is discussed in subsection 3 1 related to drinking water resources lj 56 lj 49 50 and lj 52 respectively fig 1 groundwater with the prevailing 2 4 dmebt concentrations was only abstracted from a3 median values of 1 7 and 5 0 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt fig 3 and table 2 according to the directions of the groundwater flow the a3 groundwater could be potentially impacted by the same pollution sources as r3 c1 and c2 which is discussed in the next subsection 3 3 relationship between the bttps in urban groundwater a strong linear correlation is determined between the natural logarithmic values of the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt nlv in groundwater samples from industrial areas r 0 82 fig s4a similar relationships were also observed between the natural logarithmic values of the bttp parent compounds in tap water from china and especially in surface waters from germany wang et al 2016 wolschke et al 2011 which indicates the representativeness of the investigated bttps their relationship highlights the similar pollution source as the one of the parent bts on the basis of the physical properties of the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt obtained with our previous investigations trček et al 2018 the transformation process between the two bttps is rejected in this regard the pollution source was attributed to the parent bts in effluents of the leaking industrial wastewater pipelines in the sampled areas which has already been reported as a problem of the western study site prestor et al 2014 vizintin et al 2009 that were transformed into bttps in the aquifer s unsaturated zone the solid grey line named the industrial line in fig 4 connects the median nlvs calculated for i1 i2 and i4 the median nlvs of the r1 and r5 groundwater follow the same line hence their bttps should also result from the transformed bts that were included in the leaking industrial effluents in r1 and r5 connected to i1 and i4 respectively fig 3 this is also evidenced by the results of the linear regression in fig s5a r 0 81 and s5b r 0 83 the same could be concluded for the drinking water resource lj 52 in g3 fig 4 according to the directions of the groundwater flow the majority of bttps most probably result from the bt input in i5 which was not included into the monitoring protocol fig 3 nevertheless an apparent linear correlation exists between the nlv data sets of groundwater sampled in g3 and the industrial areas r 0 76 fig s6 the slight deviation of the lj 52 point from the industrial line most probably reflects the dilution effect the strong liner correlation also occurs between the nlvs in samples of the sava river in g4 and of the drinking water resources lj 56 in a1 and lj 49 50 in a2 r 0 74 fig s4b the relationship indicates the similar pollution sources of bttps they are attributed to the parent bts included in effluents from leaking public wastewater pipelines in the area of sampling locations and in effluents from the wastewater treatment plants transported by the sava river that were transformed in the aquifer s unsaturated zone the dotted black line named the municipal line in fig 4 connects the median nlvs of the bttps of the discussed water the median nlvs of r2 r4 r6 and r7 follow the same line and reflects the same source of bttps as well as the values of the i3 groundwater and the sava river in g3 further information can be found in figs s7a and b the data demonstrate that the majority of their bttp concentrations result from the bts included in the municipal effluents the median nlvs of the r3 c1 g1 and g2 groundwaters and the drinking water resource lj 34 in a3 follow the black dashed line called the dilution line in fig 4 according to the directions of the groundwater flow fig 3 and the knowledge obtained from previous investigations prestor et al 2014 trček et al 2018 vizintin et al 2009 it was assumed that the source of bttps were the parent bts included in the leaking effluents of the industrial wastewater pipelines that were transformed in the aquifer s unsaturated zone in i2 and i4 this is evidenced by the strong linear correlations of the discussed data in fig s4c r 0 75 during transport the bttp concentrations were diluted which is reflected in the distribution of the median nlv along the dilution line in fig 4 this confirms the findings discussed in the subsection 3 1 and the results of our previous investigation trček et al 2018 indicating that the bts could be transformed into bttps in the aquifer but only if the leaking effluents are temporally stored in sediments of the unsaturated zone with a lower hydraulic conductivity the perched aquifers are present at different depths of i3 i4 and i2 and their vicinity as is illustrated in fig s7 they were sampled in the areas of r5 and r2 the concentrations of the bttps are increased particularly in the former area in the vicinity of i2 and i4 table 1 fig s9 the perched aquifers are not typical in the c2 area therefore the bttps had to be transported there however the median nlv does not follow the dilution line in fig 4 as it was expected according to the median nlvs of c1 and a3 fig 3 instead it follows the industrial line it is assumed that this value result from a significant recharge of the ljubljanica river with the mean yearly discharge of 55 6 m3 s 1 frantar 2008 that was unfortunately not included in the monitoring protocol south of c2 the ljubljanica river leaves the artificial canals fig 3 through which it flows through the city and receives undefined effluents including those related with energy producing facilities in the vicinity of the outflow the bts are used in the heat exchanger fluids as an anticorrosion additive their degradation studies indicated the need for spatial environmental conditions ilieva et al 2014 schmidt et al 2016 which is in accordance with the results of our previous investigations trček et al 2018 it is assumed that the caught river in the concrete canal becomes a medium that may stimulate the bt transformation processes the process may be encouraged by a the increased temperature due to the significant impacts of hot industrial effluents cheng et al 2006 puttanna et al 1999 trček et al 2018 particularly related with the transformation of the parent compound of 2 4 dmebt 4 mebt that was shown to degrade much slower than the other bts huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 or and b the reduction conditions in the unsaturated zone in the doorstep s area between the ljubljanica and sava river catchments the discussion in the subsection 3 1 this may explain a predominance of 2 4 dmebt over 2 mebt in the bttps originating from industrial effluents 4 conclusions the results of the bttp profiling in an urban aquifer are synthesized in fig 5 the main sources of bttps in the studied oxic urban groundwater were determined to be the bts and bttps included in the outflow of effluents from wastewater treatment plants and from energy producing facilities into surface streams that recharge the aquifer and in effluents from the leaking industrial and public wastewater pipelines our results confirm that the bttps could be transformed from parent compounds in the aquifer s unsaturated zone in the case when the effluents are temporally stored in sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity which is evidenced with the highest median values of bttp concentrations in samples abstracted from the perched aquifers and the bttp proportions ranging between 92 and 99 the bttps dominated over the parent bts also in groundwater the highest concentrations up to 174 and 144 ng l 1 for the 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt with medians of 5 8 and 12 9 ng l 1 respectively were measured in groundwater abstracted from the upper parts of the oxic aquifer below the clay lances where the losses from the industrial wastewater pipelines were evidenced the 2 4 dmebt dominated over the 2 mebt in the bttps originating from industrial effluents assumable due to the increased temperature of industrial effluents and or reductive conditions in the unsaturated zone that may stimulate the transformation of the 4 mebt parent compound the proposed mechanism and transformation pathway should be subject to further investigations the median sum concentration of the bttps in drinking water resources 2 0 ng l 1 is lower than the recommended quality criterion for bts so far the results indicate the necessity for protecting drinking water resources stored in the lower aquifer parts seeing that a significant impact of the bttp transport from industrial areas is observed at one pumping station the bttps concentrations decrease the aquifer s saturated zone with the distance from the source locations due to the dilution process which depends on the hydrodynamic conditions residence time and the sorption characteristics of bttps the latter have not been discovered so far as well as the bttps toxic properties because of the abundance of bts in the environment and the apparent environmental relevance of the bttps a risk assessment of the bttps with respect to health and the environment is recommended

for optimization of the photo catalyst pastrana martínez et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively degrade a wide variety of pollutants o shea and dionysiou 2012 the production of reactive species primarily ho radicals with smaller amounts of oxidants such as h2o2 o2 is central to the effectiveness of aops these reactive species lead to oxidative transformation and mineralization of the target pollutants aops have shown tremendous promise for degradation of a wide variety of organic pollutants during water purification andreozzi et al 1999 klavarioti et al 2009 oller et al 2011 ultrasonic irradiation is a unique aops as it generates hydroxyl radicals directly from water molecules and thus does not require addition of catalyst or oxidant common to the majority of aops hoffmann et al 1996 mason and tiehm 2001 ultrasonic irradiation can penetrate and be used to treat turbid and highly colored solutions while the application of photochemical aops such as uv peroxide is limited to relatively clear solutions which allow penetration of photons deep into the solution as ultrasonic waves pass through a solution gas bubbles undergo local expansion and compression cycles colussi et al 1998 suslick et al 1999 the size of the bubble increases with the number of expansion compression cycles leading to a pressure differential and eventually the bubbles collapse a process referred to as cavitation wu et al 2013 at collapse three zones have been defined the region at the center of the cavitation site referred to as the hot spot the gas liquid

the pyrolysis of water vapor and produces hydroxyl radicals ho as well as other oxidative species the gas liquid interface has high temperatures above 2000 k and high pressures above 200 atm leading to pyrolysis and generation of hydroxyl radicals and other oxidative species the bulk solution possesses relatively mild conditions close to ambient temperature and pressure where target compounds are

previously seymour et al 1997 schematic representation included in supplementary materials the aqueous solution containing the target compound was added into the reaction vessel saturated by gentle bubbling with o2 for 15 min samples were taken at specific treatment intervals and analyzed immediately or stored in the refrigerator until analyses a varian pro star 210 hplc with a diode array

a 1000 mg l stock solution was prepared using volumetric flasks and stored in the refrigerator different concentration solutions were obtained from the dilution of stock solution employing adjustable pipettes and volumetric flasks the dph degradation was monitored over a range of initial dph concentrations of 2 8 5 2 14 0 27 0 62 0 and 160 0 μmol l 1 the sampling times were adjusted according to the extent of degradation at different initial concentrations for dph 0 2 8 and 5 2 μmol l 1 samples were taken at 0 1 2 3 4 6 and 8 min of the treatment dph 0 14 0 and 27 0 μmol l 1 samples were taken at 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min for the 62 0 μmol l 1 samples were taken at 0 4 8 12 and 16 min while for dph 0 160 0 μmol l 1 samples were analyzed at 0 5 10 20 and 30 min samples for the product studies using lc ms were taken at 0 and 30 min for the 14 0 μmol l 1 dph solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics the ultrasonically induced degradation of dph was effective over a range of initial concentrations from 2 8 to 160 0 μmol l 1 under o2 saturation at 5 c the degradations of dph as a function of treatment time at different initial concentrations are illustrated in s fig 1 the extent of degradation decreases with increasing initial concentration the treatment time required to degrade 50 of the initial concentration varied from 3 9 to 33 3 min for the initial dph concentrations of 2 8 160 0 μmol l 1 respectively previous studies have established that the ultrasonic mediated degradation of a variety of organic compounds follows pseudo first kinetics at a given initial concentration cui et al 2017 hua et al 1995 kim et al 2012 song et al 2009 taylor et al 2014 pseudo first order kinetics are represented by the mathematical equation ln c t c 0 k t k min 1 where ct and c0 μmol l 1 are the concentration at treatment time t and the initial concentration respectively the pseudo first order kinetic plot fig 1 of the degradation of dph yields rate constants of 0 21 0 13 0 082 0 050 0 035 and 0 023 min 1 corresponding to the initial concentrations of 2 8 5 2 14 0 27 0 61 0 and 160 0 μmol l 1 respectively the observed rate constants decreased by approximately 10 fold as the initial concentration increased by about 80 times the rate constant does not change significantly with initial concentration for a true first order type reaction process however variations in the reaction rate constant as a function of initial concentration have been previously reported for heterogeneous processes güyer and ince 2011 jiang et al 2002a this anomaly has been rationalized based on mass transfer limitations and saturation effects for heterogeneous processes occurring at or near the gas liquid interface jiang et al 2002b 3 2 heterogeneous kinetic modeling the ultrasonically mediated degradation of pollutants in aqueous media involves two primary processes direct pyrolysis of target compounds and degradation mediated by the reactive species generated during cavitation the extent of these degradation pathways is dependent on the partitioning of the target compounds to the gas gas liquid interface and bulk liquid regions hoffmann et al 1996 mason and tiehm 2001 dph has relatively low vapor pressure and is not expected to partition to the hot spot gas region during cavitation the gas liquid interface however also possesses high temperatures 2000 k and high pressures 300 atm during cavitational collapse above the supercritical points 680 k and 218 atm for water and thus it exists in a supercritical state hua et al 1995 shao and chen 2015 suslick et al 1990 water in the supercritical state exhibits hydrophobic rather than the hydrophilic solvation properties associated with water under ambient conditions in general ultrasonic mediated degradation is initiated by reactive oxygen species generated at the hot spot and g l interfacial regions alternatively neutral hydrophobic species can partition to the g l interface where direct pyrolysis can occur because of the high temperatures produced during cavitation since the degradation reactions will primarily occur at or near the liquid gas interface the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetic model for heterogeneous reactions was employed eq 1 to the degradation process okitsu et al 2005 xiao et al 2014 for the purposes of kinetic modeling we define the liquid gas interface as the reaction surface where dph can partition to and from the l h model assumes 1 all sites on the surface interface are equivalent 2 each site is occupied by one molecule and forms a monolayer uniform partitioning 3 the molecules have no interactions with the ones on the adjacent sites 4 the adsorption and desorption process is in an equilibrium 1 1 r 0 1 k r k l h c 0 where r0 μmol l 1 min 1 is the initial rate c0 μmol l 1 is the initial dph concentration kr l min μmol 1 is the reactivity coefficient and kl h μmol l 1 is the equilibrium constant the initial rates of degradation were monitored over the initial 20 of the degradation of dph to minimize competition from the degradation products the observed degradation rates as a function of initial concentrations c0 were used to construct the l h plot 1 r0 min l μmol as a function of 1 c0 l μmol which yields a linear relationship as shown in fig 2 a the intercept equals 1 kr and the slope is 1 krkl h the l h plot yields a reactivity constant kr 1 96 μmol min 1 l 1 and the partitioning constant kl h was 0 06 μmol l 1 the reactivity constant and partitioning constant are empirical values to describe the apparent reactivity and the partitioning factors according to the l h model 3 3 hydroxyl radical competition study hydroxyl radicals produced during cavitation are critical to the effective degradation of organic compounds during ultrasonic treatment to assess the role of ho in the degradation of dph coumarin cou a hydroxyl radical trap was added to the solution during the ultrasonic treatment of dph the rates of ultrasonic induced degradation of coumarin were monitored under different initial concentrations 25 40 50 60 80 and 100 μmol l the observed degradation rates as a function of initial concentrations were modeled using the langmuir hinshelwood model described earlier the l h plot of the observed degradation of coumarin illustrated in fig 2 b yields a linear relationship indicating the degradation occurs at or near the reaction surface gas liquid interface the slope and intercept of the l h plot yield the following apparent kinetic parameters reactivity constant kr 3 71 μmol min 1 l 1 and a partitioning constant kl h 0 26 μmol l 1 by comparison the l h kinetic parameters of cou were significantly higher than those observed for dph under the same conditions the ultrasonically induced degradation of dph and cou fit to the l h model however the better fit of dph to the l h indicates cou may not follow the specific l h model assumptions as well dph and cou process hydrocarbon functionality and thus both can partition to the hydrophobic g l interface cou will be uncharged under the experimental conditions while dph possesses an aliphatic amine with pka 8 98 and thus exists in protonated positive form at neutral solution ph topp et al 2012 since dph is positively charged it is not expected to partition to the hydrophobic g l interface like neutral cou cou is neutral and thus more likely to partition to the g l interface than the positively charged dph in addition cou is more volatile than dph and more likely to partitioning to hot spot region higher partitioning of cou to the g l and hot spot regions is consistent with a larger observed kl h compared to the less volatile charged dph cou thus should exhibit greater partitioning to the hot spot and g l interfacial regions have greater l h reactivity and degrade faster than dph based on these results cou will be effective as a probe for the ho mediated dph degradation pathways a kinetic competition study between dph and cou was conducted the degradation of 0 1 mmol l 1 dph was monitored in absence and presence of an equimolar amount of cou as illustrated in fig 3 the degradation rate of 0 1 mmol l 1 dph in the absence of cou was 2 82 μmol l 1 min 1 in the presence of an equimolar amount of cou the observe dph degradation rate dropped 57 8 to 1 19 μmol l 1 min 1 the observed rates of reaction of hydroxyl radical with cou and dph also depend on the bimolecular rate constants based on replicate experiments the reproducibility of the kinetic results is within 5 7 experimental error the bimolecular hydroxyl radical rate constants for ho cou is kcou ho 1 05 1010 m 1s 1 and ho dph is kdph ho 0 71 0 2 1010 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2012 newton and milligan 2006 sicard roselli et al 2014 based strictly on the relative magnitude of the rate constants at a 1 1 ratio of cou to dph in homogeneous solution cou would be 1 48 times more reactive and a 59 7 decrease of degradation rate is expected the observation of a 57 8 decrease corresponds to the theoretical value also indicates that the reaction between dph and hydroxyl radical dominates the degradation process the theoretical and experimental are in excellent agreement indicating the pyrolysis pathway is not affected by the ho scavenger 3 4 product study hydroxyl radical mediated processes are central to the effective degradation of pollutants by ultrasonic treatment hydroxyl radicals react with organic pollutants through three possible pathways hydroxyl radical addition hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer hydroxyl radical addition to electron rich aromatic systems is generally 10 100 times faster than hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer is uncommon except for exceedingly electron rich systems based on relative reaction rates for these competing pathways hydroxyl radical will react primarily with dph through addition and hydrogen abstraction pathways product studies were completed by lc ms after 90 of the starting material was degraded the retention time of dph is 6 554 min with an accurate mass charge ratio of 256 1623 corresponding to the molecular weight peak s f 2 although the lc ms raw data represents accurate mass of the protonated species m z m 1 values for the purpose of this manuscript we will refer the accurate mass as the molecular weight for the remainder of the paper the total ion chromatogram exhibits several well resolved peaks indicative of degradation products based on the observed accurate mass measurements and key fragmentations in the ms specific structures were assigned to the reaction products as described herein 3 4 1 hydroxyl radical addition products hydroxyl radical is a powerful electrophile and readily adds to aromatic rings hydroxyl radical addition to the aromatic ring with subsequent elimination of h is a common reaction pathway for aromatic compounds fig 4 the ho addition can occur at meta ortho and para positions louit et al 2005 among the observed products are three clearly resolved peaks with identical molecular weights m z of 272 1693 and retention times of 5 665 5 784 and 6 044 min corresponding to the mono hydroxylation products s f 3 all three mass spectra exhibited fragment peaks at m z 183 08 indicating hydroxylation of the benzene ring and are assigned to para meta and ortho phenolic adducts aravindakumar s group reported similar isomeric phenols for dph and hydroxyl radical generated by uv h2o2 menachery et al 2015 mono hydroxylation increases the electron rich character of the aromatic ring making the product more reactive to a second electrophilic ho addition reaction products with molecular weight mw 287 15 were also observed among the predominant products and correspond to di hydroxylation products of dph as shown in fig 4 addition of the second ho can occur at mono hydroxylated ring leading to a di hydroxylated benzene ring while reaction at the phenyl ring non hydroxylated will produce two mono hydroxylated benzene within one dph molecule as illustrated in fig 4 these products constitutional isomers have identical molecular weights three isomers were detected and reported in previous work menachery et al 2016 however for the dihydroxylation of single benzene ring in dph there are seven possible constitutional isomers six constitutional isomers are possible from the mono hydroxylated of the two benzene rings within dph given the identical molecular weights and a large number of possible isomers for di hydroxylated dph it is difficult to separate distinguish and assign the individual di hydroxylated isomers however four unique peaks with mw of 287 16 were observed in the product mixture corresponding to the di hydroxylated products the retention times of the resolved chromatographic peaks for the di hydroxylated products were 4 908 5 080 5 283 and 5 614 min s fig 4 given enhanced reactivity of the mono hydroxylated aromatic ring compared to non hydroxylated aromatic ring we expect dihydroxylation of single aromatic will dominant the reaction mixture while specific assignment of these isomers is difficult it is likely that additional dihydroxylation products are formed which are below the detection limit or overlapping with the observed peaks 3 4 2 hydrogen abstraction reaction products while hydroxyl radical addition to the aromatic rings leading to phenolic products appears to be the predominant reaction pathway hydroxyl abstract of the benzyl hydrogen is also possible a dph degradation product was observed with mw of 193 11 and a retention time at 4 823 min this product can be the result of a radical chain oxidation process at the highly reactive benzylic hydrogen s fig 5 the fragments at m z 105 04 and m z 121 03 are indicative of the ester group functionality the proposed product s fig 6 a product with mw 199 08 was observed and assigned as a dihydroxylation adduct of benzophenone a secondary degradation product of dph which could be produced by abstraction of the benzylic hydrogen such an adduct has been previously reported menachery et al 2016 3 4 3 pyrolysis products with the high temperatures at the hot spot and gas liquid interfacial regions produced during cavitation pyrolysis can also play a role in ultrasonically induced degradation processes given the low vapor pressure of dph and positive charge under the experimental conditions it is not expected to partition onto vapor phase hot spot but rather reside primarily in the g l interface and or bulk regions under the temperatures generated at the g l interface homolytic bond cleavage can occur within the dph molecule the weakest bonds within dph based on typical homolytic bond cleavage energies are the alkyl csp3 csp3 bonds and the csp3 nsp3 bonds compared to the csp2 csp2 and csp2 h bonds within the aromatic rings t w graham solomons 2001 a product with mw 241 15 was observed with a retention time of 6 428 min which corresponds to m 14 indicative of loss of a ch2 and assigned to the conversion of the n ch3 to n h shown in fig 5 mass spectrum is shown in s fig 7 the product with mw 182 07 is consistent with benzophenone containing characteristic fragments m z 105 041 and m 77 fig 6 among possible pathways the formation of benzophenone can also occur by hydroxyl mediated radical chain oxidation at the benzylic carbon cooper et al 2009 4 computational study of competing degradation pathways detailed computational studies were performed at the b3lyp 6 311g level of theory using the gaussian 09 program package to have a better understanding of the pyrolysis and hydroxyl radical mediated degradation pathways based on the product studies the computational experiments focus on the hydroxyl radical addition and hydrogen atom abstraction reaction pathways to determine the energetics and partitioning of the dph ho reaction pathways computational studies were also carried out to correlate the energies required for homolytic bond cleavages for individual bonds in dph to determine the partitioning of pyrolytic degradation pathways during ultrasonic treatment 4 1 hydroxyl radical addition to aromatic ring the addition of hydroxyl radical to aromatic systems commonly occurs at near diffusion controlled rates with bimolecular rates constants of 109 1010 m 1sec 1 the aromatic phenyl groups present in dph are highly susceptible to addition by hydroxyl radical dph has two identical mono alkyl substituted benzene rings with addition possible at the ipso ortho meta and para positions although hydroxylation at the ipso position is proposed for addition of water to the radical cation of dph menachery et al 2016 direct addition of hydroxyl radical at the ipso position is generally not competitive with the ortho meta and para reaction pathways hydroxyl radical addition leading to hydroxylation of the aromatic rings in dph has been reported menachery et al 2015 but isomers are difficult to distinguish by ms computational studies were conducted to identify the most probable sites on dph for ho radical addition to the aromatic rings in order to trace the reaction pathways between dph and ho three series of separate calculations simulating ho radical attack at ortho meta and para positions were performed fig 4 the initial reactants are dph ho the intermediates are ho adducts and the final products are obtained by the loss of the hydrogen atom from the attacked position in the radical ho adducts the results of calculations of the transition state energies ts for formation of the ho adducts are represented as the activation energy ea and the adduct formation energy δrh calculated as 11 0 13 0 10 3 kcal mol 1 for the o m and the p position the activation barriers for the ortho and para postion are slightly lower than that for the meta position which means that the ortho and para additions are modestly favored for ho addition the ortho and para position are electron rich compared to the meta position because of the electron donating effect directing of the alkyl subsitutent since ho is electrophilic the rate of reaction should be modestly faster at the more electron rich ortho and para postions consistent with the computation results the activation energies are similar for all three isomers indicating likely formation of all which is further supported by the lc ms results which indicate the presence of three isomeric forms of mono hydroxylated dph products during the degradation process 4 1 1 hydrogen abstraction reaction pathways hydroxyl radical mediated hydrogen abstractions can occur at a number of sites within the dph molecule the aromatic rings present in dph contain csp2 h bonds which are significantly stronger than the aliphatic csp3 h bonds given the csp2 h bonds are dramatically less reactivity towards hydrogen abstraction they were not taken into consideration abstraction of the different csp3 hs will lead to four different radical products the partitioning of these competing reaction pathways can be predicted based on the homolytic bond dissociation energies h elimination the relative reactivities calculated for csp3 h dph reaction sites are summarized in fig 8 the most reactivity site towards hydrogen abstraction is c h1 the benzylic hydrogen the benzylic properties and additional electron withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom alpha to the hydrogen weaken the c h1 bond which has a calculated bond dissociation energy of 75 4 kcal mol 1 the calculated bond strengths for the csp3 h2 bond α with o is 90 1 kcal mol 1 and the csp3 h3 and csp3 h4 bonds adjacent to nitrogen atom are 88 1 kcal mol 1 the calculated differences in the bond strengths for h2 h3 and h4 are within the expected margins of error of 3 4 kcal mol 1 typical for b3lyp 6 311g calculations these reactions are assumed to have similar entropies since the transformations involve csp3 h bonds and differ only by the position of abstraction since the h abstraction reactions proceed via loose variational transition states relative yields of the radicals should be approximately proportional to e δe rt where δe is the calculated c h bond strength for each h elimination channel r 0 001987 kcal mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant and t k is the phase temperature atkins et al 2013 based on the computational results of the c h bond energies the partitioning of the different hydrogen abstraction channels at the different regions within the cavitation site were determined in the bulk solution at 278 k the results indicate the abstraction occurs at h1 the temperature can have a pronounced effect on the partitioning of the hydroxyl radical mediated reaction pathways at the gas liquid interfacial region of the cavitation site temperatures can reach 2000 k yielding the following calculated partitioning of the hydrogen abstract pathways 73 38 occurs at h1 3 55 at h2 two hydrogens 5 72 at h3 two hydrogens and 17 36 involves h4 six hydrogens at the hot spot with temperatures reaching 5000 k 27 45 of h abstraction involves h1 12 38 involve h2 14 98 and h3 and the remaining 45 19 involves h4 since there are six identical hydrogens at h4 position there is a higher possibility of the abstraction occurring at h4 than h2 from the perspective of statistics the homolytic bond dissociation hbd and h abstraction removal of h results in the same carbon centered radicals can also occur via h abstraction reactions dph ho dph h2o relative product yields for h abstraction pathways are likely thermodynamically controlled because the barriers for the h abstraction reactions by ho are normally either very low or even submerged below the reactants the h abstraction by ho should be exothermic since the strength of the o h bond formed 117 6 kcal mol 1 is higher than the strength of c h bonds broken in the case of the thermodynamic control the relative yields of the radicals discussed above is determined by their relative energies and hence should be identical to the relative yields evaluated for the h homolytic bond dissociation 4 1 2 fragmentation of carbon centered radicals the carbon centered radicals produced by hydroxyl radical mediated hydrogen abstraction can undergo β scission or react with o2 to produce peroxyl radicals the unimolecular fragmentation channels for the carbon centered radicals were calculated to predict the most probable degradation pattern the benzylic radical produced by abstraction of h1 is predicted to undergo c o bond fragmentation to yield benzophenone and a primary carbon center radical with ea of 19 9 kcal mol 1 the primary radical can undergo β scission to yield ethylene and a nitrogen centered radical these reaction pathways and relative energies are summarized in fig 8 the presence of benzophenone as a primary reaction product was confirmed by lc ms the low molecular products are highly volatile and can readily escape solution under experimental conditions computational studies indicate the carbon centered radical formed by extraction of h2 can undergo c n fragmentation β scission pathway 2a leading to diphenyl vinyloxy methane and dimethylamine radical in competition with β scission of the c o bond pathway 2b yielding the diphenylmethyl radical and 2 dimethylamino acetaldehyde fig 8 the activation energy for pathway 2a and 2b are 18 3 kcal mol 1 and 9 8 kcal mol 1 respectively the benzylic radical species formed in pathway 2b can react with molecular oxygen ultimately leading to benzophenone via radical chain oxidation pathways according to the computational results pathway 2b is heavily favored over 2a the carbon centered radical produced by abstraction of h3 is also subject to two competing β scission pathways first fragmentation of the c n bond leading to imine and methyl radical products with ea of 24 5 kcal mol 1 in a favored process fragmentation of the c o yields and oxygen center benzophenone radical and n n dimethyl n ethylene amine with ea 10 6 kcal mol 1 the oxygen center radical undergoes rapid 1 2 hydrogen shift to yield the favored benzyl radical which upon radical chain oxidation can readily produce benzophenone the β scission pathways for the carbon centered radical obtained from h4 both involve c n bond fragmentation the activation energy for the n ch3 bond and n ch2 bond are nearly identical 26 9 and 26 4 kcal mol 1 respectively these competing pathways also produce energetically similar carbon centered radicals and imine products the calculated barriers for the β scission processes are quite low thus the unimolecular decomposition of the initial carbon centered radicals should be very fast at the temperatures associated with cavitation a number of predicted products were not observed in lc ms the reason these products escaped detection is attributed to low yields in a complex mixture of different pyrolysis and hydroxyl mediated reaction products their rapid degradation and or high volatility such that they escape as a gas 4 2 computation of pyrolytic degradation pathways the high temperatures produced during cavitation can lead to the pyrolysis by carbon carbon c c carbon oxygen c o or carbon nitrogen c n bond fragmentation pathways the energies required for c c c o and c n bond cleavage depends on bond strengths c h bond are stronger and less likely to go fragmentation the csp2 csp2 bonds in the aromatic rings are among the strongest in dph and unlikely to undergo fragmentation the csp2 csp3 bonds are also relatively strong with a calculated activation energy of 73 8 kcal mol 1 for their bond fragmentation even though c o bonds are generally stronger than c c bonds the lowest activation energy is 55 4 kcal mol 1 for the cbenzylic o bond cleavage leading to an oxygen centered radical and a highly stabilized resonance benzylic radical the other c o bond fragmentation non benzylic carbon required an activation energy of 74 0 kcal mol 1 for competing c n bond fragmentation pathways elimination of the methyl radical 66 8 kcal mol 1 is slightly favored over elimination of the dimethylamine radical 68 4 kcal mol 1 the activation energy required for csp3 csp3 fragmentation is 67 7 kcal mol 1 the computational results summarized in fig 9 clearly indicate the fragmentation producing the diphenylmethyl benzylic radical species is a highly favored pathway in the direct pyrolysis of dph which yields benzophenone observed in the presence of o2 5 conclusions diphenhydramine the first generation antihistamine is commonly found in drinking water sources and treated waste waters the ultrasonic treatment of dph leads to the rapid degradation and follows pseudo first order kinetics at a given initial concentration the

product studies illustrated mono hydroxylation of the aromatic rings in dph yields three isomers as a primary degradation pathway subsequent hydroxylation leads to a mixture of di hydroxylated isomers

treatment processes do not effectively remove dph li et al 2011 adsorption and ion exchange methods often require extended contact times and are often cost prohibitive for removal of dph from drinking

for optimization of the photo catalyst pastrana martínez et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively degrade a wide variety of pollutants o shea and dionysiou 2012 the production of reactive species primarily ho radicals with smaller amounts of oxidants such as h2o2 o2 is central to the effectiveness of aops these reactive species lead to oxidative transformation and mineralization of the target pollutants aops have shown tremendous promise for degradation of a wide variety of organic pollutants during water purification andreozzi et al 1999 klavarioti et al 2009 oller et al 2011 ultrasonic irradiation is a unique aops as it generates hydroxyl radicals directly from water molecules and thus does not require addition of catalyst or oxidant common to the majority of aops hoffmann et al 1996 mason and tiehm 2001 ultrasonic irradiation can penetrate and be used to treat turbid and highly colored solutions while the application of photochemical aops such as uv peroxide is limited to relatively clear solutions which allow penetration of photons deep into the solution as ultrasonic waves pass through a solution gas bubbles undergo local expansion and compression cycles colussi et al 1998 suslick et al 1999 the size of the bubble increases with the number of expansion compression cycles leading to a pressure differential and eventually the bubbles collapse a process referred to as cavitation wu et al 2013 at collapse three zones have been defined the region at the center of the cavitation site referred to as the hot spot the gas liquid interface and the bulk solution the hot spot possesses extremely high temperatures above 5000 k and pressures above 500 atm colussi et al 1998 mason and tiehm 2001 suslick et al 1999 which leads to the pyrolysis of water vapor and produces hydroxyl radicals ho as well as other oxidative species the gas liquid interface has high temperatures above 2000 k and high pressures above 200 atm leading to pyrolysis and generation of hydroxyl radicals and other oxidative species the bulk solution possesses relatively mild conditions close to ambient temperature and pressure where target compounds are only transformed upon reaction with radical species that diffuse from the cavitation site kim et al 2016 leong et al 2011 peller et al 2001 sillanpää 2011 song et al 2005 although the hydroxyl

kinetic studies adsorption isotherms and the product studies of the ultrasonically induced decomposition of dph a computational method was also employed to complement product studies and established

previously seymour et al 1997 schematic representation included in supplementary materials the aqueous solution containing the target compound was added into the reaction vessel saturated by gentle bubbling with o2 for 15 min samples were taken at specific treatment intervals and analyzed immediately or stored in the refrigerator until analyses a varian pro star 210 hplc with a diode array

agilent 6530 accurate mass spectrometer equipped with an agilent infinity 1290 infinity binary pump equipped with a 3 0 100 mm 1 8 μ c18 column was used for the product studies the mobile phase for

gradient program 0 1 min 95 a 1 10 min from 95 to 5 a the column temperature was 30 c to monitor the concentration of dph accurately a calibration curve was carefully developed from 2 to 2000 μmol l 1 a 1000 mg l stock solution was prepared using volumetric flasks and stored in the refrigerator different concentration solutions were obtained from the dilution of stock solution employing adjustable pipettes and volumetric flasks the dph degradation was monitored over a range of initial dph concentrations of 2 8 5 2 14 0 27 0 62 0 and 160 0 μmol l 1 the sampling times were adjusted according to the extent of degradation at different initial concentrations for dph 0 2 8 and 5 2 μmol l 1 samples were taken at 0 1 2 3 4 6 and 8 min of the treatment dph 0 14 0 and 27 0 μmol l 1 samples were taken at 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 min for the 62 0 μmol l 1 samples were taken at 0 4 8 12 and 16 min while for dph 0 160 0 μmol l 1 samples were analyzed at 0 5 10 20 and 30 min samples for the product studies using lc ms were taken at 0 and 30 min for the 14 0 μmol l 1 dph solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics the ultrasonically induced degradation of dph was effective over a range of initial concentrations from 2 8 to 160 0 μmol l 1 under o2 saturation at 5 c the degradations of dph as a function of treatment time at different initial concentrations are illustrated in s fig 1 the extent of degradation decreases with increasing initial concentration the treatment time required to degrade 50 of the initial concentration varied from 3 9 to 33 3 min for the initial dph concentrations of 2 8 160 0 μmol l 1 respectively previous studies have established that the ultrasonic mediated degradation of a variety of organic compounds follows pseudo first kinetics at a given initial concentration cui et al 2017 hua et al 1995 kim et al 2012 song et al 2009 taylor et al 2014 pseudo first order kinetics are represented by the mathematical equation ln c t c 0 k t k min 1 where ct and c0 μmol l 1 are the concentration at treatment time t and the initial concentration respectively the pseudo first order kinetic plot fig 1 of the degradation of dph yields rate constants of 0 21 0 13 0 082 0 050 0 035 and 0 023 min 1 corresponding to the initial concentrations of 2 8 5 2 14 0 27 0 61 0 and 160 0 μmol l 1 respectively the observed rate constants decreased by approximately 10 fold as the initial concentration increased by about 80 times the rate constant does not change significantly with initial concentration for a true first order type reaction process however variations in the reaction rate constant as a function of initial concentration have been previously reported for heterogeneous processes güyer and ince 2011 jiang et al 2002a this anomaly has been rationalized based on mass transfer limitations and saturation effects for heterogeneous processes occurring at or near the gas liquid interface jiang et al 2002b 3 2 heterogeneous kinetic modeling the ultrasonically mediated degradation of pollutants in aqueous media involves two primary processes direct pyrolysis of target compounds and degradation mediated by the reactive species generated during cavitation the extent of these degradation pathways is dependent on the partitioning of the target compounds to the gas gas liquid interface and bulk liquid regions hoffmann et al 1996 mason and tiehm 2001 dph has relatively low vapor pressure and is not expected to partition to the hot spot gas region during cavitation the gas liquid interface however also possesses high temperatures 2000 k and high pressures 300 atm during cavitational collapse above the supercritical points 680 k and 218 atm for water and thus it exists in a supercritical state hua et al 1995 shao and chen 2015 suslick et al 1990 water in the supercritical state exhibits hydrophobic rather than the hydrophilic solvation properties associated with water under ambient conditions in general ultrasonic mediated degradation is initiated by reactive oxygen species generated at the hot spot and g l interfacial regions alternatively neutral hydrophobic species can partition to the g l interface where direct pyrolysis can occur because of the high temperatures produced during cavitation since the degradation reactions will primarily occur at or near the liquid gas interface the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetic model for heterogeneous reactions was employed eq 1 to the degradation process okitsu et al 2005 xiao et al 2014 for the purposes of kinetic modeling we define the liquid gas interface as the reaction surface where dph can partition to and from the l h model assumes 1 all sites on the surface interface are equivalent 2 each site is occupied by one molecule and forms a monolayer uniform partitioning 3 the molecules have no interactions with the ones on the adjacent sites 4 the adsorption and desorption process is in an equilibrium 1 1 r 0 1 k r k l h c 0 where r0 μmol l 1 min 1 is the initial rate c0 μmol l 1 is the initial dph concentration kr l min μmol 1 is the reactivity coefficient and kl h μmol l 1 is the equilibrium constant the initial rates of degradation were monitored over the initial 20 of the degradation of dph to minimize competition from the degradation products the observed degradation rates as a function of initial concentrations c0 were used to construct the l h plot 1 r0 min l μmol as a function of 1 c0 l μmol which yields a linear relationship as shown in fig 2 a the intercept equals 1 kr and the slope is 1 krkl h the l h plot yields a reactivity constant kr 1 96 μmol min 1 l 1 and the partitioning constant kl h was 0 06 μmol l 1 the reactivity constant and partitioning constant are empirical values to describe the apparent reactivity and the partitioning factors according to the l h model 3 3 hydroxyl radical competition study hydroxyl radicals produced during cavitation are critical to the effective degradation of organic compounds during ultrasonic treatment to assess the role of ho in the degradation of dph coumarin cou a hydroxyl radical trap was added to the solution during the ultrasonic treatment of dph the rates of ultrasonic induced degradation of coumarin were monitored under different initial concentrations 25 40 50 60 80 and 100 μmol l the observed degradation rates as a function of initial concentrations were modeled using the langmuir hinshelwood model described earlier the l h plot of the observed degradation of coumarin illustrated in fig 2 b yields a linear relationship indicating the degradation occurs at or near the reaction surface gas liquid interface the slope and intercept of the l h plot yield the following apparent kinetic parameters reactivity constant kr 3 71 μmol min 1 l 1 and a partitioning constant kl h 0 26 μmol l 1 by comparison the l h kinetic parameters of cou were significantly higher than those observed for dph under the same conditions the ultrasonically induced degradation of dph and cou fit to the l h model however the better fit of dph to the l h indicates cou may not follow the specific l h model assumptions as well dph and cou process hydrocarbon functionality and thus both can partition to the hydrophobic g l interface cou will be uncharged under the experimental conditions while dph possesses an aliphatic amine with pka 8 98 and thus exists in protonated positive form at neutral solution ph topp et al 2012 since dph is positively charged it is not expected to partition to the hydrophobic g l interface like neutral cou cou is neutral and thus more likely to partition to the g l interface than the positively charged dph in addition cou is more volatile than dph and more likely to partitioning to hot spot region higher partitioning of cou to the g l and hot spot regions is consistent with a larger observed kl h compared to the less volatile charged dph cou thus should exhibit greater partitioning to the hot spot and g l interfacial regions have greater l h reactivity and degrade faster than dph based on these results cou will be effective as a probe for the ho mediated dph degradation pathways a kinetic competition study between dph and cou was conducted the degradation of 0 1 mmol l 1 dph was monitored in absence and presence of an equimolar amount of cou as illustrated in fig 3 the degradation rate of 0 1 mmol l 1 dph in the absence of cou was 2 82 μmol l 1 min 1 in the presence of an equimolar amount of cou the observe dph degradation rate dropped 57 8 to 1 19 μmol l 1 min 1 the observed rates of reaction of hydroxyl radical with cou and dph also depend on the bimolecular rate constants based on replicate experiments the reproducibility of the kinetic results is within 5 7 experimental error the bimolecular hydroxyl radical rate constants for ho cou is kcou ho 1 05 1010 m 1s 1 and ho dph is kdph ho 0 71 0 2 1010 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2012 newton and milligan 2006 sicard roselli et al 2014 based strictly on the relative magnitude of the rate constants at a 1 1 ratio of cou to dph in homogeneous solution cou would be 1 48 times more reactive and a 59 7 decrease of degradation rate is expected the observation of a 57 8 decrease corresponds to the theoretical value also indicates that the reaction between dph and hydroxyl radical dominates the degradation process the theoretical and experimental are in excellent agreement indicating the pyrolysis pathway is not affected by the ho scavenger 3 4 product study hydroxyl radical mediated processes are central to the effective degradation of pollutants by ultrasonic treatment hydroxyl radicals react with organic pollutants through three possible pathways hydroxyl radical addition hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer hydroxyl radical addition to electron rich aromatic systems is generally 10 100 times faster than hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer is uncommon except for exceedingly electron rich systems based on relative reaction rates for these competing pathways hydroxyl radical will react primarily with dph through addition and hydrogen abstraction pathways product studies were completed by lc ms after 90 of the starting material was degraded the retention time of dph is 6 554 min with an accurate mass charge ratio of 256 1623 corresponding to the molecular weight peak s f 2 although the lc ms raw data represents accurate mass of the protonated species m z m 1 values for the purpose of this manuscript we will refer the accurate mass as the molecular weight for the remainder of the paper the total ion chromatogram exhibits several well resolved peaks indicative of degradation products based on the observed accurate mass measurements and key fragmentations in the ms specific structures were assigned to the reaction products as described herein 3 4 1 hydroxyl radical addition products hydroxyl radical is a powerful electrophile and readily adds to aromatic rings hydroxyl radical addition to the aromatic ring with subsequent elimination of h is a common reaction pathway for aromatic compounds fig 4 the ho addition can occur at meta ortho and para positions louit et al 2005 among the observed products are three clearly resolved peaks with identical molecular weights m z of 272 1693 and retention times of 5 665 5 784 and 6 044 min corresponding to the mono hydroxylation products s f 3 all three mass spectra exhibited fragment peaks at m z 183 08 indicating hydroxylation of the benzene ring and are assigned to para meta and ortho phenolic adducts aravindakumar s group reported similar isomeric phenols for dph and hydroxyl radical generated by uv h2o2 menachery et al 2015 mono hydroxylation increases the electron rich character of the aromatic ring making the product more reactive to a second electrophilic ho addition reaction products with molecular weight mw 287 15 were also observed among the predominant products and correspond to di hydroxylation products of dph as shown in fig 4 addition of the second ho can occur at mono hydroxylated ring leading to a di hydroxylated benzene ring while reaction at the phenyl ring non hydroxylated will produce two mono hydroxylated benzene within one dph molecule as illustrated in fig 4 these products constitutional isomers have identical molecular weights three isomers were detected and reported in previous work menachery et al 2016 however for the dihydroxylation of single benzene ring in dph there are seven possible constitutional isomers six constitutional isomers are possible from the mono hydroxylated of the two benzene rings within dph given the identical molecular weights and a large number of possible isomers for di hydroxylated dph it is difficult to separate distinguish and assign the individual di hydroxylated isomers however four unique peaks with mw of 287 16 were observed in the product mixture corresponding to the di hydroxylated products the retention times of the resolved chromatographic peaks for the di hydroxylated products were 4 908 5 080 5 283 and 5 614 min s fig 4 given enhanced reactivity of the mono hydroxylated aromatic ring compared to non hydroxylated aromatic ring we expect dihydroxylation of single aromatic will dominant the reaction mixture while specific assignment of these isomers is difficult it is likely that additional dihydroxylation products are formed which are below the detection limit or overlapping with the observed peaks 3 4 2 hydrogen abstraction reaction products while hydroxyl radical addition to the aromatic rings leading to phenolic products appears to be the predominant reaction pathway hydroxyl abstract of the benzyl hydrogen is also possible a dph degradation product was observed with mw of 193 11 and a retention time at 4 823 min this product can be the result of a radical chain oxidation process at the highly reactive benzylic hydrogen s fig 5 the fragments at m z 105 04 and m z 121 03 are indicative of the ester group functionality the proposed product s fig 6 a product with mw 199 08 was observed and assigned as a dihydroxylation adduct of benzophenone a secondary degradation product of dph which could be produced by abstraction of the benzylic hydrogen such an adduct has been previously reported menachery et al 2016 3 4 3 pyrolysis products with the high temperatures at the hot spot and gas liquid interfacial regions produced during cavitation pyrolysis can also play a role in ultrasonically induced degradation processes given the low vapor pressure of dph and positive charge under the experimental conditions it is not expected to partition onto vapor phase hot spot but rather reside primarily in the g l interface and or bulk regions under the temperatures generated at the g l interface homolytic bond cleavage can occur within the dph molecule the weakest bonds within dph based on typical homolytic bond cleavage energies are the alkyl csp3 csp3 bonds and the csp3 nsp3 bonds compared to the csp2 csp2 and csp2 h bonds within the aromatic rings t w graham solomons 2001 a product with mw 241 15 was observed with a retention time of 6 428 min which corresponds to m 14 indicative of loss of a ch2 and assigned to the conversion of the n ch3 to n h shown in fig 5 mass spectrum is shown in s fig 7 the product with mw 182 07 is consistent with benzophenone containing characteristic fragments m z 105 041 and m 77 fig 6 among possible pathways the formation of benzophenone can also occur by hydroxyl mediated radical chain oxidation at the benzylic carbon cooper et al 2009 4 computational study of competing degradation pathways detailed computational studies were performed at the b3lyp 6 311g level of theory using the gaussian 09 program package to have a better understanding of the pyrolysis and hydroxyl radical mediated degradation pathways based on the product studies the computational experiments focus on the hydroxyl radical addition and hydrogen atom abstraction reaction pathways to determine the energetics and partitioning of the dph ho reaction pathways computational studies were also carried out to correlate the energies required for homolytic bond cleavages for individual bonds in dph to determine the partitioning of pyrolytic degradation pathways during ultrasonic treatment 4 1 hydroxyl radical addition to aromatic ring the addition of hydroxyl radical to aromatic systems commonly occurs at near diffusion controlled rates with bimolecular rates constants of 109 1010 m 1sec 1 the aromatic phenyl groups present in dph are highly susceptible to addition by hydroxyl radical dph has two identical mono alkyl substituted benzene rings with addition possible at the ipso ortho meta and para positions although hydroxylation at the ipso position is proposed for addition of water to the radical cation of dph menachery et al 2016 direct addition of hydroxyl radical at the ipso position is generally not competitive with the ortho meta and para reaction pathways hydroxyl radical addition leading to hydroxylation of the aromatic rings in dph has been reported menachery et al 2015 but isomers are difficult to distinguish by ms computational studies were conducted to identify the most probable sites on dph for ho radical addition to the aromatic rings in order to trace the reaction pathways between dph and ho three series of separate calculations simulating ho radical attack at ortho meta and para positions were performed fig 4 the initial reactants are dph ho the intermediates are ho adducts and the final products are obtained by the loss of the hydrogen atom from the attacked position in the radical ho adducts the results of calculations of the transition state energies ts for formation of the ho adducts are represented as the activation energy ea and the adduct formation energy δrh calculated as 11 0 13 0 10 3 kcal mol 1 for the o m and the p position the activation barriers for the ortho and para postion are slightly lower than that for the meta position which means that the ortho and para additions are modestly favored for ho addition the ortho and para position are electron rich compared to the meta position because of the electron donating effect directing of the alkyl subsitutent since ho is electrophilic the rate of reaction should be modestly faster at the more electron rich ortho and para postions consistent with the computation results the activation energies are similar for all three isomers indicating likely formation of all which is further supported by the lc ms results which indicate the presence of three isomeric forms of mono hydroxylated dph products during the degradation process 4 1 1 hydrogen abstraction reaction pathways hydroxyl radical mediated hydrogen abstractions can occur at a number of sites within the dph molecule the aromatic rings present in dph contain csp2 h bonds which are significantly stronger than the aliphatic csp3 h bonds given the csp2 h bonds are dramatically less reactivity towards hydrogen abstraction they were not taken into consideration abstraction of the different csp3 hs will lead to four different radical products the partitioning of these competing reaction pathways can be predicted based on the homolytic bond dissociation energies h elimination the relative reactivities calculated for csp3 h dph reaction sites are summarized in fig 8 the most reactivity site towards hydrogen abstraction is c h1 the benzylic hydrogen the benzylic properties and additional electron withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom alpha to the hydrogen weaken the c h1 bond which has a calculated bond dissociation energy of 75 4 kcal mol 1 the calculated bond strengths for the csp3 h2 bond α with o is 90 1 kcal mol 1 and the csp3 h3 and csp3 h4 bonds adjacent to nitrogen atom are 88 1 kcal mol 1 the calculated differences in the bond strengths for h2 h3 and h4 are within the expected margins of error of 3 4 kcal mol 1 typical for b3lyp 6 311g calculations these reactions are assumed to have similar entropies since the transformations involve csp3 h bonds and differ only by the position of abstraction since the h abstraction reactions proceed via loose variational transition states relative yields of the radicals should be approximately proportional to e δe rt where δe is the calculated c h bond strength for each h elimination channel r 0 001987 kcal mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant and t k is the phase temperature atkins et al 2013 based on the computational results of the c h bond energies the partitioning of the different hydrogen abstraction channels at the different regions within the cavitation site were determined in the bulk solution at 278 k the results indicate the abstraction occurs at h1 the temperature can have a pronounced effect on the partitioning of the hydroxyl radical mediated reaction pathways at the gas liquid interfacial region of the cavitation site temperatures can reach 2000 k yielding the following calculated partitioning of the hydrogen abstract pathways 73 38 occurs at h1 3 55 at h2 two hydrogens 5 72 at h3 two hydrogens and 17 36 involves h4 six hydrogens at the hot spot with temperatures reaching 5000 k 27 45 of h abstraction involves h1 12 38 involve h2 14 98 and h3 and the remaining 45 19 involves h4 since there are six identical hydrogens at h4 position there is a higher possibility of the abstraction occurring at h4 than h2 from the perspective of statistics the homolytic bond dissociation hbd and h abstraction removal of h results in the same carbon centered radicals can also occur via h abstraction reactions dph ho dph h2o relative product yields for h abstraction pathways are likely thermodynamically controlled because the barriers for the h abstraction reactions by ho are normally either very low or even submerged below the reactants the h abstraction by ho should be exothermic since the strength of the o h bond formed 117 6 kcal mol 1 is higher than the strength of c h bonds broken in the case of the thermodynamic control the relative yields of the radicals discussed above is determined by their relative energies and hence should be identical to the relative yields evaluated for the h homolytic bond dissociation 4 1 2 fragmentation of carbon centered radicals the carbon centered radicals produced by hydroxyl radical mediated hydrogen abstraction can undergo β scission or react with o2 to produce peroxyl radicals the unimolecular fragmentation channels for the carbon centered radicals were calculated to predict the most probable degradation pattern the benzylic radical produced by abstraction of h1 is predicted to undergo c o bond fragmentation to yield benzophenone and a primary carbon center radical with ea of 19 9 kcal mol 1 the primary radical can undergo β scission to yield ethylene and a nitrogen centered radical these reaction pathways and relative energies are summarized in fig 8 the presence of benzophenone as a primary reaction product was confirmed by lc ms the low molecular products are highly volatile and can readily escape solution under experimental conditions computational studies indicate the carbon centered radical formed by extraction of h2 can undergo c n fragmentation β scission pathway 2a leading to diphenyl vinyloxy methane and dimethylamine radical in competition with β scission of the c o bond pathway 2b yielding the diphenylmethyl radical and 2 dimethylamino acetaldehyde fig 8 the activation energy for pathway 2a and 2b are 18 3 kcal mol 1 and 9 8 kcal mol 1 respectively the benzylic radical species formed in pathway 2b can react with molecular oxygen ultimately leading to benzophenone via radical chain oxidation pathways according to the computational results pathway 2b is heavily favored over 2a the carbon centered radical produced by abstraction of h3 is also subject to two competing β scission pathways first fragmentation of the c n bond leading to imine and methyl radical products with ea of 24 5 kcal mol 1 in a favored process fragmentation of the c o yields and oxygen center benzophenone radical and n n dimethyl n ethylene amine with ea 10 6 kcal mol 1 the oxygen center radical undergoes rapid 1 2 hydrogen shift to yield the favored benzyl radical which upon radical chain oxidation can readily produce benzophenone the β scission pathways for the carbon centered radical obtained from h4 both involve c n bond fragmentation the activation energy for the n ch3 bond and n ch2 bond are nearly identical 26 9 and 26 4 kcal mol 1 respectively these competing pathways also produce energetically similar carbon centered radicals and imine products the calculated barriers for the β scission processes are quite low thus the unimolecular decomposition of the initial carbon centered radicals should be very fast at the temperatures associated with cavitation a number of predicted products were not observed in lc ms the reason these products escaped detection is attributed to low yields in a complex mixture of different pyrolysis and hydroxyl mediated reaction products their rapid degradation and or high volatility such that they escape as a gas 4 2 computation of pyrolytic degradation pathways the high temperatures produced during cavitation can lead to the pyrolysis by carbon carbon c c carbon oxygen c o or carbon nitrogen c n bond fragmentation pathways the energies required for c c c o and c n bond cleavage depends on bond strengths c h bond are stronger and less likely to go fragmentation the csp2 csp2 bonds in the aromatic rings are among the strongest in dph and unlikely to undergo fragmentation the csp2 csp3 bonds are also relatively strong with a calculated activation energy of 73 8 kcal mol 1 for their bond fragmentation even though c o bonds are generally stronger than c c bonds the lowest activation energy is 55 4 kcal mol 1 for the cbenzylic o bond cleavage leading to an oxygen centered radical and a highly stabilized resonance benzylic radical the other c o bond fragmentation non benzylic carbon required an activation energy of 74 0 kcal mol 1 for competing c n bond fragmentation pathways elimination of the methyl radical 66 8 kcal mol 1 is slightly favored over elimination of the dimethylamine radical 68 4 kcal mol 1 the activation energy required for csp3 csp3 fragmentation is 67 7 kcal mol 1 the computational results summarized in fig 9 clearly indicate the fragmentation producing the diphenylmethyl benzylic radical species is a highly favored pathway in the direct pyrolysis of dph which yields benzophenone observed in the presence of o2 5 conclusions diphenhydramine the first generation antihistamine is commonly found in drinking water sources and treated waste waters the ultrasonic treatment of dph leads to the rapid degradation and follows pseudo first order kinetics at a given initial concentration the rate constant was observed to be dependent on the initial dph concentration and decreased with increasing dph concentration such kinetic behavior is consistent with previous studies involving heterogeneous treatment systems the degradation was also accurately model by langmuir hinshelwood kinetics dph is effectively degraded by ultrasonic degradation even at high concentrations detailed product studies illustrated mono hydroxylation of the aromatic rings in dph yields three isomers as a primary degradation pathway subsequent hydroxylation leads to a mixture of di hydroxylated isomers benzophenone was also detected and likely produced from dph as a favored pyrolytic reaction pathway the computational studies are consistent with the product studies and provide additional insight relating to the competing reaction pathways the results demonstrated ultrasound is an effective predictable method to degrade dph from aqueous systems appendix a supplementary data the following is

19364,we present results from field experiments linking hydrology geochemistry and microbiology during infiltration at a field site that is used for managed aquifer recharge mar these experiments measured how a horizontal permeable reactive barrier prb made of woodchips impacted subsurface nitrate removal and microbial ecology concentrations of dissolved organic carbon consistently increased in infiltrating water below the prb but not in un amended native soil the average nitrate removal rate in soils below the prb was 1 5 g m2 day no3 n despite rapid infiltration up to 1 9 m d and a short fluid residence time within the woodchips 6 h in contrast 0 09 g m2 day no3 n was removed on average in native soil residual nitrate in infiltrating water below the prb was enriched in δ15n and δ18o with low and variable isotopic enrichment factors that are consistent with denitrification during rapid infiltration many putative denitrifying bacteria were significantly enhanced in the soil below a prb methylotenera mobilis and genera microbacterium polaromonas and novosphingobium had log2 fold changes of 4 9 5 6 7 2 and 11 8 respectively these bacteria were present before infiltration and were not enhanced in native soil it appears that the woodchip prb contributed to favorable conditions in the underlying soil for enhanced nitrate removal quantitatively shifting soil microbial

contaminant removal valhondo et al 2018 in this study we examined how a horizontal woodchip prb could enhance nitrate removal during rapid infiltration for mar specifically we seek to address the following questions a is denitrification during rapid infiltration enhanced by brief passage through a carbon rich prb b how does infiltration through a prb affect microbial ecology in shallow soils c how might using a horizonal prb improve water quality during mar to address these questions we conducted a novel series of plot scale field experiments to represent shallow soil conditions during infiltration for mar collecting co located and contemporaneous hydrologic geochemical and microbial samples these interdisciplinary experiments were designed to compare nitrate removal processes in native soils to those within and below a horizontal woodchip prb with applications for simultaneously improving groundwater supply and quality via mar 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site field work was completed within the 2 5 ha harkins slough mar infiltration basin in the pajaro valley central coastal california usa fig s1 land use in the pajaro valley is a mix of agricultural urban residential and undeveloped but most groundwater use supports agricultural activities nitrate concentrations in major surface water bodies and groundwater often exceed the u s environmental protection agency s maximum contaminant level of 10 mg l no3 n los huertos et al 2001 pajaro valley water management agency 2016 the experimental site is located on eolian dune and alluvial deposits and shallow soils are characterized as baywood loamy sand typically having 81 sand 16 silt and 2 clay usda 2014 the harkins slough mar system is operated by a local agency that diverts water from a nearby wetland when flows and water quality are sufficiently high diverted water passes through a rapid sand filter before entering the infiltration basin recharged water is subsequently recovered from a network of shallow wells mixed with recycled water tertiary treated and disinfected and groundwater from farther inland and distributed to local customers in lieu of pumping from the regional aquifer earlier studies of the harkins slough mar system examined infiltration dynamics and water quality during infiltration through native soils focusing on the central deeper part of the infiltration basin racz et al 2011 schmidt et al 2011 the experiments presented in this study were located at higher elevation near the edge of the infiltration basin and explored how a prb may stimulate nutrient cycling fig s1 2 2 plot construction and operation we constructed four hand excavated infiltration plots each 1 m2 in area each plot was lined with fiberglass walls caulked at the corners and backed by bentonite fig 1a and b two plots ns1 and ns2 contained only native soil in plots prb1 and prb2 a horizontal prb consisting of a 30 cm thick layer of redwood chips 0 5 2 cm in dimension and rough in shape was installed above native soils woodchips were added to the plots by hand and gently consolidated then covered with a coarse nylon screen held down by washed rounded river rocks to prevent floatation a hose delivered groundwater with elevated no3 to the plots from a nearby well a float switch and solenoid valve controlled water delivery keeping the water level within a limited range fig 1c for each test water infiltrated continuously for 14 15 days we ran four tests in series over a 10 week period experimental plots were designed to represent a small scale mar infiltration basin some lateral infiltration occurs in field scale mar systems bouwer 2002 but a larger fraction of lateral flow was expected to occur below the 1 m2 plots especially near the edges see supporting information accordingly all instruments for subsurface sampling and measurements were installed within the central 0 16 m2 of each plot where flow is dominantly vertical fig 1d all infiltration rate and geochemical load calculations are based on data and samples collected from this region the inflowing water supply was intermittent during test ns2 fig s2 which prevented maintenance of saturated conditions in the shallow soil so we focused on data from ns1 as a no treatment control for comparison with results from tests prb1 and prb2 for each test the float switch was installed high in the plot water level 0 5 m and then lowered water level 0 3 m after a period of initial infiltration we lowered the float switch on day 4 during test prb1 day 7 during test ns1 and day 8 during test prb2 see supporting information for details on plot construction operation and sampling 2 3 sampling soil samples were collected using a hand auger before and after infiltration at 10 20 cm intervals down to 110 cm below plot base cm bpb soil aliquots for microbiological analysis were collected with ethanol rinsed spatulas while experiments were running fluid samples were collected using six piezometers in two nests of three with screen centers at 30 55 and 80 cm bpb additional fluid samples were drawn from within the prb during tests prb1 and prb2 we sampled surface and subsurface water 10 12 times during each test pumping the fluid through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter into acid washed pre rinsed polyethylene and glass bottles samples were put on ice immediately and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 4 infiltration rates we converted absolute pressure at the plot base to water level correcting for local barometric pressure during periods when the solenoid valve was closed every 10 20 min preventing water from flowing into the plot we calculated the bulk infiltration rate as change in water level over time we independently calculated the vertical component of infiltration in the center of the plot with thermal probes installed in the soil this technique uses heat as a tracer to quantify the vertical infiltration rate from the amplitude reduction with depth of periodic temperature fluctuations hatch et al 2006 thermal probes do not provide reliable infiltration data during the first and last few days of each test due to edge effects equivalent to the order of the filter applied to the thermal data 2 3 days thus we focused our analysis on days 4 12 of each test 2 5 soils characterization to determine soil texture splits from pre infiltration

delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer twelve standards were run at regular intervals and showed no discernible drift with standard deviations of 0 06 for δ15n and 0 15 for δ18o for each day nitrogen and oxygen enrichment factors were calculated using an approximation of the rayleigh equation 2 7 phylogenetic sequencing soil dna was extracted with the powersoil dna isolation kit qiagen and quantified with a qubit 4 fluorometer invitrogen partial 16s rrna genes v4 and v5 variable regions were amplified using primers modified to contain 5 sequencing adapters for barcoding and sequencing using the illumina miseq platform samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of 550 bp amplicons an amplicon sequencing pipeline was adapted from the

sequence post processing was performed with qiime version 2018 2 caporaso et al 2010 based on the analytical pipeline steps specified in weathers et al 2016 and using the qiime2 plugins described

to the national center for biotechnology information sequence read archive database sra accession srp151895 3 results 3 1 soils grain size data revealed predominantly sandy soils in all plots fig s3 consistent with regional geology and mapped soil units for all soil samples d 10 10 finer was 100 μm and d 50 245 μm toc was 6 and tn was 0 07 by weight for all samples toc and tn did not vary significantly with depth or differ in samples from before and after infiltration table s1 3 2 infiltration sandy soils led to rapid infiltration fig 2 a for test ns1 bulk infiltration rates were relatively stable between 3 7 and 4 5 m d bulk rates were higher and more variable during tests prb1 7 5 19 1 m d and prb2 14 5 21 1 m d it is unlikely that the prb significantly influenced observed infiltration rates beneath the plots because the woodchips were much larger than soil grains infiltration rates were more likely dominated by underlying soil texture with differences in infiltration rates beneath the plots resulting from soil heterogeneity vertical infiltration rates near the plot centers were generally lower than bulk rates 1 1 3 4 m d 1 2 2 6 m d and 2 0 6 0 m d for tests ns1 prb1 and prb2 respectively fig 2b vertical flow rates determined from multiple thermal probes in the same plot were similar fig s4 and were consistent with independent measurements made in the sandiest part of the deeper basin during an earlier study racz et al 2011 the large difference between vertical and total infiltration is to be expected for experimental plots of this size see supporting information the residence time of water within woodchips at the plot center based on vertical infiltration was 2 8 6 0 h for test prb1 and 1 2 3 6 h for test prb2 plot walls surrounding the woodchips limited lateral flow within the prb though any lateral flow in the prb would result in even shorter residence times we lowered plot water levels midway through each test with the intent of slowing infiltration but this had limited influence on infiltration rates fig 2a though bulk infiltration rates slowed immediately after lowering the water level these rates subsequently increased ultimately returning to values observed near the start of each test vertical infiltration rates did not respond significantly to plot water level changes indicating that much of the observed dynamics was associated with lateral flow we surmise that the sustained free water boundary condition inside the plots resulted in formation of a temporary inverted shallow water table in adjacent soils when the water level was abruptly lowered there was likely a transient period of flow towards the plot then downward temporarily reducing bulk infiltration 3 3 water chemistry infiltration rates and soil properties determine the depth extent of soil saturation and pore fluids could be collected only when the piezometers were within saturated zones fig 1 on most days inflowing water had consistent composition 22 25 mg l no3 n 25 29 mg l doc and little to no nitrite or ammonium although inflowing no3 n was relatively constant nitrate load varied as a function of infiltration rate 40 72 g day m2 no3 n for ns1 30 61 g day m2 no3 n for prb1 and 66 104 g day m2 no3 n for test prb2 fig 2c d e the water supply occasionally included a fraction of recycled water readily identified by nh4 n 0 5 mg l and or no2 n 0 25 mg l tables s2 5 data from these days were not used for subsequent analyses all inflowing and subsurface water samples had doc 20 mg l doc generally showed no trend with depth in native soil but increased with depth below each prb fig 3 nitrate removal during test ns1 was inconsistent and modest ranging from 3 6 g n day m2 net addition to 2 7 g n day m2 in total 1 2 g n m2 was removed over 14 days fig 2c during test prb1 there was nitrate removal on days 5 12 peaking at 7 3 g n day m2 on day 5 cumulative removal during test prb1 was 23 1 g n m2 over 15 days fig 2d nitrate removal was less consistent during test prb2 peaking at 3 5 g day m2 and adding to a cumulative removal of 4 9 g n m2 over 15 days fig 2e on days when nitrate removal was observed the largest changes occurred below 30 cm bpb and coincided with small increases in no2 n fig 3 subsurface δ15n and δ18o differed little from surface values on days with no nitrate removal at depth fig 4 a residual nitrate was enriched in δ15n on all four days with measurable nitrate removal and enriched in δ18o relative to surface water on three of those four days fig 4b which is consistent with denitrification böhlke et al 2002 mariotti et al 1988 nitrogen enrichment factors ranged from 1 7 to 21 1 overlapping the range of values reported in agricultural regions 4 to 30 böhlke et al 2002 böttcher et al 1990 oxygen enrichment factors ranged from 3 5 to 2 9 similar to some reported values carrey et al 2013 but higher less negative than others böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 isotopic enrichment factors often exhibit an inverse relationship with denitrification rate mariotti et al 1988 vogel et al 1981 and in the present study rapid infiltration and denitrification corresponded to relatively low enrichment factors 3 4 microbiology soil microbial communities were grouped into four statistically similar sets native soil before infiltration nsb native soil after infiltration nsa prb before infiltration prbb and prb after infiltration prba these sets account for two dominant factors explaining community variance the presence of a prb 30 and sample collection time 20 fig s5a table s7 while sample depth accounted for 5 of the variance compared to other samples many notable clades were enhanced in prba samples many otus enhanced in prba samples have the potential to carry out denitrification fig 5 the otu with the largest increase in relative abundance below the prb was genus novosphingobium present at 14 10 after infiltration and 0 004 0 01 before infiltration a log2 fold change of 11 8 when this genus was proposed the ability to reduce no3 the first step in denitrification was a defining characteristic takeuchi et al 2001 enhanced otus with the potential to reduce no3 no2 and no include methylotenera mobilis with a log2 fold change 4 9 kalyuzhnaya et al 2006 genus microbacterium 5 6 zhou et al 2016 and family methylophilaceae 5 4 lapidus et al 2011 enhanced otus with the potential to reduce no3 no2 and n2o include genera polaromonas 7 2 lycus et al 2017 and microbacterium and family comamonadaceae 4 0 khan et al 2002 these otus were present in samples collected before infiltration and were not significantly enhanced in nsa samples additionally many otus were inhibited in prba samples one putative denitrifying genus streptomyces had a log2 fold change of 2 2 kumon et al 2002 some otus enhanced in prba samples are associated with hydrocarbon degradation as well as nitrate reduction including genera novosphingobium liu 2005 microbacterium and polaromonas and families erythrobacteraceae tonon et al 2014 and comamonadaceae hydrocarbon degradation can occur rapidly under denitrifying conditions hutchins et al 1991 the growth of microbes with the potential for hydrocarbon degradation could signal favorable conditions for denitrification as well furthermore many studies have explored the potential for microbes to co metabolize micropollutants and other contaminants under denitrifying conditions suarez et al 2010 tarlera 2003 and have found that co metabolic processes can be enhanced with the addition of a carbon source li et al 2013 4 discussion and implications 4 1 infiltration rates and nitrate removal to assess the potential benefit of a horizontal prb during mar we compare results from plot scale experiments to those from an earlier study at the same field site that observed nitrate removal during mar operations using native soil without a prb schmidt et al 2011 during mar operations mean infiltration was slower and initial no3 was lower than in the present study nitrate removal during infiltration through native soil occurred only when vertical infiltration rates were 0 7 0 2 m d fig 6 a at higher infiltration rates it was inferred that oxic conditions were maintained throughout the saturated soil limiting redox conditions needed for efficient denitrification schmidt et al 2011 additionally for 12 out of 23 measurements when the vertical infiltration rate was 0 9 m d there was little to no nitrate removal thus having an infiltration rate through native soil below the identified threshold did not guarantee that nitrate removal would occur during mar operations in the present study vertical infiltration rates in native soil were always 0 9 m d and limited nitrate removal occurred consistent with earlier work however during tests prb1 and prb2 nitrate removal occurred on every day with an infiltration rate 1 9 m d fig 6b a much higher threshold and a more consistent pattern than observed in native soil no nitrate removal occurred at infiltration rates 1 9 m d in the present study even when water passed through a prb although a prb may extend the range of infiltration rates during which subsurface nitrate removal can occur the process is still flow rate limited we did not observe infiltration rates 1 3 m d in the present study but given that a woodchip prb helped to stimulate denitrification in sandy soils at rapid infiltration rates it seems likely that the benefit from a prb would extend to soils with lower infiltration capacities as well additional work at lower fluid flow rates would be useful especially to determine whether the inverse relationship observed between infiltration rate and nitrate removal rate below a prb fig 6b is a consequence of the high infiltration rates near the threshold or a consistent behavior across a typical range of mar infiltration rates 0 5 2 m d other factors also influence nitrate removal including carbon nitrate availability redox conditions temperature and soil properties separating these effects will require carefully controlled experiments with a wide range of fluid and soil conditions and flow rates 4 2 linking geochemistry and microbiology isotopic and microbial data provide consistent strong evidence that nitrate removal occurred via denitrification in soils below a prb pore fluid nitrate in these soils was enriched in δ15n and δ18o relative to surface water on days with nitrate removal a pattern consistent with denitrification during rapid infiltration mariotti et al 1988 significantly enhanced otus below the prb contained putative functionality for complete denitrification and the abundance of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria may further indicate that conditions were favorable for denitrification hutchins et al 1991 however we cannot eliminate the possibility that anammox occurred in these soils as well on some days during tests ns1 prb1 and prb2 ammonium appeared in the subsurface at 6 mg l but nh4 was inconsistent and not correlated with nitrate removal tables s2 s5 anammox has also been observed during managed recharge fox 2001 and is often identified and distinguished from denitrification by quantification of genes hzo or hzsa via qpcr or using isotopic tracers in n2 gas jones et al 2017 rysgaard 2004 ongoing work will use qpcr to quantify nitrogen cycling genes with depth and time below a prb relative to native soil in soils below a prb no3 decreased with depth fig 3 depth was also an important factor in explaining community variance for prba samples fig s5b putative nitrate reducing otus ranged from having a total relative abundance in prba samples of 16 6 58 3 the relative abundance of putative nitrate reducers was greatest in the shallowest samples 10 cm bpb and decreased with depth this pattern is consistent with the trend of decreasing no3 with depth fig 7 most otus that were enhanced in prba samples were present before infiltration thus it appears unlikely that woodchips merely transported foreign bacteria to the underlying soil rather woodchips seem to have contributed to more favorable metabolic and growth conditions for native soil microbes that were already present there are several possible mechanisms by which a prb might stimulate denitrification the high porosity and large surface area of woodchips might provide microbial habitat but that does not account for nitrate removal and enhanced otus occurring in soils below the prb the placement of a prb could enhance denitrification by thickening the saturated zone increasing residence time within the saturated zone leading to lower oxygen and other favorable redox conditions at an equivalent soil depth the most likely explanation is that the prb elevated concentrations of biologically available organic carbon in underlying soils consistent with higher observed doc fig 3 promoting more rapid microbially mediated dissolved oxygen consumption 4 3 comparing a horizontal prb to a denitrifying bioreactor results in this study are consistent in some ways with previous work using bioreactors favorable redox and other conditions may stimulate denitrification in many contexts however in typical denitrifying bioreactors and beds most nitrate removal occurs within the reactive material and hydraulic retention times range from several hours to many days addy et al 2016 warneke et al 2011 in contrast in this study we did not observe nitrate removal within the woodchip prb where residence times were often 1 2 h and always 6 h instead we observed nitrate removal in soils up to 80 cm below the prb fig 3 likely due to more favorable conditions for ambient soil microbes capable of nitrate removal fig 5 denitrifying bioreactors and beds are often used to improve the quality of treated wastewater in which no3 and nh4 along with other constituents are elevated far above drinking water standards these systems can be designed and operated to optimize selected biochemical processes including nuanced controls on fluid flow rate and associated hydraulic retention time during operation in contrast while mar systems can be designed to achieve specific goals for water supply and quality improvement they are influenced strongly by ambient often heterogeneous soil properties rapid infiltration through well drained soils may result in the formation of a thin or no saturated zone below some parts of an infiltration basin limiting opportunities for establishing redox conditions favorable to denitrification the flow rate through a denitrifying bioreactor or bed can be reduced to improve nitrate removal rates but slowing the flow applied to a well drained infiltration basin is likely to result in development of shallow unsaturated conditions virtually ending denitrification until saturated soil conditions are restored this tradeoff emphasizes the importance of considering soil infiltration properties when choosing locations for mar and or designing them with specific infiltration targets 4 4 implications for mar design and operation these results suggest that significant water quality benefit may be achieved by adding a horizontal prb to an mar infiltration basin nitrate removal rates are sensitive to infiltration rate fig 6a and b which varies spatially and temporally during mar mawer et al 2016 racz et al 2011 there is particular potential for a horizontal prb to facilitate nitrate removal benefit when infiltration rates are above the observed threshold in native soils 0 7 0 2 m d at this study s location schmidt et al 2011 and below the threshold for soils below a prb 1 9 m d at this study s location fig 6b mar projects are typically intended to achieve rapid infiltration 0 5 2 m d that maximizes water supply benefit during mar operations at harkins slough for wy2008 mean infiltration rates 0 5 m d were maintained for about a third of the operating season and 0 9 m d for 14 days mean infiltration rates were always 1 9 m d fig 6c during rapid infiltration for test prb1 the average nitrate removal rate was 1 5 g day m2 no3 n if this rate were representative of average conditions throughout an infiltration basin it would be equivalent to 15 kg day ha thus for a 2 5 ha infiltration basin like harkins slough adding a horizontal prb could potentially contribute an additional 37 5 kg of no3 n removal on each day with infiltration rates 0 7 0 2 m d and 1 9 m d for the 14 days with infiltration 0 9 m d at harkins slough in wy2008 this comprises an additional 525 kg of no3 n removal for the 49 days with infiltration 0 5 m d this yields 1840 kg of additional no3 n removal there is considerable spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in hydrologic biogeochemical and microbial conditions during mar so these results need to be considered carefully in assessing how a horizontal prb might best be integrated with mar for improved water quality an additional consideration is the lifespan and maintenance requirements such a system woodchip prbs can provide years of water quality improvements robertson 2010 robertson et al 2008 but aging may reduce denitrification efficiency the speciation of leached carbon from woodchips page et al 2002 and how that speciation may change or diminish over time during mar merits further study it may be efficacious for mar to mix the soil amendment into the substrate directly rather than emplacing it as a distinct layer this approach has the advantage that adding fresh material can be included as part of regular maintenance including sediment scraping and disking that opens up soil pores after operation additional field and lab experiments are underway to evaluate the efficacy of mixing prb materials in with native soil rather than creating a separate layer designing an mar project that removes contaminants as water infiltrates would provide a measure of safety which is especially important when non pristine water sources are collected to augment supplies e g stormwater runoff recycled wastewater installing a prb horizontally in an mar basin has advantages over traditional vertical prbs the horizontal prb has relatively low installation and replacement cost removes nitrate before it reaches an aquifer does not require the presence or detailed knowledge of a hydraulic gradient and works within an mar system that simultaneously increases groundwater supply learning more about linked physical chemical and biological mechanisms by which a prb may enhance the removal of nitrate and other contaminants during mar will increase understanding of subsurface solute and mineral cycling and facilitate projects that improve both water supply and water quality 5 conclusions controlled field based experiments representing infiltration for managed recharge demonstrated that a horizontal prb made of woodchips significantly enhanced nitrate removal during rapid infiltration through shallow soils compared with nitrate removal observed during managed recharge operations without a prb nitrate removal in soils below a prb occurred more consistently and at greater infiltration rates when scaled up this benefit could translate into significant water quality improvement the woodchip prb appeared to create favorable growing conditions for denitrifying microbes that were already present in the soil by providing bioavailable carbon and or thickening the saturated zone using a horizontal prb and considering soil infiltration properties could facilitate the

19364,we present results from field experiments linking hydrology geochemistry and microbiology during infiltration at a field site that is used for managed aquifer recharge mar these experiments measured how a horizontal permeable reactive barrier prb made of woodchips impacted subsurface nitrate removal and microbial ecology concentrations of dissolved organic carbon consistently increased in infiltrating water below the prb but not in un amended native soil the average nitrate removal rate in soils below the prb was 1 5 g m2 day no3 n despite rapid infiltration up to 1 9 m d and a short fluid residence time within the woodchips 6 h in contrast 0 09 g m2 day no3 n was removed on average in native soil residual nitrate in infiltrating water below the prb was enriched in δ15n and δ18o with low and variable isotopic enrichment factors that are consistent with denitrification during rapid infiltration many putative denitrifying bacteria were significantly enhanced in the soil below a prb methylotenera mobilis and genera microbacterium polaromonas and novosphingobium had log2 fold changes of 4 9 5 6 7 2 and 11 8 respectively these bacteria were present before infiltration and were not enhanced in native soil it appears that the woodchip prb contributed to favorable conditions in the underlying soil for enhanced nitrate removal quantitatively shifting soil microbial

contaminant removal valhondo et al 2018 in this study we examined how a horizontal woodchip prb could enhance nitrate removal during rapid infiltration for mar specifically we seek to address the following questions a is denitrification during rapid infiltration enhanced by brief passage through a carbon rich prb b how does infiltration through a prb affect microbial ecology in shallow soils c how might using a horizonal prb improve water quality during mar to address these questions we conducted a novel series of plot scale field experiments to represent shallow soil conditions during infiltration for mar collecting co located and contemporaneous hydrologic geochemical and microbial samples these interdisciplinary experiments were designed to compare nitrate removal processes in native soils to those within and below a horizontal woodchip prb with applications for simultaneously improving groundwater supply and quality via mar 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site field work was completed within the 2 5 ha harkins slough mar infiltration basin in the pajaro valley central coastal california usa fig s1 land use in the pajaro valley is a mix of agricultural urban residential and undeveloped but most groundwater use supports agricultural activities nitrate concentrations in major surface water bodies and groundwater often exceed the u s environmental protection agency s maximum contaminant level of 10 mg l no3 n los huertos et al 2001 pajaro valley water management agency 2016 the experimental site is located on eolian dune and alluvial deposits and shallow soils are characterized as baywood loamy sand typically having 81 sand 16 silt and 2 clay usda 2014 the harkins slough mar system is operated by a local agency that diverts water from a nearby wetland when flows and water quality are sufficiently high diverted water passes through a rapid sand filter before entering the infiltration basin recharged water is subsequently recovered from a network of shallow wells mixed with recycled water tertiary treated and disinfected and groundwater from farther inland and distributed to local customers in lieu of pumping from the regional aquifer earlier studies of the harkins slough mar system examined infiltration dynamics and water quality during infiltration through native soils focusing on the central deeper part of the infiltration basin racz et al 2011 schmidt et al 2011 the experiments presented in this study were located at higher elevation near the edge of the infiltration basin and explored how a prb may stimulate nutrient cycling fig s1 2 2 plot construction and operation we constructed four hand excavated infiltration plots each 1 m2 in area each plot was lined with fiberglass walls caulked at the corners and backed by bentonite fig 1a and b two plots ns1 and ns2 contained only native soil in plots prb1 and prb2 a horizontal prb consisting of a 30 cm thick layer of redwood chips 0 5 2 cm in dimension and rough in shape was installed above native soils woodchips were added to the plots by hand and gently consolidated then covered with a coarse nylon screen held down by washed rounded river rocks to prevent floatation a hose delivered groundwater with elevated no3 to the plots from a nearby well a float switch and solenoid valve controlled water delivery keeping the water level within a limited range fig 1c for each test water infiltrated continuously for 14 15 days we ran four tests in series over a 10 week period experimental plots were designed to represent a small scale mar infiltration basin some lateral infiltration occurs in field scale mar systems bouwer 2002 but a larger fraction of lateral flow was expected to occur below the 1 m2 plots especially near the edges see supporting information accordingly all instruments for subsurface sampling and measurements were installed within the central 0 16 m2 of each plot where flow is dominantly vertical fig 1d all infiltration rate and geochemical load calculations are based on data and samples collected from this region the inflowing water supply was intermittent during test ns2 fig s2 which prevented maintenance of saturated conditions in the shallow soil so we focused on data from ns1 as a no treatment control for comparison with results from tests prb1 and prb2 for each test the float switch was installed high in the plot water level 0 5 m and then lowered water level 0 3 m after a period of initial infiltration we lowered the float switch on day 4 during test prb1 day 7 during test ns1 and day 8 during test prb2 see supporting information for details on plot construction operation and sampling 2 3 sampling soil samples were collected using a hand auger before and after infiltration at 10 20 cm intervals down to 110 cm below plot base cm bpb soil aliquots for microbiological analysis were collected with ethanol rinsed spatulas while experiments were running fluid samples were collected using six piezometers in two nests of three with screen centers at 30 55 and 80 cm bpb additional fluid samples were drawn from within the prb during tests prb1 and prb2 we sampled surface and subsurface water 10 12 times during each test pumping the fluid through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter into acid washed pre rinsed polyethylene and glass bottles samples were put on ice immediately and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 4 infiltration rates we converted absolute pressure at the plot base to water level correcting for local barometric pressure during periods when the solenoid valve was closed every 10 20 min preventing water from flowing into the plot we calculated the bulk infiltration rate as change in water level over time we independently calculated the vertical component of infiltration in the center of the plot with thermal probes installed in the soil this technique uses heat as a tracer to quantify the vertical infiltration rate from the amplitude reduction with depth of periodic temperature fluctuations hatch et al 2006 thermal probes do not provide reliable infiltration data during the first and last few days of each test due to edge effects equivalent to the order of the filter applied to the thermal data 2 3 days thus we focused our analysis on days 4 12 of each test 2 5 soils characterization to determine soil texture splits from pre infiltration

consistent with regional geology and mapped soil units for all soil samples d 10 10 finer was 100 μm and d 50 245 μm toc was 6 and tn was 0 07 by weight for all samples toc and tn did not vary significantly with depth or differ in samples from before and after infiltration table s1 3 2 infiltration sandy soils led to rapid infiltration fig 2 a for test ns1 bulk infiltration rates were relatively stable between 3 7 and 4 5 m d bulk rates were higher and more variable during tests prb1 7 5 19 1 m d and prb2 14 5 21 1 m d it is unlikely that the prb significantly influenced observed infiltration rates beneath the plots because the woodchips were much larger than soil grains infiltration rates were more likely dominated by underlying soil texture with differences in infiltration rates beneath the plots resulting from soil heterogeneity vertical infiltration rates near the plot centers were generally lower than bulk rates 1 1 3 4 m d 1 2 2 6 m d and 2 0 6 0 m d for tests ns1 prb1 and prb2 respectively fig 2b vertical flow rates determined from multiple thermal probes in the same plot were similar fig s4 and were consistent with independent measurements made in the sandiest part of the deeper basin during an earlier study racz et al 2011 the large difference between vertical and total infiltration is to be expected for experimental plots of this size see supporting information the residence time of water within woodchips at the plot center based on vertical infiltration was 2 8 6 0 h for test prb1 and 1 2 3 6 h for test prb2 plot walls surrounding the woodchips limited lateral flow within the prb though any lateral flow in the prb would result in even shorter residence times we lowered plot water levels midway through each test with the intent of slowing infiltration but this had limited influence on infiltration rates fig 2a though bulk infiltration rates slowed immediately after lowering the water level these rates subsequently increased ultimately returning to values observed near the start of each test vertical infiltration rates did not respond significantly to plot water level changes indicating that much of the observed dynamics was associated with lateral flow we surmise that the sustained free water boundary condition inside the plots resulted in formation of a temporary inverted shallow water table in adjacent soils when the water level was abruptly lowered there was likely a transient period of flow towards the plot then downward temporarily reducing bulk infiltration 3 3 water chemistry infiltration rates and soil properties determine the depth extent of soil saturation and pore fluids could be collected only when the piezometers were within saturated zones fig 1 on most days inflowing water had consistent composition 22 25 mg l no3 n 25 29 mg l doc and little to no nitrite or ammonium although inflowing no3 n was relatively constant nitrate load varied as a function of infiltration rate 40 72 g day m2 no3 n for ns1 30 61 g day m2 no3 n for prb1 and 66 104 g day m2 no3 n for test prb2 fig 2c d e the water supply occasionally included a fraction of recycled water readily identified by nh4 n 0 5 mg l and or no2 n 0 25 mg l tables s2 5 data from these days were not used for subsequent analyses all inflowing and subsurface water samples had doc 20 mg l doc generally showed no trend with depth in native soil but increased with depth below each prb fig 3 nitrate removal during test ns1 was inconsistent and modest ranging from 3 6 g n day m2 net addition to 2 7 g n day m2 in total 1 2 g n m2 was removed over 14 days fig 2c during test prb1 there was nitrate removal on days 5 12 peaking at 7 3 g n day m2 on day 5 cumulative removal during test prb1 was 23 1 g n m2 over 15 days fig 2d nitrate removal was less consistent during test prb2 peaking at 3 5 g day m2 and adding to a cumulative removal of 4 9 g n m2 over 15 days fig 2e on days when nitrate removal was observed the largest changes occurred below 30 cm bpb and coincided with small increases in no2 n fig 3 subsurface δ15n and δ18o differed little from surface values on days with no nitrate removal at depth fig 4 a residual nitrate was enriched in δ15n on all four days with measurable nitrate removal and enriched in δ18o relative to surface water on three of those four days fig 4b which is consistent with denitrification böhlke et al 2002 mariotti et al 1988 nitrogen enrichment factors ranged from 1 7 to 21 1 overlapping the range of values reported in agricultural regions 4 to 30 böhlke et al 2002 böttcher et al 1990 oxygen enrichment factors ranged from 3 5 to 2 9 similar to some reported values carrey et al 2013 but higher less negative than others böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 isotopic enrichment factors often exhibit an inverse relationship with denitrification rate mariotti et al 1988 vogel et al 1981 and in the present study rapid infiltration and denitrification corresponded to relatively low enrichment factors 3 4 microbiology soil microbial communities were grouped into four statistically similar sets native soil before infiltration nsb native soil after infiltration nsa prb before infiltration prbb and prb after infiltration prba these sets account for two dominant factors explaining community variance the presence of a prb 30 and sample collection time 20 fig s5a table s7 while sample depth accounted for 5 of the variance compared to other samples many notable clades were enhanced in prba samples many otus enhanced in prba samples have the potential to carry out denitrification fig 5 the otu with the largest increase in relative abundance below the prb was genus novosphingobium present at 14 10 after infiltration and 0 004 0 01 before infiltration a log2 fold change of 11 8 when this genus was proposed the ability to reduce no3 the first step in denitrification was a defining characteristic takeuchi et al 2001 enhanced otus with the potential to reduce no3 no2 and no include methylotenera mobilis with a log2 fold change 4 9 kalyuzhnaya et al 2006 genus microbacterium 5 6 zhou et al 2016 and family methylophilaceae 5 4 lapidus et al 2011 enhanced otus with the potential to reduce no3 no2 and n2o include genera polaromonas 7 2 lycus et al 2017 and microbacterium and family comamonadaceae 4 0 khan et al 2002 these otus were present in samples collected before infiltration and were not significantly enhanced in nsa samples additionally many otus were inhibited in prba samples one putative denitrifying genus streptomyces had a log2 fold change of 2 2 kumon et al 2002 some otus enhanced in prba samples are associated with hydrocarbon degradation as well as nitrate reduction including genera novosphingobium liu 2005 microbacterium and polaromonas and families erythrobacteraceae tonon et al 2014 and comamonadaceae hydrocarbon degradation can occur rapidly under denitrifying conditions hutchins et al 1991 the growth of microbes with the potential for hydrocarbon degradation could signal favorable conditions for denitrification as well furthermore many studies have explored the potential for microbes to co metabolize micropollutants and other contaminants under denitrifying conditions suarez et al 2010 tarlera 2003 and have found that co metabolic processes can be enhanced with the addition of a carbon source li et al 2013 4 discussion and implications 4 1 infiltration rates and nitrate removal to assess the potential benefit of a horizontal prb during mar we compare results from plot scale experiments to those from an earlier study at the same field site that observed nitrate removal during mar operations using native soil without a prb schmidt et al 2011 during mar operations mean infiltration was slower and initial no3 was lower than in the present study nitrate removal during infiltration through native soil occurred only when vertical infiltration rates were 0 7 0 2 m d fig 6 a at higher infiltration rates it was inferred that oxic conditions were maintained throughout the saturated soil limiting redox conditions needed for efficient denitrification schmidt et al 2011 additionally for 12 out of 23 measurements when the vertical infiltration rate was 0 9 m d there was little to no nitrate removal thus having an infiltration rate through native soil below the identified threshold did not guarantee that nitrate removal would occur during mar operations in the present study vertical infiltration rates in native soil were always 0 9 m d and limited nitrate removal occurred consistent with earlier work however during tests prb1 and prb2 nitrate removal occurred on every day with an infiltration rate 1 9 m d fig 6b a much higher threshold and a more consistent pattern than observed in native soil no nitrate removal occurred at infiltration rates 1 9 m d in the present study even when water passed through a prb although a prb may extend the range of infiltration rates during which subsurface nitrate removal can occur the process is still flow rate limited we did not observe infiltration rates 1 3 m d in the present study but given that a woodchip prb helped to stimulate denitrification in sandy soils at rapid infiltration rates it seems likely that the benefit from a prb would extend to soils with lower infiltration capacities as well additional work at lower fluid flow rates would be useful especially to determine whether the inverse relationship observed between infiltration rate and nitrate removal rate below a prb fig 6b is a consequence of the high infiltration rates near the threshold or a consistent behavior across a typical range of mar infiltration rates 0 5 2 m d other factors also influence nitrate removal including carbon nitrate availability redox conditions temperature and soil properties separating these effects will require carefully controlled experiments with a wide range of fluid and soil conditions and flow rates 4 2 linking geochemistry and microbiology isotopic and microbial data provide consistent strong evidence that nitrate removal occurred via denitrification in soils below a prb pore fluid nitrate in these soils was enriched in δ15n and δ18o relative to surface water on days with nitrate removal a pattern consistent with denitrification during rapid infiltration mariotti et al 1988 significantly enhanced otus below the prb contained putative functionality for complete denitrification and the abundance of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria may further indicate that conditions were favorable for denitrification hutchins et al 1991 however we cannot eliminate the possibility that anammox occurred in these soils as well on some days during tests ns1 prb1 and prb2 ammonium appeared in the subsurface at 6 mg l but nh4 was inconsistent and not correlated with nitrate removal tables s2 s5 anammox has also been observed during managed recharge fox 2001 and is often identified and distinguished from denitrification by quantification of genes hzo or hzsa via qpcr or using isotopic tracers in n2 gas jones et al 2017 rysgaard 2004 ongoing work will use qpcr to quantify nitrogen cycling genes with depth and time below a prb relative to native soil in soils below a prb no3 decreased with depth fig 3 depth was also an important factor in explaining community variance for prba samples fig s5b putative nitrate reducing otus ranged from having a total relative abundance in prba samples of 16 6 58 3 the relative abundance of putative nitrate reducers was greatest in the shallowest samples 10 cm bpb and decreased with depth this pattern is consistent with the trend of decreasing no3 with depth fig 7 most otus that were enhanced in prba samples were present before infiltration thus it appears unlikely that woodchips merely transported foreign bacteria to the underlying soil rather woodchips seem to have contributed to more favorable metabolic and growth conditions for native soil microbes that were already present there are several possible mechanisms by which a prb might stimulate denitrification the high porosity and large surface area of woodchips might provide microbial habitat but that does not account for nitrate removal and enhanced otus occurring in soils below the prb the placement of a prb could enhance denitrification by thickening the saturated zone increasing residence time within the saturated zone leading to lower oxygen and other favorable redox conditions at an equivalent soil depth the most likely explanation is that the prb elevated concentrations of biologically available organic carbon in underlying soils consistent with higher observed doc fig 3 promoting more rapid microbially mediated dissolved oxygen consumption 4 3 comparing a horizontal prb to a denitrifying bioreactor results in this study are consistent in some ways with previous work using bioreactors favorable redox and other conditions may stimulate denitrification in many contexts however in typical denitrifying bioreactors and beds most nitrate removal occurs within the reactive material and hydraulic retention times range from several hours to many days addy et al 2016 warneke et al 2011 in contrast in this study we did not observe nitrate removal within the woodchip prb where residence times were often 1 2 h and always 6 h instead we observed nitrate removal in soils up to 80 cm below the prb fig 3 likely due to more favorable conditions for ambient soil microbes capable of nitrate removal fig 5 denitrifying bioreactors and beds are often used to improve the quality of treated wastewater in which no3 and nh4 along with other constituents are elevated far above drinking water standards these systems can be designed and operated to optimize selected biochemical processes including nuanced controls on fluid flow rate and associated hydraulic retention time during operation in contrast while mar systems can be designed to achieve specific goals for water supply and quality improvement they are influenced strongly by ambient often heterogeneous soil properties rapid infiltration through well drained soils may result in the formation of a thin or no saturated zone below some parts of an infiltration basin limiting opportunities for establishing redox conditions favorable to denitrification the flow rate through a denitrifying bioreactor or bed can be reduced to improve nitrate removal rates but slowing the flow applied to a well drained infiltration basin is likely to result in development of shallow unsaturated conditions virtually ending denitrification until saturated soil conditions are restored this tradeoff emphasizes the importance of considering soil infiltration properties when choosing locations for mar and or designing them with specific infiltration targets 4 4 implications for mar design and operation these results suggest that significant water quality benefit may be achieved by adding a horizontal prb to an mar infiltration basin nitrate removal rates are sensitive to infiltration rate fig 6a and b which varies spatially and temporally during mar mawer et al 2016 racz et al 2011 there is particular potential for a horizontal prb to facilitate nitrate removal benefit when infiltration rates are above the observed threshold in native soils 0 7 0 2 m d at this study s location schmidt et al 2011 and below the threshold for soils below a prb 1 9 m d at this study s location fig 6b mar projects are typically intended to achieve rapid infiltration 0 5 2 m d that maximizes water supply benefit during mar operations at harkins slough for wy2008 mean infiltration rates 0 5 m d were maintained for about a third of the operating season and 0 9 m d for 14 days mean infiltration rates were always 1 9 m d fig 6c during rapid infiltration for test prb1 the average nitrate removal rate was 1 5 g day m2 no3 n if this rate were representative of average conditions throughout an infiltration basin it would be equivalent to 15 kg day ha thus for a 2 5 ha infiltration basin like harkins slough adding a horizontal prb could potentially contribute an additional 37 5 kg of no3 n removal on each day with infiltration rates 0 7 0 2 m d and 1 9 m d for the 14 days with infiltration 0 9 m d at harkins slough in wy2008 this comprises an additional 525 kg of no3 n removal for the 49 days with infiltration 0 5 m d this yields 1840 kg of additional no3 n removal there is considerable spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in hydrologic biogeochemical and microbial conditions during mar so these results need to be considered carefully in assessing how a horizontal prb might best be integrated with mar for improved water quality an additional consideration is the lifespan and maintenance requirements such a system woodchip prbs can provide years of water quality improvements robertson 2010 robertson et al 2008 but aging may reduce denitrification efficiency the speciation of leached carbon from woodchips page et al 2002 and how that speciation may change or diminish over time during mar merits further study it may be efficacious for mar to mix the soil amendment into the substrate directly rather than emplacing it as a distinct layer this approach has the advantage that adding fresh material can be included as part of regular maintenance including sediment scraping and disking that opens up soil pores after operation additional field and lab experiments are underway to evaluate the efficacy of mixing prb materials in with native soil rather than creating a separate layer designing an mar project that removes contaminants as water infiltrates would provide a measure of safety which is especially important when non pristine water sources are collected to augment supplies e g stormwater runoff recycled wastewater installing a prb horizontally in an mar basin has advantages over traditional vertical prbs the horizontal prb has relatively low installation and replacement cost removes nitrate before it reaches an aquifer does not require the presence or detailed knowledge of a hydraulic gradient and works within an mar system that simultaneously increases groundwater supply learning more about linked physical chemical and biological mechanisms by which a prb may enhance the removal of nitrate and other contaminants during mar will increase understanding of subsurface solute and mineral cycling and facilitate projects that improve both water supply and water quality 5 conclusions controlled field based experiments representing infiltration for managed recharge demonstrated that a horizontal prb made of woodchips significantly enhanced nitrate removal during rapid infiltration through shallow soils compared with nitrate removal observed during managed recharge operations without a prb nitrate removal in soils below a prb occurred more consistently and at greater infiltration rates when scaled up this benefit could translate into significant water quality improvement the woodchip prb appeared to create favorable growing conditions for denitrifying microbes that were already present in the soil by providing bioavailable carbon and or thickening the saturated zone using a horizontal prb and considering soil infiltration properties could facilitate the
