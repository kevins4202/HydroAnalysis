15690,as an emerging pollutant microplastics mps may interact with dissolved organic matter dom which is prevalent in the aqueous environment meanwhile the aging of mps in the actual environment increases the uncertainty of their environmental fate here the interaction mechanisms between pristine and aged polypropylene microplastics pp mps and humic acid ha at ph 7 0 were explored microstructural changes of ha were examined by fluorescence and fourier transformation infrared ft ir spectroscopy atomic force microscopy coupled with infrared afm ir and micro raman techniques were used to characterize and analyze the interacted pp mps the addition of ha increased the surface roughness of both pristine and aged pp mps results of afm ir and raman spectra showed that the interaction of pp mps with ha accelerated their surface oxidation and enhanced the characteristic signals xps spectra showed that the oxygen content ratio of pristine and aged pp mps increased by 0 95 and 1 48 after the addition of ha respectively pp mps after aging interacted more strongly with ha and there was a higher affinity between them two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos combined with ft ir spectra further elucidated the interaction mechanism at the molecular level this work will help to evaluate the environmental impact of mps in ecosystems and understand their interactions with dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics dom afm ir 2d cos micro raman 1 introduction since its invention in 1907 plastic has gradually become a global environmental problem due to its high durability and the improper disposal of plastic waste jambeck jenna et al 2015 luo et al 2022c in the actual environment due to a series of natural factors ultraviolet light temperature chemical oxidation etc these large plastics gradually break down into plastic particles less than 5 mm in size called microplastics mps shan et al 2022 thompson richard et al 2004 in recent years mps have received a great deal of attention from a large number of scientists as an emerging contaminant fajardo et al 2022 law kara and thompson richard 2014 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 however there are currently few studies on the interaction between mps and natural organic matter abdurahman et al 2020 chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 exploring the interaction mechanism of mps with natural organic matter is crucial for understanding the morphology and migration of mps and assessing the impact of mps on ecosystems particularly most mps in the actual environment undergo extensive aging due to uv radiation biodegradation and chemical oxidation duan et al 2021 liu et al 2020 it is also of great practical significance to investigate the interaction between aged mps and natural organic matter dissolved organic matter dom refers to the heterogeneous mixture existing in soil and water which is composed of a series of macromolecules with different molecular weight and structures polysaccharides amino acids peptides proteins etc and can pass through 0 45 μm filter membrane including humic acid fulvic acid various hydrophilic organic acids nucleic acids and surfactants abdurahman et al 2020 ding et al 2022 dom in water often exists in three forms dissolved state colloidal state and semi colloidal state which is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment wells and stretz 2019 various functional groups of dom can provide binding sites for metals nanoparticles and other organic pollutants chen et al 2017 sun et al 2017 mps in aquatic environments will inevitably interact with dom and thus alter the morphology transport ecotoxicity and bioavailability of mps chen et al 2018 schmidt et al 2011 humic acid ha as a representative substance of dom plays an important role in revealing the interaction between dom and mps and the dynamics of organic carbon chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 previous studies have demonstrated that there is an interfacial interaction between pristine mps and dom abdurahman et al 2020 ding et al 2022 but most mps exposed to the actual environment experience varying degrees of aging physicochemical properties adsorption characteristics and surface functional groups of the aged mps are greatly changed sun et al 2020 it is meaningful to explore whether aged mps will exhibit different effects after interacting with dom as compared to pristine mps additionally the characterization methods fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy etc adopted in previous studies are difficult to intuitively track the microstructure and functional group variations of mps upon the interaction chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 in the present study atomic force microscopy coupled with infrared spectroscopy afm ir and micro raman spectroscopy was used to elucidate the interaction mechanism between mps and dom at the molecular level afm ir and micro raman spectroscopy is powerful tools for exploring the chemical structure of substances and have been employed for characterization and analysis of mps luo et al 2020a 2021c in this study two different polypropylene microplastics pp mps pristine and aged were selected as representatives to study the interaction between pp mps and ha under neutral conditions the structural changes of ha during the interaction were analyzed by fluorescence and fourier transformation infrared ft ir spectroscopy changes in physicochemical properties of pp mps were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem ft ir afm ir micro raman spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the interaction mechanism between pp mps and ha was further elucidated by two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos at the molecular level results of this study contribute to understanding the environmental behavior of dom and assessing the environmental impact of mps in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polypropylene microplastics pp mps with the average size of 500 μm were purchased from zhonglian plastic chemical technology dongguan china commercial ha was purchased from sigma aldrich usa and purified by the previously determined method prior to use chen et al 2015 in short the pristine ha was dissolved in 0 1 m naoh solution and then filtered through 0 45 μm membrane the filtrate was acidified to ph 1 0 with 1 m hcl and the precipitates were collected by filtration washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized water and finally freeze dried the purified ha sample was dissolved to 50 mg l as a stock solution ph 7 0 2 2 aging treatment of mps photo aging experiments of pp mps were performed by exposing approximately 50 g of the as prepared samples in a xenon lamp weathering test chamber zh xd 150 sailham equipment china the samples were aged in the air and the conditions of photo aging were described as follows temperature 60 c humidity 70 light irradiance 1000 w m 2 it has been reported that the average temperature in hangzhou city is about 18 c the humidity is 70 and the light irradiance in midsummer is 350 w m 2 for full spectral range of 300 800 nm luo et al 2021b 2021c pp mps were removed from the chamber after three months of aging treatment and the samples were then washed several times with deionized water filtered and dried for subsequent characterization 2 3 interaction experiments a series of mixed samples containing mps and ha were prepared by mixing appropriate amount of pristine and aged pp mps particles 0 200 mg with 10 ml aliquots of ha stock solution respectively deionized water was added to the mixed solution to make a final volume of 20 ml and the mixed solution was fine tuned using 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution to stabilize the ph of the solution at about 7 0 all samples were shaken for one week at 150 rpm on a horizontal shaker at 25 c to ensure interaction equilibrium two 5 ml supernatants of each sample were taken for ft ir and fluorescence spectrum analysis all supernatants were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane to remove impurities for ft ir measurements the extracted supernatant was freeze dried and mixed with 50 mg kbr powders ir grade for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem landscape of each sample was recorded using a rf 6000 fluorescence spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the excitation and emission scanning ranges were 240 600 nm at an increment of 5 0 nm and 211 618 nm at an increment of 2 0 nm respectively excitation and emission slit widths were set to 5 0 nm and the scan speed was 2000 nm min 1 the remaining solution was filtered through a 200 mesh sieve and the obtained pp mps particles were washed with deionized water for further characterization and analysis a background solution containing 200 mg of pp mps without ha was prepared using the same procedure and its spectrum was measured as a control group to investigate the adsorption behavior of ha on pp mps batch adsorption experiments of ha onto pristine and aged pp mps were performed as detailed in the supporting information text s1 2 4 characterization of mps four different pp mps were characterized 1 unaged pp mps before interaction with ha upp bha 2 unaged pp mps after interaction with ha upp aha 3 aged pp mps before interaction with ha app bha 4 aged pp mps after interaction with ha app aha surface morphology of mps was characterized by sem zeiss sigma 300 surface functional groups of mps were determined by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer shimadzu tracer 100 japan which was recorded in the 4000 400 cm 1 region with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the c and o elements of mps were analyzed by xps thermo scientific k alpha raman spectra of mps were recorded on a labram hr evolution raman spectrometer horiba scientific france in the range of 50 4000 cm 1 and data analysis was conducted by a labspec6 software the grating was set to 600 nm and a 785 nm diode laser was used raman mapping of mps was performed on a test area of 80 μm 80 μm using the integrated area of 780 1600 cm 1 for pp mps afm topographical imaging was carried out by a nanoir2 afm ir instrument equipped with contact mode nir2 probe anasys instrument inc version 3 15 usa detailed methods of afm ir spectra are described in previous studies luo et al 2021b 2 5 2d cos analyses due to the non uniformity of binding groups between dom and mps the application of conventional models or methods is limited 2d cos analysis was used to reveal the subtle changes in the infrared spectra of pp mps after interacting with ha 2d cos applies a continuous external disturbance time temperature concentration etc to the system collects a series of spectral variation characteristics in the disturbance and carries out correlation analysis in this study the concentration of pp mps was defined as an external disturbance of the system and the 2d cos spectra were obtained according to previous procedures chen et al 2014 luo et al 2022a typically the procedure generates two types of two dimensional maps called synchronous and asynchronous maps which are obtained using an open access software 2d shige version 1 3 kwansei gakuin university japan the principles of 2d cos analysis are described in detail elsewhere and the explanation is based entirely on noda s rules lasch and noda 2019 briefly synchronous spectrum φ x1 x2 consists of auto peaks and cross peaks representing the simultaneous changes of spectral intensities observed at two different wavenumbers x1 and x2 along the perturbation variable tk auto peaks are distributed along the main diagonal of the spectrum the positive sign of the cross peaks φ x1 x2 indicates that the change directions of x1 and x2 are the same and the negative sign indicates that the change directions are opposite asynchronous spectrum ψ x1 x2 only consists of cross peaks located at off diagonal positions when the signs of φ x1 x2 and ψ x1 x2 are the same in both types of maps the change of signal strength at x1 precedes that at x2 but when the signs of φ x1 x2 and ψ x1 x2 are opposite the change of signal strength at x2 precedes that at x1 3 results 3 1 fluorescence eems of ha without fluorescence signal from pp mps the fluorescence eems of ha revealed that the ex em peaks of ha are concentrated at 530 450 nm and 505 385 nm regardless of the addition of pristine or aged pp mps fig 1 for the ha with the addition of pristine pp mps fig 1a f the fluorescence peak intensity under different mps concentrations 0 200 mg at 535 450 nm reached 3650 4185 4396 4420 4423 and 4418 respectively the intensity of the fluorescence peak enhanced with the increasing concentration of pp mps and then remained constant when the amount of pp mps increased to 120 mg in contrast to the ha reacted with pristine mps the ha reacted with aged mps fig 1g l had higher peak intensity of humic like fractions at 535 450 nm fluorescence intensity was 3642 4235 4341 4654 4675 and 4382 respectively 3 2 ft ir spectra of ha and 2d cos analysis to explore the structural variation caused by the interaction between ha and pp mps ft ir spectra were used to monitor the changes of functional groups in the process fig 2 four main sharp peaks were identified from the ft ir spectra after interaction with pristine and aged pp mps which were centered at 834 1380 1620 and 3450 cm 1 respectively the ir spectra did not change significantly in the ha with the addition of pristine pp mps fig 2a indicating that the structure of ha was insensitive to the pristine pp mps compared to the ha with pristine pp mps the ir spectral peak intensity of the ha with aged pp mps changed obviously fig 2b the intensity of the characteristic peak of ha at 1250 1700 cm 1 showed an overall decreasing trend as the concentration of pp mps increased however the intensity of the characteristic peak was slightly enhanced when the mass of pp mps was increased to 200 mg in order to further clarify the effect of the concentration change of pp mps on the structure variation sequence of each functional group of ha 2d cos analysis was performed on ft ir spectra at ph 7 0 in the spectral range of 744 4000 cm 1 fig 3 for the ha interaction with pristine pp mps five major auto peaks were observed at 835 936 1608 2336 and 3392 cm 1 in the synchronous map along the diagonal line fig 3a except the cross peaks at 936 and 2336 cm 1 other cross peaks in synchronous maps were all positive table 1 furthermore the asynchronous map revealed the sequential changes in the ft ir spectra of ha with increasing concentrations of pp mps fig 3b the 2d ir cos maps of ha after interacting with aged pp mps fig 3c and d did not change significantly suggesting that aging of mps could not affect the sequence of structural changes in ha 3 3 sem and 3 d images of pp mps sem images of unaged and aged pp mps before and after the interaction revealed the changes in surface morphology fig 4 for the pristine pp mps without interaction with ha the surface was relatively flat and smooth fig 4a in contrast the surface of the pristine pp mps after the reaction with ha became rough and some grooves appeared fig 4b in addition the surface of the aged pp mps was very rough and laminar structure appeared fig 4c the surface roughness of aged pp mps was rougher after the interaction with ha and more cracks and grooves appeared on the surface fig 4d it can be concluded that the order of surface roughness of pp mps is app aha app bha upp aha upp bha to further understand the changes in the surface morphology of pp mps and the distribution of functional groups three dimensional 3 d images of pp mps based on topographical images and afm ir images were integrated fig 5 the 3 d image was exported by the analysis studio software and integrated by topographical images and afm ir images the surface of pristine pp mps without ha reaction was relatively flat and the signal intensity of functional groups was low fig 5a however after the reaction with ha the surface of pristine pp mps became rough and the functional group signal was enhanced fig 5b furthermore the surface of aged pp mps before ha reaction was more uneven and the signal of functional groups was more intense fig 5c in contrast the surface of aged pp mps after ha reaction was rougher and the red color covered almost the entire surface of mps indicating the appearance of more functional groups fig 5d 3 4 topographical imaging afm ir spectroscopy and afm ir imaging of pp mps in the present study three independent points on the topographical images of pp mps were examined and their average spectra were normalized the absorption peak located at 1720 cm 1 belonged to the stretching vibration of c o carbonyl bond and the brightness on these images represented the signal intensity of this functional group fig 6 as can be seen the surface of unaged pp mps without ha reaction was smooth and the height range of mps was about 800 nm fig 6a the carbonyl signal was weak and unevenly distributed as displayed in the afm ir images fig 6a the afm ir and ft ir spectra showed three major sharp peaks of pp mps which were centered at 2928 1465 and 1377 cm 1 respectively fig 6a and fig s1a the upp aha displayed greater surface roughness and more carbonyl signal fig 6b this was evidenced by the xps spectra of pp mps fig s2a and b table s1 which showed the appearance of o1s peaks after reaction with ha and indicated an increase in oxygen containing functional groups in addition the peak positions in the afm ir spectra and ft ir spectra did not change significantly but the peak intensities decreased slightly fig 6b and fig s1b aged pp mps exhibited different afm ir results the aged pp mps without ha reaction had fewer bright white areas i e fewer convex surfaces in the topographical image compared to unaged pp mps which indicated more coarsening fig 6c the afm ir image implied the significant surface oxidation of pp mps particles fig 6c in addition to the previously existing sharp peak an obvious c o peak 1720 cm 1 appeared in the afm ir spectra which was consistent with the findings in the afm ir images fig 6c the aged pp mps after ha reaction had the roughest surface and strongest yellow signal i e c o stretching vibration fig 6d moreover the carbonyl peak became more intense fig 6d fig s1c and d similarly a more intense o1s signal was observed fig s2c and d table s1 with o1s peak intensities in the order of app aha 3 87 app bha 2 39 upp aha 0 95 upp bha 0 3 5 raman spectra and raman mapping of pp mps the raman peaks of pp mps samples in the range of 700 1500 cm 1 were centered at 834 1130 1157 and 1454 cm 1 fig 7 raman mapping images of pp mps were obtained in the raman shift range of 780 1600 cm 1 by selecting a test area of 80 μm 80 μm under the raman microscope with 81 randomly selected sampling points fig 8 for unaged pp mps there was a slight enhancement of the characteristic signal before and after the interaction with ha fig 8a and b however for aged pp mps the addition of ha under the same conditions greatly enhanced the characteristic signal of pp mps fig 8c and d in addition it can be seen from the mapping images that the distribution of functional groups on the surface of mps was uneven regardless of aging or reaction with ha fig 8 this may be related to the change of the surface roughness of pp mps 4 discussion the literatures have shown extensive research on knowledge related to the interaction of pristine mps with dom abdurahman et al 2020 chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 so far there are few studies evaluating the influence of aging on the interaction between mps and dom in the actual environment most mps will undergo extensive aging and dom is a soluble organic substance widely existing in aquatic and terrestrial environments chen et al 2017 luo et al 2022c this study focused on elucidating the interaction mechanism between pristine aged pp mps and ha the high concentration of pp mps induced the changes in the fluorescent components of ha and the changes of the fluorescent components were more significant when aged pp mps participated in the reaction fig 1 this may be due to the formation of highly conjugated co polymers with increased electron density after the interaction of pp mps with the aromatic structure of dom through π π conjugation chen et al 2018 photo labile property of protein like fluorophores has been previously reported for aquatic dom phong and hur 2015 the peak intensity tended to decrease after reaching the maximum with the addition of 160 mg of aged pp mps fig 1 g l which might be due to the partial degradation of ha lee et al 2021 romera castillo et al 2018 the structural variation caused by the interaction between ha and pp mps and the effect of the concentration change of pp mps on the structure variation sequence of each functional group of ha were determined by ft ir and 2d cos analysis fig 2 and fig 3 the band at 834 cm 1 was associated with the aromatic hydrogen out of plane bending vibration luo et al 2021a while the band at 1380 cm 1 represented the bending vibration or symmetric stretching vibration of nitro compound n o or the co stretching or oh deformation of carboxylic acid groups ding et al 2022 li et al 2017 luo et al 2022a the peak at 1620 cm 1 corresponded to the nh bending vibration of amine or amide luo et al 2021a while the peak at 3450 cm 1 was ascribed to the oh stretching of carboxylic acids phenols and alcohols ding et al 2022 tremblay et al 2011 the physicochemical properties of aged pp mps were unstable which led to ha dissociation and exposure of more functional groups chen et al 2014 luo et al 2022c thus it is not difficult to explain that the structure of ha was insensitive to pristine pp mps but the ir spectral peak intensity of the ha with aged pp mps changed obviously 2d cos is an effective tool for analyzing subtle changes in ft ir spectra which can help to clarify the interaction mechanism between pp mps and ha at the molecular level chen et al 2019 noda 2016 park et al 2016 according to noda s rule and the analysis in table 1 luo et al 2022b noda et al 2000 the sequence of band variation followed the order of 1608 3392 2336 936 835 cm 1 this indicated that with the increase of pp mps concentration the structural change order of ha was alkene c c or amine amide n h carboxylic acids phenols and alcohols o h aromatic rings c h alkene c h aromatic hydrogen ch the alkene c c or amine amide nh in ha was the most sensitive to concentration changes in pristine and aged pp mps and the saturated bonds were more sensitive than the unsaturated bonds it has been reported that the surface roughness of mps increases in the presence of ha and is related to the size of mps chen et al 2018 researchers also demonstrated that it is mainly the oxygen containing functional groups from carboxylate phenolic and aliphatic groups that play an important role in changing the surface morphology of mps ding et al 2022 additionally our previous studies have demonstrated the increase in specific surface area and surface roughness of aged mps luo et al 2020c it can be deduced that the surface morphology of aged mps changes further after the addition of ha and changes more drastically compared to the pristine mps in the present study the sem images showed that the aged pp mps developed larger cracks and grooves after interacting with ha and even a layered structure appeared which was consistent with the expectation fig 4 studies have also shown that reaction with ha contributes to the aging of mps to some extent ding et al 2022 the combination of atomic force microscopy and ir spectroscopy not only provides nanometer resolution images but also determines the chemical composition of the object luo et al 2020b shim et al 2017 in the 3 d images exported by the analysis studio software not only the same results as sem images were obtained but we found that ha also induced an enhancement of the functional group signal of pp mps fig 5 this enhancement may be related to the increase of oxygen containing functional groups luo et al 2020b therefore in order to obtain the chemical composition and distribution of mps more accurately the topographical images and afm ir images of pp mps at peak 1720 cm 1 were analyzed the application of afm ir opens up new opportunities for the characterization of mps which not only enables the identification and imaging of the chemical composition of mps but also requires only relatively simple sample pre treatment chen et al 2020 meyns et al 2019 it should be emphasized that peak tracking errors as well as cantilever beam damage or wear during afm ir imaging may produce artifacts especially in fast scan mode chen et al 2020 after comparing the afm ir and ft ir spectra fig 6 and fig s1 we found that the analyses of the two spectra were basically consistent but the positions of some peaks were slightly shifted probably due to differences in hardware and laser settings van eerdenbrugh et al 2012 the peak at 2928 cm 1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of ch2 bond while the peaks at 1465 and 1377 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetric bending vibration of ch3 bond jeyavani et al 2022 luo et al 2021b for app aha the large increase in c o groups indicated that the addition of ha promoted the surface oxidation of pp mps which might be due to the oxidation of ch bonds to c o bonds in pp mps luo et al 2020b interestingly the peak positions in the afm ir spectra and ft ir spectra did not change significantly after the addition of ha but the peak intensities decreased slightly initially we speculated that this may be because the mps adsorbed with ha resulted in the weakening of functional group signals however it was found that no adsorption occurred between pp mps and ha after batch adsorption experiments were performed fig s3 which seems contrary to the study by other researchers abdurahman et al 2020 previous investigations showed that the adsorption of two doms on ps mps was low ph dependent and related to ionic strength and site energy moreover the environmental behaviors of ps mps would be influenced by the amount and the type of dom as well as solution chemistry abdurahman et al 2020 furthermore other studies suggested that hydrophobic hydrogen bond and n π electron donor acceptor eda interactions may play a role in the adsorption of ha on mps however the adsorption of ha on both pristine and aged pp mps is a multi layer process attributed to physical adsorption moreover n π eda interaction between pp mps and ha does not exist due to simple structure of pp mps which just involves ch3 and ch2 fig 6 so the adsorption of ha on pp mps is poor song et al 2022 it can be considered that the pp mps and dom types selected in the present study and the reaction environment did not result in a good adsorption effect between pp mps and ha of course this is not to say that the adsorption results are meaningless which allow us to rule out the possibility of c o groups supplemented by adsorption of ha onto pp mps both raman and ft ir spectroscopy have the advantages of non destructive analysis low sample amounts and environmental friendliness however the better spatial resolution narrower spectral band wider spectral coverage and lower water interference of raman spectroscopy are not available in ft ir spectroscopy araujo et al 2018 sobhani et al 2019 regardless of the unaged or aged mps only the raman peak intensity increased during the reaction and the main structure of pp mps did not change which may be limited by the oxygen diffusion in the polymer luo et al 2020a ter halle et al 2017 in particular the raman peak at 1454 cm 1 was attributed to ch2 bending vibrations or ch3 asymmetric bending vibrations which was often considered to be the characteristic peak of pp mps fig 7 the bands at 834 and 1157 cm 1 were assigned to cc stretching vibrations and ch3 bending vibrations while the peak at 1130 cm 1 was assigned to the ch stretching vibrations ch2 wagging vibrations and ch3 bending vibrations guo et al 2019 in the raman mapping images the characteristic signal of ha addition was greatly enhanced in aged pp mps compared to unaged pp mps under the same conditions fig 8 this observation was consistent with the results of afm ir raman devices use a laser as light source which may lead to sample heating and occasionally to background emission and even to polymer degradation araujo et al 2018 however we use the latest analysis software and calibrate the system before each sample test during the raman mapping process enough mapping test points 81 test points are selected under a large enough test area 80 μm 80 μm and the scanning time 10 s of each test point is short enough so the error caused by the instrument can be avoided all the above results contribute to a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between pp mps and ha further demonstrating that aging of mps makes the interaction more intense it is necessary to be cautious in drawing any general conclusions regarding the environmental behavior and ecological risks of mps obviously the pp mps and ha selected in this study cannot represent all polymers and doms nevertheless the present study provides a new perspective on the interaction processes and mechanisms between mps and doms the combination of weathering forces as the main influencing factor with advanced characterization methods will help to better understand the fate behavior and risk of mps 5 conclusions mps are ubiquitous in the environment and most mps undergo extensive aging in order to better understand the interaction mechanism between mps and dom in the natural environment pp mps and ha were selected as representatives in this study pp mps mainly interacted with the aromatic structure of ha and the ft ir characteristic peak of ha interacting with aged pp mps changed more obviously the 2d cos results displayed that the structural change order of ha was alkene c c or amine amide n h carboxylic acids phenols and alcohols o h aromatic rings c h alkene c h aromatic hydrogen ch from the sem and 3 d images it can be seen that the surface roughness of pp mps before and after the interaction changed significantly aged pp mps had the roughest surface after reacting with ha spectroscopic results showed that the addition of ha induced the increase of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pp mps and the afm ir signal of aged mps was much stronger than that of unaged mps both afm ir and micro raman results revealed more intense interactions between aged mps and dom these findings provide a comprehensive explanation of the interaction between mps and dom present in the actual environment

problem due to its high durability and the improper disposal of plastic waste jambeck jenna et al 2015 luo et al 2022c in the actual environment due to a series of natural factors ultraviolet light temperature chemical oxidation etc these large plastics gradually break down into plastic particles less than 5 mm in size called microplastics mps shan et al 2022 thompson richard et al 2004 in recent years mps have received a great deal of attention from a large number of scientists as an emerging contaminant fajardo et al 2022 law kara and thompson richard 2014 liu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 however there are currently few studies on the interaction between mps and natural organic matter abdurahman et al 2020 chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 exploring the interaction mechanism of mps with natural organic matter is crucial for understanding the morphology and migration of mps and assessing the impact of mps on ecosystems particularly most mps in the actual environment undergo extensive aging due to uv radiation biodegradation and chemical oxidation duan et al 2021 liu et al 2020 it is also of great practical significance to investigate the interaction between aged mps and natural

an important role in revealing the interaction between dom and mps and the dynamics of organic carbon chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 previous studies have demonstrated that there is an interfacial interaction between pristine mps and dom abdurahman et al 2020 ding et al 2022 but most mps exposed to the actual environment experience varying degrees of aging physicochemical properties adsorption characteristics and surface functional groups of the aged mps are greatly changed sun et al 2020 it is meaningful to explore whether aged mps will exhibit different effects after interacting with dom as compared to pristine mps additionally the characterization methods fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy etc adopted in previous studies are difficult to intuitively track the microstructure and functional group variations of mps upon the interaction chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 in the present study atomic force microscopy coupled with infrared spectroscopy afm ir and micro raman spectroscopy was used to elucidate the interaction mechanism between mps and dom at the molecular level afm ir and micro raman spectroscopy is powerful tools for exploring the chemical structure of substances and have been employed for characterization and analysis of mps luo et al 2020a 2021c in this study two different polypropylene microplastics pp mps pristine and aged were selected as representatives to study the interaction between pp mps and ha under neutral conditions the structural changes of ha during the interaction were analyzed by fluorescence and fourier transformation infrared ft ir spectroscopy changes in physicochemical properties of pp mps were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem ft ir afm ir micro raman spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the interaction mechanism between pp mps and ha was further elucidated by two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos at the molecular level results of this study contribute to understanding the environmental behavior of dom and assessing the environmental impact of mps in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polypropylene microplastics pp mps with the average size of 500 μm were purchased from zhonglian plastic chemical technology dongguan china commercial ha was purchased from sigma aldrich usa and purified by the previously determined method prior to use chen et al 2015 in short the pristine ha was dissolved in 0 1 m naoh solution and then filtered through 0 45 μm membrane the filtrate was acidified to ph 1 0 with 1 m hcl and the precipitates were collected by filtration washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized water and finally freeze dried the purified ha sample was dissolved to 50 mg l as a stock solution ph 7 0 2 2 aging treatment of mps photo aging experiments of pp mps were performed by exposing approximately 50 g of the as prepared samples in a xenon lamp weathering test chamber zh xd 150 sailham equipment china the samples were aged in the air and the conditions of photo aging were described as follows temperature 60 c humidity 70 light irradiance 1000 w m 2 it has been reported that the average temperature in hangzhou city is about 18 c the humidity is 70 and the light irradiance in midsummer is 350 w m 2 for full spectral range of 300 800 nm luo et al 2021b 2021c pp mps were removed from the chamber after three months of aging treatment and the samples were then washed several times with deionized water filtered and dried for subsequent characterization 2 3 interaction experiments a series of mixed samples containing mps and ha were prepared by mixing appropriate amount of pristine and aged pp mps particles 0 200 mg with 10 ml aliquots of ha stock solution respectively deionized water was added to the mixed solution to make a final volume of 20 ml and the mixed solution was fine tuned using 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution to stabilize the ph of the solution at about 7 0 all samples were shaken for one week at 150 rpm on a horizontal shaker at 25 c to ensure interaction equilibrium two 5 ml supernatants of each sample were taken for ft ir and fluorescence spectrum analysis all supernatants were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane to remove impurities for ft ir measurements the extracted supernatant was freeze dried and mixed with 50 mg kbr powders ir grade for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem landscape of each sample was recorded using a rf 6000 fluorescence spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the excitation and emission scanning ranges were 240 600 nm at an increment of 5 0 nm and 211 618 nm at an increment of 2 0 nm respectively excitation and emission slit widths were set to 5 0 nm and the scan speed was 2000 nm min 1 the remaining solution was filtered through a 200 mesh sieve and the obtained pp mps particles were washed with deionized water for further characterization and analysis a background solution containing 200 mg of pp mps without ha was prepared using the same procedure and its spectrum was measured as a control group to investigate the adsorption behavior of ha on pp mps batch adsorption experiments of ha onto pristine and aged pp mps were performed as detailed in the supporting information text s1 2 4 characterization of mps four different pp mps were characterized 1 unaged pp mps before interaction with ha upp bha 2 unaged pp mps after interaction with ha upp aha 3 aged pp mps before interaction with ha app bha 4 aged pp mps after interaction with ha app aha surface morphology of mps was characterized by sem zeiss sigma 300 surface functional groups of mps were determined by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer shimadzu tracer 100 japan which was recorded in the 4000 400 cm 1 region with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the c and o elements of mps were analyzed by xps thermo scientific k alpha raman spectra of mps were recorded on a labram hr evolution raman spectrometer horiba scientific france in the range of 50 4000 cm 1 and data analysis was conducted by a labspec6 software the grating was set to 600 nm and a 785 nm diode laser was used raman mapping of mps was performed on a test area of 80 μm 80 μm using the integrated area of 780 1600 cm 1 for pp mps afm topographical imaging was carried out by a nanoir2 afm ir instrument equipped with contact mode nir2 probe anasys instrument inc version 3 15 usa detailed methods of afm ir spectra are described in previous studies luo et al 2021b 2 5 2d cos analyses due to the non uniformity of binding groups between dom and mps the application of conventional models or methods is limited 2d cos analysis was used to reveal the subtle changes in the infrared spectra of pp mps after interacting with ha 2d cos applies a continuous external disturbance time temperature concentration etc to the system collects a series of spectral variation characteristics in the disturbance and carries out correlation analysis in this study the concentration of pp mps was defined as an external disturbance of the system and the 2d cos spectra were obtained according to previous procedures chen et al 2014 luo et al 2022a typically the procedure generates two types of two dimensional maps called synchronous and asynchronous maps which are obtained using an open access software 2d shige version 1 3 kwansei gakuin university japan the principles of 2d cos analysis are described in detail elsewhere and the explanation is based entirely on noda s rules lasch and noda 2019 briefly synchronous spectrum φ x1 x2 consists of auto peaks and cross peaks representing the simultaneous changes of spectral intensities observed at two different wavenumbers x1 and x2 along the perturbation variable tk auto peaks are distributed along the main diagonal of the spectrum the positive sign of the cross peaks φ x1 x2 indicates that the change directions of x1 and x2 are the same and the negative sign indicates that the change directions are opposite asynchronous spectrum ψ x1 x2 only consists of cross peaks located at off diagonal positions when the signs of φ x1 x2 and ψ x1 x2 are the same in both types of maps the change of signal strength at x1 precedes that at x2 but when the signs of φ x1 x2 and ψ x1 x2 are opposite the change of signal strength at x2 precedes that at x1 3 results 3 1 fluorescence eems of ha without fluorescence signal from pp mps the fluorescence eems of ha revealed that the ex em peaks of ha are concentrated at 530 450 nm and 505 385 nm regardless of the addition of pristine or aged pp mps fig 1 for the ha with the addition of pristine pp mps fig 1a f the fluorescence peak intensity under different mps concentrations 0 200 mg at 535 450 nm reached 3650 4185 4396 4420 4423 and 4418 respectively the intensity of the fluorescence peak enhanced with the increasing concentration of pp mps and then remained constant when the amount of pp mps increased to 120 mg in contrast to the ha reacted with pristine mps the ha reacted with aged mps fig 1g l had higher peak intensity of humic like fractions at 535 450 nm fluorescence intensity was 3642 4235 4341 4654 4675 and 4382 respectively 3 2 ft ir spectra of ha and 2d cos analysis to explore the structural variation caused by the interaction between ha and pp mps ft ir spectra were used to monitor the changes of functional groups in the process fig 2 four main sharp peaks were identified from the ft ir spectra after interaction with pristine and aged pp mps which were centered at 834 1380 1620 and 3450 cm 1 respectively the ir spectra did not change significantly in the ha with the addition of pristine pp mps fig 2a indicating that the structure of ha was insensitive to the pristine pp mps compared to the ha with pristine pp mps the ir spectral peak intensity of the ha with aged pp mps changed obviously fig 2b the intensity of the characteristic peak of ha at 1250 1700 cm 1 showed an overall decreasing trend as the concentration of pp mps increased however the intensity of the characteristic peak was slightly enhanced when the mass of pp mps was increased to 200 mg in order to further clarify the effect of the concentration change of pp mps on the structure variation sequence of each functional group of ha 2d cos analysis was performed on ft ir spectra at ph 7 0 in the spectral range of 744 4000 cm 1 fig 3 for the ha interaction with pristine pp mps five major auto peaks were observed at 835 936 1608 2336 and 3392 cm 1 in the synchronous map along the diagonal line fig 3a except the cross peaks at 936 and 2336 cm 1 other cross peaks in synchronous maps were all positive table 1 furthermore the asynchronous map revealed the sequential changes in the ft ir spectra of ha with increasing concentrations of pp mps fig 3b the 2d ir cos maps of ha after interacting with aged pp mps fig 3c and d did not change significantly suggesting that aging of mps could not affect the sequence of structural changes in ha 3 3 sem and 3 d images of pp mps sem images of unaged and aged pp mps before and after the interaction revealed the changes in surface morphology fig 4 for the pristine pp mps without interaction with ha the surface was relatively flat and smooth fig 4a in contrast the surface of the pristine pp mps after the reaction with ha became rough and some grooves appeared fig 4b in addition the surface of the aged pp mps was very rough and laminar structure appeared fig 4c the surface roughness of aged pp mps was rougher after the interaction with ha and more cracks and grooves appeared on the surface fig 4d it can be concluded that the order of surface roughness of pp mps is app aha app bha upp aha upp bha to further understand the changes in the surface morphology of pp mps and the distribution of functional groups three dimensional 3 d images of pp mps based on topographical images and afm ir images were integrated fig 5 the 3 d image was exported by the analysis studio software and integrated by topographical images and afm ir images the surface of pristine pp mps without ha reaction was relatively flat and the signal intensity of functional groups was low fig 5a however after the reaction with ha the surface of pristine pp mps became rough and the functional group signal was enhanced fig 5b furthermore the surface of aged pp mps before ha reaction was more uneven and the signal of functional groups was more intense fig 5c in contrast the surface of aged pp mps after ha reaction was rougher and the red color covered almost the entire surface of mps indicating the appearance of more functional groups fig 5d 3 4 topographical imaging afm ir spectroscopy and afm ir imaging of pp mps in the present study three independent points on the topographical images of pp mps were examined and their average spectra were normalized the absorption peak located at 1720 cm 1 belonged to the stretching vibration of c o carbonyl bond and the brightness on these images represented the signal intensity of this functional group fig 6 as can be seen the surface of unaged pp mps without ha reaction was smooth and the height range of mps was about 800 nm fig 6a the carbonyl signal was weak and unevenly distributed as displayed in the afm ir images fig 6a the afm ir and ft ir spectra showed three major sharp peaks of pp mps which were centered at 2928 1465 and 1377 cm 1 respectively fig 6a and fig s1a the upp aha displayed greater surface roughness and more carbonyl signal fig 6b this was evidenced by the xps spectra of pp mps fig s2a and b table s1 which showed the appearance of o1s peaks after reaction with ha and indicated an increase in oxygen containing functional groups in addition the peak positions in the afm ir spectra and ft ir spectra did not change significantly but the peak intensities decreased slightly fig 6b and fig s1b aged pp mps exhibited different afm ir results the aged pp mps without ha reaction had fewer bright white areas i e fewer convex surfaces in the topographical image compared to unaged pp mps which indicated more coarsening fig 6c the afm ir image implied the significant surface oxidation of pp mps particles fig 6c in addition to the previously existing sharp peak an obvious c o peak 1720 cm 1 appeared in the afm ir spectra which was consistent with the findings in the afm ir images fig 6c the aged pp mps after ha reaction had the roughest surface and strongest yellow signal i e c o stretching vibration fig 6d moreover the carbonyl peak became more intense fig 6d fig s1c and d similarly a more intense o1s signal was observed fig s2c and d table s1 with o1s peak intensities in the order of app aha 3 87 app bha 2 39 upp aha 0 95 upp bha 0 3 5 raman spectra and raman mapping of pp mps the raman peaks of pp mps samples in the range of 700 1500 cm 1 were centered at 834 1130 1157 and 1454 cm 1 fig 7 raman mapping images of pp mps were obtained in the raman shift range of 780 1600 cm 1 by selecting a test area of 80 μm 80 μm under the raman microscope with 81 randomly selected sampling points fig 8 for unaged pp mps there was a slight enhancement of the characteristic signal before and after the interaction with ha fig 8a and b however for aged pp mps the addition of ha under the same conditions greatly enhanced the characteristic signal of pp mps fig 8c and d in addition it can be seen from the mapping images that the distribution of functional groups on the surface of mps was uneven regardless of aging or reaction with ha fig 8 this may be related to the change of the surface roughness of pp mps 4 discussion the literatures have shown extensive research on knowledge related to the interaction of pristine mps with dom abdurahman et al 2020 chen et al 2018 ding et al 2022 so far there are few studies evaluating the influence of aging on the interaction between mps and dom in the actual environment most mps will undergo extensive aging and dom is a soluble organic substance widely existing in aquatic and terrestrial environments chen et al 2017 luo et al 2022c this study focused on elucidating the interaction mechanism between pristine aged pp mps and ha the high concentration of pp mps induced the changes in the fluorescent components of ha and the changes of the fluorescent components were more significant when aged pp mps participated in the reaction fig 1 this may be due to the formation of highly conjugated co polymers with increased electron density after the interaction of pp mps with the aromatic structure of dom through π π conjugation chen et al 2018 photo labile property of protein like fluorophores has been previously reported for aquatic dom phong and hur 2015 the peak intensity tended to decrease after reaching the maximum with the addition of 160 mg of aged pp mps fig 1 g l which might be due to the partial degradation of ha lee et al 2021 romera castillo et al 2018 the structural variation caused by the interaction between ha and pp mps and the effect of the concentration change of pp mps on the structure variation sequence of each functional group of ha were determined by ft ir and 2d cos analysis fig 2 and fig 3 the band at 834 cm 1 was associated with the aromatic hydrogen out of plane bending vibration luo et al 2021a while the band at 1380 cm 1 represented the bending vibration or symmetric stretching vibration of nitro compound n o or the co stretching or oh deformation of carboxylic acid groups ding et al 2022 li et al 2017 luo et al 2022a the peak at 1620 cm 1 corresponded to the nh bending vibration of amine or amide luo et al 2021a while the peak at 3450 cm 1 was ascribed to the oh stretching of carboxylic acids phenols and alcohols ding et al 2022 tremblay et al 2011 the physicochemical properties of aged pp mps were unstable which led to ha dissociation and exposure of more functional groups chen et al 2014 luo et al 2022c thus it is not difficult to explain that the structure of ha was insensitive to pristine pp mps but the ir spectral peak intensity of the ha with aged pp mps changed obviously 2d cos is an effective tool for analyzing subtle changes in ft ir spectra which can help to clarify the interaction mechanism between pp mps and ha at the molecular level chen et al 2019 noda 2016 park et al 2016 according to noda s rule and the analysis in table 1 luo et al 2022b noda et al 2000 the sequence of band variation followed the order of 1608 3392 2336 936 835 cm 1 this indicated that with the increase of pp mps concentration the structural change order of ha was alkene c c or amine amide n h carboxylic acids phenols and alcohols o h aromatic rings c h alkene c h aromatic hydrogen ch the alkene c c or amine amide nh in ha was the most sensitive to concentration changes in pristine and aged pp mps and the saturated bonds were more sensitive than the unsaturated bonds it has been reported that the surface roughness of mps increases in the presence of ha and is related to the size of mps chen et al 2018 researchers also demonstrated that it is mainly the oxygen containing functional groups from carboxylate phenolic and aliphatic groups that play an important role in changing the surface morphology of mps ding et al 2022 additionally our previous studies have demonstrated the increase in specific surface area and surface roughness of aged mps luo et al 2020c it can be deduced that the surface morphology of aged mps changes further after the addition of ha and changes more drastically compared to the pristine mps in the present study the sem images showed that the aged pp mps developed larger cracks and grooves after interacting with ha and even a layered structure appeared which was consistent with the expectation fig 4 studies have also shown that reaction with ha contributes to the aging of mps to some extent ding et al 2022 the combination of atomic force microscopy and ir spectroscopy not only provides nanometer resolution images but also determines the chemical composition of the object luo et al 2020b shim et al 2017 in the 3 d images exported by the analysis studio software not only the same results as sem images were obtained but we found that ha also induced an enhancement of the functional group signal of pp mps fig 5 this enhancement may be related to the increase of oxygen containing functional groups luo et al 2020b therefore in order to obtain the chemical composition and distribution of mps more accurately the topographical images and afm ir images of pp mps at peak 1720 cm 1 were analyzed the application of afm ir opens up new opportunities for the characterization of mps which not only enables the identification and imaging of the chemical composition of mps but also requires only relatively simple sample pre treatment chen et al 2020 meyns et al 2019 it should be emphasized that peak tracking errors as well as cantilever beam damage or wear during afm ir imaging may produce artifacts especially in fast scan mode chen et al 2020 after comparing the afm ir and ft ir spectra fig 6 and fig s1 we found that the analyses of the two spectra were basically consistent but the positions of some peaks were slightly shifted probably due to differences in hardware and laser settings van eerdenbrugh et al 2012 the peak at 2928 cm 1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of ch2 bond while the peaks at 1465 and 1377 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetric bending vibration of ch3 bond jeyavani et al 2022 luo et al 2021b for app aha the large increase in c o groups indicated that the addition of ha promoted the surface oxidation of pp mps which might be due to the oxidation of ch bonds to c o bonds in pp mps luo et al 2020b interestingly the peak positions in the afm ir spectra and ft ir spectra did not change significantly after the addition of ha but the peak intensities decreased slightly initially we speculated that this may be because the mps adsorbed with ha resulted in the weakening of functional group signals however it was found that no adsorption occurred between pp mps and ha after batch adsorption experiments were performed fig s3 which seems contrary to the study by other researchers abdurahman et al 2020 previous investigations showed that the adsorption of two doms on ps mps was low ph dependent and related to ionic strength and site energy moreover the environmental behaviors of ps mps would be influenced by the amount and the type of dom as well as solution chemistry abdurahman et al 2020 furthermore other studies suggested that hydrophobic hydrogen bond and n π electron donor acceptor eda interactions may play a role in the adsorption of ha on mps however the adsorption of ha on both pristine and aged pp mps is a multi layer process attributed to physical adsorption moreover n π eda interaction between pp mps and ha does not exist due to simple structure of pp mps which just involves ch3 and ch2 fig 6 so the adsorption of ha on pp mps is poor song et al 2022 it can be considered that the pp mps and dom types selected in the present study and the reaction environment did not result in a good adsorption effect between pp mps and ha of course this is not to say that the adsorption results are meaningless which allow us to rule out the possibility of c o groups supplemented by adsorption of ha onto pp mps both raman and ft ir spectroscopy have the advantages of non destructive analysis low sample amounts and environmental friendliness however the better spatial resolution narrower spectral band wider spectral coverage and lower water interference of raman spectroscopy are not available in ft ir spectroscopy araujo et al 2018 sobhani et al 2019 regardless of the unaged or aged mps only the raman peak intensity increased during the reaction and the main structure of pp mps did not change which may be limited by the oxygen diffusion in the polymer luo et al 2020a ter halle et al 2017 in particular the raman peak at 1454 cm 1 was attributed to ch2 bending vibrations or ch3 asymmetric bending vibrations which was often considered to be the characteristic peak of pp mps fig 7 the bands at 834 and 1157 cm 1 were assigned to cc stretching vibrations and ch3 bending vibrations while the peak at 1130 cm 1 was assigned to the ch stretching vibrations ch2 wagging vibrations and ch3 bending vibrations guo et al 2019 in the raman mapping images the characteristic signal of ha addition was greatly enhanced in aged pp mps compared to unaged pp mps under the same conditions fig 8 this observation was consistent with the results of afm ir raman devices use a laser as light source which may lead to sample heating and occasionally to background emission and even to polymer degradation araujo et al 2018 however we use the latest analysis software and calibrate the system before each sample test during the raman mapping process enough mapping test points 81 test points are selected under a large enough test area 80 μm 80 μm and the scanning time 10 s of each test point is short enough so the error caused by the instrument can be avoided all the above results contribute to a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between pp mps and ha further demonstrating that aging of mps makes the interaction more intense it is necessary to be cautious in drawing any general conclusions regarding the environmental behavior and ecological risks of mps obviously the pp mps and ha selected in this study cannot represent all polymers and doms nevertheless the present study provides a new perspective on the interaction processes and mechanisms between mps and doms the combination of weathering forces as the main influencing factor with advanced characterization methods will help to better understand the fate behavior and risk of mps 5 conclusions mps are ubiquitous in the environment and most mps undergo extensive aging in order to better understand the interaction mechanism between mps and dom in the natural environment pp mps and ha were selected as representatives in this study pp mps mainly interacted with the aromatic structure of ha and the ft ir characteristic peak of ha interacting with aged pp mps changed more obviously the 2d cos results displayed that the structural change order of ha was alkene c c or amine amide n h carboxylic acids phenols and alcohols o h aromatic rings c h alkene c h aromatic hydrogen ch from the sem and 3 d images it can be seen that the surface roughness of pp mps before and after the interaction changed significantly aged pp mps had the roughest surface after reacting with ha spectroscopic results showed that the addition of ha induced the increase of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pp mps and the afm ir signal of aged mps was much stronger than that of unaged mps both afm ir and micro raman results revealed more intense interactions between aged mps and dom these findings provide a comprehensive explanation of the interaction between mps and dom present in the actual environment

15691,the ubiquitous microplastics mps in water environment play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args due to their exchange between floating mps and receiving waters however whether the arg exchange is persistent or transient and what are the differences in arg exchange between conventional plastics and biodegradable plastics are the two key issues to be addressed in this study biodegradable pbat and non biodegradable pet mps were chosen to explore the mp water arg exchange after the mps floated to the receiving waters the results demonstrated that the active exchange of args between mps and receiving waters occurred which however were transient for most of args the relative abundance of args both on the mps and in the waters rapidly decreased to the initial or lower levels within 4 weeks approximately 25 50 arg subtype number ratio of studied arg subtypes were introduced into the receiving waters by mps and 35 65 of studied arg subtypes went through fluctuation in terms of abundance on mps and in the receiving water args tended to converge between mps and the receiving waters with time furthermore the arg exchange between mps and waters facilitated horizontal gene transfer hgt inti1 and tnpa05 played the crucial roles in hgt which was indicated by their correlated change with most args in contrast tnpa04 showed the obvious lagging responses the biodegradable mp of pbat generally accumulated higher levels of most args including multidrug resistant genes than the non biodegradable mp of pet the transient exchange of most args between mps and water implies that the on off hitchhiking of args on mps in aquatic environment may not exert significant influence on arg transmission however compared with the conventional plastics the biodegradable mps might pose much higher arg dissemination risks due to the higher enrichment of args particularly with people s ever increasingly usage enough attention must be paid to this emerging issue graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics antibiotic resistance genes gene exchange biodegradable plastics surface water data for reference the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the extensive usage of antibiotics in manufacturing breeding and medical therapy increases the antibiotic pollution and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args in the aquatic environment li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 syranidou and kalogerakis 2022 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 as emerging contaminants args are attracting a growing attention because of their adverse ecological effects and intricate relationship with other contaminants such as microplastics mps yang et al 2020 green et al 2017 the synthetic plastic wastes continuously enter the surface water systems approximately 1 6 104 4 7 106 pieces per day through urban sewage discharge sarkar et al 2021 wang et al 2020a agricultural waste discharge zhou et al 2020 li et al 2018b runoff sankoda and yamada 2021 mccormick et al 2016 and atmospheric deposition gonzález pleiter et al 2020 thus surface waters have become key reservoirs of both mps and args yang et al 2018 vandermeersch et al 2015 the mp surface is recognized as a favorable microbe niche where the biofilms can form and it is then called plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 cincinelli et al 2019 li et al 2019 the plastisphere can act as a hotspot for accumulating transporting and spreading args bowley et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 the richness of args mobile genetic elements mges and their microbial hosts in the plastisphere is significantly higher than those in the bulk water and the horizontal transfer of args gets more frequent on the mp surface with the increase of mges yang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 imran et al 2019 arias andres et al 2018 in addition the large specific surface area of mps allows the facile absorption of antibiotics on mps and thus promotes spread of antibiotic resistance li et al 2021 2018a mps in the flowing surface waters always travel long distance with currents su et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yan et al 2021 in this sense the floating mps serve as important carriers for microbial hitchhikers and play an important role in persistent exchange of microbes including some pathogens between mps and the arriving waters bowley et al 2021 prata et al 2021 simkanin et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 the hydrological changes could affect the distribution of microbes in some streams mughini gras et al 2021 boulton 1993 similarly the mps and carried args are always transferred from one water environment to another accompanied with the persistent change of microbial communities in the mp surrounded water it can be inferred that the arg exchange between mps and their surrounding waters may occur in the dynamic surface water environment recent studies have reported that allochthonous bacteria including pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and the associated args tend to board the mp surface for seeking favorable conditions for their survival and subsequent evolution of relatively stable community structure compared with the surrounding environment and aboard the mps sathicq et al 2021 besides the gene carrying capacity and the floating feature of mps may significantly increase the risks of arg dissemination and the invasion of exogenous species in urbanized rivers li et al 2021 arias andres et al 2019 in spite of the occurrence of exchange of args between mps and the surrounding water some scientific questions urgently need to be clarified for example what occurs on the antibiotic resistance variation in the plastisphere and the surrounding water in response to the change of water environment is such arg exchange active or not are the effect of arg exchanges persistent or transient it was reported that args were significantly correlated with water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen do and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n zainab et al 2020 recently one study reported that abundance of args on mps decreased with salinity increase in aquatic environment wang et al 2020b however the above mentioned scientific questions on the dynamic changes of args on mps and in the receiving water after water environment shift still remain unclear in addition to the conventional mps the growingly adopted biodegradable particles such as poly butyleneadipate co terephthalate pbat and polylactic acid pla also have been found to accumulate in the aquatic environments weinstein et al 2020 shruti and kutralam muniasamy 2019 because the biodegradable mps can be used as a carbon source of microorganisms zumstein et al 2018 how does the biodegradability of mps affect the arg exchange to the best of our knowledge all these questions remain unanswered based on the context mentioned above this study focused on the exchange of args between mps and their changed water environment the non biodegradable and biodegradable mps were comparatively studied to explore the arg exchange kinetics and persistence between mps and their surrounding water the special attention was paid to the multidrug args due to their high environmental risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the conventional non biodegradable plastic thin sheets of polyethylene terephthalate pet and the biodegradable plastic thin sheets of pbat were used as mps where the biofilm formed naturally in this study pet and pbat plastics with purity percentage of 95 and 99 respectively were purchased from a plastic producer xinjiang blue ridge tunhe technology co ltd changji china the plastics were cut using sterilized scissors into 5 5 mm mp sheets the mp sheets were successively rinsed with 75 ethanol for three times 3 5 min each time for disinfection and with sterile ultrapure water to further remove the ethanol and residual contaminants on surface the surface waters for experiments were collected from three different surface water compartments with water exchanges on june 18 2021 including west lake named as wl 120 156 e

mges gene copies of genes normalized to the gene copies of 16s rrna on mps and in waters after the transfer of the mps to the receiving waters changed drastically fig 1 the representation of args abundance before mps were transferred is given in text s2 and text s3 generally the arg abundance on mps 50 80 of studied arg subtypes on pbat and 20 55 on pet and in waters 55 65 of studied arg subtypes exhibited a significant change during the initial 1 2 weeks after transfer of the mps to receiving waters one way anova p 0 05 this indicates that exchange of args between the mp surface especially the pbat mps and the receiving waters was active when mps were transferred to the receiving water 50 60 of studied arg subtypes on pbat 20 50 of studied arg subtypes on pet and 35 60 of studied arg subtypes in the receiving water underwent first a significant increase within the initial 2 weeks p 0 05 and subsequently a decrease to the initial levels in terms of abundance within the following 2 4 weeks fig 1 on the contrary a lower proportion of studied arg subtypes 0 35 on pbat 0 25 on pet and 0 20 in the receiving water firstly decreased and then increased within 4 weeks in terms of abundance after transfer of the mps in addition some args 10 30 on pbat 15 50 on pet and 25 35 in the receiving water changed little in terms of relative abundance fig 2 a b only 0 35 of studied args on pbat 0 25 on pet and 5 20 in the receiving water showed a simply increasing or decreasing trend throughout the 4 week s experimental period in generally most arg subtypes on pbat especially tet genes such as tetc tetg and tetq showed a stronger response in relative abundance than on pet in all treatment groups interestingly 35 65 of studied arg subtypes suffered fluctuation in their abundance between on mps and in the receiving waters for instance the relative abundance of tetg increased rapidly to its peak 4 16 10 2 2 22 10 3 copies 16s rrna in the receiving water but decreased rapidly on pbat at week 2 fig 1b it implies that tetg might be rapidly released from the pbat plastisphere into the receiving water similarly the increase of the tetc relative abundance on mps especially pbat was associated with its abundance decrease in receiving water fig 1a c f these results indicate the occurrence of arg exchange between mps and waters when mps floated with the water flow to the new water environments besides the entry of mps into receiving waters also led to a drastic rise of abundance of 5 35 studied args i e tetc and sul2 in the receiving water from very low initial levels take tetc as an example its relative abundance in the receiving water increased by 5 200 fold for all transfer treatments except the sr to qr transfer group fig 1 it seems that mps released some carried arg subtypes to waters as they arrived in the receiving water which accounted for around 25 50 of studied args for all experimental groups for example tetg was only detected on the pet surface and undetected either on the pbat surface or in the wl water when the pet mps were transferred to the wl water the relative abundance of tetg in the wl receiving water increase from zero to 4 30 10 3 2 79 10 3 copies 16s rrna fig 1b furthermore the tetg relative abundance of 3 49 10 2 3 74 10 3 copies 16s rrna was detected on pbat when the pet and pbat were incubated together in the wl water similarly sul1 was detected on mps both pet and pbat but undetected in the sr water the arg sul1 was present in the sr receiving water with relative abundance of 8 44 10 4 6 38 10 5 copies 16s rrna at week 1 after mps were transferred to the sr water fig 1a in addition part of arg subtypes in the receiving water seemed to board on mp surfaces for instance cmla1 was only detected in the qr water with relative abundance of 4 97 10 4 4 06 10 5 copies 16s rrna at initial stage before its transfer to mps when the biofilm colonized mps were transferred to the qr receiving water relative abundance of cmla1 on pbat increased from zero to 3 69 10 4 1 10 10 4 copies 16s rrna while its abundance in the qr water decreased to zero at week 2 fig 1e similar results forccmla1 was also observed in the sr water fig 1f these confirmed plastic water exchange of args 3 2 accumulation and exchange of args on pbat and pet generally the biodegradable pbat accumulated more args than conventional non biodegradable pet in this study the relative abundance of total args on pbat was significantly higher than on pet in the wl and qr waters for example the pbat mp surface had the relative abundance of total args of 3 15 10 2 3 04 10 3 copies 16s rrna which was much higher than the 1 10 10 2 5 29 10 4 copies 16s rrna on the pet surface in wl water p 0 001 fig s1 a similar phenomenon was observed for the sr water even if the arg laden mps were transferred to the new water environment the biodegradable pbat still had higher abundance of most studied args than pet during the 4 week incubation period fig 3 in addition more species of args including multiple drug resistance mdr genes were found to accumulate on pbat than pet it has to be noted that the mdr genes including mcr 1 and ndm 1 were detected on pbat in at least one treatment group at every sampling time fig 4 and the abundances of mdr genes on pbat was significantly higher than those on pet for most groups p 0 001 fig 1 3 3 horizontal gene transfer during mp water arg exchange mps and their entry to new receiving waters had a considerable impact on horizontal arg transfer both on mps and in waters to understand this the pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to explore the co occurrence pattern involving args and mges on mps and in the receiving waters as shown in fig 5 arg abundance on pbat was significantly and positively correlated with tnpa05 r 0 66 p 0 001 and the args abundance on pet and in the receiving water was significantly and positively correlated with both inti1 r 0 55 0 93 p 0 05 and tnpa05 r 0 47 0 97 p 0 05 in particular tnpa05 was found to significantly co occur and co change with most args on the pbat pet and in the receiving waters in each experimental group fig 1 generally the relative abundance of tnpa05 especially on pbat and in receiving waters increased within initial 2 weeks and subsequent decrease to the initial levels within the followed 2 4 weeks on the contrary tnpa04 the most abundant mge encoding transposase gene generally changed little in terms of relative abundance on mps and in the receiving waters within 2 weeks and thereafter increased during the 2 4 weeks fig 1 besides the relative abundance of inti1 on pbat presented a downward trend throughout the incubation period for most experimental groups which was inconsistent with change pattern of most args on pbat but inti1 was found to significantly co change with most args on pet and in the receiving water during the experimental period for each group 3 4 characteristics of bacterial communities on mps and in receiving water microbial diversity based on alpha diversity chao index of out level on pbat pet and the receiving waters were shown in fig 6 a in general diverse bacterial assemblages were observed on mps with a statistically p 0 01 anova lower chao index compared to the bacteria in the receiving waters significant difference in diversity was also observed for bacteria between pbat and pet samples moreover the relative abundance of bacterial outs at the phylum level was variable among pbat pet and the receiving waters and they shared most dominant phyla fig 6b for instance the phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant across all samples with higher relative proportions on mps compared to those in the receiving waters but the relative proportions of actinobacteria on mps were lower than the abundances in the receiving waters these results indicated that mp surface selectively enriched a unique suite of bacteria however there was no significant change with time in alpha diversity in the mp receiving water system after mps had been transferred to the receiving waters figs 6b s2 p 0 05 except the comparison between week 1 and week 4 in fig s2b to further identify the separation pattern between bacterial communities bray curtis based non metric multidimensional scaling nmds profiles were analyzed to examine the community dissimilarity among samples fig 6c the distance between points represented the degree of variance the points of pbat pet and the receiving waters were located in different quadrants indicating that bacterial communities among pbat pet and the receiving waters had distinct differences however most groups with different incubation time 1 2 and 4 weeks after transfer of mps to the receiving waters were in close proximity it means that the difference in the structure of communities was relatively small with incubation time after mps were transferred to the receiving waters 4 discussion 4 1 persistent or transient effect of mp water arg exchange this study demonstrated that when mps entered a new water environment most arg subtypes on the mps and in the receiving waters responded rapidly and actively fig 1 the active arg exchange between the mps and the receiving waters can be ascribed to the fact that the gene exchanges always occur between the isolates from ecologically similar but geographically separated environments smillie et al 2011 when the arg laden mps migrated from one water environment to another with water flow the microorganisms from the receiving water may land on the mp surface as hitchhikers and simultaneously the microorganisms on mps might get off and enter the receiving water debroas et al 2017 kirstein et al 2016 hence the mp pollution triggered the gene exchange in aquatic ecosystems arias andres et al 2018 however the present study also showed that the changes of args on the mps and the waters were transient rather than persistent relative abundance of 55 65 detected args in the receiving waters increased rapidly and then returned to the initial level within a short period of time 1 2 weeks in all the experimental groups this was inconsistent with previous studies li et al 2021 yang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 these studies reported a consensus of persistent accumulation process of args on mp surfaces sathicq et al 2021 yang et al 2020 mao et al 2015 the active but transient change of args on mps and in the receiving water should not be ignored since entry of mps with water current to new aquatic environment may cause a temporal explosive increase in args and introduce exotic types of args such as mdr genes 4 2 converging role of mps for args in plastisphere and water the pca graphic presented more discrete points of arg abundances at week 1 than at week 4 after the mps floated to the new water environment indicating that the args on mps and in the receiving water tended to cluster together with time fig 7 to better illustrate the temporal variation of antibiotic resistance on the mps and in the receiving waters the ternary plots were used to analyze dynamic variation of genes within 4 weeks after mps were relocated to the new receiving waters the change process of arg patterns could be divided into three stages fig 8 i at the initial stage the studied args tended to accumulate on mps especially on pbat mps fig 8a ii at 1 2 week after mps floated to new water environment both relative abundance and arg subtypes such as tetb tetx and ereb increased and some args such as tet sul and bla genes migrated gradually towards the receiving water compared to the initial stage fig 8b and c iii at week 4 a relative steady state equilibrium was established fig 8d this was similar to the earlier studies shi et al 2020 arias andres et al 2018 the result of our study further indicated that mps led to an active but transient exchange and accumulation of args within 2 weeks after they together with args floated to new waters and then abundance of args generally returned to a stable state this implies that the mps potentially play a converging role for args in plastisphere and water 4 3 selective enrichment of multidrug resistance genes on mps notably in most cases two mdr genes mcr 1 and ndm 1 were detected at a higher abundance on the mps than in the receiving water especially at week 1 or 2 fig 1 for example the relative abundance of ndm 1 on pbat 3 22 10 4 6 42 10 5 copies 16s rrna was significantly higher than that in the receiving water 1 65 10 4 5 51 10 5 copies 16s rrna p 0 05 at week 2 after mps floated from wl water to sr water similar phenomenon was also found in other experimental groups it means that mps may also act as potential carriers of multidrug resistant genes in aquatic environment this may be explained by the facts that mps promoted gene exchange among antibiotic resistant bacteria and caused drug resistance to develop into mdr and thus corresponding genes appeared li et al 2022 dong et al 2021 dnm 1 can exist in the mitochondrial dna of all kinds of bacteria owing to its strong replication ability rapid transmission speed and propensity of gene mutations luo et al 2010 hgt allows bacteria to exchange their genetic materials including args among diverse species greatly fostering collaboration among bacterial population in mdr development sun et al 2019 le roux and blokesch 2018 dzidic and bedeković 2003 it was reported that mps were the hotspot for args and hgt became more frequent on mp surface than in bulk water wang et al 2020b yang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 leading to the emergence of mdr genes therefore once the multidrug args accumulated on mps they are apt to spread to different water environments along with the mp transportation increasing the transmission risk of the dangerous multidrug args li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 seltenrich 2015 luo et al 2010 4 4 higher arg abundance on biodegradable mps than on non biodegradable mps the differences in relative abundance and arg subtypes between biodegradable mps and conventional mps in response to the mp water exchange after the mps were exposed to various receiving waters were compared in this study the biodegradable mps pbat accumulated more args than the conventional mps pet fig 3 this means that the biodegradable mps may pose higher transmission risk of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments than the conventional mps such difference can be attributed to the availability of nutrients from the polymer substrate to bacteria pbat a flexible biodegradable plastic type of aliphatic aromatic co polyester is of high elongation at breakage and exhibited hydrophilicity due to its active chemical functional groups such as ester carboxyl and hydroxyl groups weng et al 2013 witt et al 2001 the organic carbon in the pbat monomer unit can be used as carbon source by microorganisms for example filamentous fungi gain energy to form biomass through microbial polymer colonization enzymatic depolymerization on the pbat surface microbial uptake and utilization of the released low molecular weight compounds zumstein et al 2018 moreover the soft pbat surface may benefit bacterial swarming and lead to high arg abundances on pbat if they are hosts of args guo et al 2020 xavier et al 2011 it is worthy to note that mcr 1 and ndm 1 were detected at a higher abundance on biodegradable pbat than on non biodegradable pet in most cases during water shift see fig 3 and section 4 3 this indicates that pbat mps closely host mdr genes and thereby might pose a greater threat to environmental health and water safety one previous study confirmed that the biodegradable mps harbored args sun et al 2021 however there were no significant differences in the abundance and diversity of args on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate and non biodegradable pet in the present study the results showed that mdr genes tended to accumulate on biodegradable pbat in comparison with non biodegradable pet the biodegradable mps have been found to be more beneficial to the bacterial growth and colonization by providing more bioavailable carbon source than non biodegradable polymers song et al 2022 peng et al 2022 zumstein et al 2018 compared to the non biodegradable pet mps the biodegradable pbat mps act as nutritional hot spots in which cells are physiologically activated and form biofilm with higher cell density which thus increase hgt due to higher cell to cell contact in plastisphere on biodegradable mps than non biodegradable mps thomas and nielsen 2005 and this could enhance arg abundances including mdr genes sun et al 2019 a good correlation between biofilm activity and multidrug resistance was observed in mangrove sediment biofilm where the isolates having resistance to several drugs showed higher biofilm activity imchen et al 2019 in the present study the biofilm on pbat showed higher activities and thus had higher mdr abundance therefore urgent attention should be paid to the potential hazard posed by biodegradable plastics in the environment 4 5 horizontal transfer of arg associated with mp water gene exchange in the present study the args abundance on mps and in the receiving waters was significantly and positively correlated with tnpa05 and inti1 fig 5 besides the co occurrence and the drastic co change of the detected mges tnpa05 and inti1 and most args on the mps and in the receiving water were observed during the 4 weeks experimental period as mps floated to new water environment fig 1 these imply that the changes in arg abundances were associated with hgt mges mges inti1 tnpa04 and tnpa05 affected the occurrence and promoted the movement of args in the receiving waters through the mechanism of lateral gene transfer huang et al 2019 guo et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 aminov 2011 it has been known that hgt generally works in three modes including transformation transduction and conjugation johnsborg et al 2007 natural transformation by extracellular dna transduction by bacteriophages and conjugation by plasmids would occur and allow genetic material including args to be transferred between species on mps and in the receiving water after water change lerminiaux and cameron 2019 for instance the macrolide resistance genes ermb on plasmid encoded resistance can be transferred between different bacterial species via mges liu et al 2007 a close physical proximity between bacteria could favor the contact between surface attached bacteria and thus trigger the move of mges wang et al 2020c as shown in fig s3 the procrustes analysis revealed a significant correlation p 0 029 9999 permutations between mges inti1 tnpa04 and tnpa05 profiles and bacterial community composition on mps and the receiving waters with the procrustes a sum of squares m2 0 911 therefore it can speculate that when mps were transferred to the receiving water the interspecies cell to cell contact may become more frequent leading to an increase in mge abundance and eventually promoting hgt in the mp water system in the present study non significant change p 0 05 was observed in alpha diversity of microbiota with incubation time after mps were transferred to the receiving waters figs s2 6b and c however most of the arg subtypes in mps water system exhibited a significant change in terms of relative abundance after transfer of mps especially during the initial 1 2 weeks p 0 05 fig 1 considering the co occurrence and the co change of the detected mges tnpa05 and inti1 and most of the arg subtypes this study supports the idea that changes in arg abundances were associated with the changes of hgt activities mges it is worth mentioning that the rapid increases in relative abundances of tnpa05 and inti1 were followed by their subsequent decreases to the initial or even lower levels while tnpa04 increased rapidly to higher levels compared to their initial values at week 4 in most of experimental groups it gives a clue that the tnpa04 may link with gene changes after 4 weeks of mps entering a new water environment further studies based on the long term test several months are required to obtain a comprehensive overview on the mp water exchange process of args and the role of different mges in addition the pearson s correlations of basic water environmental factors including ph conductivity do chemical oxygen demand nh4 n and suspended particle matter with args on mps and those in the receiving waters were conducted for exploring the factors influencing arg exchange the results showed that the relative abundance of args on mps especially on pet was related to the basic water environmental factors such as ec and spm p 0 05 fig s4 therefore it indicates that the sudden change in these water environmental factors exerted substantial influence on the arg exchange between the mps and the receiving waters stimulated hgt dong et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 johnsborg et al 2007 and finally facilitated the acquisition of foreign resistance genes from the surrounding substrates johnsborg et al 2007 5 conclusions the present study answered two important questions about the universal arg exchange between mps and waters 1 are the arg exchanges persistent or transient and 2 do the biodegradable and non biodegradable plastics show different responses to the arg exchanges as for as the first question the results of this work demonstrated that when the arg carried mps entered the receiving water the rapid and active exchange of args happened between mps and the surrounding waters which however was temporal and the relative abundance of args both on the mps and in the waters rapidly declined to their initial values or even lower levels it was also found that args tended to converge between mps and receiving water with the evolution time after mp borne args were exposed to the new waters furthermore the arg exchange between mps and water can be beneficial to the hgt activity the abundance fluctuation of most args during their exchange between the mps and the waters was positively correlated to that of inti1 and tnpa05 this indicates the important roles of those two mges in gene exchange in comparison the clear lagging responses for tnpa04 were obtained as for the effects of mp biodegradability on the arg exchanges the biodegradable pbat was found to generally accumulate the higher levels of most args including mdr genes than the conventional plastics of pet thus the risks of arg transmission resulting from the ever increasingly used biodegradable plastics may be higher than those caused by the conventional plastics further studies ought to be dedicated to interaction mechanisms of args mges and their bacterial hosts during the universal mp water gene exchanges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15691,the ubiquitous microplastics mps in water environment play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args due to their exchange between floating mps and receiving waters however whether the arg exchange is persistent or transient and what are the differences in arg exchange between conventional plastics and biodegradable plastics are the two key issues to be addressed in this study biodegradable pbat and non biodegradable pet mps were chosen to explore the mp water arg exchange after the mps floated to the receiving waters the results demonstrated that the active exchange of args between mps and receiving waters occurred which however were transient for most of args the relative abundance of args both on the mps and in the waters rapidly decreased to the initial or lower levels within 4 weeks approximately 25 50 arg subtype number ratio of studied arg subtypes were introduced into the receiving waters by mps and 35 65 of studied arg subtypes went through fluctuation in terms of abundance on mps and in the receiving water args tended to converge between mps and the receiving waters with time furthermore the arg exchange between mps and waters facilitated horizontal gene transfer hgt inti1 and tnpa05 played the crucial roles in hgt which was indicated by their correlated change with most args in contrast tnpa04 showed the obvious lagging responses the biodegradable mp of pbat generally accumulated higher levels of most args including multidrug resistant genes than the non biodegradable mp of pet the transient exchange of most args between mps and water implies that the on off hitchhiking of args on mps in aquatic environment may not exert significant influence on arg transmission however compared with the conventional plastics the biodegradable mps might pose much higher arg dissemination risks due to the higher enrichment of args particularly with people s ever increasingly usage enough attention must be paid to this emerging issue graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics antibiotic resistance genes gene exchange biodegradable plastics surface water data for reference the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the extensive usage of antibiotics in manufacturing breeding and medical therapy increases the antibiotic pollution and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args in the aquatic environment li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 syranidou and kalogerakis 2022 zhang et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 as emerging contaminants args are attracting a growing attention because of their adverse ecological effects and intricate relationship with other contaminants such as microplastics mps yang et al 2020 green et al 2017 the synthetic plastic wastes continuously enter the surface water systems approximately 1 6 104 4 7 106 pieces per day through urban sewage discharge sarkar et al 2021 wang et al 2020a agricultural waste discharge zhou et al 2020 li et al 2018b runoff sankoda and yamada 2021 mccormick et al 2016 and atmospheric deposition gonzález pleiter et al 2020 thus surface waters have become key reservoirs of both mps and args yang et al 2018 vandermeersch et al 2015 the mp surface is recognized as a favorable microbe niche where the biofilms can form and it is then called plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 cincinelli et al 2019 li et al 2019 the plastisphere can act as a hotspot for accumulating transporting and spreading args bowley et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 the richness of args mobile genetic elements mges and their microbial hosts in the plastisphere is significantly higher than those in the bulk water and the horizontal transfer of args gets more frequent on the mp surface with the increase of mges yang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 imran et al 2019 arias andres et al 2018 in addition the large specific surface area of mps allows the facile absorption of antibiotics on mps and thus promotes spread of antibiotic resistance li et al 2021 2018a mps in the flowing surface waters always travel long distance with currents su et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yan et al 2021 in this sense the floating mps serve as important carriers for microbial hitchhikers and play an important role in persistent exchange of microbes including some pathogens between mps and the arriving waters bowley et al 2021 prata et al 2021 simkanin et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 the hydrological changes could affect the distribution of microbes in some streams mughini gras et al 2021 boulton 1993 similarly the mps and carried args are always transferred from one water environment to another accompanied with the persistent change of microbial communities in the mp surrounded water it can be inferred that the arg exchange between mps and their surrounding waters may occur in the dynamic surface water environment recent studies have reported that allochthonous bacteria including pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and the associated args tend to board the mp surface for seeking favorable conditions for their survival and subsequent evolution of relatively stable community structure compared with the surrounding environment and aboard the mps sathicq et al 2021 besides the gene carrying capacity and the floating feature of mps may significantly increase the risks of arg dissemination and the invasion of exogenous species in urbanized rivers li et al 2021 arias andres et al 2019 in spite of the occurrence of exchange of args between mps and the surrounding water some scientific questions urgently need to be clarified for example what occurs on the antibiotic resistance variation in the plastisphere and the surrounding water in response to the change of water environment is such arg exchange active or not are the effect of arg exchanges persistent or transient it was reported that args were significantly correlated with water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen do and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n zainab et al 2020 recently one study reported that abundance of args on mps decreased with salinity increase in aquatic environment wang et al 2020b however the above mentioned scientific questions on the dynamic changes of args on mps and in the receiving water after water environment shift still remain unclear in addition to the conventional mps the growingly adopted biodegradable particles such as poly butyleneadipate co terephthalate pbat and polylactic acid pla also have been found to accumulate in the aquatic environments weinstein et al 2020 shruti and kutralam muniasamy 2019 because the biodegradable mps can be used as a carbon source of microorganisms zumstein et al 2018 how does the biodegradability of mps affect the arg exchange to the best of our knowledge all these questions remain unanswered based on the context mentioned above this study focused on the exchange of args between mps and their changed water environment the non biodegradable and biodegradable mps were comparatively studied to explore the arg exchange kinetics and persistence between mps and their surrounding water the special attention was paid to the multidrug args due to their high environmental risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the conventional non biodegradable plastic thin sheets of polyethylene terephthalate pet and the biodegradable plastic thin sheets of pbat were used as mps where the biofilm formed naturally in this study pet and pbat plastics with purity percentage of 95 and 99 respectively were purchased from a plastic producer xinjiang blue ridge tunhe technology co ltd changji china the plastics were cut using sterilized scissors into 5 5 mm mp

significant differences and a p value below 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant between samples bar charts were generated by origin 8 0 originlab corporation northampton ma usa pearson s

mges gene copies of genes normalized to the gene copies of 16s rrna on mps and in waters after the transfer of the mps to the receiving waters changed drastically fig 1 the representation of args abundance before mps were transferred is given in text s2 and text s3 generally the arg abundance on mps 50 80 of studied arg subtypes on pbat and 20 55 on pet and in waters 55 65 of studied arg subtypes exhibited a significant change during the initial 1 2 weeks after transfer of the mps to receiving waters one way anova p 0 05 this indicates that exchange of args between the mp surface especially the pbat mps and the receiving waters was active when mps were transferred to the receiving water 50 60 of studied arg subtypes on pbat 20 50 of studied arg subtypes on pet and 35 60 of studied arg subtypes in the receiving water underwent first a significant increase within the initial 2 weeks p 0 05 and subsequently a decrease to the initial levels in terms of abundance within the following 2 4 weeks fig 1 on the contrary a lower proportion of studied arg subtypes 0 35 on pbat 0 25 on pet and 0 20 in the receiving water firstly decreased and then increased within 4 weeks in terms of abundance after transfer of the mps in addition some args 10 30 on pbat 15 50 on pet and 25 35 in the receiving water changed little in terms of relative abundance fig 2 a b only 0 35 of studied args on pbat 0 25 on pet and 5 20 in the receiving water showed a simply increasing or decreasing trend throughout the 4 week s experimental period in generally most arg subtypes on pbat especially tet genes such as tetc tetg and tetq showed a stronger response in relative abundance than on pet in all treatment groups interestingly 35 65 of studied arg subtypes suffered fluctuation in their abundance between on mps and in the receiving waters for instance the relative abundance of tetg increased rapidly to its peak 4 16 10 2 2 22 10 3 copies 16s rrna in the receiving water but decreased rapidly on pbat at week 2 fig 1b it implies that tetg might be rapidly released from the pbat plastisphere into the receiving water similarly the increase of the tetc relative abundance on mps especially pbat was associated with its abundance decrease in receiving water fig 1a c f these results indicate the occurrence of arg exchange between mps and waters when mps floated with the water flow to the new water environments besides the entry of mps into receiving waters also led to a drastic rise of abundance of 5 35 studied args i e tetc and sul2 in the receiving water from very low initial levels take tetc as an example its relative abundance in the receiving water increased by 5 200 fold for all transfer treatments except the sr to qr transfer group fig 1 it seems that mps released some carried arg subtypes to waters as they arrived in the receiving water which accounted for around 25 50 of studied args for all experimental groups for example tetg was only detected on the pet surface and undetected either on the pbat surface or in the wl water when the pet mps were transferred to the wl water the relative abundance of tetg in the wl receiving water increase from zero to 4 30 10 3 2 79 10 3 copies 16s rrna fig 1b furthermore the tetg relative abundance of 3 49 10 2 3 74 10 3 copies 16s rrna was detected on pbat when the pet and pbat were incubated together in the wl water similarly sul1 was detected on mps both pet and pbat but undetected in the sr water the arg sul1 was present in the sr receiving water with relative abundance of 8 44 10 4 6 38 10 5 copies 16s rrna at week 1 after mps were transferred to the sr water fig 1a in addition part of arg subtypes in the receiving water seemed to board on mp surfaces for instance cmla1 was only detected in the qr water with relative abundance of 4 97 10 4 4 06 10 5 copies 16s rrna at initial stage before its transfer to mps when the biofilm colonized mps were transferred to the qr receiving water relative abundance of cmla1 on pbat increased from zero to 3 69 10 4 1 10 10 4 copies 16s rrna while its abundance in the qr water decreased to zero at week 2 fig 1e similar results forccmla1 was also observed in the sr water fig 1f these confirmed plastic water exchange of args 3 2 accumulation and exchange of args on pbat and pet generally the biodegradable pbat accumulated more args than conventional non biodegradable pet in this study the relative abundance of total args on pbat was significantly higher than on pet in the wl and qr waters for example the pbat mp surface had the relative abundance of total args of 3 15 10 2 3 04 10 3 copies 16s rrna which was much higher than the 1 10 10 2 5 29 10 4 copies 16s rrna on the pet surface in wl water p 0 001 fig s1 a similar phenomenon was observed for the sr water even if the arg laden mps were transferred to the new water environment the biodegradable pbat still had higher abundance of most studied args than pet during the 4 week incubation period fig 3 in addition more species of args including multiple drug resistance mdr genes were found to accumulate on pbat than pet it has to be noted that the mdr genes including mcr 1 and ndm 1 were detected on pbat in at least one treatment group at every sampling time fig 4 and the abundances of mdr genes on pbat was significantly higher than those on pet for most groups p 0 001 fig 1 3 3 horizontal gene transfer during mp water arg exchange mps and their entry to new receiving waters had a considerable impact on horizontal arg transfer both on mps and in waters to understand this the pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to explore the co occurrence pattern involving args and mges on mps and in the receiving waters as shown in fig 5 arg abundance on pbat was significantly and positively correlated with tnpa05 r 0 66 p 0 001 and the args abundance on pet and in the receiving water was significantly and positively correlated with both inti1 r 0 55 0 93 p 0 05 and tnpa05 r 0 47 0 97 p 0 05 in particular tnpa05 was found to significantly co occur and co change with most args on the pbat pet and in the receiving waters in each experimental group fig 1 generally the relative abundance of tnpa05 especially on pbat and in receiving waters increased within initial 2 weeks and subsequent decrease to the initial levels within the followed 2 4 weeks on the contrary tnpa04 the most abundant mge encoding transposase gene generally changed little in terms of relative abundance on mps and in the receiving waters within 2 weeks and thereafter increased during the 2 4 weeks fig 1 besides the relative abundance of inti1 on pbat presented a downward trend throughout the incubation period for most experimental groups which was inconsistent with change pattern of most args on pbat but inti1 was found to significantly co change with most args on pet and in the receiving water during the experimental period for each group 3 4 characteristics of bacterial communities on mps and in receiving water microbial diversity based on alpha diversity chao index of out level on pbat pet and the receiving waters were shown in fig 6 a in general diverse bacterial assemblages were observed on mps with a statistically p 0 01 anova lower chao index compared to the bacteria in the receiving waters significant difference in diversity was also observed for bacteria between pbat and pet samples moreover the relative abundance of bacterial outs at the phylum level was variable among pbat pet and the receiving waters and they shared most dominant phyla fig 6b for instance the phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant across all samples with higher relative proportions on mps compared to those in the receiving waters but the relative proportions of actinobacteria on mps were lower than the abundances in the receiving waters these results indicated that mp surface selectively enriched a unique suite of bacteria however there was no significant change with time in alpha diversity in the mp receiving water system after mps had been transferred to the receiving waters figs 6b s2 p 0 05 except the comparison between week 1 and week 4 in fig s2b to further identify the separation pattern between bacterial communities bray curtis based non metric multidimensional scaling nmds profiles were analyzed to examine the community dissimilarity among samples fig 6c the distance between points represented the degree of variance the points of pbat pet and the receiving waters were located in different quadrants indicating that bacterial communities among pbat pet and the receiving waters had distinct differences however most groups with different incubation time 1 2 and 4 weeks after transfer of mps to the receiving waters were in close proximity it means that the difference in the structure of communities was relatively small with incubation time after mps were transferred to the receiving waters 4 discussion 4 1 persistent or transient effect of mp water arg exchange this study demonstrated that when mps entered a new water environment most arg subtypes on the mps and in the receiving waters responded rapidly and actively fig 1 the active arg exchange between the mps and the receiving waters can be ascribed to the fact that the gene exchanges always occur between the isolates from ecologically similar but geographically separated environments smillie et al 2011 when the arg laden mps migrated from one water environment to another with water flow the microorganisms from the receiving water may land on the mp surface as hitchhikers and simultaneously the microorganisms on mps might get off and enter the receiving water debroas et al 2017 kirstein et al 2016 hence the mp pollution triggered the gene exchange in aquatic ecosystems arias andres et al 2018 however the present study also showed that the changes of args on the mps and the waters were transient rather than persistent relative abundance of 55 65 detected args in the receiving waters increased rapidly and then returned to the initial level within a short period of time 1 2 weeks in all the experimental groups this was inconsistent with previous studies li et al 2021 yang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 these studies reported a consensus of persistent accumulation process of args on mp surfaces sathicq et al 2021 yang et al 2020 mao et al 2015 the active but transient change of args on mps and in the receiving water should not be ignored since entry of mps with water current to new aquatic environment may cause a temporal explosive increase in args and introduce exotic types of args such as mdr genes 4 2 converging role of mps for args in plastisphere and water the pca graphic presented more discrete points of arg abundances at week 1 than at week 4 after the mps floated to the new water environment indicating that the args on mps and in the receiving water tended to cluster together with time fig 7 to better illustrate the temporal variation of antibiotic resistance on the mps and in the receiving waters the ternary plots were used to analyze dynamic variation of genes within 4 weeks after mps were relocated to the new receiving waters the change process of arg patterns could be divided into three stages fig 8 i at the initial stage the studied args tended to accumulate on mps especially on pbat mps fig 8a ii at 1 2 week after mps floated to new water environment both relative abundance and arg subtypes such as tetb tetx and ereb increased and some args such as tet sul and bla genes migrated gradually towards the receiving water compared to the initial stage fig 8b and c iii at week 4 a relative steady state equilibrium was established fig 8d this was similar to the earlier studies shi et al 2020 arias andres et al 2018 the result of our study further indicated that mps led to an active but transient exchange and accumulation of args within 2 weeks after they together with args floated to new waters and then abundance of args generally returned to a stable state this implies that the mps potentially play a converging role for args in plastisphere and water 4 3 selective enrichment of multidrug resistance genes on mps notably in most cases two mdr genes mcr 1 and ndm 1 were detected at a higher abundance on the mps than in the receiving water especially at week 1 or 2 fig 1 for example the relative abundance of ndm 1 on pbat 3 22 10 4 6 42 10 5 copies 16s rrna was significantly higher than that in the receiving water 1 65 10 4 5 51 10 5 copies 16s rrna p 0 05 at week 2 after mps floated from wl water to sr water similar phenomenon was also found in other experimental groups it means that mps may also act as potential carriers of multidrug resistant genes in aquatic environment this may be explained by the facts that mps promoted gene exchange among antibiotic resistant bacteria and caused drug resistance to develop into mdr and thus corresponding genes appeared li et al 2022 dong et al 2021 dnm 1 can exist in the mitochondrial dna of all kinds of bacteria owing to its strong replication ability rapid transmission speed and propensity of gene mutations luo et al 2010 hgt allows bacteria to exchange their genetic materials including args among diverse species greatly fostering collaboration among bacterial population in mdr development sun et al 2019 le roux and blokesch 2018 dzidic and bedeković 2003 it was reported that mps were the hotspot for args and hgt became more frequent on mp surface than in bulk water wang et al 2020b yang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 leading to the emergence of mdr genes therefore once the multidrug args accumulated on mps they are apt to spread to different water environments along with the mp transportation increasing the transmission risk of the dangerous multidrug args li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 seltenrich 2015 luo et al 2010 4 4 higher arg abundance on biodegradable mps than on non biodegradable mps the differences in relative abundance and arg subtypes between biodegradable mps and conventional mps in response to the mp water exchange after the mps were exposed to various receiving waters were compared in this study the biodegradable mps pbat accumulated more args than the conventional mps pet fig 3 this means that the biodegradable mps may pose higher transmission risk of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments than the conventional mps such difference can be attributed to the availability of nutrients from the polymer substrate to bacteria pbat a flexible biodegradable plastic type of aliphatic aromatic co polyester is of high elongation at breakage and exhibited hydrophilicity due to its active chemical functional groups such as ester carboxyl and hydroxyl groups weng et al 2013 witt et al 2001 the organic carbon in the pbat monomer unit can be used as carbon source by microorganisms for example filamentous fungi gain energy to form biomass through microbial polymer colonization enzymatic depolymerization on the pbat surface microbial uptake and utilization of the released low molecular weight compounds zumstein et al 2018 moreover the soft pbat surface may benefit bacterial swarming and lead to high arg abundances on pbat if they are hosts of args guo et al 2020 xavier et al 2011 it is worthy to note that mcr 1 and ndm 1 were detected at a higher abundance on biodegradable pbat than on non biodegradable pet in most cases during water shift see fig 3 and section 4 3 this indicates that pbat mps closely host mdr genes and thereby might pose a greater threat to environmental health and water safety one previous study confirmed that the biodegradable mps harbored args sun et al 2021 however there were no significant differences in the abundance and diversity of args on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate and non biodegradable pet in the present study the results showed that mdr genes tended to accumulate on biodegradable pbat in comparison with non biodegradable pet the biodegradable mps have been found to be more beneficial to the bacterial growth and colonization by providing more bioavailable carbon source than non biodegradable polymers song et al 2022 peng et al 2022 zumstein et al 2018 compared to the non biodegradable pet mps the biodegradable pbat mps act as nutritional hot spots in which cells are physiologically activated and form biofilm with higher cell density which thus increase hgt due to higher cell to cell contact in plastisphere on biodegradable mps than non biodegradable mps thomas and nielsen 2005 and this could enhance arg abundances including mdr genes sun et al 2019 a good correlation between biofilm activity and multidrug resistance was observed in mangrove sediment biofilm where the isolates having resistance to several drugs showed higher biofilm activity imchen et al 2019 in the present study the biofilm on pbat showed higher activities and thus had higher mdr abundance therefore urgent attention should be paid to the potential hazard posed by biodegradable plastics in the environment 4 5 horizontal transfer of arg associated with mp water gene exchange in the present study the args abundance on mps and in the receiving waters was significantly and positively correlated with tnpa05 and inti1 fig 5 besides the co occurrence and the drastic co change of the detected mges tnpa05 and inti1 and most args on the mps and in the receiving water were observed during the 4 weeks experimental period as mps floated to new water environment fig 1 these imply that the changes in arg abundances were associated with hgt mges mges inti1 tnpa04 and tnpa05 affected the occurrence and promoted the movement of args in the receiving waters through the mechanism of lateral gene transfer huang et al 2019 guo et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 aminov 2011 it has been known that hgt generally works in three modes including transformation transduction and conjugation johnsborg et al 2007 natural transformation by extracellular dna transduction by bacteriophages and conjugation by plasmids would occur and allow genetic material including args to be transferred between species on mps and in the receiving water after water change lerminiaux and cameron 2019 for instance the macrolide resistance genes ermb on plasmid encoded resistance can be transferred between different bacterial species via mges liu et al 2007 a close physical proximity between bacteria could favor the contact between surface attached bacteria and thus trigger the move of mges wang et al 2020c as shown in fig s3 the procrustes analysis revealed a significant correlation p 0 029 9999 permutations between mges inti1 tnpa04 and tnpa05 profiles and bacterial community composition on mps and the receiving waters with the procrustes a sum of squares m2 0 911 therefore it can speculate that when mps were transferred to the receiving water the interspecies cell to cell contact may become more frequent leading to an increase in mge abundance and eventually promoting hgt in the mp water system in the present study non significant change p 0 05 was observed in alpha diversity of microbiota with incubation time after mps were transferred to the receiving waters figs s2 6b and c however most of the arg subtypes in mps water system exhibited a significant change in terms of relative abundance after transfer of mps especially during the initial 1 2 weeks p 0 05 fig 1 considering the co occurrence and the co change of the detected mges tnpa05 and inti1 and most of the arg subtypes this study supports the idea that changes in arg abundances were associated with the changes of hgt activities mges it is worth mentioning that the rapid increases in relative abundances of tnpa05 and inti1 were followed by their subsequent decreases to the initial or even lower levels while tnpa04 increased rapidly to higher levels compared to their initial values at week 4 in most of experimental groups it gives a clue that the tnpa04 may link with gene changes after 4 weeks of mps entering a new water environment further studies based on the long term test several months are required to obtain a comprehensive overview on the mp water exchange process of args and the role of different mges in addition the pearson s correlations of basic water environmental factors including ph conductivity do chemical oxygen demand nh4 n and suspended particle matter with args on mps and those in the receiving waters were conducted for exploring the factors influencing arg exchange the results showed that the relative abundance of args on mps especially on pet was related to the basic water environmental factors such as ec and spm p 0 05 fig s4 therefore it indicates that the sudden change in these water environmental factors exerted substantial influence on the arg exchange between the mps and the receiving waters stimulated hgt dong et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 johnsborg et al 2007 and finally facilitated the acquisition of foreign resistance genes from the surrounding substrates johnsborg et al 2007 5 conclusions the present study answered two important questions about the universal arg exchange between mps and waters 1 are the arg exchanges persistent or transient and 2 do the biodegradable and non biodegradable plastics show different responses to the arg exchanges as for as the first question the results of this work demonstrated that when the arg carried mps entered the receiving water the rapid and active exchange of args happened between mps and the surrounding waters which however was temporal and the relative abundance of args both on the mps and in the waters rapidly declined to their initial values or even lower levels it was also found that args tended to converge between mps and receiving water with the evolution time after mp borne args were exposed to the new waters furthermore the arg exchange between mps and water can be beneficial to the hgt activity the abundance fluctuation of most args during their exchange between the mps and the waters was positively correlated to that of inti1 and tnpa05 this indicates the important roles of those two mges in gene exchange in comparison the clear lagging responses for tnpa04 were obtained as for the effects of mp biodegradability on the arg exchanges the biodegradable pbat was found to generally accumulate the higher levels of most args including mdr genes than the conventional plastics of pet thus the risks of arg transmission resulting from the ever increasingly used biodegradable plastics may be higher than those caused by the conventional plastics further studies ought to be dedicated to interaction mechanisms of args mges and their bacterial hosts during the universal mp water gene exchanges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15692,microplastics mps are increasingly entering the urban aquatic ecosystems and the environmental significance and health risks of plastisphere a special biofilm on mps have received widespread attention in this study mps of polylactic acid pla and polyvinyl chloride pvc and quartzite were incubated in an urban water environment and the tetracycline tc degradation ability was compared approximatedly 24 of tc biodegraded in 28 d in the water quartzite system which is significantly higher than that in the water pla 17 3 and water pvc systems 16 7 re incubation of microorganisms in biofilms affirmed that quartzite biofilm has a higher tc degradation capacity than the plastisphere according to high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna and metagenomic analysis quartzite biofilm contained more abundant potential tc degrading bacteria genes related to tc degradation eutg acee and dlat and metabolic pathways related to tc degradation an oligotrophic environment on the quartzite surface might lead to the higher metabolic capacity of quartzite biofilm for unconventional carbons e g tc it is also found that compared with quartzite biofilm the distinct microbes in the plastisphere carried more antibiotic resistance genes args higher affinity of mps surface to antibiotics may lead to higher antibiotics stress on the plastisphere which further amplify the carrying capacity for args of microorganisms in the plastisphere compared to the nondegradable pvc mps surface of the biodegradable pla plastics harbored significantly higher amounts of biomass and args compared to the mineral particles the capability of plastisphere has lower ability to degrade unconventional carbon sources such as the refractory organic pollutants due to the abundance of carbon sources adsorbed organic carbon and endogenous organic carbon on the mps surface meanwhile the stronger adsorption capacity for pollutants also leads to higher pollutant stress such as antibiotic stress in plastisphere which in turn affects the microbiological characteristics of the plastisphere itself such as carrying more args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics plastisphere antibiotic degradation args biodegradable plastic data availability i have submitted the figures and tables at the attach files step 1 introduction microplastics mps are plastic debris with a diameter of less than 5 mm thompson et al 2004 andrady et al 2011 owing to the discharge of domestic sewage and atmospheric deposition a large number of mps have entered the urban river constant et al 2020 hernandez et al 2017 for instance 370 to 7924 items m3 mps were observed in the pearl river lin et al 2018 the health threats of mps to aquatic life have been well documented qiao et al 2019 and a recent study confirmed that these threats could be transported in the aquatic food web mcilwraith et al 2021 with such a high abundance of mps the associated environmental impact on urban rivers should be considered the prolonged drifting of mps in the aquatic environment can provide a stable habitat for microorganisms to form a biofilm defined as plastisphere zettler et al 2013 which harbored unique microbe composition different from the surrounding water amaral zettler et al 2020 de tender et al 2015 mccormick et al 2014 xue et al 2021 zettler et al 2013 subsequently plastisphere were also found in the terrestrial and atmosphere environment zhu et al 2022 peng et al 2022b it was suggested that the plastisphere in water had a more diverse community structure than the surrounding water and the biofilm on rock or leaf wu et al 2019 although the microbial structure and composition of plastisphere were investigated knowledge of the microbial function characteristics of the plastisphere remains limited microorganisms are crucial undertakers of some environmental functions in the aquatic ecosystem such as nutrient cycling and biodegradation of organic pollutants ghattas et al 2017 hutchins and fu 2017 it is estimated that the microbial biomass attached to mps accounts for more than 6 of the total mass in the aquatic ecosystems moret ferguson et al 2010 therefore plastisphere are assumed to affect the degradation of some organic pollutants in aquatic environment tu et al 2020 antibiotics have been identified as an emerging contaminant yang et al 2018 in 2015 antibiotic consumption was 42 billion daily and this figure is expected to increase by 200 by 2030 klein et al 2018 animal husbandry is one of the worst

antibiotic pollution in urban waters enriches antibiotic resistance genes args liu et al 2019 xue et al 2020 higher abundance of args in microbes in the plastisphere than in the surrounding water and

genus levels fig 1b c the bacterial community in three kinds of particles in particle biofilms presented remarkable distinction at the phylum and genus levels at the phylum level the biofilm of quartzite harbored significantly higher bacteroidota myxococcota and desulfobacterota than that of pla and pvc biofilms p 0 05 fig 2 a b at the genus level quartzite biofilms had significantly higher abundance in several genera and the norank f saprospiraceae unclassified f rhodobacteraceae and methyloversatilis showed the most difference p 0 05 fig 2c d network analysis was used to explore the underlying interaction of microbial consortia toward the particle biofilms fig 3 the modularity indexes in the biofilm were 0 628 pla 0 637 pvc and 0 453 quartzite with the modularity indexes of 0 4 suggesting that the networks had modular structures the network in the biofilm of pla pvc and quartzite has 404 316 positive and 88 negative 402 297 positive and 105 negative and 618 370 positive and

biofilms after 28 days different amounts of tc disappeared in the river water of the three treatments i e pla pvc and quartzite based on the background adsorption experiment with sterilization water the adsorption capacities of tc on pla pvc and quartzite were 3 77 4 36 and 2 57 respectively fig s5 p 0 05 after deducting the influence of adsorption the water containing quartzite biofilm exhibited the highest tc degradation efficiency 23 9 followed by that containing pla biofilm 17 3 and pvc biofilm 16 7 in amended water while the ck presented a significantly lower degradation efficiency of 11

involved in the degradation of tc shao et al 2019 in different biofilms the abundance of three major functional genes eutg acee and dlat related to tc degradation was further quantified to explain the different tc degradation abilities of the three biofilms the quartzite biofilm harbored the highest abundance of acee 4 01e 4 followed by the biofilms on pvc 3 33e 4 and pla 2 68e 4 fig 5 a comparably the dlat annotation also showed a significantly higher abundance in quartzite biofilm 6 95e 4 than in pvc 6 00e 4 and pla 5 48e 4 biofilms compared with acee and dlat the abundance of eutg was much lower in the particle biofilms ranging from 3 03e 7 to 4 83e 6 no differences were observed in the three biofilms tc can be biodegraded through demethylation dehydrogenation decarbonylation and deamination leng et al 2016 the quartzite biofilm harbored the highest abundance of the metabolic pathways in dehydrogenation deamination and decarbonylation 3 54e 3 1 92e 4 and 2 97e 7 which were all significantly higher than that in pla and pvc biofilms fig s6 metabolism was the most abundant functional category in level 1 fig s7 while the amino acid metabolism 11 61 14 05 and carbohydrate metabolism 10 27 12 28 were dominated among metabolism function in biofilms in level 2 fig 5b as for the top 30 kegg pathway in level 3 biosynthesis of secondary metabolites 2 37 2 73 microbial metabolism in diverse environments 1 58 1 96 biosynthesis of amino acids 0 91 1 03 and carbon metabolism 0 86 1 01 were the 4 major metabolism pathways fig s8 the quartzite biofilm had a higher relative abundance than pla and pvc biofilms in most of the functional metabolism in levels 2 and 3 and presented a significant difference in several pathways including atp binding cassette transporter the two component system and quorum sensing fig s8 3 4 occurrence of args in biofilms in the simulation experiment four tc resistance genes teta tetc tetm and tetx and an integrase gene inti1 were detected in particle biofilms after 28 days compared to the pla and pvc biofilms after 28 days incubation 2 05e 5 copies cm2 and 1 67e 5 copies cm2 the quartzite biofilm had a significantly lower args absolute abundance of 5 20e 4 copies cm2 p 0 05 fig 6 a the relative abundance reached the same result that quartzite biofilm 1 12e 2 was significantly lower than pla and pvc biofilms 1 81e 2 and 2 00e 2 p 0 05 fig 6b in addition the absolute and relative abundances of inti1 in the pla biofilm 1 82e 5 copies cm2 and 1 61e 2 and the pvc biofilm 1 43e 5 copies cm2 and 1 75e 2 were also significantly higher than that of the quartzite biofilm 6 04e 4 copies cm2 and 1 30e 2 p 0 05 fig s9 a confirmatory experiment was conducted to verify the selective colonization of args on mps particles under the consistent tc stress pla pvc and quartzite particles were incubated in the same microcosm with a continuous 0 0 5 and 1 mg l tc for 14 d without tc adding args absolute and relative abundances on mps were higher than those on quartzite however the differences did not reach a significant level fig s10 in the treatments with 0 5 and 1 mg l tc significantly higher absolute and relative abundances of args were observed on mps and the difference was more significant as the tc concentration increased fig s10 for example in 0 5 mg l tc treatment the relative abundances of args in pla and pvc biofilms were 1 46 and 1 36 times those in quartzite biofilm while the values were 1 86 and 1 75 times in 1 mg l tc treatment based on the kegg annotation in metagenomic analysis the leading bacterial hosts of args in biofilms were harbored by pseudomonas unclassified flavobacteriaceae and actinobacteria fig 7 a the abundance of these genera in both of the pla and pvc biofilms were higher than that in the quartzite biofilm fig 7a which was consistent with the difference of args in different biofilms fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 distinctive bacterial composition among three biofilms overall particle surface community categories were consistent with surrounding water in all experiment groups fig 1 indicating that the river water environment serves as a bacterial source however the community proportion differed and particle biofilms harbored the specific bacterial communities a different microbial community structure colonized on the plastic surface compared to surrounding water has been frequently reported de tender et al 2015 li et al 2021 zettler et al 2013 in freshwater and seawater environments the plastisphere and surrounding water had significant distinctions in some genera such as mycoplana erythromicrobium rhodoferax zymomonas and polaromonas gonzalez pleiter et al 2021 previous research found that the mineral surface biofilm and surrounding water were also different in some phyla s microbial communities including proteobacteria firmicutes chlorobi and cyanobacteria wu et al 2019 compared to quartzite biofilm similar biomass and bacterial communities were observed in two mps pla and pvc biofilms fig 1 s3 considering the same incubation environment the different biomass and bacterial communities in three biofilms could be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the substances i e bioavailability surface charge and hydrophobicity during the long term cultivation pla and pvc two plastic polymers might be degraded by a few microorganisms and enzymes feng et al 2002 nakamiya et al 2005 qi et al 2017 especially for pla a biodegradable material the degradation products of small molecules i e monomer and oligomer can be easily utilized by the colonized microorganisms hakkarainen 2001 leading to higher nutrient levels and significantly higher biomass on plastic surfaces in comparison as a mineral matrix quartzite could not generate nutritional source for microorganisms in the extracts of three particles incubated for 28 days toc was in the order of pla pvc quartzite p 0 05 fig s11 in addition the plastic degrading microorganisms will gain nutritional advantages in plastisphere which may also affect the community structure of biofilms five genera among the reported pla degrading bacteria qi et al 2017 were detected in the pla biofilms in this study and four of them were higher than those in the pvc and quartzite biofilms fig 1 similarly the abundance of the genus of an identified pvc degrading bacteria i e bacillus giacomucci et al 2019 was higher in the biofilm of pvc than that of pla and quartzite fig 1 besides the electrical charge on the plastic surface affects the colonization of microorganisms on its surface due to the charge modification of the polyethylene surface the cell adhesion density of escherichia coli on a positively charged surface was 23 times higher than that on a negatively charged surface terada et al 2012 in the biofilm formation process the electrostatic attraction or overcoming electrostatic repulsion could lead to initial adhesion between cells and the matrix palmer et al 2007 wang et al 2021 pzc of most bacterial cells is approximately 3 4 causing a negative charge of bacterial cells in most environments soni et al 2008 the different pzcs of materials i e 3 4 for pla 2 8 for pvc and 1 3 for quartzite may lead to different adsorption potential of microorganisms on different surfaces polymer hydrophilicity hydrophobicity can also affect the surface community it is reported that bacteria with strong surface hydrophobicity are more likely to attach to hydrophobic surfaces while the bacteria with strong hydrophilicity are inclined to the hydrophilic surface cerca et al 2005 in this work the contact angles of pla pvc and quartzite are 77 8 91 25 and 0 respectively fig s12 suggesting that the surface of mps is highly hydrophobic generally microorganism surfaces with higher n c values are more hydrophobic and higher o c values are more hydrophilic desrousseaux et al 2013 gram positive bacteria have more peptidoglycan in the cytoderm contributing to higher n c and stronger hydrophobicity van roosmalen et al 2004 based on the bugbase predictions of bacterial phenotypes it was verified that the biofilms on mps surfaces had a significantly higher proportion of gram positive bacteria p 0 05 fig s13 although the two plastics are more hydrophobic than quartzite the pvc surface has a larger contact angle and is more hydrophobic fig s12 leading to a higher proportion of gram positive bacteria on the pvc surface fig s13 4 2 potential reasons for the different tc biodegradation capability of the particle biofilms a significantly higher tc degradation efficiency was detected in the quartzite amended water than that in mps amended water after 30 days of incubation p 0 05 fig 4a given that there is no significant difference in bacterial biomass and community structure in the three particle amended water fig 1 s3 it is inferred that the different microorganism communities in the biofilms of quartzite and mps result in this phenomenon furthermore the confirmatory experiment verified the above conjecture fig 4b in terms of the bacterial community in biofilms three phyla bacteroidota myxococcota and desulfobacterota and three genera norank f saprospiraceae norank f rhodobacteraceae and methyloversatilis were found significantly higher on the quartzite surface than that on mps fig 2 bacteroidota have been found to accelerate the removal efficiency of antibiotics in the electrolytic cell liang et al 2013 in wastewater treatment methyloversatilis was the dominant genus in the degradation of tc peng et al 2018 this might explain the higher tc biodegradation capacity of the surrounding water of the quartzite particles moreover the co occurrence network illustrated that the quartzite surface had rich and close interactions with different bacterial communities fig 3 it suggested that these interactions contribute to the cooperative behavior among microorganisms prompting tc degradation the biofilm on the quartzite surface presented remarkable tc biodegradable genes and pathways depending on the functional annotation of kegg the abundance of function annotated of both dehydrogenation and deamination was much higher on quartzite biofilm than that on pla and pvc biofilms fig s6 in addition the changes in hydrolysis ring opening and oxidation also occur in the tc removal associated with the encoding of the functional gene e g eutg acee and dlat by microorganisms shao et al 2019 there are more eutg and acee relative abundance on the quartzite surface than those on the pla and pvc surface manifesting higher abundance of tc degrading genes on quartzite and higher degradation capability fig 5a the greater fundamental metabolic capacity of microorganisms could promote the expression of environmental functions of the community including antibiotic degradation feng et al 2019 liao et al 2021 for example the citrate cycle and propanoate metabolism are two significant elementary metabolic pathways for major nutrients prompting tc biodegradation shao et al 2019 as for functional annotation in kegg level 2 quartzite surfaces always had a higher abundance in multiple fundamental metabolisms fig 5b four major metabolic pathways ec 2 3 1 12 ec 6 2 1 1 ec 1 1 1 1 and ec 1 2 4 1 about citrate cycle and propanoate metabolism were detected at higher abundance in quartzite biofilm than in pla and pvc biofilms fig 7b which may result in higher tc biodegradation the oligotrophic environment on the quartzite surface may contribute to the higher tc degradation capacity of quartzite biofilm in the re dissolving experiment the toc concentration on the mp surfaces was significantly higher than on the quartzite surface fig s11 illustrating that plastic surfaces discharge more organic carbon and favor microbial colonization compared to pla and pvc surfaces microorganisms on more oligotrophic quartzite have to utilize more tc deemed a carbon and energy source to promote their growth and reproduction during the incubation period in the relatively oligotrophic environment tc with the concentration of 1 mg l contributes to 19 2 toc according to the original river water 9 15 mg l and toc analyzer s determination principle therefore the microorganisms utilizing tc on oligotrophic quartzite surfaces may acquire a survival advantage it suggests that the functional microorganisms are retained and multiplied enhancing the efficiency of tc biodegradation this survival of the fittest mechanism is commonly applied to screening functional microorganisms angelidaki et al 2000 ma et al 2019 4 3 remarkable args enrichment in the plastisphere mp biofilms harbored a higher abundance of args than quartzite biofilm in the polluted river microcosm system many reports have observed that antibiotics were positively correlated to arg copies qiao et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 xu et al 2015 for example multiple args qnrs ermb and suli increased the correlation between absolute abundance and antibiotic concentration suggesting the positive enrichment under antibiotic pressure rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 the simulated experiment of args abundance verified that when three types of particles were incubated in the same environment without adding tc the absolute abundance and relative abundance of args on the mp s surface were also higher than those of quartzite based on the kegg annotation the leading arg carriers were actinobacter unclassified flavobacteriaceae and pseudomonas which is inconsistent with those potential tc degrading microorganisms in the previous studies unclassified flavobacteriaceae and pseudomonas have been the critical hosts for args wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 both metagenomic analysis and 16s rrna sequencing showed that these communities were more abundant on mps surfaces fig 7a s11 suggesting that the colonization preference of these bacterial communities on the mps surface resulted in the higher abundance of args in the plastisphere when the environmental stress of tc increased the differences in the abundance of args in the biofilms of mps and quartzite were further amplified fig s10 it was speculated that the different tc adsorption properties on the three particles caused the args enrichment on the mps surface the stronger adsorption of tc on the mps result in higher antibiotic stresses fig s5 thus further amplifying the advantages of bacteria carrying args during the colonization on mps and the abundance of args in the plastisphere 4 4 plastisphere bring higher health risk than mineral biofilm the integrase gene inti1 is commonly responsible for the args spreading through horizontal gene transfer hgt gillings et al 2015 given that args have become a critical global public health risk in this century qiao et al 2018 a higher abundance of inti1 was found on mps surface than that on quartzite fig s9 suggesting that the more abundant args on the mps surface have the greater potential to spread in the plastisphere and surrounding water the abundance of metabolic pathways associated with disease on the surface of three types of particles was explored based on the kegg database in most metabolic pathways associated with human diseases pla biofilm showed the highest relative abundance followed by pvc biofilm and the quartzite biofilm generally had the lowest relative abundance fig s14 the result illustrated that mps biofilm presented a higher pathogenic risk than a natural mineral particle the combination of higher pathogenic metabolic pathways and a higher abundance of args suggests that the plastisphere poses a higher health threat to organisms in the environment in addition mps float more easily in water than dense mineral particles andrady 2017 which could further increase the transport capacity of the plastisphere in water and the health threat of pathogenic microorganisms and args in the plastisphere it should be noted that more abundant args and metabolic pathways associated with the disease were observed on pla in the comparison of two mps figs 6 s14 biodegradable plastic is increasingly being promoted due to being environmentally friendly pla the most widely used biodegradable plastic has been developed and applied in the commercial fields such as packaging bags food boxes and straws siracusa et al 2008 considering that the degradation of degradable plastics in the environment is a long process such as pla was not degraded after 120 days in the soil environment kamiya et al 2007 when more biodegradable mps accumulate in the aquatic environment environmental threats must also be considered conclusions compared with the mineral surface biofilm plastisphere in the aquatic environment has no advantage in degrading tc antibiotic organic substances generated from mps provide more carbon sources to microbes than the mineral particles which can not only affect the biomass of plastispheres but also make the plastispheres less capable of degrading those unconventional carbons such as the refractory organic pollutants higher affinity of the mps surface to organic pollutants causes higher pollution stress in plastisphere which may in turn affect the microbiological characteristics of plastisphere more arg carried by plastispheres can be explained by the higher antibiotic stress on the surface of mps particles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

15692,microplastics mps are increasingly entering the urban aquatic ecosystems and the environmental significance and health risks of plastisphere a special biofilm on mps have received widespread attention in this study mps of polylactic acid pla and polyvinyl chloride pvc and quartzite were incubated in an urban water environment and the tetracycline tc degradation ability was compared approximatedly 24 of tc biodegraded in 28 d in the water quartzite system which is significantly higher than that in the water pla 17 3 and water pvc systems 16 7 re incubation of microorganisms in biofilms affirmed that quartzite biofilm has a higher tc degradation capacity than the plastisphere according to high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna and metagenomic analysis quartzite biofilm contained more abundant potential tc degrading bacteria genes related to tc degradation eutg acee and dlat and metabolic pathways related to tc degradation an oligotrophic environment on the quartzite surface might lead to the higher metabolic capacity of quartzite biofilm for unconventional carbons e g tc it is also found that compared with quartzite biofilm the distinct microbes in the plastisphere carried more antibiotic resistance genes args higher affinity of mps surface to antibiotics may lead to higher antibiotics stress on the plastisphere which further amplify the carrying capacity for args of microorganisms in the plastisphere compared to the nondegradable pvc mps surface of the biodegradable pla plastics harbored significantly higher amounts of biomass and args compared to the mineral particles the capability of plastisphere has lower ability to degrade unconventional carbon sources such as the refractory organic pollutants due to the abundance of carbon sources adsorbed organic carbon and endogenous organic carbon on the mps surface meanwhile the stronger adsorption capacity for pollutants also leads to higher pollutant stress such as antibiotic stress in plastisphere which in turn affects the microbiological characteristics of the plastisphere itself such as carrying more args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics plastisphere antibiotic degradation args biodegradable plastic data availability i have submitted the figures and tables at the attach files step 1 introduction microplastics mps are plastic debris with a diameter of less than 5 mm thompson et al 2004 andrady et al 2011 owing to the discharge of domestic sewage and atmospheric deposition a large number of mps have entered the urban river constant et al 2020 hernandez et al 2017 for instance 370 to 7924 items m3 mps were observed in the pearl river lin et al 2018 the health threats of mps to aquatic life have been well documented qiao et al 2019 and a recent study confirmed that these threats could be transported in the aquatic food web mcilwraith et al 2021 with such a high abundance of mps the associated environmental impact on urban rivers should be considered the prolonged drifting of mps in the aquatic environment can provide a stable habitat for microorganisms to form a biofilm defined as plastisphere zettler et al 2013 which harbored unique microbe composition different from the surrounding water amaral zettler et al 2020 de tender et al 2015 mccormick et al 2014 xue et al 2021 zettler et al 2013 subsequently plastisphere were also found in the terrestrial and atmosphere environment zhu et al 2022 peng et al 2022b it was suggested that the plastisphere in water had a more diverse community structure than the surrounding water and the biofilm on rock or leaf wu et al 2019 although the microbial structure and composition of plastisphere were investigated knowledge of the microbial function characteristics of the plastisphere remains limited microorganisms are crucial undertakers of some environmental functions in the aquatic ecosystem such as nutrient cycling and biodegradation of organic pollutants ghattas et al 2017 hutchins and fu 2017 it is estimated that the microbial biomass attached to mps accounts for more than 6 of the total mass in the aquatic ecosystems moret ferguson et al 2010 therefore plastisphere are assumed to affect the degradation of some organic pollutants in aquatic environment tu et al 2020 antibiotics have been identified as an emerging contaminant yang et al 2018 in 2015 antibiotic consumption was 42 billion daily and this figure is expected to increase by 200 by 2030 klein et al 2018 animal husbandry is one of the worst hit areas of antibiotic pollution the sewage water usually contains high antibiotic concentrations and could flow into the urban water system murata et al 2011 as a widely used antibiotic in animal husbandry and aquaculture liyanage and manage 2019 tetracycline tc was freqently detected in water environment sometimes with high concentrations of hundreds of milligrams per liter li et al 2008 higher tc concentration of 2 6 mg l was even reported in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent hou et al 2016 biodegradation is the main route of antibiotic degradation miran et al 2018 and biofilm microorganisms on solid surfaces usually have a higher capacity to degrade organic pollutants than the free microorganisms in water flemming et al 2016 although antibiotics and mp contaminations often coexist in wwtps and urban water environments wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 characteristics of antibiotics degradation by the plastisphere remain to be identified besides antibiotic pollution in urban waters enriches antibiotic resistance genes args liu et al 2019 xue et al 2020 higher abundance of args in microbes in the plastisphere than in the surrounding water and natural substrate biofilms have been reported in some studies wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however this enrichment remains controversial peng et al 2022a in order to further understand the effect of the interaction between mps and antibiotics on the degradation of antibiotics in the plastisphere and the enrichment characteristics of args in the plastisphere effects of biodegradable and non biodegradable mps and mineral particles on tc biodegradation in urban river water was studied and the tc degradation ability of the re incubated biofilms on different particles was compared the

biofilms after 28 days different amounts of tc disappeared in the river water of the three treatments i e pla pvc and quartzite based on the background adsorption experiment with sterilization water the adsorption capacities of tc on pla pvc and quartzite were 3 77 4 36 and 2 57 respectively fig s5 p 0 05 after deducting the influence of adsorption the water containing quartzite biofilm exhibited the highest tc degradation efficiency 23 9 followed by that containing pla biofilm 17 3 and pvc biofilm 16 7 in amended water while the ck presented a significantly lower degradation efficiency of 11

involved in the degradation of tc shao et al 2019 in different biofilms the abundance of three major functional genes eutg acee and dlat related to tc degradation was further quantified to explain the different tc degradation abilities of the three biofilms the quartzite biofilm harbored the highest abundance of acee 4 01e 4 followed by the biofilms on pvc 3 33e 4 and pla 2 68e 4 fig 5 a comparably the dlat annotation also showed a significantly higher abundance in quartzite biofilm 6 95e 4 than in pvc 6 00e 4 and pla 5 48e 4 biofilms compared with acee and dlat the abundance of eutg was much lower in the particle biofilms ranging from 3 03e 7 to 4 83e 6 no differences were observed in the three biofilms tc can be biodegraded through demethylation dehydrogenation decarbonylation and deamination leng et al 2016 the quartzite biofilm harbored the highest abundance of the metabolic pathways in dehydrogenation deamination and decarbonylation 3 54e 3 1 92e 4 and 2 97e 7 which were all significantly higher than that in pla and pvc biofilms fig s6 metabolism was the most abundant functional category in level 1 fig s7 while the amino acid metabolism 11 61 14 05 and carbohydrate metabolism 10 27 12 28 were dominated among metabolism function in biofilms in level 2 fig 5b as for the top 30 kegg pathway in level 3 biosynthesis of secondary metabolites 2 37 2 73 microbial metabolism in diverse environments 1 58 1 96 biosynthesis of amino acids 0 91 1 03 and carbon metabolism 0 86 1 01 were the 4 major metabolism pathways fig s8 the quartzite biofilm had a higher relative abundance than pla and pvc biofilms in most of the functional metabolism in levels 2 and 3 and presented a significant difference in several pathways including atp binding cassette transporter the two component system and quorum sensing fig s8 3 4 occurrence of args in biofilms in the simulation experiment four tc resistance genes teta tetc tetm and tetx and an integrase gene inti1 were detected in particle biofilms after 28 days compared to the pla and pvc biofilms after 28 days incubation 2 05e 5 copies cm2 and 1 67e 5 copies cm2 the quartzite biofilm had a significantly lower args absolute abundance of 5 20e 4 copies cm2 p 0 05 fig 6 a the relative abundance reached the same result that quartzite biofilm 1 12e 2 was significantly lower than pla and pvc biofilms 1 81e 2 and 2 00e 2 p 0 05 fig 6b in addition the absolute and relative abundances of inti1 in the pla biofilm 1 82e 5 copies cm2 and 1 61e 2 and the pvc biofilm 1 43e 5 copies cm2 and 1 75e 2 were also significantly higher than that of the quartzite biofilm 6 04e 4 copies cm2 and 1 30e 2 p 0 05 fig s9 a confirmatory experiment was conducted to verify the selective colonization of args on mps particles under the consistent tc stress pla pvc and quartzite particles were incubated in the same microcosm with a continuous 0 0 5 and 1 mg l tc for 14 d without tc adding args absolute and relative abundances on mps were higher than those on quartzite however the differences did not reach a significant level fig s10 in the treatments with 0 5 and 1 mg l tc significantly higher absolute and relative abundances of args were observed on mps and the difference was more significant as the tc concentration increased fig s10 for example in 0 5 mg l tc treatment the relative abundances of args in pla and pvc biofilms were 1 46 and 1 36 times those in quartzite biofilm while the values were 1 86 and 1 75 times in 1 mg l tc treatment based on the kegg annotation in metagenomic analysis the leading bacterial hosts of args in biofilms were harbored by pseudomonas unclassified flavobacteriaceae and actinobacteria fig 7 a the abundance of these genera in both of the pla and pvc biofilms were higher than that in the quartzite biofilm fig 7a which was consistent with the difference of args in different biofilms fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 distinctive bacterial composition among three biofilms overall particle surface community categories were consistent with surrounding water in all experiment groups fig 1 indicating that the river water environment serves as a bacterial source however the community proportion differed and particle biofilms harbored the specific bacterial communities a different microbial community structure colonized on the plastic surface compared to surrounding water has been frequently reported de tender et al 2015 li et al 2021 zettler et al 2013 in freshwater and seawater environments the plastisphere and surrounding water had significant distinctions in some genera such as mycoplana erythromicrobium rhodoferax zymomonas and polaromonas gonzalez pleiter et al 2021 previous research found that the mineral surface biofilm and surrounding water were also different in some phyla s microbial communities including proteobacteria firmicutes chlorobi and cyanobacteria wu et al 2019 compared to quartzite biofilm similar biomass and bacterial communities were observed in two mps pla and pvc biofilms fig 1 s3 considering the same incubation environment the different biomass and bacterial communities in three biofilms could be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the substances i e bioavailability surface charge and hydrophobicity during the long term cultivation pla and pvc two plastic polymers might be degraded by a few microorganisms and enzymes feng et al 2002 nakamiya et al 2005 qi et al 2017 especially for pla a biodegradable material the degradation products of small molecules i e monomer and oligomer can be easily utilized by the colonized microorganisms hakkarainen 2001 leading to higher nutrient levels and significantly higher biomass on plastic surfaces in comparison as a mineral matrix quartzite could not generate nutritional source for microorganisms in the extracts of three particles incubated for 28 days toc was in the order of pla pvc quartzite p 0 05 fig s11 in addition the plastic degrading microorganisms will gain nutritional advantages in plastisphere which may also affect the community structure of biofilms five genera among the reported pla degrading bacteria qi et al 2017 were detected in the pla biofilms in this study and four of them were higher than those in the pvc and quartzite biofilms fig 1 similarly the abundance of the genus of an identified pvc degrading bacteria i e bacillus giacomucci et al 2019 was higher in the biofilm of pvc than that of pla and quartzite fig 1 besides the electrical charge on the plastic surface affects the colonization of microorganisms on its surface due to the charge modification of the polyethylene surface the cell adhesion density of escherichia coli on a positively charged surface was 23 times higher than that on a negatively charged surface terada et al 2012 in the biofilm formation process the electrostatic attraction or overcoming electrostatic repulsion could lead to initial adhesion between cells and the matrix palmer et al 2007 wang et al 2021 pzc of most bacterial cells is approximately 3 4 causing a negative charge of bacterial cells in most environments soni et al 2008 the different pzcs of materials i e 3 4 for pla 2 8 for pvc and 1 3 for quartzite may lead to different adsorption potential of microorganisms on different surfaces polymer hydrophilicity hydrophobicity can also affect the surface community it is reported that bacteria with strong surface hydrophobicity are more likely to attach to hydrophobic surfaces while the bacteria with strong hydrophilicity are inclined to the hydrophilic surface cerca et al 2005 in this work the contact angles of pla pvc and quartzite are 77 8 91 25 and 0 respectively fig s12 suggesting that the surface of mps is highly hydrophobic generally microorganism surfaces with higher n c values are more hydrophobic and higher o c values are more hydrophilic desrousseaux et al 2013 gram positive bacteria have more peptidoglycan in the cytoderm contributing to higher n c and stronger hydrophobicity van roosmalen et al 2004 based on the bugbase predictions of bacterial phenotypes it was verified that the biofilms on mps surfaces had a significantly higher proportion of gram positive bacteria p 0 05 fig s13 although the two plastics are more hydrophobic than quartzite the pvc surface has a larger contact angle and is more hydrophobic fig s12 leading to a higher proportion of gram positive bacteria on the pvc surface fig s13 4 2 potential reasons for the different tc biodegradation capability of the particle biofilms a significantly higher tc degradation efficiency was detected in the quartzite amended water than that in mps amended water after 30 days of incubation p 0 05 fig 4a given that there is no significant difference in bacterial biomass and community structure in the three particle amended water fig 1 s3 it is inferred that the different microorganism communities in the biofilms of quartzite and mps result in this phenomenon furthermore the confirmatory experiment verified the above conjecture fig 4b in terms of the bacterial community in biofilms three phyla bacteroidota myxococcota and desulfobacterota and three genera norank f saprospiraceae norank f rhodobacteraceae and methyloversatilis were found significantly higher on the quartzite surface than that on mps fig 2 bacteroidota have been found to accelerate the removal efficiency of antibiotics in the electrolytic cell liang et al 2013 in wastewater treatment methyloversatilis was the dominant genus in the degradation of tc peng et al 2018 this might explain the higher tc biodegradation capacity of the surrounding water of the quartzite particles moreover the co occurrence network illustrated that the quartzite surface had rich and close interactions with different bacterial communities fig 3 it suggested that these interactions contribute to the cooperative behavior among microorganisms prompting tc degradation the biofilm on the quartzite surface presented remarkable tc biodegradable genes and pathways depending on the functional annotation of kegg the abundance of function annotated of both dehydrogenation and deamination was much higher on quartzite biofilm than that on pla and pvc biofilms fig s6 in addition the changes in hydrolysis ring opening and oxidation also occur in the tc removal associated with the encoding of the functional gene e g eutg acee and dlat by microorganisms shao et al 2019 there are more eutg and acee relative abundance on the quartzite surface than those on the pla and pvc surface manifesting higher abundance of tc degrading genes on quartzite and higher degradation capability fig 5a the greater fundamental metabolic capacity of microorganisms could promote the expression of environmental functions of the community including antibiotic degradation feng et al 2019 liao et al 2021 for example the citrate cycle and propanoate metabolism are two significant elementary metabolic pathways for major nutrients prompting tc biodegradation shao et al 2019 as for functional annotation in kegg level 2 quartzite surfaces always had a higher abundance in multiple fundamental metabolisms fig 5b four major metabolic pathways ec 2 3 1 12 ec 6 2 1 1 ec 1 1 1 1 and ec 1 2 4 1 about citrate cycle and propanoate metabolism were detected at higher abundance in quartzite biofilm than in pla and pvc biofilms fig 7b which may result in higher tc biodegradation the oligotrophic environment on the quartzite surface may contribute to the higher tc degradation capacity of quartzite biofilm in the re dissolving experiment the toc concentration on the mp surfaces was significantly higher than on the quartzite surface fig s11 illustrating that plastic surfaces discharge more organic carbon and favor microbial colonization compared to pla and pvc surfaces microorganisms on more oligotrophic quartzite have to utilize more tc deemed a carbon and energy source to promote their growth and reproduction during the incubation period in the relatively oligotrophic environment tc with the concentration of 1 mg l contributes to 19 2 toc according to the original river water 9 15 mg l and toc analyzer s determination principle therefore the microorganisms utilizing tc on oligotrophic quartzite surfaces may acquire a survival advantage it suggests that the functional microorganisms are retained and multiplied enhancing the efficiency of tc biodegradation this survival of the fittest mechanism is commonly applied to screening functional microorganisms angelidaki et al 2000 ma et al 2019 4 3 remarkable args enrichment in the plastisphere mp biofilms harbored a higher abundance of args than quartzite biofilm in the polluted river microcosm system many reports have observed that antibiotics were positively correlated to arg copies qiao et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 xu et al 2015 for example multiple args qnrs ermb and suli increased the correlation between absolute abundance and antibiotic concentration suggesting the positive enrichment under antibiotic pressure rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 the simulated experiment of args abundance verified that when three types of particles were incubated in the same environment without adding tc the absolute abundance and relative abundance of args on the mp s surface were also higher than those of quartzite based on the kegg annotation the leading arg carriers were actinobacter unclassified flavobacteriaceae and pseudomonas which is inconsistent with those potential tc degrading microorganisms in the previous studies unclassified flavobacteriaceae and pseudomonas have been the critical hosts for args wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 both metagenomic analysis and 16s rrna sequencing showed that these communities were more abundant on mps surfaces fig 7a s11 suggesting that the colonization preference of these bacterial communities on the mps surface resulted in the higher abundance of args in the plastisphere when the environmental stress of tc increased the differences in the abundance of args in the biofilms of mps and quartzite were further amplified fig s10 it was speculated that the different tc adsorption properties on the three particles caused the args enrichment on the mps surface the stronger adsorption of tc on the mps result in higher antibiotic stresses fig s5 thus further amplifying the advantages of bacteria carrying args during the colonization on mps and the abundance of args in the plastisphere 4 4 plastisphere bring higher health risk than mineral biofilm the integrase gene inti1 is commonly responsible for the args spreading through horizontal gene transfer hgt gillings et al 2015 given that args have become a critical global public health risk in this century qiao et al 2018 a higher abundance of inti1 was found on mps surface than that on quartzite fig s9 suggesting that the more abundant args on the mps surface have the greater potential to spread in the plastisphere and surrounding water the abundance of metabolic pathways associated with disease on the surface of three types of particles was explored based on the kegg database in most metabolic pathways associated with human diseases pla biofilm showed the highest relative abundance followed by pvc biofilm and the quartzite biofilm generally had the lowest relative abundance fig s14 the result illustrated that mps biofilm presented a higher pathogenic risk than a natural mineral particle the combination of higher pathogenic metabolic pathways and a higher abundance of args suggests that the plastisphere poses a higher health threat to organisms in the environment in addition mps float more easily in water than dense mineral particles andrady 2017 which could further increase the transport capacity of the plastisphere in water and the health threat of pathogenic microorganisms and args in the plastisphere it should be noted that more abundant args and metabolic pathways associated with the disease were observed on pla in the comparison of two mps figs 6 s14 biodegradable plastic is increasingly being promoted due to being environmentally friendly pla the most widely used biodegradable plastic has been developed and applied in the commercial fields such as packaging bags food boxes and straws siracusa et al 2008 considering that the degradation of degradable plastics in the environment is a long process such as pla was not degraded after 120 days in the soil environment kamiya et al 2007 when more biodegradable mps accumulate in the aquatic environment environmental threats must also be considered conclusions compared with the mineral surface biofilm plastisphere in the aquatic environment has no advantage in degrading tc antibiotic organic substances generated from mps provide more carbon sources to microbes than the mineral particles which can not only affect the biomass of plastispheres but also make the plastispheres less capable of degrading those unconventional carbons such as the refractory organic pollutants higher affinity of the mps surface to organic pollutants causes higher pollution stress in plastisphere which may in turn affect the microbiological characteristics of plastisphere more arg carried by plastispheres can be explained by the higher antibiotic stress on the surface of mps particles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

15693,sewage sludge is an important source for microplastics mps entering into environment hydrothermal treatment has been considered a promising method for reducing mps in sewage sludge however mps degradation characteristics and mechanism during sludge hydrothermal treatment are not fully understood in the study three common mps i e polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet were used to explore the effect of hydrothermal treatment on the properties of mps in sewage sludge the hydrothermally treated ht mps in sludge feature more broken and rougher surfaces with higher o containing functional groups in the sludge than those in water the dissolved leachates from the ht mps in the sludge show higher concentrations than the counterparts implying that certain components in sludge serve to promote the mp degradation and leaching during hydrothermal treatment three model components in the sludge including protein carbohydrate and sio2 were further investigated for their individual effects on the hydrothermal degradation of mps compared with those in water the ht mps in the protein and carbohydrate solutions show greater changes in the surface micro morphologies and carbonyl index and generate more leachates however the sio2 solution results in similar difference in the mps changes with the water solution indicating that organic components of sludge play a more critical role in the enhanced mps hydrothermal degradation than inorganic components the ht pet leads to more pronounced changes in the physicochemical and leaching characteristics than the ht pe and ps possibly due to more susceptible hydrolysis of the pet hydrothermal degradation of the mps is found to be mainly driven by depolymerization of the polymer and leaching of the plastics additives the findings imply that the sludge organic components significantly promote the mps aging and degradation during hydrothermal treatment and potential changes in the environmental risk of the treated mps upon their subsequent land applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics sewage sludge hydrothermal pretreatment physicochemical characteristics leaching characteristics potential risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps 5 mm have received extensive attention due to their potential threats to the environment de souza machado et al 2018 eerkes medrano et al 2015 ni et al 2020 wastewater contains a number of mps from personal care products and textile during the washing process mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 wei et al 2019b most of mps in the wastewater are trapped in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment processes resulting in high content of mps in sewage sludge carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 found that the contents of mps in sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the netherlands reached 4196 15 385 particles kg 1 dry sludge li et al found that the average abundance of mps in sewage sludge in china was 22 7 12 1 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge li et al 2018 the total amount of mps entering the soil in europe and north america reaches 63 000 430 000 tons year 1 and 44 000 300 000 tons year 1 with the land application of sewage sludge respectively nizzetto et al 2016 sewage sludge is an important source for the mps entering the soil which has a negative impact on soil properties soil functions and biodiversity and thereby causing damage to terrestrial ecosystems he et al 2018 in addition mps are a carrier to adsorb organic pollutants heavy metals etc to cause composite pollution and release pollutants under certain circumstances affecting organisms koelmans et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore the mps in sewage sludge and its potential environmental risks deserve to pay great attention sewage sludge often contains various pollutants such as heavy metals antibiotics and pathogenic bacteria therefore many treatments such as dewatering anaerobic digestion and composting are often applied to reduce the sludge amount or stabilize the sludge before it enters to environment yang et al 2015 studies have found that the treatment processes have an important effect on the content and physicochemical characteristics of mps in sewage sludge mahon et al 2017 zubris and richards 2005 mahon et al reported that the content of mps in sludge is reduced after anaerobic digestion treatment the mps are fragmented and their particle sizes become relatively small after alkali and lime stabilization treatment the surface of mps melts and foams after thermal drying mahon et al 2017 chen et al found that ultra high temperature composting results in a higher removal rate of mps 43 7 compared with the traditional composting 4 5 due to the higher temperature chen et al 2020 ni et al found that pyrolysis can effectively control the mps in sewage sludge but suggested that at least 450 c is required to avoid potential environmental risks induced by incomplete pyrolysis ni et al 2020 however information on effects of sludge treatment processes on the physicochemical properties of mps is still limited gaining the related knowledge is very important for understanding that environmental risks of the mps occurring in the practical sewage sludge given that the sludge treatment can exert the potential influence on the mps properties li et al 2019 liu et al 2020a hydrothermal treatment is a process in which sewage sludge is heated and converted into useful resources in water or other suitable solvents at certain temperatures and pressures huang and yuan 2016 in recent decades hydrothermal treatment has been widely studied and used to tackle the ever growing disposal challenges of sewage sludge chand et al 2022 hydrothermal treatment effectively reduces the environmental risk of micropollutants being released to farmlands silva thomsen et al 2020 several studies reported mps degradation during hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge chand et al found that the hydrothermal treatment causes a decrease in the amount of mps significantly and reduces the movement of mps from the sewage sludge into the terrestrial environment chand et al 2022 xu and bai showed that mps in sewage sludge experience a 79 reduction after hydrothermal treatment at 260 c xu and bai 2022 bai et al 2020 conducted a gasification experiment on polycarbonate pc mps in supercritical water and found that a strong free radical reaction occurs in supercritical water destroying the original structure of pc mps compared with the pyrolysis hydrothermal treatment utilizes a lower temperature and does not require the pretreatment to remove the water from the sludge zaker et al 2019 therefore the hydrothermal treatment can be a promising method for reducing mps in sewage sludge however degradation characteristics of mps and the associated mechanisms during the hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge is not fully understood sewage sludge often contains a lot of organic and inorganic matters such as biomolecules e g protein and carbohydrate and sio2 dai et al 2017 liu et al 2020b it is necessary to explore the individual roles of sludge organic and inorganic components played in the degradation of mps during hydrothermal treatment to deeply clarify the degradation mechanism of sludge based mps during the hydrothermal treatment the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the changes in physicochemical characteristics and leaching contents of mps in sewage sludge during hydrothermal treatment 2 explore the effect of protein carbohydrate and sio2 components in sewage sludge on the mps hydrothermal degradation characteristics and 3 understand transformation pathways of mps during hydrothermal treatment through several characterization tools of dissolved organic matters doms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and equipment sewage sludge was collected from the wusong wwtps in haijiang road baoshan district shanghai china and the physicochemical characteristics are as follows total solid ts 21 59 0 16 volatile solid vs ts 53 43 0 16 protein 42 77 4 98 mg g 1 dry weight and carbohydrate 9 90 1 79

polyethylene pe ps and pet were chosen the sizes were less than 5 mm and their colors were blue white and green respectively to facilitate further identification standard bovine serum albumin was purchased from aladdin industrial corp shanghai china and other reagents were obtained from sinopharm group corp shanghai china the hydrothermal reactor is shown in fig s1 it consisted of a stainless steel kettle cover kettle body and lined gland and polytetrafluoroethylene liner with a capacity of 50 ml specific operation of the hydrothermal test included the steps to mix the mps particles with the solution put the mixtures in the inner liner compact the liner with a liner gland and to seal the reactor tightly the reactor was then placed in a muffle furnace and heated to the desired temperature at 10 c min 1 2 2 hydrothermal treatment of sludge based mps the mps content was set at 0 5 in the sewage sludge wet weight according to the value previously reported for sewage sludge li et al 2018 0 1 g of each mp was added to the hydrothermal reactor containing 20 g of sewage sludge after evenly stirred the reactor was sealed and placed in a muffle furnace the hydrothermal temperature and time was set to 220 and 5 h respectively according to our preliminary experiment fig s2 in which the variation of the leached amount from the mps was stable a control group was prepared using deionized water instead of sewage sludge control a while another control group comprised the sewage sludge without any mp addition control b at the end of hydrothermal treatment the substrates were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min and then the supernatants were filtered with nylon 66 microporous membrane 0 45 μm the filtrate was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for analysis of doms leached from the mps the remaining solid residues of mps were taken out from the reaction kettle and then placed in a clean petri dish and dried at room temperature for characterizing mp physicochemical properties each group was treated in triplicate 2 3 effect of sludge organic and inorganic components bovine serum albumin anhydrous glucose and micro sized sio2 were used as model protein carbohydrate and inorganic components in the sludge respectively dai et al 2017 wei et al 2019a their contents in the artificial sewage sludge solutions were set to 10 g l 1 2 g l 1 and 100 g l 1 using deionized water respectively according to their ranges in the real sewage sludge dai et al 2017 0 1 g of each mp was added to 20 ml of the three individual solutions respectively and then the mixtures were put into the reaction kettle and heated to 220 c in a muffle furnace with the constant temperature for 5 h other operation procedures including the collection of doms and solid residues were same as the above hydrothermal test of the sludge based mps the artificial solutions containing the protein carbohydrate or sio2 only without the mps were added to the reaction kettle as a control group control c each treatment was conducted in triplicate 2 4 characterization methods for mps physicochemical properties the mps in the solid residues from sludge hydrothermal treatment were extracted using the density separation li et al 2020 while those from pure water and simulated solutions were rinsed with deionized water for several times micro morphologies of the virgin and hydrothermally treated ht mps were observed using high power optical microscope with axiocam 506 color digital camera twenty particles of the mps were randomly collected and their sizes were measured using image j software scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was made using hitachi su 1500 sem japan hitachi high technologies corporation to investigate the changes in the mps surface

using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytikjena jena germany the dcod and doc contents of the doms leached from the mps in the sludge were quantified by the difference between the sludge groups with and without any mp addition while those in the simulated solution between the simulated groups with and without any mp addition fluorescence excitation and emission matrix eem analysis was conducted

fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units using the fluorescence intensity of the integrated raman peak at 350 nm em lawaetz and stedmon 2009 a ultra performance liquid chromatography instrument uplc agilent 1290 infinity ii coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof ms system was employed to analyze the dom samples lian et al 2020 in brief the filtrate samples of 20 μl from ht mps in the water solution were loaded on a c18 column 150 3 mm 2 7 μm poroshell 120 agilent technologies with the thermostat set to 30 c the mobile phase was set at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 to separate the samples using the positive ion esi mode with acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid or the negative ion esi mode with acetonitrile hrms agilent 6540 qtof ms with an agilent jet stream

3 results and discussion 3 1 mps changes by sludge hydrothermal treatment 3 1 1 surface characteristics of ht mps in the sewage sludge as shown in fig 1 the changes in micro morphologies of pe ps and pet in sewage sludge after hydrothermal treatment are different from those in water the pe and ps sizes in the water increase after the treatment with no change in the colors in contrast for the sewage sludge the colors turn to blue black and yellow but there is no variation about the sizes the results imply that the sludge solution operates to prevent the agglomeration of the mps coating the surface of mps during hydrothermal treatment different from the pe and ps the ht pet becomes smaller in water solution after the treatment while in the sludge it becomes powder like and indiscoverable the unique feature of the pet can be explained by its depolymerization into monomers or intermediate oligomers due to the hydrolysis of its functional ester groups during the hydrothermal treatment barnard et al 2021 kosloski oh et al 2021 the pet exhibits a greater extent of the change in the sludge than in the water after hydrothermal treatment implying that the sludge solution plays a role in promoting the pet degradation as shown in fig s3 the sem micrograph of the ht pe has rougher surface in the sludge and water compared to the virgin pe implying that the hydrothermal treatment stimulated the significant aging of the mps compared with water solution the sludge solution induces the ht pe to be much rougher and to have a lot of additional fine particle and pore like structures which agreed well with the results of the micro morphologies as shown in fig 2 the ftir spectra of the ht mps in the water are similar to those of virgin mps while there is a notable difference in sludge solution ht pe in the sludge show weaker peaks at 2911 2843 1460 and 720 cm 1 and stronger peaks at 3452 1610 1537 and 1027 cm 1 than the virgin pe in their spectra similarly the peak intensities in the spectra of ps are markedly enhance at 3490 1703 and 1069 cm 1 in the sludge after hydrothermal treatment the results indicate that hydrothermal treatment leads to a decrease in ch bond and an increase in oh nh co and carbonyl groups on the pe and ps surface in the sludge on the contrary characteristic peaks of the ht pet become weaker at 2966 1717 1265 1130 and 880 cm 1 and two additional peaks are found at 3491 and 3452 cm 1 implying a decrease in c o co and ch groups and an increase in nh bonds after hydrothermal treatment the results can be attributed to the thermal oxidation and decomposition of the pet to o containing compounds during hydrothermal treatment xu and bai 2022 and the attachment of sludge organic matter such as protein nh bond and carbohydrate oh during the mps melting li et al 2019 wijesekara et al 2018 the characteristic peaks of the pet feature even have greater reduction after treatment and nearly disappear in the sludge implying the occurrence of severe degradation on the pet surface after hydrothermal treatment previous studies showed that the extent of polymer degradation such as the ease of chain scission depends on its chemical structure haider et al 2019 liguori et al 2021 degradation and depolymerization of polyesters such as pet is often easier to occur than those of polyolefins such as pe and ps as the absence of functional groups in the hydrocarbon skeleton causes more intrinsic chemical resistance of the polyolefins versus the polyesters liguori et al 2021 ci is further used to quantitatively describe the changes of thermal oxidized properties of the mps surface during hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge li et al 2020 liu et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the ci values of ht pe and ps in the water and sludge solutions are higher than the corresponding virgin mps implying that the hydrothermal treatment induces the aging degradation of pe and ps surface the ht mps in sludge solution exhibit a higher ci value than those in water solution corresponding the above sem and ftir results suggesting that the sludge solution promotes hydrothermal degradation of the mps however the opposite trend is observed for the ci value of ht pet after the treatment possibly due to the decarbonylation of pet during hydrothermal treatment chia et al 2020 huang et al 2022 another possible reason is that hydrothermal treatment functions to convert fiber like pet into powder like form causing its difficult extraction from sewage sludge and thus the ci may reflect the mixture of powder like pet and organic matter in sewage sludge 3 1 2 dcod and doc leached from ht mps in the sewage sludge the aging process does not only cause the changes in the surface characteristics of the mps but also promotes the releasing of plastic monomers oligomers and additives shi et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the dcod and doc contents of the ht sludge are much higher than that of raw sludge implying that hydrothermal treatment promote the dissolution of sludge organic matter xiao and zhou 2020 xu and jiang 2017 yan et al 2022 the ht sludge with mp addition has higher dcod and doc than that without any mp addition implying that the mps in the sludge are leached by their degradation during the hydrothermal process enhancing doms contents of ht sludge as shown in fig 3b and 3d dcod and doc concentrations of the leachates from ht mps in sludge solution are higher than those in mp containing water solution the results imply that mps leaching is more pronounced in the sewage solution than in water upon hydrothermal treatment sewage sludge is a complex heterogeneous mixture consisting of organic e g protein carbohydrates and inorganic materials e g sio2 and metal ions liu et al 2020b which might promote the hydrothermal degradation and leaching of mps through participation into the reaction or as a catalyst study has found esters and aromatic acids from pistachio hulls can promote the degradation of pet and nylon 6 during hydrothermal liquefaction process hongthong et al 2020 the presence of organic matter of biomass could significantly inhibit the mps particles agglomeration during the hydrothermal treatment shen 2020 supporting the above results that the ht pe and ps in the water have larger size than the corresponding ht mps in the sludge fig 1 the doc and toc contents from the ht pet in the sludge are significantly higher than that from the ht pe and ps corroborating that the hydrothermal treatment has a greater effect on pet than the pe and ps as shown in fig s4 the ph values in the groups with mp addition are lower than the control group without mps after hydrothermal treatment both for the water and sludge the result suggest that some acid components are released or formed during the mps hydrothermal treatment the acidification can be attributed to the formation of carbonyl groups during the thermal oxidation for pe and ps zhou et al 2019 corresponding to the ci results and the generation of terephthalic acid during the ester hydrolysis for pet barnard et al 2021 the reduction in ph is less pronounced in sludge solution than in water solution although more doms are released from the mps during sludge hydrothermal treatment fig 3c and 3d possibly due to higher alkalinity and buffer capacity of the sewage sludge tian et al 2020 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2017 reported that the buffering function of the colloids in the sludge may play an important role in maintaining the ph stability wu et al 2021 found that humic acid and fulvic acid can limit the duration of aging and alterations of mp properties during long term weathering in natural waters therefore the relatively stable variation of ph values in the sludge implies low accumulation of acid products from plastic hydrothermal degradation which may reduce the inhibition of these acid products to the mps degradation li et al 2022 after hydrothermal treatment electrical conductivities of the sludge were measured to be 2920 3260 3325 and 3190 μs cm 1 for control pe ps and pet respectively but those in water solution are not detectable indicating the abundance of metal salts in the sludge mps containing sludge solution have higher electrical conductivity than the control b without mps it is possibly attributed to the leaching of metal containing additives in the mps during the hydrothermal treatment boyle et al 2020 capolupo et al 2020 3 2 effect of sludge components on mps hydrothermal degradation since the stimulating effects of sludge solution are confirmed on the changes of mp surface and leaching properties upon the hydrothermal treatment it is important as the next step to further identify the major sludge components to be responsible for the changes 3 2 1 surface characteristics of ht mps in the solutions fig s5 s7 show micro morphologies of the virgin and corresponding ht mps in the water sio2 protein and carbohydrate solutions no significant changes are observed after hydrothermal treatment except for the size of mps compared with the virgin mps the sizes of ht pe and ps increase but the ht pet size decreases in all the solutions fig s8 pe ps and pet are the thermoplastics the mps are likely melted during the hydrothermal treatment and then agglomerated together and become larger flakes when cooled to room temperature therefore the particle sizes of pe and ps tend to become larger after hydrothermal treatment the aliphatic polyester such as pet is highly susceptible to hydrolytic degradation and thus the reduction of pet size results from the hydrolysis and depolymerization reaction during hydrothermal treatment causing the chain scission fambri et al 2020 xu and bai 2022 the ht pe and ps particles in the water solution have similar sizes with those in the simulated solutions with sio2 protein or carbohydrate but possesses larger size for pet particle implying that the organic and inorganic groups in the sludge have great impact on the pet size but not on the pe and ps sizes during the hydrothermal treatment the difference for pet is the most pronounced in the solution containing carbohydrate it is likely that the sludge components promote the pet hydrolysis and degradation through the catalytic and synergistic effect barnard et al 2021 kosloski oh et al 2021 seshasayee and savage 2021 sem analysis shows that some particle like materials presents on the mps surfaces in the sio2 solution after hydrothermal treatment fig 4 implying the attachment of the silica the results indicate that the mineral component in sludge is able to attach on the mps surface altering the micro morphology results of the ht mps in the sludge fig 1 the mps surfaces present uneven fracture and tiny pores like structure in the protein and carbohydrate solutions after hydrothermal treatment especially for pet the changes are more obvious than that in the water solution the results imply that the two sludge components could promote the mps aging and degradation during the hydrothermal treatment with the synergistic effect on the hydrothermal aging and degradation of the mps it agrees with the previous findings that the biomolecules such as cellulose starch and lignin facilitate the hydrothermal degradation of the plastics seshasayee and savage 2020 2021 ftir spectra were used to further investigate the effect of sio2 protein and carbohydrate in the sludge on the changes in the surface functional groups of the mps during hydrothermal treatment as shown fig s9 compared with the virgin mps the characteristic peaks of the mps show no substantial changes in all the solutions after hydrothermal treatment except for pe and ps in the sio2 solution the results imply that the sludge organic and inorganic components have little influence on surface functional composition of the mps during hydrothermal treatment the ht pe and ps in the sio2 solution present an increase in the peak intensities at 1100 cm 1 relating to the anti symmetric stretching vibration absorption of si o indicating the attachment of sio2 on the mps surface in accordance with the above sem results fig 4 as shown in table s2 the cis of ht mps in the solutions have a decreasing sequence as followings carbohydrate sio2 water protein for pe carbohydrate protein sio2 water for ps and water sio2 protein carbohydrate for pet the results imply that both of the protein and carbohydrate have a greater influence than the inorganic component such as sio2 for ps and pet however protein leads to a decrease in ci values and the carbohydrate causes an increase for pe seshasayee and savage also found that carbohydrate such as cellulose and starch promoted the plastics degradation but protein such as soy protein did not during hydrothermal liquefaction seshasayee and savage 2020 2021 the related mechanism deserves to further investigation 3 2 2 dcod and doc contents leached from ht mps in the solutions as shown in fig 5a and 5b the doms leached from the ht mps in the protein and carbohydrate solutions have higher dcod and doc contents than that in water solution the results imply that the sludge organic matter such as protein and carbohydrate promote the hydrothermal leaching degradation of the mps as supported by the sem and ci results the dissolution and decomposition of biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins in sewage sludge often occurs during hydrothermal treatment wang and li 2015 low molecular weight groups from their decomposition such as peptides dipeptides amino acids and glucose might act as active donor during the chain scission of the mps yuan et al 2009 compared with the carbohydrate solutions the protein solution results in the higher dcod and doc leaching from the ht mps meanwhile the protein solution shows higher ph values and electrical conductivities after hydrothermal treatment implying greater buffer capacity and more metal ions fig 5c and 5d the possible explanation is that amino acids from protein decomposition are transformed to the basic groups such as ammonia at a temperature above 190 sun et al 2013 the results explain the higher mps leaching degradation in the protein solution resulting from the lower inhibition of acid products and higher catalysis of metals barnard et al 2021 kosloski oh et al 2021 compared with the carbohydrate solution the dcod and doc contents from the ht mps in the sio2 solution are similar to or even lower than those in the water implying that the sio2 has limited catalytic effect on the mps leaching degradation during the hydrothermal treatment but prevent the mps agglomeration during sludge hydrothermal treatment in addition the ht pet has higher dcod and doc contents and lower ph values than ht pe and ps in all the solutions implying greater pet leaching degradation during hydrothermal treatment corresponding to the results from the ht mps in the sewage sludge fig 3c and 3d 3 3 chemical characteristics of the doms leached from ht mps 3 3 1 fluorescent eems analysis fluorescent eems were used to further characterize the doms leached from the mps and the spectra are shown in fig 6 the spectra of doms from the ht pe and ps have the similar four peaks while the ht pet exhibits only two peaks in its spectrum as shown in table 2 ex em pairs of the peaks from the pe and ps are located at 200 305 nm and 215 305 nm for peak 1 275 305 nm and 270 305 nm for peak 2 225 405 nm and 225 395 nm for peak 3 and 280 400 nm and 300 405 nm for peak 4 respectively in accordance with the previous studies lee et al 2020 2021 peak 1 and peak 2 belong to the phenol like fluorescent groups while peak 3 and peak 4 relate to the humic acid like substances respectively lee et al 2020 2021 the results imply that the fluorescent composition is similar between pe and ps derived dom which likely originate from the plastics additives and chain scission shi et al 2021 however the ht ps reveals higher fluorescence peak intensities in dom compared to the pe derived dom despite the similar dcod and doc contents between the pe and ps the result can be explained by the styrene monomer of the ps which tends to generate more phenol like and aromatic fluorescent groups during the hydrothermal treatment compared with the pe seshasayee and savage 2020 the pet derived dom shows the two peaks peaks i and ii at 255 335 nm and 290 330 nm respectively implying that the doms is mainly composed of the phenol like groups as previously demonstrated by the sem and ci analyses the greater tendency of aging degradation upon hydrothermal treatment for pet versus pe and ps might result in the high generation it might generate high contents of plastic monomer and oligomer such as terephthalic acid like materials during the pet hydrolysis which are closely associated with the peak i and peak ii the fluorescent peaks might be an applicable method to rapidly monitor the plastic chain scission degree and additives releasing amount lee et al 2021 3 3 2 uplc qtof ms analysis molecular composition of the doms formed and leached from the ht mps are analyzed using uplc qtof ms to further understand the degradation process and mechanisms of the mps 281 161 and 434 features are gained in the esi mode for pe ps and pet while 410 260 and 598 features are recorded in the esi mode respectively implying that more features are found in the esi mode meanwhile the ion intensities of top 50 individual doms from the mps in esi mode are also lower than that from the corresponding mps in esi mode tables s3 s5 the results imply that the doms are ionized better in the esi mode than in the esi mode compared with the pe and ps doms from the pet have more features detected and higher ion intensity implying that the pet has more individual doms released during the hydrothermal treatment in accordance with the above results from the dcod and doc contents the formula of some main features are further detected according to the self constructed and nist database which are shown in tables s6 s8 a lot of o containing groups are found in the leachates of the ht mps the results imply that the hydrothermal oxidization of the mps causes the generation of vast carboxyl groups acid products during hydrothermal treatment in accordance with the results of the ci and ph values the individual doms mostly consist of monomers oligomers and plastic leachates of the mps and their hydrothermal degradation products therefore possible degradation pathways of the three mps during hydrothermal treatment are gained and outlined in fig 7 which can be divided into two main pathways i e depolymerization of the mps and leaching of the plastics additives the pe polymers are produced by the copolymerization of ethylene and a functionalized vinyl monomer berda et al 2006 the pe can be depolymerized through a free radical reaction during hydrothermal treatment and might involve three main processes i e chain initiation free radical reaction and termination reaction barontini et al 2004 firstly pe is cracked into olefin monomers double bonds of some olefins are eliminated through the addition reaction to form alkyl radicals then alkyl radicals undergo addition reaction with oxygen and hydroxyl radicals in the autoclave to form carboxylates acids or aldehydes and ketones long chain compounds may be hydrolyzed by chain scission into corresponding short chain compounds during hydrothermal treatment due to the combined action of high temperature and high pressure similarly the ps depolymerization may be conducted through zip and random chain breaking delre et al 2021 yeung et al 2021 ps is firstly cracked into styrene monomer or other benzene homologs through zip depolymerization the monomers and oligomers may be further cracked into olefins and benzene rings for example the formation of 1 1 dibenzylethene comes from the thermal cracking of polystyrene and then some oxygen containing compounds are formed by the combination of methyl radical and hydrogen radical or the combination of phenyl and alkyl radical like the pe and ps pet is the copolymer obtained from two polymerized monomers of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol barnard et al 2021 pet often forms ester bonds by cross esteration of carboxyl and hydroxyl to increase the molecular weight however a large number of ester bonds are highly susceptible to protons at high temperature the protons in the water can be activated during hydrothermal treatment the original ester bonds of pet become very unstable and prone to fracture due to the proton attack then long chains of the pet are broken slowly forming a short chain with a lower molecular weight until they are broken down into polymer monomers barnard et al 2021 in the study pet may be firstly depolymerized to bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate bhet and then hydrolyzed into esters and benzoic acid in addition to chain scission the plastics additives are leached during hydrothermal treatment the additives leached from the pe include phthalate benzoic acid terephthalic acid dibutyl phthalate tributyl phosphate apart from the terephthalic acid and tributyl phosphate the ps additives also contain salicylic acid and fluore 9 one compared with the pe and ps more plastics additives are found in the doms from the pet the possible reason is that the pet synthesis process is more complex than pe and ps plastics due to more plastic additives incorporated during the pet production process 3 4 implication of this study the above results imply that sludge hydrothermal treatment results in a great effect on the surface and leaching characteristics of the mps such as an increase in surface roughness and o containing functional groups on the mps and the releasing of the dissolved leachates due to the promotion of sludge organic components jiang et al 2022 reported that the ht mps have an increasing inhibitory effect on anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge due to the acceleration of the released toxic plastic additives therefore the aging of mps during hydrothermal treatment maybe enhance the potential risk of subsequent sludge land applications to soil environment which needs to further investigate in addition the pet shows a more considerable degradation than the pe and ps during sludge hydrothermal treatment and the degradation is almost complete the result confirms that hydrothermal treatment is a promising method to reduce the sludge based mps since pet is one of the most common mps in the sewage sludge madon et al 2017 wei et al 2021 it deserves to further explore the decomposition feasibility of other mps in sludge hydrothermal process and the potential effect of the mps degradation products on environment 4 conclusions the ht mps in sludge retain rougher surfaces with more o containing functional groups releasing higher contents of leachates compared with those in water solution indicating that organic and inorganic components contained in sludge exert a synergistic effect on the mps degradation during hydrothermal treatment the changes depended on mp types compared with pe and ps pet shows greater changes in the physicochemical and leaching characteristics after hydrothermal treatment due to more susceptible hydrolysis of the ester bonds in the pet sludge organic components such as protein and carbohydrate demonstrate their enhancing effects on the mps aging and degradation during hydrothermal treatment the effect is more obvious for pet as low molecular weight substances produced from the decomposition might act as an active donor to promote the mps chain scission inorganic component in sludge such as sio2 exhibits limited effect on the mps hydrothermal degradation while it tends to attach to the mps surface preventing the agglomeration of mps in sludge the ht driven mps degradation seems to operate through two main pathways one is via the depolymerization into monomers and oligomer such as bhet and the other is via the leaching of the plastics additives such as phthalate the findings of the present study provide new insights into the changes in the physicochemical and the leaching characteristics of mps existing in sludge during hydrothermal treatment it deserves further investigating of potential environmental risks

15693,sewage sludge is an important source for microplastics mps entering into environment hydrothermal treatment has been considered a promising method for reducing mps in sewage sludge however mps degradation characteristics and mechanism during sludge hydrothermal treatment are not fully understood in the study three common mps i e polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet were used to explore the effect of hydrothermal treatment on the properties of mps in sewage sludge the hydrothermally treated ht mps in sludge feature more broken and rougher surfaces with higher o containing functional groups in the sludge than those in water the dissolved leachates from the ht mps in the sludge show higher concentrations than the counterparts implying that certain components in sludge serve to promote the mp degradation and leaching during hydrothermal treatment three model components in the sludge including protein carbohydrate and sio2 were further investigated for their individual effects on the hydrothermal degradation of mps compared with those in water the ht mps in the protein and carbohydrate solutions show greater changes in the surface micro morphologies and carbonyl index and generate more leachates however the sio2 solution results in similar difference in the mps changes with the water solution indicating that organic components of sludge play a more critical role in the enhanced mps hydrothermal degradation than inorganic components the ht pet leads to more pronounced changes in the physicochemical and leaching characteristics than the ht pe and ps possibly due to more susceptible hydrolysis of the pet hydrothermal degradation of the mps is found to be mainly driven by depolymerization of the polymer and leaching of the plastics additives the findings imply that the sludge organic components significantly promote the mps aging and degradation during hydrothermal treatment and potential changes in the environmental risk of the treated mps upon their subsequent land applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics sewage sludge hydrothermal pretreatment physicochemical characteristics leaching characteristics potential risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps 5 mm have received extensive attention due to their potential threats to the environment de souza machado et al 2018 eerkes medrano et al 2015 ni et al 2020 wastewater contains a number of mps from personal care products and textile during the washing process mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 wei et al 2019b most of mps in the wastewater are trapped in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment processes resulting in high content of mps in sewage sludge carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 found that the contents of mps in sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the netherlands reached 4196 15 385 particles kg 1 dry sludge li et al found that the average abundance of mps in sewage sludge in china was 22 7 12 1 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge li et al 2018 the total amount of mps entering the soil in europe and north america reaches 63 000 430 000 tons year 1 and 44 000 300 000 tons year 1 with the land application of sewage sludge respectively nizzetto et al 2016 sewage sludge is an important source for the mps entering the soil which has a negative impact on soil properties soil functions and biodiversity and thereby causing damage to terrestrial ecosystems he et al 2018 in addition mps are a carrier to adsorb organic pollutants heavy metals etc to cause composite pollution and release pollutants under certain circumstances affecting organisms koelmans et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore the mps in sewage sludge and its potential environmental risks deserve to pay great attention sewage sludge often contains various pollutants such as heavy metals antibiotics and pathogenic bacteria therefore many treatments such as dewatering anaerobic digestion and composting are often applied to reduce the sludge amount or stabilize the sludge before it enters to environment yang et al 2015 studies have found that the treatment processes have an important effect on the content and physicochemical characteristics of mps in sewage sludge mahon et al 2017 zubris and richards 2005 mahon et al reported that the content of mps in sludge is reduced after anaerobic digestion treatment the mps are fragmented and their particle sizes become relatively small after alkali and lime stabilization treatment the surface of mps melts and foams after thermal drying mahon et al 2017 chen et al found that ultra high temperature composting results in a higher removal rate of mps 43 7 compared with the traditional composting 4 5 due to the higher temperature chen et al 2020 ni et al found that pyrolysis can effectively control the mps in sewage sludge but suggested that at least 450 c is required to avoid potential environmental risks induced by incomplete pyrolysis ni et al 2020 however information on effects of sludge treatment processes on the physicochemical properties of mps is still limited gaining the related knowledge is very important for understanding that environmental risks of the mps occurring in the practical sewage sludge given that the sludge treatment can exert the potential influence on the mps properties li et al 2019 liu et al 2020a hydrothermal treatment is a process in which sewage sludge is heated and converted into useful resources in water or other suitable solvents at certain temperatures and pressures huang and yuan 2016 in recent decades hydrothermal treatment has been widely studied and used to tackle the ever growing disposal challenges of sewage sludge chand et al 2022 hydrothermal treatment effectively reduces the environmental risk of micropollutants being released to farmlands silva thomsen et al 2020 several studies reported mps degradation during hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge chand et al found that the hydrothermal treatment causes a decrease in the amount of mps significantly and reduces the movement of mps from the sewage sludge into the terrestrial environment chand et al 2022 xu and bai showed that mps in sewage sludge experience a 79 reduction after hydrothermal treatment at 260 c xu and bai 2022 bai et al 2020 conducted a gasification experiment on polycarbonate pc mps in supercritical water and found that a strong free radical reaction occurs in supercritical water destroying the original structure of pc mps compared with the pyrolysis hydrothermal treatment utilizes a lower temperature and does not require the pretreatment to remove the water from the sludge zaker et al 2019 therefore the hydrothermal treatment can be a promising method for reducing mps in sewage sludge however degradation characteristics of mps and the associated mechanisms during the hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge is not fully understood sewage sludge often contains a lot of organic and inorganic matters such as biomolecules e g protein and carbohydrate and sio2 dai et al 2017 liu et al 2020b it is necessary to explore the individual roles of sludge organic and inorganic components played in the degradation of mps during hydrothermal treatment to deeply clarify the degradation mechanism of sludge based mps during the hydrothermal treatment the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the changes in physicochemical characteristics and leaching contents of mps in sewage sludge during hydrothermal treatment 2 explore the effect of protein carbohydrate and sio2 components in sewage sludge on the mps hydrothermal degradation characteristics and 3 understand transformation pathways of mps during hydrothermal treatment through several characterization tools of dissolved organic matters doms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and equipment sewage sludge was collected from the wusong wwtps in haijiang road baoshan

the solution put the mixtures in the inner liner compact the liner with a liner gland and to seal the reactor tightly the reactor was then placed in a muffle furnace and heated to the desired temperature at 10 c min 1 2 2 hydrothermal treatment of sludge based mps the mps content was set at 0 5 in the sewage sludge wet weight according to the value previously reported for sewage sludge li

temperature and time was set to 220 and 5 h respectively according to our preliminary experiment fig s2 in which the variation of the leached amount from the mps was stable a control group was prepared using deionized water instead of sewage sludge control a while another control group comprised the sewage sludge without any mp addition control b at the end of hydrothermal treatment the substrates were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min and then the supernatants were filtered with nylon 66 microporous membrane 0 45 μm the filtrate was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for analysis of doms leached from the mps the remaining solid residues of mps were taken out from the reaction kettle and then placed in a clean petri dish and dried at room temperature for characterizing mp physicochemical properties each group was treated in triplicate 2 3 effect of sludge organic and inorganic components bovine serum albumin anhydrous glucose and micro sized sio2 were used as model protein carbohydrate and inorganic components in the sludge respectively dai et al 2017 wei et al 2019a their contents in the artificial sewage sludge solutions were set to 10 g l 1 2 g l 1 and 100 g

the mixtures were put into the reaction kettle and heated to 220 c in a muffle furnace with the constant temperature for 5 h other operation procedures including the collection of doms and solid residues were same as the above hydrothermal test of the sludge based mps the artificial solutions containing the protein carbohydrate or sio2 only without the mps were added to the reaction kettle as a control group control c each treatment was conducted in triplicate 2 4 characterization methods for mps physicochemical properties the mps in the solid residues from sludge hydrothermal treatment were extracted using the density separation li et al 2020 while those from pure water and simulated solutions were rinsed with deionized water for several times micro morphologies of the virgin and hydrothermally treated ht mps were observed using high power optical microscope with axiocam 506 color digital camera twenty particles of the mps were randomly collected and their sizes were measured using image j software scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was made using hitachi su 1500 sem japan hitachi high technologies corporation to investigate the changes in the mps surface

using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytikjena jena germany the dcod and doc contents of the doms leached from the mps in the sludge were quantified by the difference between the sludge groups with and without any mp addition while those in the simulated solution between the simulated groups with and without any mp addition fluorescence excitation and emission matrix eem analysis was conducted

instrument uplc agilent 1290 infinity ii coupled with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof ms system was employed to analyze the dom samples lian et al 2020 in brief the filtrate samples of 20 μl from ht mps in the water solution were loaded on a c18 column 150 3 mm 2 7 μm poroshell 120 agilent technologies with the thermostat set to 30 c the mobile phase was set at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 to separate the samples using the positive ion esi mode with acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid or the negative ion esi mode with acetonitrile hrms agilent 6540 qtof ms with an agilent jet stream

3 results and discussion 3 1 mps changes by sludge hydrothermal treatment 3 1 1 surface characteristics of ht mps in the sewage sludge as shown in fig 1 the changes in micro morphologies of pe ps and pet in sewage sludge after hydrothermal treatment are different from those in water the pe and ps sizes in the water increase after the treatment with no change in the colors in contrast for the sewage sludge the colors turn to blue black and yellow but there is no variation about the sizes the results imply that the sludge solution operates to prevent the agglomeration of the mps coating the surface of mps during hydrothermal treatment different from the pe and ps the ht pet becomes smaller in water solution after the treatment while in the sludge it becomes powder like and indiscoverable the unique feature of the pet can be explained by its depolymerization into monomers or intermediate oligomers due to the hydrolysis of its functional ester groups during the hydrothermal treatment barnard et al 2021 kosloski oh et al 2021 the pet exhibits a greater extent of the change in the sludge than in the water after hydrothermal treatment implying that the sludge solution plays a role in promoting the pet degradation as shown in fig s3 the sem micrograph of the ht pe has rougher surface in the sludge and water compared to the virgin pe implying that the hydrothermal treatment stimulated the significant aging of the mps compared with water solution the sludge solution induces the ht pe to be much rougher and to have a lot of additional fine particle and pore like structures which agreed well with the results of the micro morphologies as shown in fig 2 the ftir spectra of the ht mps in the water are similar to those of virgin mps while there is a notable difference in sludge solution ht pe in the sludge show weaker peaks at 2911 2843 1460 and 720 cm 1 and stronger peaks at 3452 1610 1537 and 1027 cm 1 than the virgin pe in their spectra similarly the peak intensities in the spectra of ps are markedly enhance at 3490 1703 and 1069 cm 1 in the sludge after hydrothermal treatment the results indicate that hydrothermal treatment leads to a decrease in ch bond and an increase in oh nh co and carbonyl groups on the pe and ps surface in the sludge on the contrary characteristic peaks of the ht pet become weaker at 2966 1717 1265 1130 and 880 cm 1 and two additional peaks are found at 3491 and 3452 cm 1 implying a decrease in c o co and ch groups and an increase in nh bonds after hydrothermal treatment the results can be attributed to the thermal oxidation and decomposition of the pet to o containing compounds during hydrothermal treatment xu and bai 2022 and the attachment of sludge organic matter such as protein nh bond and carbohydrate oh during the mps melting li et al 2019 wijesekara et al 2018 the characteristic peaks of the pet feature even have greater reduction after treatment and nearly disappear in the sludge implying the occurrence of severe degradation on the pet surface after hydrothermal treatment previous studies showed that the extent of polymer degradation such as the ease of chain scission depends on its chemical structure haider et al 2019 liguori et al 2021 degradation and depolymerization of polyesters such as pet is often easier to occur than those of polyolefins such as pe and ps as the absence of functional groups in the hydrocarbon skeleton causes more intrinsic chemical resistance of the polyolefins versus the polyesters liguori et al 2021 ci is further used to quantitatively describe the changes of thermal oxidized properties of the mps surface during hydrothermal treatment of sewage sludge li et al 2020 liu et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the ci values of ht pe and ps in the water and sludge solutions are higher than the corresponding virgin mps implying that the hydrothermal treatment induces the aging degradation of pe and ps surface the ht mps in sludge solution exhibit a higher ci value than those in water solution corresponding the above sem and ftir results suggesting that the sludge solution promotes hydrothermal degradation of the mps however the opposite trend is observed for the ci value of ht pet after the treatment possibly due to the decarbonylation of pet during hydrothermal treatment chia et al 2020 huang et al 2022 another possible reason is that hydrothermal treatment functions to convert fiber like pet into powder like form causing its difficult extraction from sewage sludge and thus the ci may reflect the mixture of powder like pet and organic matter in sewage sludge 3 1 2 dcod and doc leached from ht mps in the sewage sludge the aging process does not only cause the changes in the surface characteristics of the mps but also promotes the releasing of plastic monomers oligomers and additives shi et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the dcod and doc contents of the ht sludge are much higher than that of raw sludge implying that hydrothermal treatment promote the dissolution of sludge organic matter xiao and zhou 2020 xu and jiang 2017 yan et al 2022 the ht sludge with mp addition has higher dcod and doc than that without any mp addition implying that the mps in the sludge are leached by their degradation during the hydrothermal process enhancing doms contents of ht sludge as shown in fig 3b and 3d dcod and doc concentrations of the leachates from ht mps in sludge solution are higher than those in mp containing water solution the results imply that mps leaching is more pronounced in the sewage solution than in water upon hydrothermal treatment sewage sludge is a complex heterogeneous mixture consisting of organic e g protein carbohydrates and inorganic materials e g sio2 and metal ions liu et al 2020b which might promote the hydrothermal degradation and leaching of mps through participation into the reaction or as a catalyst study has found esters and aromatic acids from pistachio hulls can promote the degradation of pet and nylon 6 during hydrothermal liquefaction process hongthong et al 2020 the presence of organic matter of biomass could significantly inhibit the mps particles agglomeration during the hydrothermal treatment shen 2020 supporting the above results that the ht pe and ps in the water have larger size than the corresponding ht mps in the sludge fig 1 the doc and toc contents from the ht pet in the sludge are significantly higher than that from the ht pe and ps corroborating that the hydrothermal treatment has a greater effect on pet than the pe and ps as shown in fig s4 the ph values in the groups with mp addition are lower than the control group without mps after hydrothermal treatment both for the water and sludge the result suggest that some acid components are released or formed during the mps hydrothermal treatment the acidification can be attributed to the formation of carbonyl groups during the thermal oxidation for pe and ps zhou et al 2019 corresponding to the ci results and the generation of terephthalic acid during the ester hydrolysis for pet barnard et al 2021 the reduction in ph is less pronounced in sludge solution than in water solution although more doms are released from the mps during sludge hydrothermal treatment fig 3c and 3d possibly due to higher alkalinity and buffer capacity of the sewage sludge tian et al 2020 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2017 reported that the buffering function of the colloids in the sludge may play an important role in maintaining the ph stability wu et al 2021 found that humic acid and fulvic acid can limit the duration of aging and alterations of mp properties during long term weathering in natural waters therefore the relatively stable variation of ph values in the sludge implies low accumulation of acid products from plastic hydrothermal degradation which may reduce the inhibition of these acid products to the mps degradation li et al 2022 after hydrothermal treatment electrical conductivities of the sludge were measured to be 2920 3260 3325 and 3190 μs cm 1 for control pe ps and pet respectively but those in water solution are not detectable indicating the abundance of metal salts in the sludge mps containing sludge solution have higher electrical conductivity than the control b without mps it is possibly attributed to the leaching of metal containing additives in the mps during the hydrothermal treatment boyle et al 2020 capolupo et al 2020 3 2 effect of sludge components on mps hydrothermal degradation since the stimulating effects of sludge solution are confirmed on the changes of mp surface and leaching properties upon the hydrothermal treatment it is important as the next step to further identify the major sludge components to be responsible for the changes 3 2 1 surface characteristics of ht mps in the solutions fig s5 s7 show micro morphologies of the virgin and corresponding ht mps in the water sio2 protein and carbohydrate solutions no significant changes are observed after hydrothermal treatment except for the size of mps compared with the virgin mps the sizes of ht pe and ps increase but the ht pet size decreases in all the solutions fig s8 pe ps and pet are the thermoplastics the mps are likely melted during the hydrothermal treatment and then agglomerated together and become larger flakes when cooled to room temperature therefore the particle sizes of pe and ps tend to become larger after hydrothermal treatment the aliphatic polyester such as pet is highly susceptible to hydrolytic degradation and thus the reduction of pet size results from the hydrolysis and depolymerization reaction during hydrothermal treatment causing the chain scission fambri et al 2020 xu and bai 2022 the ht pe and ps particles in the water solution have similar sizes with those in the simulated solutions with sio2 protein or carbohydrate but possesses larger size for pet particle implying that the organic and inorganic groups in the sludge have great impact on the pet size but not on the pe and ps sizes during the hydrothermal treatment the difference for pet is the most pronounced in the solution containing carbohydrate it is likely that the sludge components promote the pet hydrolysis and degradation through the catalytic and synergistic effect barnard et al 2021 kosloski oh et al 2021 seshasayee and savage 2021 sem analysis shows that some particle like materials presents on the mps surfaces in the sio2 solution after hydrothermal treatment fig 4 implying the attachment of the silica the results indicate that the mineral component in sludge is able to attach on the mps surface altering the micro morphology results of the ht mps in the sludge fig 1 the mps surfaces present uneven fracture and tiny pores like structure in the protein and carbohydrate solutions after hydrothermal treatment especially for pet the changes are more obvious than that in the water solution the results imply that the two sludge components could promote the mps aging and degradation during the hydrothermal treatment with the synergistic effect on the hydrothermal aging and degradation of the mps it agrees with the previous findings that the biomolecules such as cellulose starch and lignin facilitate the hydrothermal degradation of the plastics seshasayee and savage 2020 2021 ftir spectra were used to further investigate the effect of sio2 protein and carbohydrate in the sludge on the changes in the surface functional groups of the mps during hydrothermal treatment as shown fig s9 compared with the virgin mps the characteristic peaks of the mps show no substantial changes in all the solutions after hydrothermal treatment except for pe and ps in the sio2 solution the results imply that the sludge organic and inorganic components have little influence on surface functional composition of the mps during hydrothermal treatment the ht pe and ps in the sio2 solution present an increase in the peak intensities at 1100 cm 1 relating to the anti symmetric stretching vibration absorption of si o indicating the attachment of sio2 on the mps surface in accordance with the above sem results fig 4 as shown in table s2 the cis of ht mps in the solutions have a decreasing sequence as followings carbohydrate sio2 water protein for pe carbohydrate protein sio2 water for ps and water sio2 protein carbohydrate for pet the results imply that both of the protein and carbohydrate have a greater influence than the inorganic component such as sio2 for ps and pet however protein leads to a decrease in ci values and the carbohydrate causes an increase for pe seshasayee and savage also found that carbohydrate such as cellulose and starch promoted the plastics degradation but protein such as soy protein did not during hydrothermal liquefaction seshasayee and savage 2020 2021 the related mechanism deserves to further investigation 3 2 2 dcod and doc contents leached from ht mps in the solutions as shown in fig 5a and 5b the doms leached from the ht mps in the protein and carbohydrate solutions have higher dcod and doc contents than that in water solution the results imply that the sludge organic matter such as protein and carbohydrate promote the hydrothermal leaching degradation of the mps as supported by the sem and ci results the dissolution and decomposition of biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins in sewage sludge often occurs during hydrothermal treatment wang and li 2015 low molecular weight groups from their decomposition such as peptides dipeptides amino acids and glucose might act as active donor during the chain scission of the mps yuan et al 2009 compared with the carbohydrate solutions the protein solution results in the higher dcod and doc leaching from the ht mps meanwhile the protein solution shows higher ph values and electrical conductivities after hydrothermal treatment implying greater buffer capacity and more metal ions fig 5c and 5d the possible explanation is that amino acids from protein decomposition are transformed to the basic groups such as ammonia at a temperature above 190 sun et al 2013 the results explain the higher mps leaching degradation in the protein solution resulting from the lower inhibition of acid products and higher catalysis of metals barnard et al 2021 kosloski oh et al 2021 compared with the carbohydrate solution the dcod and doc contents from the ht mps in the sio2 solution are similar to or even lower than those in the water implying that the sio2 has limited catalytic effect on the mps leaching degradation during the hydrothermal treatment but prevent the mps agglomeration during sludge hydrothermal treatment in addition the ht pet has higher dcod and doc contents and lower ph values than ht pe and ps in all the solutions implying greater pet leaching degradation during hydrothermal treatment corresponding to the results from the ht mps in the sewage sludge fig 3c and 3d 3 3 chemical characteristics of the doms leached from ht mps 3 3 1 fluorescent eems analysis fluorescent eems were used to further characterize the doms leached from the mps and the spectra are shown in fig 6 the spectra of doms from the ht pe and ps have the similar four peaks while the ht pet exhibits only two peaks in its spectrum as shown in table 2 ex em pairs of the peaks from the pe and ps are located at 200 305 nm and 215 305 nm for peak 1 275 305 nm and 270 305 nm for peak 2 225 405 nm and 225 395 nm for peak 3 and 280 400 nm and 300 405 nm for peak 4 respectively in accordance with the previous studies lee et al 2020 2021 peak 1 and peak 2 belong to the phenol like fluorescent groups while peak 3 and peak 4 relate to the humic acid like substances respectively lee et al 2020 2021 the results imply that the fluorescent composition is similar between pe and ps derived dom which likely originate from the plastics additives and chain scission shi et al 2021 however the ht ps reveals higher fluorescence peak intensities in dom compared to the pe derived dom despite the similar dcod and doc contents between the pe and ps the result can be explained by the styrene monomer of the ps which tends to generate more phenol like and aromatic fluorescent groups during the hydrothermal treatment compared with the pe seshasayee and savage 2020 the pet derived dom shows the two peaks peaks i and ii at 255 335 nm and 290 330 nm respectively implying that the doms is mainly composed of the phenol like groups as previously demonstrated by the sem and ci analyses the greater tendency of aging degradation upon hydrothermal treatment for pet versus pe and ps might result in the high generation it might generate high contents of plastic monomer and oligomer such as terephthalic acid like materials during the pet hydrolysis which are closely associated with the peak i and peak ii the fluorescent peaks might be an applicable method to rapidly monitor the plastic chain scission degree and additives releasing amount lee et al 2021 3 3 2 uplc qtof ms analysis molecular composition of the doms formed and leached from the ht mps are analyzed using uplc qtof ms to further understand the degradation process and mechanisms of the mps 281 161 and 434 features are gained in the esi mode for pe ps and pet while 410 260 and 598 features are recorded in the esi mode respectively implying that more features are found in the esi mode meanwhile the ion intensities of top 50 individual doms from the mps in esi mode are also lower than that from the corresponding mps in esi mode tables s3 s5 the results imply that the doms are ionized better in the esi mode than in the esi mode compared with the pe and ps doms from the pet have more features detected and higher ion intensity implying that the pet has more individual doms released during the hydrothermal treatment in accordance with the above results from the dcod and doc contents the formula of some main features are further detected according to the self constructed and nist database which are shown in tables s6 s8 a lot of o containing groups are found in the leachates of the ht mps the results imply that the hydrothermal oxidization of the mps causes the generation of vast carboxyl groups acid products during hydrothermal treatment in accordance with the results of the ci and ph values the individual doms mostly consist of monomers oligomers and plastic leachates of the mps and their hydrothermal degradation products therefore possible degradation pathways of the three mps during hydrothermal treatment are gained and outlined in fig 7 which can be divided into two main pathways i e depolymerization of the mps and leaching of the plastics additives the pe polymers are produced by the copolymerization of ethylene and a functionalized vinyl monomer berda et al 2006 the pe can be depolymerized through a free radical reaction during hydrothermal treatment and might involve three main processes i e chain initiation free radical reaction and termination reaction barontini et al 2004 firstly pe is cracked into olefin monomers double bonds of some olefins are eliminated through the addition reaction to form alkyl radicals then alkyl radicals undergo addition reaction with oxygen and hydroxyl radicals in the autoclave to form carboxylates acids or aldehydes and ketones long chain compounds may be hydrolyzed by chain scission into corresponding short chain compounds during hydrothermal treatment due to the combined action of high temperature and high pressure similarly the ps depolymerization may be conducted through zip and random chain breaking delre et al 2021 yeung et al 2021 ps is firstly cracked into styrene monomer or other benzene homologs through zip depolymerization the monomers and oligomers may be further cracked into olefins and benzene rings for example the formation of 1 1 dibenzylethene comes from the thermal cracking of polystyrene and then some oxygen containing compounds are formed by the combination of methyl radical and hydrogen radical or the combination of phenyl and alkyl radical like the pe and ps pet is the copolymer obtained from two polymerized monomers of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol barnard et al 2021 pet often forms ester bonds by cross esteration of carboxyl and hydroxyl to increase the molecular weight however a large number of ester bonds are highly susceptible to protons at high temperature the protons in the water can be activated during hydrothermal treatment the original ester bonds of pet become very unstable and prone to fracture due to the proton attack then long chains of the pet are broken slowly forming a short chain with a lower molecular weight until they are broken down into polymer monomers barnard et al 2021 in the study pet may be firstly depolymerized to bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate bhet and then hydrolyzed into esters and benzoic acid in addition to chain scission the plastics additives are leached during hydrothermal treatment the additives leached from the pe include phthalate benzoic acid terephthalic acid dibutyl phthalate tributyl phosphate apart from the terephthalic acid and tributyl phosphate the ps additives also contain salicylic acid and fluore 9 one compared with the pe and ps more plastics additives are found in the doms from the pet the possible reason is that the pet synthesis process is more complex than pe and ps plastics due to more plastic additives incorporated during the pet production process 3 4 implication of this study the above results imply that sludge hydrothermal treatment results in a great effect on the surface and leaching characteristics of the mps such as an increase in surface roughness and o containing functional groups on the mps and the releasing of the dissolved leachates due to the promotion of sludge organic components jiang et al 2022 reported that the ht mps have an increasing inhibitory effect on anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge due to the acceleration of the released toxic plastic additives therefore the aging of mps during hydrothermal treatment maybe enhance the potential risk of subsequent sludge land applications to soil environment which needs to further investigate in addition the pet shows a more considerable degradation than the pe and ps during sludge hydrothermal treatment and the degradation is almost complete the result confirms that hydrothermal treatment is a promising method to reduce the sludge based mps since pet is one of the most common mps in the sewage sludge madon et al 2017 wei et al 2021 it deserves to further explore the decomposition feasibility of other mps in sludge hydrothermal process and the potential effect of the mps degradation products on environment 4 conclusions the ht mps in sludge retain rougher surfaces with more o containing functional groups releasing higher contents of leachates compared with those in water solution indicating that organic and inorganic components contained in sludge exert a synergistic effect on the mps degradation during hydrothermal treatment the changes depended on mp types compared with pe and ps pet shows greater changes in the physicochemical and leaching characteristics after hydrothermal treatment due to more susceptible hydrolysis of the ester bonds in the pet sludge organic components such as protein and carbohydrate demonstrate their enhancing effects on the mps aging and degradation during hydrothermal treatment the effect is more obvious for pet as low molecular weight substances produced from the decomposition might act as an active donor to promote the mps chain scission inorganic component in sludge such as sio2 exhibits limited effect on the mps hydrothermal degradation while it tends to attach to the mps surface preventing the agglomeration of mps in sludge the ht driven mps degradation seems to operate through two main pathways one is via the depolymerization into monomers and oligomer such as bhet and the other is via the leaching of the plastics additives such as phthalate the findings of the present study provide new insights into the changes in the physicochemical and the leaching characteristics of mps existing in sludge during hydrothermal treatment it deserves further investigating of potential environmental risks

15694,understanding the diversity of bacteria and e coli levels at beaches is important for managing health risks this study compared temporal changes of the bacterial communities of belle isle beach detroit mi and sand point beach windsor ont both located near the lake st clair origin of the detroit river water samples collected 4 days week for 12 weeks in summer were subjected to 16s rrna analysis of amplicon sequencing and e coli enumeration bacterial communities changed over time as determined by cluster dendrogram analysis exhibiting different communities in july and august than in june and different communities at the two beaches after june alpha diversity decreased and relative abundance of enterobacter gammaproteobacteria increased at sand point whereas belle isle maintained its alpha diversity and dominance by betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria contamination at both beaches is dominated by birds 23 to 50 of samples while only 10 had evidence of human associated bacteria high e coli at both beaches was often associated with precipitation nearshore sampling counts were higher than waist deep sampling counts despite the dynamic changes in bacterial communities between the two beaches this analysis based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is able to provide information about bacterial types associated with high e coli levels and to use bacterial sequences to more precisely determine sources and health relevance of contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacteria beach health biodiversity freshwater great lakes region source tracking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial contamination at beaches can come from a variety of point and non point sources knowledge of sources origins human non human and biophysical factors that determine pathogen concentration and distribution are critical for managing beaches and exposure risks byappanahalli et al 2015 additionally traditional methods of monitoring health risks from fecal matter contamination based on escherichia coli presence are limited in their sensitivity and specificity kapoor et al 2013 however sensitive methods based on bacterial sequences are now available that can provide more specific information about the diversity of bacteria including potential pathogens present at beaches a method that has recently been tested to characterize the bacteria in beach water is 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis by means of high throughput sequencing lee et al 2016 staley et al 2018 nakatsu et al 2019 shahraki et al 2021a 2021b by targeting a ribosomal barcode region in bacterial genomes diverse sequences of millions of genomes and the molecular classification of thousands of types operational taxonomic units or otus of bacteria can be obtained comparisons of the otus in a water sample to a reference database often rdp as described by wang et al 2007 enables taxonomic identification of the bacteria in that sample usually enabling classification to genus or higher level despite the limitation that relatively short ribosomal barcodes reliably identify species nor distinguish pathogenic from non pathogenic species and strains singer et al 2016 jeong et al 2021 the diversity of barcode sequences nevertheless enables the statistical characterization of distinctive community patterns to determine similarities or differences between populations at different locations across time e g in the present study over several months of a typical beach season and during high and low levels of fecal contamination current regulations use a single species of bacteria in freshwater usually e coli as an indicator that pathogens may be present and the beach should be posted warning or closed this decision is made based on the number of colony forming units cfus the fact that different threshold criteria are used in different locations is one of the weaknesses of the current system a fair question to ask is whether distinctive metabarcoding components may provide more accurate and comprehensive information than high levels of e coli for assessing beach health furthermore since indicator bacteria levels fluctuate at least daily illustrated by data in the present paper and previous studies selegean et al 2001 sampson et al 2005 an important question is whether metabarcoded populations also change on a day to day basis and if so whether distinctive otus are associated with high indicator bacteria levels previous freshwater metabarcoding studies have often sampled sites only weekly or biweekly lee et al 2016 staley et al 2018 shahraki et al 2021b or less frequently hengy et al 2017 nakatsu et al 2019 and likely missed some high e coli events although a recent study by shahraki et al 2021a focused on high frequency hourly sampling it only covered one day per month in the present study a more frequent sampling strategy was adopted sampling four consecutive days per week throughout an entire summer beach season early june through early september at two heavily used urban freshwater beaches in relatively close proximity in the great lakes region near detroit one on the american side and the other in canada the present study also compared both nearshore and offshore samples in our daily sampling in order to compare to previous studies that reported higher e coli levels in nearshore than offshore samples sampson et al 2005 kleinheinz et al 2006 staley et al 2015 nakatsu et al 2019 altogether this intensive frequent sampling strategy combined with a metabarcoding approach was designed to develop a more detailed analysis of variation of beach bacteria communities over location and time at two freshwater beaches during an entire beach season 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing the project study sites were belle isle beach bi 42 3455 n 82 9781 w in detroit michigan and sand point beach sp 42 3379 n 82 9183 w in

extraction 2 2 source tracking reference samples fecal samples and sewage were collected from within the windsor essex region canada as described by shahraki et al 2019 for use as reference material for the sources of fecal contamination animal samples were 3 fecal samples from each of five commonly implicated animal sources cattle pigs dogs seagulls and geese 15 fecal samples in all human fecal samples consisted of 3 samples collected from each of two healthy humans a total of 6 human samples in addition influent sewage samples 3 250 ml from the lou romano water reclamation plant were collected as also representing human source fecal contamination for analysis of fecal samples two grams of fecal material was transferred in 2 ml sterile vials containing 0 5 g of 1 mm glass beads and

elongation at 72 c for 5 min as described in more detail by shahraki et al 2019 both first and second rounds of pcr were conducted in 25 µl volume he et al 2018 library preparation methods were done as described by shahraki et al 2019 pcr products were then pooled and purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen toronto on canada the pooled library was diluted to 60 pmol l and sequenced on an ion pgm system thermo fisher scientific burlington on canada using ion 318 chip kit v2 bc three sequence runs were performed belle isle beach samples sand point beach samples and fecal samples and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v 1 9 1 bioinformatics pipeline caporaso et al 2010 sequencing data from the three runs had 12 million raw reads and were combined after demultiplexing technical replicates were pooled and sequences were quality filtered to remove poor quality sequence reads from the raw sequence data during this process most parameters were set to software defaults sequences shorter than 200 bp those with more than 2 base pairs of primer mismatch and reference based and de novo chimeras were excluded from subsequent analysis the remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using usearch v11 0 667 with a threshold set to 97 similarity edgar 2010 and were then taxonomically assigned using the basic local alignment search tool blast against the silva v138 16s rrna reference database edgar 2010 the representative sequence for each otu was selected using the most abundant method for assigning taxonomy in the ribosomal database project rdp classifier program with a minimum 80 confidence level wang et al 2007 sequences that represent mitochondria and chloroplasts were eliminated sequences that belong to archaea were not found out of a total of 5115 855 reads for all samples 3941 bacterial otus were identified among the filtered sequences ten negative controls had sequencing reads ranging from 600 to 6700 sequences out of a total of 36 209 reads we used decontam version 1 8 0 davis et al 2018 in the r package to identify the control sample otus as possible contaminants in our beach water samples version the average reads sample was 23 130 5503 to 63 748 raw sequences were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive and have accession numbers prjna803550 prjna803520 and prjna810197 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 comparison of e coli data with precipitation data in order to determine if the runoff from rainfall had any influence on increasing the e coli levels in the beaches precipitation data from nearby locations were collected and compared examination of the relationship of e coli levels with precipitation is based both on published studies for example shanks et al 2006 and also on our general observations of precipitation while or shortly before collecting samples at these beaches these data are presented to provide the environmental context in which the bacterial community analysis of this paper is being presented for bi beach precipitation data from gross pointe farms an area that drains into lake st clair just upstream from belle isle was obtained from national weather service nws https www weather gov wrh climate wfo dtx similarly for sp beach precipitation data for little river that drains into sp beach was obtained from environment climate change canada eccc for windsor airport station form early june to early september observed e coli levels are presented with comparison to the canadian recreational water usage warning guideline of 200 cfu 100 ml as the threshold criteria for sp beach and the state of michigan usa single day recreational water monitoring threshold of 300 cfu 100 ml for bi beach thirty day running geometric mean values were calculated and compared with the epa s 30 day running geometric mean threshold of 126 cfu 100 ml usepa 2010 further comparisons of 30 day running geometric mean values over time and between nearshore samples and waist deep samples were accomplished using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test 2 4 2 bacterial analysis community diversity and temporal variation for graphical comparison abundant top 15 otus at ns and wd collecting depths across all sampling dates at both bi beach and sp beach were selected and presented as heat maps at phylum for proteobacteria they were presented at class level and genera level heat maps were generated using microsoft excel office professional plus 2019 version 1808 build 10 387 20023 genera that contain potential waterborne pathogens were identified based on the literature within the top 15 otus and relative abundances of those genera were compared across the summer at both beaches at ns and wd collecting depths to investigate whether significant community differences may exist in the bacterial populations between the two beaches we analyzed community structure by methods that account for richness and distribution of bacterial otus alpha diversity calculations were performed after removing single and double read otus and rarifying the otus to 5000 quality sequences for each sample the original otu table non rarefied was used to calculate relative abundance in order to limit outlier effects of rare taxa on multivariate clustering algorithms a subset of the 500 most abundant bacterial otus accounting for 98 95 of total reads was used for bacterial community composition analysis to perform alpha diversity analyses the shannon and chao1 indices were measured using the rarefied table to visualize differences among samples violin plots were created using the r v4 0 1 r core team 2016 package ggplots2 v3 3 2 wickham 2016 kruskal wallis tests on shannon and chao1 indices were used to compare the variation between the months june july august on combined data sets from ns and wd samples from both beaches wilcoxon tests were performed using shannon and chao1 indices to compare ns and wd collection sites within each beach and within and between each month to define the broad temporal variations among the samples collected from june to september the top 500 otus were used in clustering dendrogram and principal coordinates analysis pcoa to test for temporal and spatial variation of the sample populations the hypotheses being tested by these analyses were a beach bacteria communities have temporal and spatial variation over several months and between different locations and b month to month changes in bacterial communities are present at these beaches clustering analysis utilized the paleontological statistics software package hammer et al 2001 to perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on a bray curtis distance matrix from the top 500 otus analysis of the temporal and spatial variation of bacterial communities and their interactions utilized permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova of all samples collected from both beaches month to month variations within each beach were analyzed using one way permanova pairwise test with 9999 permutations and bonferroni corrected p values for assessment of statistical significance 2 4 3 source tracking analysis for source tracking possible source specific otus were identified as those otus that had high abundance higher than 1 in samples from one fecal source but low abundance less than 0 1 in the others these possible source specific otus were further pruned by retaining only those that had a low abundance less than 0 1 in the field samples with minimal evidence of fecal contamination e coli 50 cfu 100 ml resultant otus were used as unique markers of sources to characterize human and animal fecal sources present in samples having high indicator e coli levels 3 results 3 1 e coli enumeration enumeration of e coli at bi and sp beaches over the entire sampling period are shown in fig 2 the results show that the michigan recreational water criterion e coli concentration of 300 cfu 100 ml at bi was exceeded twice 4 of total sampling days at the wd location and 14 times 28 of total sampling days at the ns location at sp beach the canadian criterion e coli concentration of 200 cfu 100 ml was exceeded 8 times 16 of total sampling days at the wd location and 10 times 20 of total sampling days at the ns location peaks in high e coli levels at the two beaches often coincided with rainfall or followed precipitation shortly thereafter by a day or two fig 2 of the 17 sampling days in the month of july two of the exceedances at the ns location including the highest value of 2400 cfu 100 ml recorded in july at the location were observed during a precipitation event between july 11 and july 13 for sp beach in july three of the exceedences for both ns and wd locations including the highest value of 3000 cfu 100 ml at both locations in the month of july occurred during the precipitation event between july 11 and july 13 of the 21 sampling days in the month of august and the beginning of september five out of the eight exceedances at the bi ns location including one of the two highest values of 2400 recorded in august at the location were observed during or immediately following significant rainfall events on august 3 17 and 29 for sp beach in august six of the exceedences for ns and five for wd locations including the highest value of 2400 cfu 100 ml at both locations in the month of august occurred during or immediately following significant rainfall events on august 3 17 and 29 despite these evident co occurrences considerable variability in association also occur for example several precipitation events in june not followed by an increase of e coli and conversely an increase in e coli at both beaches on august 9 not associated with a rainfall event analysis of monthly and 30 day running averages revealed that e coli levels were frequently higher at ns sites than wd sites fig 3 bi ns e coli 30 day running geometric means exceeded the criterion threshold for 30 day geometric means 126 cfu 100 ml over 24 times from july 13th to sep 4th fig 3b statistical analysis with the nonparametric kruskal wallis comparison test determined that bi beach ns counts are significantly higher than the wd counts p 0 004 sp ns and wd counts are not significantly different for the same statistical test p 0 444 3 2 bacterial community analysis negative controls had very few otus with high number reads belonging to genera ralstonia otu 23 sphingomonas otu 88 uncultured bacteria otus 9 326 and 173 mycoplasma otu 33 ambiguous taxa otu 46 bradyrhizobium out 132 and pelomonas otu 170 our decontam results indicated that none of these negative control otus are possible contaminants in our beach samples so we excluded all the controls for further analysis we also did permanova and cluster analysis with and without the above mentioned otus no significant changes in dendrogram cluster patterns were apparent so we did not exclude any otus in the analysis analysis of otus at both bi and sp beaches showed highly diverse bacterial types that dynamically change in composition between early and late summer as illustrated in fig 4 most samples are dominated by betaproteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria accounting for 67 83 of relative abundance the exception is at sp in july and august during which gammaproteobacteria replaced actinobacteria and betaproteobacteria as occurring in highest abundance among other taxa a notable outbreak was the comparatively higher level of planctomycetes at the sp ns location in august at the genus level fig 5 shows that the most frequently found otus include bacillus enterobacter limnohabitans polynucleobacter variovorax and otus identified as hcgi clades of actinobacteria while some genera were found in high proportions throughout the summer e g variovorax and limnohabitans at bi and bacillus at sp other genera seemed more strongly dependent on collection month especially at sp at sp limnohabitans polynucleobacter variovorax and the hcgi clades occurred mainly early in the summer while enterobacter a gammaproteobacteria consistently appeared in high proportions in july and august at sp at bi enterobacter followed a similar temporal pattern but was present in much lower proportions bacillus appeared at both beaches sporadically throughout the summer exiguobacterium was present mainly from mid july to mid august at sp otus identified as acinetobacter citrobacter enterococcus legionella and staphylococcus were also detected although at much lower sequence proportions than the otus illustrated in fig 5 these genera are of interest because they contain both pathogenic and non pathogenic strains and might thus indicate the presence of potential pathogens in general the number of sequences of genera identified as potential pathogens was lower in june than later in the summer these potentially pathogenic genera rose to a peak in mid july approximately july 11 to 20 more or less coinciding with the peak in e coli in mid july in august a more sustained though still low level of potential pathogens occurred including citrobacter legionella and pseudomonas following up on the temporal and spatial differences revealed in figs 4 and 5 we next examined community structure by methods that account for richness and distribution of bacterial otus we compared samples over the time span of the study for significant differences in alpha diversity population clustering and principal coordinates analysis alpha diversity analysis of alpha diversity shannon and chao1 of the bacterial communities at both beaches and at ns and wd locations reveals differences over time and between beaches and collection sites figs 6 a1 a3 shannon alpha diversity at sp decreased significantly from values near 5 in june to values near 2 in august p 0 001 for both ns and wd comparisons wilcoxon tests in contrast at bi shannon alpha diversity persisted at values between 5 and 6 in each month and for both ns and wd locations all possible comparisons had p 0 05 except for a slight but significant increase in diversity from about 5 to 5 7 between june and august at ns sites cluster analysis cluster dendrograms for the two beaches reveal large temporal changes over the three month sampling period at both beaches fig 7 when cluster dendrogram analysis is applied to the populations at each beach separately both beaches show june samples clustering separately from august samples illustrated in supplement fig a4 a and a4 b however despite the superficial similarity of the clustering at the two beaches considered separately when data from the two beaches are combined into a single cluster dendrogram fig 7 it becomes apparent that the community structure of bacteria at the two beaches are distinct from one another for almost all samples across the summer the cluster dendrogram for the combined dataset of both beaches in fig 7 shows almost no overlap in the distribution of the communities from the two beaches instead the resultant dendrogram fig 7 has more than four distinct groups with almost all sp samples clustering together at the left of fig 7 while most bi samples cluster together separately at the right side of the dendrogram the only exception is the cluster of bi august samples encircled by an ellipse in fig 7 principal coordinates analyses also show distinctly different distributions of the majority of samples from the two beaches on pcoa plots data shown in supplementary in fig a5 a7 two way permanova analysis indicates both temporal and spatial variation and their interactions were significantly different p 0 0001 one way permanova pairwise comparison results for sp beach indicates that june samples were significantly different from july p 0 006 and august samples p 0 006 and july samples were significantly different from august samples p 0 006 similarly bi june samples were significantly different from july p 0 012 and august samples p 0 0006 and july samples were significantly different from august samples p 0 0018 3 2 source analysis six otus were identified as unique markers for human and fecal sources source otus as listed along the left side of tables 1 and 2 the genera of these six otus varied among source types and included otus identified as jeotgalibacilus otu 15 clostridium sensu stricto 1 otu 18 streptococcus otu 27 acinetobacter otu 36 enterococcus otu 67 and lactococcus otu 69 the presence of these otus was then examined in the high throughput sequencing output from bi beach table 1 and sp beach table 2 in general a higher percentage of nearshore samples had unique source otus evidence of fecal contamination than waist deep samples at both beaches the most frequently occurring source of fecal contamination was from birds for which markers indicated this source at bi beach in 23 waist deep to 50 of samples nearshore and at sp beach in 41 nearshore and 46 waist deep of samples the human wastewater marker was identified in about 8 12 of samples at both beaches and collection locations fecal markers from farm animals cow pig were not found at sp beach however they were found in 7 to 19 of samples from bi beach table 1 similarly fecal markers of dogs domestic animal were present in a higher percentage of samples at bi beach compared to sp beach table 2 samples with e coli concentrations exceeding the safe level criterion for swimming 300 cfu 100 ml in michigan and 200 cfu 100 ml in ontario were examined for correlation between e coli concentrations and specific otus for the two locations at each of the two beaches the top 6 otus with correlation coefficient 0 5 with significance level p 0 1 were identified and are presented in table 3 none of the otus that had been identified as source specific unique otus from human and animal sources as presented in tables 1 and 2 were among those top 6 otus for any of the samples that had high e coli levels the genera of these otus that highly correlate with high e coli levels varied as listed in table 3 and include genera that encompass human pathogens pseudomonas citrobacter tatumella legionella sphingomonas and chryseobacterium 4 discussion although several high throughput sequencing studies of bacterioplankton at beaches have recently appeared mou et al 2013 sible et al 2015 carney et al 2019 mohiuddin et al 2019 paver et al 2020 and others cited elsewhere in this paper the present study is unique in its combination of frequency daily and duration three months of sampling and analysis the frequency of sampling enabled a more detailed analysis of changes in the structure of bacterial communities and the duration of the sampling period over several months enabled the observation of temporal change the comparison of bacterial communities from near shore and waist deep samples is also more intensive than prior comparisons of these sampling locations e coli data collected at the beaches and precipitation records provided specific context for the bacterial community changes we observed while the e coli data reinforce previous observations e g shanks et al 2006 that high indicator bacteria levels often occur in association with precipitation the association of high e coli with precipitation is variable possibly due to other influences such as temperature wind and variation in fecal source inputs that may also influence changes in bacterial communities that are the focus of this study the results reveal a dynamic and continual change of bacterial community composition over an entire beach season and emphasizes that patrons of these two beaches would encounter different sets of bacteria earlier in the season june than later august regardless of the counts of indicator e coli that may be present for example at bi swimmers would encounter proportionately much more variovorax than at sp but proportionately much less enterobacter perhaps somewhat surprisingly since these beaches are in close proximity within 5 km of the mouth of detroit river on lake st clair located across from one another on the same connected water body the assemblages at the two beaches nevertheless differ substantially from one another as evidenced by their distant location on a cluster dendrogram fig 7 and for most samples on a pcoa plot and analyses of alpha diversity supplementary data for temporal variation similar results were described by shahraki et al 2021a for a study conducted on 6 different beaches located on lake st clair and lake erie however unlike our present results shahraki et al 2021a reported no significant spatial variation among the samples from the six beaches hydrodynamic modeling of lake st clair during the same time period revealed significant differences between both water temperature and water age in the northwest nw and southeast se parts of lake st clair madani et al 2020 the beach waters at bi beach are seen to have a greater influence from nw lake st clair waters as compared to se for sp beach supporting the ideas that physicochemistry and hydrologic connectivity of local waters may be more important than geographic region in determining the structure of bacterial communities hengy et al 2017 paver et al 2020 this may help explain the distinct differences observed in the bacterial communities at the two beaches despite their proximity alpha diversity of bacteria at other great lakes beaches ranges from about 3 lee et al 2016 hengy et al 2017 to 7 5 nakatsu et al 2019 nevers et al 2020 a range that our data supports the dominant types of bacteria at the beaches are also similar to previous studies viz the bacterial community in lakes near beaver island and lake erie were dominated by proteobacteria primarily betaproteobacteria and also had relative abundances of 10 of actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and among a subset of samples gammaproteobacteria hengy et al 2017 shahraki et al 2021b dominance by betaproteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria was also observed by nakatsu et al 2019 three small lakes in ohio studied by lee et al 2016 were however dominated more by actinobacteria and in many instances cyanobacteria which were mostly absent in our samples with only sporadic abundances of betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria of 10 the study by lee et al 2016 was however similar to ours in doing multiple repeated sampling over an entire season albeit only about once per week and not as systematic in intervals and start and stop dates at different sites as in the present study and analyzing temporal changes with cluster dendrograms the result similarly showed that samples collected in august grouped almost completely separate from june and july branches of the dendrogram fig 5a of lee et al 2016 the greater consistency and duration of sampling underlying the cluster dendrogram analysis in the present study strongly support the hypothesis of dynamic changes between june and august at great lakes freshwater beaches this study also developed a method of identifying potential fecal sources by developing a database of unique source otus otus that were seen only in a particular source s feces and were not present or present only at abundances of 0 1 in samples that were thought to be low in fecal contamination by dint of having a low count of indicator e coli in contrast to other methods of source tracking which identify different source specific strains of a single genus e g patterns of antibiotic resistance olivas and faulkner 2008 or sequence variants ram et al 2004 of e coli or source specific strains of bacteroides ko et al 2018 each source otu in the present method is from a different genus nevertheless the method demonstrated here seems to work well the source analysis here concluded that fecal contamination at these two area beaches was predominantly from bird feces similar to the conclusion from an earlier study at two other lake st clair beaches lake st clair metro beach and memorial beach on the american side of the lake using a completely different technique ram et al 2004 that study estimated fecal sources of contamination to be approximately 50 birds 15 humans 20 pets dogs and cats and 5 farm animals proportions that are very similar to the present study the presence of rrna gene barcodes of the same genus as several potential pathogens in these beach water samples might indicate that pathogens are present however caution must be exercised in interpreting these data for one the rdp database and the use of this relatively short rrna barcode is sufficient to identify most otus only to genus and are insufficient to identify the exact species known to be a human pathogen even if it were possible to identify species with the barcode it would likely be impossible to know if the pathogenic strains of that species are present this is one of the known major drawbacks with the short read high throughput metabarcoding sequencing singer et al 2016 jeong et al 2021 as one example to consider identification of legionella which was present in a small number of samples during july and august could be identifying any of a large number of non pathogenic legionella that are found in aquatic sources duron et al 2018 furthermore the rdp 16s rrna gene database still has many unidentified uncultured bacteria barcodes that are unable to provide any useful information at genus or species level in addition software annotation error could also lead to misidentification of certain taxa edgar 2018 hence future studies should focus on using full length rrna sequences or a combination of techniques that might include validation of pathogen specific genes shahraki et al 2021a a search for otus in the high throughput output that had a good correlation with both e coli indicator bacteria and with the presence of animal fecal markers failed to turn up a consistent universal marker that could stand in for e coli for beach water testing this failure to demonstrate an alternative universal marker probably reflects the changing composition of bacteria including potentially pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environments that occurs seasonally interestingly in view of the fact that e coli is supposed to be an indicator that pathogens are present the majority of the otus that correlated with high e coli were identified as genera that contain pathogenic strains such as pseudomonas and legionella this high throughput method shows promise for identifying sources of contamination and investigating mechanisms underlying the diversity and changes that can occur at beaches with the passage of time 5 conclusions the results of almost daily sampling and next generation sequencing of bacteria at two nearby beaches in the great lakes region of north america revealed bacterial communities that changed both dramatically and differently over a three month summer sampling period key conclusions from this study are peaks in bacterial contamination frequently occurred in association with precipitation events bacterial contamination was higher nearshore than offshore at both beaches biodiversity analyzed by next generation sequence analysis of bacterial barcodes reveal a dynamic and continual change of bacterial community composition over an entire beach season at both beaches regardless of the indicator e coli that may be present beach goers would encounter different sets of bacteria earlier in the season than later despite the nearness of the beaches to one another on the same water body the bacterial assemblages at the two beaches differed substantially from one another throughout the season as shown by several different measures of diversity including relative abundance alpha diversity cluster dendrograms and pcoa distributions next generation sequence data could be used for source tracking analysis fecal associated bacterial barcodes were found in beach water samples and identified potential sources of contamination comparable to previous studies showing birds as major sources of great lakes beaches

15694,understanding the diversity of bacteria and e coli levels at beaches is important for managing health risks this study compared temporal changes of the bacterial communities of belle isle beach detroit mi and sand point beach windsor ont both located near the lake st clair origin of the detroit river water samples collected 4 days week for 12 weeks in summer were subjected to 16s rrna analysis of amplicon sequencing and e coli enumeration bacterial communities changed over time as determined by cluster dendrogram analysis exhibiting different communities in july and august than in june and different communities at the two beaches after june alpha diversity decreased and relative abundance of enterobacter gammaproteobacteria increased at sand point whereas belle isle maintained its alpha diversity and dominance by betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria contamination at both beaches is dominated by birds 23 to 50 of samples while only 10 had evidence of human associated bacteria high e coli at both beaches was often associated with precipitation nearshore sampling counts were higher than waist deep sampling counts despite the dynamic changes in bacterial communities between the two beaches this analysis based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing is able to provide information about bacterial types associated with high e coli levels and to use bacterial sequences to more precisely determine sources and health relevance of contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacteria beach health biodiversity freshwater great lakes region source tracking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial contamination at beaches can come from a variety of point and non point sources knowledge of sources origins human non human and biophysical factors that determine pathogen concentration and distribution are critical for managing beaches and exposure risks byappanahalli et al 2015 additionally traditional methods of monitoring health risks from fecal matter contamination based on escherichia coli presence are limited in their sensitivity and specificity kapoor et al 2013 however sensitive methods based on bacterial sequences are now available that can provide more specific information about the diversity of bacteria including potential pathogens present at beaches a method that has recently been tested to characterize the bacteria in beach water is 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis by means of high throughput sequencing lee et al 2016 staley et al 2018 nakatsu et al 2019 shahraki et al 2021a 2021b by targeting a ribosomal barcode region in bacterial genomes diverse sequences of millions of genomes and the molecular classification of thousands of types operational taxonomic units or otus of bacteria can be obtained comparisons of the otus in a water sample to a reference database often rdp as described by wang et al 2007 enables taxonomic identification of the bacteria in that sample usually enabling classification to genus or higher level despite the limitation that relatively short ribosomal barcodes reliably identify species nor distinguish pathogenic from non pathogenic species and strains singer et al 2016 jeong et al 2021 the diversity of barcode sequences nevertheless enables the statistical characterization of distinctive community patterns to determine similarities or differences between populations at different locations across time e g in the present study over several months of a typical beach season and during high and low levels of fecal contamination current regulations use a single species of bacteria in freshwater usually e coli as an indicator that pathogens may be present and the beach should be posted warning or closed this decision is made based on the number of colony forming units cfus the fact that different threshold criteria are used in different locations is one of the weaknesses of the current system a fair question to ask is whether distinctive metabarcoding components may provide more accurate and comprehensive information than high levels of e coli for assessing beach health furthermore since indicator bacteria levels fluctuate at least daily illustrated by data in the present paper and previous studies selegean et al 2001 sampson et al 2005 an important question is whether metabarcoded populations also change on a day to day basis and if so whether distinctive otus are associated with high indicator bacteria levels previous freshwater metabarcoding studies have often sampled sites only weekly or biweekly lee et al 2016 staley et al 2018 shahraki et al 2021b or less frequently hengy et al 2017 nakatsu et al 2019 and likely missed some high e coli events although a recent study by shahraki et al 2021a focused on high frequency hourly sampling it only covered one day per month in the present study a more frequent sampling strategy was adopted sampling four consecutive days per week throughout an entire summer beach season early june through early september at two heavily used urban freshwater beaches in relatively close proximity in the great lakes region near detroit one on the american side and the other in canada the present study also compared both nearshore and offshore samples in our daily sampling in order to compare to previous studies that reported higher e coli levels in nearshore than offshore samples sampson et al 2005 kleinheinz et al 2006 staley et al 2015 nakatsu et al 2019 altogether this intensive frequent sampling strategy combined with a metabarcoding approach was designed to develop a more detailed analysis of variation of beach bacteria communities over location and time at two freshwater beaches during an entire beach season 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing the project study sites were belle isle beach bi 42 3455 n 82 9781 w in detroit michigan and sand point beach sp 42 3379 n 82 9183 w in windsor ontario fig 1 duplicate water samples were collected four days a week mon thurs at nearshore ns at a depth of 40 60 cm and waist deep wd 1 1 5 m depth sites over a period of 12 weeks from june 12 2017 to september 4 2017 water samples were collected from surface water using 500 ml bottles without disturbing the sediment the water samples were processed immediately for e coli enumeration by idexx quantitray 2000 with colilert 18 medium idexx westbrook maine a 250 ml portion of the samples was filtered on 0 22 µm filters pore size filter and 47 mm diameter polycarbonate filters isopore tm millipore ma bacteria captured on the filters were preserved by freezing in 2 ml sterile vials containing 0 5 g glass beads 0 1 mm diameter bio spec products and stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction 2 2 source tracking reference samples fecal samples and sewage were collected from within the windsor essex region canada as described by shahraki et al 2019 for use as reference material for the sources of fecal contamination animal samples were 3 fecal samples from each of five commonly implicated animal sources cattle pigs dogs seagulls and geese 15 fecal samples in all human fecal samples consisted of 3 samples collected from each of two healthy humans a total of 6 human samples in addition influent sewage samples 3 250 ml from the lou romano water reclamation plant were collected as also representing human source fecal contamination for analysis of fecal samples two grams of fecal material was transferred in 2 ml sterile vials containing 0 5 g of 1 mm glass beads and preserved at 20 c sewage samples were filtered and preserved in the freezer similar to the beach water samples 2 3 dna extraction and sequencing dna was extracted from the 21 fecal samples 3 sewage

elongation at 72 c for 5 min as described in more detail by shahraki et al 2019 both first and second rounds of pcr were conducted in 25 µl volume he et al 2018 library preparation methods were done as described by shahraki et al 2019 pcr products were then pooled and purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen toronto on canada the pooled library was diluted to 60 pmol l and sequenced on an ion pgm system thermo fisher scientific burlington on canada using ion 318 chip kit v2 bc three sequence runs were performed belle isle beach samples sand point beach samples and fecal samples and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v 1 9 1 bioinformatics pipeline caporaso et al 2010 sequencing data from the three runs had 12 million raw reads and were combined after demultiplexing technical replicates were pooled and sequences were quality filtered to remove poor quality sequence reads from the raw sequence data during this process most parameters were set to software defaults sequences shorter than 200 bp those with more than 2 base pairs of primer mismatch and reference based and de novo chimeras were excluded from subsequent analysis the remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using usearch v11 0 667 with a threshold set to 97 similarity edgar 2010 and were then taxonomically assigned using the basic local alignment search tool blast against the silva v138 16s rrna reference database edgar 2010 the representative sequence for each otu was selected using the most abundant method for assigning taxonomy in the ribosomal database project rdp classifier program with a minimum 80 confidence level wang et al 2007 sequences that represent mitochondria and chloroplasts were eliminated sequences that belong to archaea were not found out of a total of 5115 855 reads for all samples 3941 bacterial otus were identified among the filtered sequences ten negative controls had sequencing reads ranging from 600 to 6700 sequences out of a total of 36 209 reads we used decontam version 1 8 0 davis et al 2018 in the r package to identify the control sample otus as possible contaminants in our beach water samples version the average reads sample was 23 130 5503 to 63 748 raw sequences were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive and have accession numbers prjna803550 prjna803520 and prjna810197 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 comparison of e coli data with precipitation data in order to determine if the runoff from rainfall had any influence on increasing the e coli levels in the beaches precipitation data from nearby locations were collected and compared examination of the relationship of e coli levels with precipitation is based both on published studies for example shanks et al 2006 and also on our general observations of precipitation while or shortly before collecting samples at these beaches these data are presented to provide the environmental context in which the bacterial community analysis of this paper is being presented for bi beach precipitation data from gross pointe farms an area that drains into lake st clair just upstream from belle isle was obtained from national weather service nws https www weather gov wrh climate wfo dtx similarly for sp beach precipitation data for little river that drains into sp beach was obtained from environment climate change canada eccc for windsor airport station form early june to early september observed e coli levels are presented with comparison to the canadian recreational water usage warning guideline of 200 cfu 100 ml as the threshold criteria for sp beach and the state of michigan usa single day recreational water monitoring threshold of 300 cfu 100 ml for bi beach thirty day running geometric mean values were calculated and compared with the epa s 30 day running geometric mean threshold of 126 cfu 100 ml usepa 2010 further comparisons of 30 day running geometric mean values over time and between nearshore samples and waist deep samples were accomplished using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test 2 4 2 bacterial analysis community diversity and temporal variation for graphical comparison abundant top 15 otus at ns and wd collecting depths across all sampling dates at both bi beach and sp beach were selected and presented as heat maps at phylum for proteobacteria they were presented at class level and genera level heat maps were generated using microsoft excel office professional plus 2019 version 1808 build 10 387 20023 genera that contain potential waterborne pathogens were identified based on the literature within the top 15 otus and relative abundances of those genera were compared across the summer at both beaches at ns and wd collecting depths to investigate whether significant community differences may exist in the bacterial populations between the two beaches we analyzed community structure by methods that account for richness and distribution of bacterial otus alpha diversity calculations were performed after removing single and double read otus and rarifying the otus to 5000 quality sequences for each sample the original otu table non rarefied was used to calculate relative abundance in order to limit outlier effects of rare taxa on multivariate clustering algorithms a subset of the 500 most abundant bacterial otus accounting for 98 95 of total reads was used for bacterial community composition analysis to perform alpha diversity analyses the shannon and chao1 indices were measured using the rarefied table to visualize differences among samples violin plots were created using the r v4 0 1 r core team 2016 package ggplots2 v3 3 2 wickham 2016 kruskal wallis tests on shannon and chao1 indices were used to compare the variation between the months june july august on combined data sets from ns and wd samples from both beaches wilcoxon tests were performed using shannon and chao1 indices to compare ns and wd collection sites within each beach and within and between each month to define the broad temporal variations among the samples collected from june to september the top 500 otus were used in clustering dendrogram and principal coordinates analysis pcoa to test for temporal and spatial variation of the sample populations the hypotheses being tested by these analyses were a beach bacteria communities have temporal and spatial variation over several months and between different locations and b month to month changes in bacterial communities are present at these beaches clustering analysis utilized the paleontological statistics software package hammer et al 2001 to perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on a bray curtis distance matrix from the top 500 otus analysis of the temporal and spatial variation of bacterial communities and their interactions utilized permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova of all samples collected from both beaches month to month variations within each beach were analyzed using one way permanova pairwise test with 9999 permutations and bonferroni corrected p values for assessment of statistical significance 2 4 3 source tracking analysis for source tracking possible source specific otus were identified as those otus that had high abundance higher than 1 in samples from one fecal source but low abundance less than 0 1 in the others these possible source specific otus were further pruned by retaining only those that had a low abundance less than 0 1 in the field samples with minimal evidence of fecal contamination e coli 50 cfu 100 ml resultant otus were used as unique markers of sources to characterize human and animal fecal sources present in samples having high indicator e coli levels 3 results 3 1 e coli enumeration enumeration of e coli at bi and sp beaches over the entire sampling period are shown in fig 2 the results show that the michigan recreational water criterion e coli concentration of 300 cfu 100 ml at bi was exceeded twice 4 of total sampling days at the wd location and 14 times 28 of total sampling days at the ns location at sp beach the canadian criterion e coli concentration of 200 cfu 100 ml was exceeded 8 times 16 of total sampling days at the wd location and 10 times 20 of total sampling days at the ns location peaks in high e coli levels at the two beaches often coincided with rainfall or followed precipitation shortly thereafter by a day or two fig 2 of the 17 sampling days in the month of july two of the exceedances at the ns location including the highest value of 2400 cfu 100 ml recorded in july at the location were observed during a precipitation event between july 11 and july 13 for sp beach in july three of the exceedences for both ns and wd locations including the highest value of 3000 cfu 100 ml at both locations in the month of july occurred during the precipitation event between july 11 and july 13 of the 21 sampling days in the month of august and the beginning of september five out of the eight exceedances at the bi ns location including one of the two highest values of 2400 recorded in august at the location were observed during or immediately following significant rainfall events on august 3 17 and 29 for sp beach in august six of the exceedences for ns and five for wd locations including the highest value of 2400 cfu 100 ml at both locations in the month of august occurred during or immediately following significant rainfall events on august 3 17 and 29 despite these evident co occurrences considerable variability in association also occur for example several precipitation events in june not followed by an increase of e coli and conversely an increase in e coli at both beaches on august 9 not associated with a rainfall event analysis of monthly and 30 day running averages revealed that e coli levels were frequently higher at ns sites than wd sites fig 3 bi ns e coli 30 day running geometric means exceeded the criterion threshold for 30 day geometric means 126 cfu 100 ml over 24 times from july 13th to sep 4th fig 3b statistical analysis with the nonparametric kruskal wallis comparison test determined that bi beach ns counts are significantly higher than the wd counts p 0 004 sp ns and wd counts are not significantly different for the same statistical test p 0 444 3 2 bacterial community analysis negative controls had very few otus with high number reads belonging to genera ralstonia otu 23 sphingomonas otu 88 uncultured bacteria otus 9 326 and 173 mycoplasma otu 33 ambiguous taxa otu 46 bradyrhizobium out 132 and pelomonas otu 170 our decontam results indicated that none of these negative control otus are possible contaminants in our beach samples so we excluded all the controls for further analysis we also did permanova and cluster analysis with and without the above mentioned otus no significant changes in dendrogram cluster patterns were apparent so we did not exclude any otus in the analysis analysis of otus at both bi and sp beaches showed highly diverse bacterial types that dynamically change in composition between early and late summer as illustrated in fig 4 most samples are dominated by betaproteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria accounting for 67 83 of relative abundance the exception is at sp in july and august during which gammaproteobacteria replaced actinobacteria and betaproteobacteria as occurring in highest abundance among other taxa a notable outbreak was the comparatively higher level of planctomycetes at the sp ns location in august at the genus level fig 5 shows that the most frequently found otus include bacillus enterobacter limnohabitans polynucleobacter variovorax and otus identified as hcgi clades of actinobacteria while some genera were found in high proportions throughout the summer e g variovorax and limnohabitans at bi and bacillus at sp other genera seemed more strongly dependent on collection month especially at sp at sp limnohabitans polynucleobacter variovorax and the hcgi clades occurred mainly early in the summer while enterobacter a gammaproteobacteria consistently appeared in high proportions in july and august at sp at bi enterobacter followed a similar temporal pattern but was present in much lower proportions bacillus appeared at both beaches sporadically throughout the summer exiguobacterium was present mainly from mid july to mid august at sp otus identified as acinetobacter citrobacter enterococcus legionella and staphylococcus were also detected although at much lower sequence proportions than the otus illustrated in fig 5 these genera are of interest because they contain both pathogenic and non pathogenic strains and might thus indicate the presence of potential pathogens in general the number of sequences of genera identified as potential pathogens was lower in june than later in the summer these potentially pathogenic genera rose to a peak in mid july approximately july 11 to 20 more or less coinciding with the peak in e coli in mid july in august a more sustained though still low level of potential pathogens occurred including citrobacter legionella and pseudomonas following up on the temporal and spatial differences revealed in figs 4 and 5 we next examined community structure by methods that account for richness and distribution of bacterial otus we compared samples over the time span of the study for significant differences in alpha diversity population clustering and principal coordinates analysis alpha diversity analysis of alpha diversity shannon and chao1 of the bacterial communities at both beaches and at ns and wd locations reveals differences over time and between beaches and collection sites figs 6 a1 a3 shannon alpha diversity at sp decreased significantly from values near 5 in june to values near 2 in august p 0 001 for both ns and wd comparisons wilcoxon tests in contrast at bi shannon alpha diversity persisted at values between 5 and 6 in each month and for both ns and wd locations all possible comparisons had p 0 05 except for a slight but significant increase in diversity from about 5 to 5 7 between june and august at ns sites cluster analysis cluster dendrograms for the two beaches reveal large temporal changes over the three month sampling period at both beaches fig 7 when cluster dendrogram analysis is applied to the populations at each beach separately both beaches show june samples clustering separately from august samples illustrated in supplement fig a4 a and a4 b however despite the superficial similarity of the clustering at the two beaches considered separately when data from the two beaches are combined into a single cluster dendrogram fig 7 it becomes apparent that the community structure of bacteria at the two beaches are distinct from one another for almost all samples across the summer the cluster dendrogram for the combined dataset of both beaches in fig 7 shows almost no overlap in the distribution of the communities from the two beaches instead the resultant dendrogram fig 7 has more than four distinct groups with almost all sp samples clustering together at the left of fig 7 while most bi samples cluster together separately at the right side of the dendrogram the only exception is the cluster of bi august samples encircled by an ellipse in fig 7 principal coordinates analyses also show distinctly different distributions of the majority of samples from the two beaches on pcoa plots data shown in supplementary in fig a5 a7 two way permanova analysis indicates both temporal and spatial variation and their interactions were significantly different p 0 0001 one way permanova pairwise comparison results for sp beach indicates that june samples were significantly different from july p 0 006 and august samples p 0 006 and july samples were significantly different from august samples p 0 006 similarly bi june samples were significantly different from july p 0 012 and august samples p 0 0006 and july samples were significantly different from august samples p 0 0018 3 2 source analysis six otus were identified as unique markers for human and fecal sources source otus as listed along the left side of tables 1 and 2 the genera of these six otus varied among source types and included otus identified as jeotgalibacilus otu 15 clostridium sensu stricto 1 otu 18 streptococcus otu 27 acinetobacter otu 36 enterococcus otu 67 and lactococcus otu 69 the presence of these otus was then examined in the high throughput sequencing output from bi beach table 1 and sp beach table 2 in general a higher percentage of nearshore samples had unique source otus evidence of fecal contamination than waist deep samples at both beaches the most frequently occurring source of fecal contamination was from birds for which markers indicated this source at bi beach in 23 waist deep to 50 of samples nearshore and at sp beach in 41 nearshore and 46 waist deep of samples the human wastewater marker was identified in about 8 12 of samples at both beaches and collection locations fecal markers from farm animals cow pig were not found at sp beach however they were found in 7 to 19 of samples from bi beach table 1 similarly fecal markers of dogs domestic animal were present in a higher percentage of samples at bi beach compared to sp beach table 2 samples with e coli concentrations exceeding the safe level criterion for swimming 300 cfu 100 ml in michigan and 200 cfu 100 ml in ontario were examined for correlation between e coli concentrations and specific otus for the two locations at each of the two beaches the top 6 otus with correlation coefficient 0 5 with significance level p 0 1 were identified and are presented in table 3 none of the otus that had been identified as source specific unique otus from human and animal sources as presented in tables 1 and 2 were among those top 6 otus for any of the samples that had high e coli levels the genera of these otus that highly correlate with high e coli levels varied as listed in table 3 and include genera that encompass human pathogens pseudomonas citrobacter tatumella legionella sphingomonas and chryseobacterium 4 discussion although several high throughput sequencing studies of bacterioplankton at beaches have recently appeared mou et al 2013 sible et al 2015 carney et al 2019 mohiuddin et al 2019 paver et al 2020 and others cited elsewhere in this paper the present study is unique in its combination of frequency daily and duration three months of sampling and analysis the frequency of sampling enabled a more detailed analysis of changes in the structure of bacterial communities and the duration of the sampling period over several months enabled the observation of temporal change the comparison of bacterial communities from near shore and waist deep samples is also more intensive than prior comparisons of these sampling locations e coli data collected at the beaches and precipitation records provided specific context for the bacterial community changes we observed while the e coli data reinforce previous observations e g shanks et al 2006 that high indicator bacteria levels often occur in association with precipitation the association of high e coli with precipitation is variable possibly due to other influences such as temperature wind and variation in fecal source inputs that may also influence changes in bacterial communities that are the focus of this study the results reveal a dynamic and continual change of bacterial community composition over an entire beach season and emphasizes that patrons of these two beaches would encounter different sets of bacteria earlier in the season june than later august regardless of the counts of indicator e coli that may be present for example at bi swimmers would encounter proportionately much more variovorax than at sp but proportionately much less enterobacter perhaps somewhat surprisingly since these beaches are in close proximity within 5 km of the mouth of detroit river on lake st clair located across from one another on the same connected water body the assemblages at the two beaches nevertheless differ substantially from one another as evidenced by their distant location on a cluster dendrogram fig 7 and for most samples on a pcoa plot and analyses of alpha diversity supplementary data for temporal variation similar results were described by shahraki et al 2021a for a study conducted on 6 different beaches located on lake st clair and lake erie however unlike our present results shahraki et al 2021a reported no significant spatial variation among the samples from the six beaches hydrodynamic modeling of lake st clair during the same time period revealed significant differences between both water temperature and water age in the northwest nw and southeast se parts of lake st clair madani et al 2020 the beach waters at bi beach are seen to have a greater influence from nw lake st clair waters as compared to se for sp beach supporting the ideas that physicochemistry and hydrologic connectivity of local waters may be more important than geographic region in determining the structure of bacterial communities hengy et al 2017 paver et al 2020 this may help explain the distinct differences observed in the bacterial communities at the two beaches despite their proximity alpha diversity of bacteria at other great lakes beaches ranges from about 3 lee et al 2016 hengy et al 2017 to 7 5 nakatsu et al 2019 nevers et al 2020 a range that our data supports the dominant types of bacteria at the beaches are also similar to previous studies viz the bacterial community in lakes near beaver island and lake erie were dominated by proteobacteria primarily betaproteobacteria and also had relative abundances of 10 of actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and among a subset of samples gammaproteobacteria hengy et al 2017 shahraki et al 2021b dominance by betaproteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria was also observed by nakatsu et al 2019 three small lakes in ohio studied by lee et al 2016 were however dominated more by actinobacteria and in many instances cyanobacteria which were mostly absent in our samples with only sporadic abundances of betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria of 10 the study by lee et al 2016 was however similar to ours in doing multiple repeated sampling over an entire season albeit only about once per week and not as systematic in intervals and start and stop dates at different sites as in the present study and analyzing temporal changes with cluster dendrograms the result similarly showed that samples collected in august grouped almost completely separate from june and july branches of the dendrogram fig 5a of lee et al 2016 the greater consistency and duration of sampling underlying the cluster dendrogram analysis in the present study strongly support the hypothesis of dynamic changes between june and august at great lakes freshwater beaches this study also developed a method of identifying potential fecal sources by developing a database of unique source otus otus that were seen only in a particular source s feces and were not present or present only at abundances of 0 1 in samples that were thought to be low in fecal contamination by dint of having a low count of indicator e coli in contrast to other methods of source tracking which identify different source specific strains of a single genus e g patterns of antibiotic resistance olivas and faulkner 2008 or sequence variants ram et al 2004 of e coli or source specific strains of bacteroides ko et al 2018 each source otu in the present method is from a different genus nevertheless the method demonstrated here seems to work well the source analysis here concluded that fecal contamination at these two area beaches was predominantly from bird feces similar to the conclusion from an earlier study at two other lake st clair beaches lake st clair metro beach and memorial beach on the american side of the lake using a completely different technique ram et al 2004 that study estimated fecal sources of contamination to be approximately 50 birds 15 humans 20 pets dogs and cats and 5 farm animals proportions that are very similar to the present study the presence of rrna gene barcodes of the same genus as several potential pathogens in these beach water samples might indicate that pathogens are present however caution must be exercised in interpreting these data for one the rdp database and the use of this relatively short rrna barcode is sufficient to identify most otus only to genus and are insufficient to identify the exact species known to be a human pathogen even if it were possible to identify species with the barcode it would likely be impossible to know if the pathogenic strains of that species are present this is one of the known major drawbacks with the short read high throughput metabarcoding sequencing singer et al 2016 jeong et al 2021 as one example to consider identification of legionella which was present in a small number of samples during july and august could be identifying any of a large number of non pathogenic legionella that are found in aquatic sources duron et al 2018 furthermore the rdp 16s rrna gene database still has many unidentified uncultured bacteria barcodes that are unable to provide any useful information at genus or species level in addition software annotation error could also lead to misidentification of certain taxa edgar 2018 hence future studies should focus on using full length rrna sequences or a combination of techniques that might include validation of pathogen specific genes shahraki et al 2021a a search for otus in the high throughput output that had a good correlation with both e coli indicator bacteria and with the presence of animal fecal markers failed to turn up a consistent universal marker that could stand in for e coli for beach water testing this failure to demonstrate an alternative universal marker probably reflects the changing composition of bacteria including potentially pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environments that occurs seasonally interestingly in view of the fact that e coli is supposed to be an indicator that pathogens are present the majority of the otus that correlated with high e coli were identified as genera that contain pathogenic strains such as pseudomonas and legionella this high throughput method shows promise for identifying sources of contamination and investigating mechanisms underlying the diversity and changes that can occur at beaches with the passage of time 5 conclusions the results of almost daily sampling and next generation sequencing of bacteria at two nearby beaches in the great lakes region of north america revealed bacterial communities that changed both dramatically and differently over a three month summer sampling period key conclusions from this study are peaks in bacterial contamination frequently occurred in association with precipitation events bacterial contamination was higher nearshore than offshore at both beaches biodiversity analyzed by next generation sequence analysis of bacterial barcodes reveal a dynamic and continual change of bacterial community composition over an entire beach season at both beaches regardless of the indicator e coli that may be present beach goers would encounter different sets of bacteria earlier in the season than later despite the nearness of the beaches to one another on the same water body the bacterial assemblages at the two beaches differed substantially from one another throughout the season as shown by several different measures of diversity including relative abundance alpha diversity cluster dendrograms and pcoa distributions next generation sequence data could be used for source tracking analysis fecal associated bacterial barcodes were found in beach water samples and identified potential sources of contamination comparable to previous studies showing birds as major sources of great lakes beaches
