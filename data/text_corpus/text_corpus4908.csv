ramette et al 2007 turnbaugh et al 2009 ley et al 2010 clemente et al 2012 flint et al 2007 however our understanding of the compositional dynamics within any gut microbial community remains unclear and incomplete because these ecosystems change rapidly given the growing acknowledgement of the importance of gut microbiota for human health there is an urgent need to understand the variation in gut microbiotas between different individuals these variations are mainly revealed by the temporal dynamics of the microbial community and its interactions with the host turnbaugh et al 2009 ley 2010 jose et al 2012 flint et al 2010 in the past the lack of temporal data from microbiotas and adequate methodologies to analyze such data has made studying the temporal dynamics of microbiota difficult nowadays however long term fine scale time series data can be easily obtained david 2014 caporaso et al 2011 faust et al 2012 there are various models to study the data sets including generalized

for example if a species i is extinct at a time t 0 then x i t 0 and x t 0 at any time t t and are independent of any other taxon x j t this leads to α i 0 and β i j 0 for i j and γ i j k 0 for j k required direct pairwise interactions and neglected higher order interactions they obtained a glv model as 2 d d t x i t μ i x i t x i t j 1 l m i j x j t x i t l 1 p ε i l u l t where x i t is the abundance of a taxon at time t μ i is the growth rate of the taxon m i j is the effect of the interaction of taxon j on taxon i will change over time and ε i l is the susceptibility to time dependent perturbation u l t although stein s model can identify the network of direct pairwise interactions between the species and account for the effects of external perturbations it has some limitations in describing the dynamics of the gut microbiota assuming a focal species cannot return once it is extinct the model cannot fit a time series with an observation value of zero however many temporal observations of samples are indeed zero some cases may be caused by the detection limit of the molecular sequencing technique whereas other cases may be due to species extinction at the time of sample observation in the latter case species may recover later because of immigration from the external environment however there is no term in the stein model to represent this effect thus in this paper we outline our stochastic glv model to analyze the time series data of the gut microbiota in our model the stochastic term can represent the effects of exchanges of microbiota members with the external environment which allows our model to fit time series with zero observations we applied our model to the temporal observation of gut microbiotas comparing the microbial communities of different individuals and that of the same individual at different periods from the perspective of the gut species network structure and random intestinal effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 models and parameter estimation strategy we propose the following glv model with stochastic terms 3 d d t x i t ξ i x i t x i t j 1 l m i j x j t η i where x i t represents the abundance of a species i at a time t ξ i is a random variable with a normal distribution ξ i n μ i σ i 2 which represents the compound increase rate combined effects of factors such as death reproduction and emigration on species i η i is also a random variable but it obeys the poisson distribution η i p o i s s o n λ i λ i is the expectation of η i which indicates the immigration effect on species i m i j represents the direct pairwise interactions between species i and species j including competition or mutualism and l represents the total number of species in the community eq 3 x i t is a continuous variable to allow the estimation of the parameters of eq 3 for observational data collected in practice we changed the equation into the discrete formula 4 4 δ x i t x i t 1 x i t ξ i x i t x i t j 1 l m i j x j t η i δ t for the convenience of processing the poisson distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution bagui and mehra 2016 η i p o i s s o n λ i n λ i λ i then the expectation and variance of δ x i t are respectively 5 e δ x i t μ i x i t x i t j 1 l m i j x j t λ i and 6 var δ x i t σ i 2 x i 2 t λ i next we estimate the parameters in eq 5 let y j t x i t x j t then eq 5 can be transformed into 7 e δ x i t μ i x i t j 1 l m i j y j t λ i to estimate the parameters θ μ i m i j λ i we use the ordinary least squares method considering the difference between the number of samples and the scale of the model parameters regularization method can be used to control the model s complexity we chose the ridge method for which the parameter optimization model is 8 θ arg min θ α t 1 t e δ x i t μ i x i t j 1 l m i j y j t λ i 2 2 α θ 2 2 where 2 represents ℓ 2 norm and α is the regularization parameter after estimating the parameters μ i m i j λ i we can estimate the parameter σ i in eq 6 the residual term of eq 3 is 9 r s s i δ x i t μ i x i t x i t j 1 l m i j x j t λ i then we can obtain the likelihood function 10 i n r s s i σ i 2 x i 2 t λ i where μ i m i j and λ i are estimated parameters we can optimize the likelihood function 10 to obtain the estimated value of the parameters σ i 2 2 model validation to test the ability of our model to capture the temporal dynamics of the gut community we simulated microbial community data from randomized interaction networks and then performed model fitting we tested the method s performance on communities of 25 50 100 species under four different sampling regimes 25 50 100 or 200 samples for convenience all species in the community had the same distribution of compound increase rate ξ i n o r m 0 1 0 02 and immigration terms η i p o i s s o n 20 the construction of the interaction matrix m was performed in the following manner using the function sample smallworld of the igraph package in r we created a random directed small world network with a neighborhood size of 5 rewiring probability of 0 1 and loops allowed the network had n vertices and 5 n edges where n is the number of species in the community the network s edges which represent interactions between species were each assigned a random weight from the uniform distribution u 0 002 0 002 each species in the community was randomly assigned an abundance using the negative binomial distribution n b 100 2 with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of approximately 71 4 time series data were obtained using eq 3 this process was repeated for all 100 artificial communities generated we used the sensitivity true positive true positives false negatives and specificity true negatives true negatives false positives to validate whether the appropriate interactions were present in the estimated interaction matrix m sensitivity and specificity are larger indicate that the true positive and true negative interactions have been well estimated receiver operating characteristic curves were generated by discarding estimated interactions based on their magnitude rejecting those more likely false positives a threshold was set for discarding interactions using quantiles of the distribution of effect sizes specifically if then we discarded a where q q t and q t are the quantile function and threshold quantile respectively the error in the size of the estimates was assessed using the mean squared error mse specifically m s e i 1 n j 1 n m i j m i j 2 n 2 where the hat denotes the estimated value of the parameter and n is the community size 2 3 concepts of network properties the network is essentially a graph a network with n nodes can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix a a i j 1 i j n the elements a i j in the matrix represent the connection weights between node i and node j based on the adjacency matrix a the following concepts of network attributes are defined horvath et al 2008 langfelder et al 2011 connectivity the connectivity also known as degree of the i th node is k i j i a i j maximum adjacency ratio the maximum adjacency ratio of node i is m a r i j i a i j 2 j i a i j network density d e n s i t y j i a i j 2 j i a i j network centralization c e n t r a l i z a t i o n n n 2 k max n 1 d e n s i t y k max max j k j network heterogeneity h e t e r o g e n e i t y var k m e a n k where k is the connectivity set of all nodes in the network clustercoeff c l u s t e r c o e f i l i m i a i l a l m a m i l i a i l 2 l i a i l 2 2 4 module preservation module preservation evaluates whether a module a group of nodes that satisfy certain constraints is preserved between a test and reference network langfelder et al 2011 for a module of interest the preservation statistics are created by comparing the module statistics with the values obtained from a randomly selected group of nodes to determine whether the module remains unchanged in another network three types of preservation statistics are defined by reference eqs 1 20 of that paper these preservation statistics can be divided into three categories 1 density based statistics which can help determine whether nodes maintain high connectivity in the test network 2 connectivity based statistics which can help determine whether the patterns of connectivity in the reference network are similar to those in the test network and 3 separability based statistics which can help determine whether modules remain distinct from one another in the network because preservation statistics measure different aspects of a module the statistical results may be inconsistent this inconsistency indicates that we can combine individual preservation statistics into composite preservation statistics one such composite statistic z summary summarizes the individual z statistical values that have been computed from the permutation test the recommended thresholds for z summary are as follows zsummary 10 indicates strong preservation 2 zsummary 10 indicates weak preservation and zsummary 2 indicates no preservation the second composite statistic medianrank which summarizes the ranks of the observed preservation statistics can be used to compare modules with different sizes as it shows no dependence on the module size a module with a lower medianrank tends to exhibit stronger observed preservation statistics than a module with a higher medianrank 2 5 data sets david et al 2014 collected stool samples from 2 healthy adults donor a da and donor b db each day in total 311 and 180 smples were separately collected from da and db the v4 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene subunit was used to identify bacteria in a culture independent manner dna was amplified using custom barcoded primers and sequenced with paired end 100 bp reads on an illumina gaiix according to a previously published protocol gregory et al 2010 the execution of otu sorting and quality control was basically as described david et al 2014 in the study of shenhav et al 2019 the closed reference otu was clustered with 99 sequence similarity against the greengenes database 13 8 mcdonald et al 2012 in addition the otu table was standardized by random sub sampling and each sample contained 10 000 reads in order to compare across subjects da and db and reduce technical variance in our work we used the otu table https github com cozygene mtv lmm from shenhav et al 2019 and filled gaps i e missing days of time series with implementation of piecewise cubic interpolation pchip pchip had certain properties that were desired abundances stay above zero monotonicity is preserved does not overshoot when data is not smooth gibbons sean et al 2017 as a results we adjusted the time series data sets to contain 365 samples for da and 319 samples for db because da traveled abroad from day 71 to 122 of the study and db was salmonella infection at day 151 of the study for our purpose we focused on the samples of days 150 365 after return from traveling abroad recorded as da for donor a for donor b we focused on the samples of days 1 150 before the salmonella infection recorded as db p and the samples of days 151 319 after salmonella infection recorded as db a 3 computational details we performed all the calculations on the r language platform version 3 6 3 we used our model and method to fit three data sets da db p and db a in the processing the linearridge function which can automatically determine the regularization parameters was used to estimate the parameters μ i m i j λ i of the model the nlm function was used to optimize the likelihood function 10 to get the value of a parameter σ i then the networks were constructed with estimated interaction matrices m d a m d b a and m d b b for the convenience of network analysis we constructed a network a m m t where is the absolute value operator and m t is the transpose of a matrix m in this way the asymmetry of the interactions between species was ignored and only the strength of the relationship between species was emphasized for these networks we used the flash cluster function in the flashclust package https cran r project org package flashclust to search for modules in the network and used the cutreedynamic function to prune and produce the final modules we used the modulepreservation function in the wgcna package to evaluate the persistence of the db p modules in the db a network the functions calculate the topology information of network and modules also from the wgcna package cytoscape version 3 6 1 software was used to generate the network graphs 4 results 4 1 model validation results the results are presented in the fig s1 s3 for communities of three different sizes 25 50 100 the estimated mean μ i of the compound increase rate ξ i of the simulated community became slightly less than real value 0 1 with increasing community size the panel m of fig s2 s3 the estimated mean λ i of immigration η i is distributed around the real value 20 the panel n of fig s1 s3 for the interaction matrix m most of the specificity was greater than 0 7 due to the preponderance of true negatives in the sparse adjacency matrix the panels a d g j of fig s1 s3 the sensitivity depended on the sample size the maximum sensitivity became large near 1 with the sample size 200 the panel j of fig s1 s3 the mse of inferred interaction matrix was unaffected by threshold values the panels b e h k of fig s1 s3 it indicates that our method was robust in general the method performed well on the simulated data given the ease with which 16s data are obtained for a microbiome attaining enough samples to apply this method should not be difficult 4 2 prediction accuracy of the model in order to more intuitively show the ability of our model to capture microbial dynamics we selected three species to show their temporal variation in different individuals and different periods and the fitting of our model on those variations fig s4 s6 from these figures especially fig s6 it is obvious that the abundances of otu2 are zero ie extinction at some time nodes but it is no longer zero ie restoring at subsequent time nodes therefore to a certain extent it can be considered that the immigration effect of species exists in gut microbiota we then investigated the predictive power of the inferred model parameters for microbiota dynamics to do this we estimated the parameters of eq 3 on 2 3 of the available data leaving 1 3 of the trajectories to test the model prediction subsequently we initiated eq 3 with the microbiota abundance of t 1 time solved eq 3 numerically using the inferred parameters to predict microbiota abundance of time t in the fig 2 we compared the observed dynamics with the inferred dynamics spearman rank correlation between observed data and prediction was 57 99 and 72 for da db p and db a on the whole compared with db p and db a the model had poor prediction on da the smallest correlation coefficient 57 and the points deviates more from the diagonal this may come from two reasons the time series predicted in da is the longest the time series of db p and db a have more gaps i e missing values after using the interpolation method pchip those time series become more predictability 4 3 stochastic effects in the gut microbiota the expectation of compound increase rate μ and the expectation of immigrantion λ of our model characterize the random dynamic effects of the gut communities as listed in table 1 the random dynamic characteristics of different individuals are different μ 0 0542 vs 0 0387 0 0335 λ 116 vs 80 60 we speculate that factors such as diet or diseases of different individuals lead to these differences the same individual characteristics in different periods also had differences λ 80 vs 60 these characteristics could be related to dietary patterns especially in db a for which data were collected after food poisoning so the random characteristics may reflect that db modified the diet after poisoning thus reducing the immigration of foreign microorganisms the values of compound increase rate ξ i and immigrantion term η i and their relationship are shown in fig 3 as a random factor the mean μ i value of ξ i was negative indicating that the overall effect in the intestinal flora was to inhibit the growth of bacteria the mean λ i value of η i was positive indicating that the gut community was affected by external bacterial migration none of the past models had taken this effect into account if the value 0 05 was selected as the threshold value of p value there was a negative correlation between μ i and λ i pearson correlation coefficient and p value 0 38 and 0 006 in da 0 31 and 0 031 in db p 0 326 and 0 021 in db a this indicated that the species that tended to decline had a stronger immigration effect 4 4 network analysis of gut microbiota as shown in table 2 the db p network fig s8 had more edges than the da network 1013 vs 831 which also rendered the other index values of db p larger than those of da fig s7 however although db p also had more modules than da 4 vs 3 da had the largest modules 22 nodes 130 edges and the strongest average connectivity and density the network s heterogeneity coefficient and db p modules were also larger than those in da table 2 column 8 these results indicate that the gut microbiota network s topological structure differs among different individuals and the interrelationships within the microbiotas are not stable not only does the composition of the gut microbiota vary greatly from person to person but so too does the relationships of the microbes involved this observation is consistent with previous findings that each individual has unique gut microbiota characteristics next we investigated the interaction network of the gut microbiota at different points in time db p vs db a within the same individual all of the topological metrics of network db a fig s9 were larger than those of network db p table 1 ninth row vs the thirteenth row although db a had fewer modules than db p 3 vs 4 they were larger 22 nodes 270 edges however the overall heterogeneity coefficient of the modules in db p was larger than that of those in db a as shown in table 3 the z summary values for the four modules in db p were all less than 2 langfelder et al 2011 thus the modules in db p were not persistent in the db a network the db individual had experienced profound changes in the gut microbiota after developing diarrhea which was consistent with the results of david et al 2014 in summary the structure of an individual s gut microbiota can be affected by some events and these influences may profoundly change the network structure of the gut microbiota in a short time 5 discussion inspired by macarthur and wilson s theory of island biogeography macarthur et al 1967 levin 1969 the classic neutral theory has a metacommunity and a local community the driving forces of community change are not the same between the metacommunity and the local community hubble 2001 in the metacommunity the events of death reproduction and speciation drive microbiota change potentially stein et al 2013 models the gut microbiota as a metacommunity and established their glv model this makes their model faces some limitations in application stein et al 2013 assumed that once a species becomes extinct it cannot return it means that once a zero value observation appears in a time series of observations at a certain sample time the observation value of the species should be zero after that time therefore stein et al 2013 had to select time series of the sample data without the zero observation value to fit their model this choice also made it convenient for them to estimate the model parameters by taking the logarithm of both sides of the model and then generating the corresponding approximation the model s problem estimation is transformed into the problem of least square estimation although it is possible to obtain a lot of statistical information this inability to deal with microbial time series observations with a zero value is a major limitation of the model of stein et al 2013 in contrast we developed a stochastic glv model from the gut microbiota perspective being a local community under this assumption the number of individual microbes in the gut microbiota is driven by the death reproduction immigration and emigration of species macarthur and wilson 1967 hubbell 2001 in the human body s digestive system the oral cavity esophagus stomach and other organs precede the intestinal tract the microbiotas in these organs will move into the gut together with food water and other substances simultaneously the microbiota in the intestinal tract will move out of the gut together with other substances in feces therefore it is reasonable to regard the gut microbiota as a local community because it is difficult to quantify the respective effects of these factors we used the random variable ξ i to allow comprehensive quantification of the roles of these factors the immigration of species from the external environment will change the number of individual species in the local community which in our model is quantified using the random variable η i the results of our model fitting to the real data were agreement with the theoretical expectation the interactions between gut organisms were varied across individuals and time periods table 2 fig 4 our model captured significant immigration effects fig 3 showed the property of gut microbiota as a local community the mean value of compound increase rate were all negative this was defferent with previous growth rate fisher et al 2014 stein et al 2013 we speculated that the emigration effect of gut organisms exists our results agree that temporal variability of gut microbiota is a personalized feature flores et al 2014 to date various types of dynamic models have been proposed for microbial communities the models always focus on specific aspects the stability of the community may 1972 alban and ramette 2007 shang et al 2017 levine et al 2017 grilli et al 2017 tarmo et al 2017 gavina et al 2018 gibbs et al 2018 the neutrality fisher and mehta 2014 washburne et al 2016 or mechanisms of species abundance distribution mcgill et al 2007 matthews and whittaker 2015 glv models are more popular in research because of their strong theoretical foundation in community ecology and dynamical systems theory fisher et al 2014 bucci et al 2016 shang et al 2017 yoshimura 2018 joseph et al 2020 remien et al 2018 xu et al 2020 descheemaeker et al 2020 glv model implemented with stochastic elements is more appropriate for modeling the dynamics of microbial communities faust et al 2018 and can capture the characteristics of experimental time series of microbial communities descheemaeker et al 2020 however to our knowledge there has not yet been implemented a stochastic glv incorporating immigration terms for experimental time series of microbial communities the design of our model takes into account these issues thus our model can capture more dynamic features of microbial communities if the effects of emigration immigration are classified as neutrality and the interactions between species are classified as niche our model can be used to discuss the characteristics of the construction and evolution mechanism of gut community thus our model can shed new light on reaserach of gut microbiota both in theory and practice 6 conclusions we have proposed a stochastic glv model based on a local community perspective to study human gut microbiota and have provided a reliable parameter estimation method using this model we investigated the network structure and random changes in the gut microbiotas of different individuals and between the microbial communities of the same individual at different times our model overcomes the limitation of zero observation in time series of microbiota and can capture changes caused by the immigration of species our model and method also can be applied to more general temporal metagenomic data funding

parameters we can optimize the likelihood function 10 to obtain the estimated value of the parameters σ i 2 2 model validation to test the ability of our model to capture the temporal dynamics of the gut community we simulated microbial community data from randomized interaction networks and then performed model fitting we tested the method s performance on communities of 25 50 100 species under four different sampling regimes 25 50 100 or 200 samples for convenience all species in the community had the same distribution of compound increase rate ξ i n o r m 0 1 0 02 and immigration terms η i p o i s s o n 20 the construction of the interaction matrix m was performed in the following manner using the function sample smallworld of the igraph package in r we created a random directed small world network with a neighborhood size of 5 rewiring probability of 0 1 and loops allowed the network had n vertices and 5 n edges where n is the number of species in the community the network s edges which represent interactions between species were each assigned a random weight from the uniform distribution u 0 002 0 002 each species in the community was randomly assigned an abundance using the negative binomial distribution n b 100 2 with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of approximately 71 4 time series data were obtained using eq 3 this process was repeated for all 100 artificial communities generated we used the sensitivity true positive true positives false negatives and specificity true negatives true negatives false positives to validate whether the appropriate interactions were present in the estimated interaction matrix m sensitivity and specificity are larger indicate that the true positive and true negative interactions have been well estimated receiver operating characteristic curves were generated by discarding estimated interactions based on their magnitude rejecting those more likely false positives a threshold was set for discarding interactions using quantiles of the distribution of effect sizes specifically if then we discarded a where q q t and q t are the quantile function and threshold quantile respectively the error in the size of the estimates was assessed using the mean squared error mse specifically m s e i 1 n j 1 n m i j m i j 2 n 2 where the hat denotes the estimated value of the parameter and n is the community size 2 3 concepts of network properties the network is essentially a graph a network with n nodes can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix a a i j 1 i j n the elements a i j in the matrix represent the connection weights between node i and node j based on the adjacency matrix a the following concepts of network attributes are defined horvath et al 2008 langfelder et al 2011 connectivity the connectivity also known as degree of the i th node is k i j i a i j maximum adjacency ratio the maximum adjacency ratio of node i is m a r i j i a i j 2 j i a i j network density d e

a module a group of nodes that satisfy certain constraints is preserved between a test and reference network langfelder et al 2011 for a module of interest the preservation statistics are created by comparing the module statistics with the values obtained from a randomly selected group of nodes to determine whether the module remains unchanged in another network three types of preservation statistics are defined by reference eqs 1 20 of that paper these preservation statistics can be divided into three categories 1 density based statistics which can help determine whether nodes maintain high connectivity in the test network 2 connectivity based statistics which can help determine whether the patterns of connectivity in the reference network are similar to those in the test network and 3 separability based statistics which can help determine whether modules remain distinct from one another in the network because preservation statistics measure different aspects of a module the statistical results may be inconsistent this inconsistency indicates that we can combine individual preservation statistics into composite preservation statistics one such composite statistic z summary summarizes the individual z statistical values that have been computed from the permutation test the recommended thresholds for z summary are as follows zsummary 10 indicates strong preservation 2 zsummary 10 indicates weak preservation and zsummary 2 indicates no preservation the second composite statistic medianrank which summarizes the ranks of the observed preservation statistics can be used to compare modules with different sizes as it shows no dependence on the module size a module with a lower medianrank tends to exhibit stronger observed preservation statistics than a module with a higher medianrank 2 5 data sets david et al 2014 collected stool samples from 2 healthy adults donor a da and donor b db each day in total 311 and 180 smples were separately collected from da and db the v4 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene subunit was used to identify bacteria in a culture independent manner dna was amplified using custom barcoded primers and sequenced with paired end 100 bp reads on an illumina gaiix according to a previously published protocol gregory et al 2010 the execution of otu sorting and quality control was basically as described david et al 2014 in the study of shenhav et al 2019 the closed reference otu was clustered with 99 sequence similarity against the greengenes database 13 8 mcdonald et al 2012 in addition the otu table was standardized by random sub sampling and each sample contained 10 000 reads in order to compare across subjects da and db and reduce technical variance in our work we used the otu table https github com cozygene mtv lmm from shenhav et al 2019 and filled gaps i e missing days of time series with implementation of piecewise cubic interpolation pchip pchip had certain properties that were desired abundances stay above zero monotonicity is preserved does not overshoot when data is not smooth gibbons sean et al 2017 as a results we adjusted the time series data sets to contain 365 samples for da and 319 samples for db because da traveled abroad from day 71 to 122 of the study and db was salmonella infection at day 151 of the study for our purpose we focused on the samples of days 150 365 after return from traveling abroad recorded as da for donor a for donor b we focused on the samples of days 1 150 before the salmonella infection recorded as db p and the samples of days 151 319 after salmonella infection recorded as db a 3 computational details we performed all the calculations on the r language platform version 3 6 3 we used our model and method to fit three data sets da db p and db a in the processing the linearridge function which can automatically determine the regularization parameters was used to estimate the parameters μ i m i j λ i of the model the nlm function was used to optimize the likelihood function 10 to get the value of a parameter σ i then the networks were constructed with estimated interaction matrices m d a m d b a and m d b b for the convenience of network analysis we constructed a network a m m t where is the absolute value operator and m t is the transpose of a matrix m in this way the asymmetry of the interactions between species was ignored and only the strength of the relationship between species was emphasized for these networks we used the flash cluster function in the flashclust package https cran r project org package flashclust to search for modules in the network and used the cutreedynamic function to prune and produce the final modules we used the modulepreservation function in the wgcna package to evaluate the persistence of the db p modules in the db a network the functions calculate the topology information of network and modules also from the wgcna package cytoscape version 3 6 1 software was used to generate the network graphs 4 results 4 1 model validation results the results are presented in the fig s1 s3 for communities of three different sizes 25 50 100 the estimated mean μ i of the compound increase rate ξ i of the simulated community became slightly less than real value 0 1 with increasing community size the panel m of fig s2 s3 the estimated mean λ i of immigration η i is distributed around the real value 20 the panel n of fig s1 s3 for the interaction matrix m most of the specificity was greater than 0 7 due to the preponderance of true negatives in the sparse adjacency matrix the panels a d g j of fig s1 s3 the sensitivity depended on the sample size the maximum sensitivity became large near 1 with the sample size 200 the panel j of fig s1 s3 the mse of inferred interaction matrix was unaffected by threshold values the panels b e h k of fig s1 s3 it indicates that our method was robust in general the method performed well on the simulated data given the ease with which 16s data are obtained for a microbiome attaining enough samples to apply this method should not be difficult 4 2 prediction accuracy of the model in order to more intuitively show the ability of our model to capture microbial dynamics we selected three species to show their temporal variation in different individuals and different periods and the fitting of our model on those variations fig s4 s6 from these figures especially fig s6 it is obvious that the abundances of otu2 are zero ie extinction at some time nodes but it is no longer zero ie restoring at subsequent time nodes therefore to a certain extent it can be considered that the immigration effect of species exists in gut microbiota we then investigated the predictive power of the inferred model parameters for microbiota dynamics to do this we estimated the parameters of eq 3 on 2 3 of the available data leaving 1 3 of the trajectories to test the model prediction subsequently we initiated eq 3 with the microbiota abundance of t 1 time solved eq 3 numerically using the inferred parameters to predict microbiota abundance of time t in the fig 2 we compared the observed dynamics with the inferred dynamics spearman rank correlation between observed data and prediction was 57 99 and 72 for da db p and db a on the whole compared with db p and db a the model had poor prediction on da the smallest correlation coefficient 57 and the points deviates more from the diagonal this may come from two reasons the time series predicted in da is the longest the time series of db p and db a have more gaps i e missing values after using the interpolation method pchip those time series become more predictability 4 3 stochastic effects in the gut microbiota the expectation of compound increase rate μ and the expectation of immigrantion λ of our model characterize the random dynamic effects of the gut communities as listed in table 1 the random dynamic characteristics of different individuals are different μ 0 0542 vs 0 0387 0 0335 λ 116 vs 80 60 we speculate that factors such as diet or diseases of different individuals lead to these differences the same individual characteristics in different periods also had differences λ 80 vs 60 these characteristics could be related to dietary patterns especially in db a for which data were collected after food poisoning so the random characteristics may reflect that db modified the diet after poisoning thus reducing the immigration of foreign microorganisms the values of compound increase rate ξ i and immigrantion term η i and their relationship are shown in fig 3 as a random factor the mean μ i value of ξ i was negative indicating that the overall effect in the intestinal flora was to inhibit the growth of bacteria the mean λ i value of η i was positive indicating that the gut community was affected by external bacterial migration none of the past models had taken this effect into account if the value 0 05 was selected as the threshold value of p value there was a negative correlation between μ i and λ i pearson correlation coefficient and p value 0 38 and 0 006 in da 0 31 and 0 031 in db p 0 326 and 0 021 in db a this indicated that the species that tended to decline had a stronger immigration effect 4 4 network analysis of gut microbiota as shown in table 2 the db p network fig s8 had more edges than the da network 1013 vs 831 which also rendered the other index values of db p larger than those of da fig s7 however although db p also had more modules than da 4 vs 3 da had the largest modules 22 nodes 130 edges and the strongest average connectivity and density the network s heterogeneity coefficient and db p modules were also larger than those in da table 2 column 8 these results indicate that the gut microbiota network s topological structure differs among different individuals and the interrelationships within the microbiotas are not stable not only does the composition of the gut microbiota vary greatly from person to person but so too does the relationships of the microbes involved this observation is consistent with previous findings that each individual has unique gut microbiota characteristics next we investigated the interaction network of the gut microbiota at different points in time db p vs db a within the same individual all of the topological metrics of network db a fig s9 were larger than those of network db p table 1 ninth row vs the thirteenth row although db a had fewer modules than db p 3 vs 4 they were larger 22 nodes 270 edges however the overall heterogeneity coefficient of the modules in db p was larger than that of those in db a as shown in table 3 the z summary values for the four modules in db p were all less than 2 langfelder et al 2011 thus the modules in db p were not persistent in the db a network the db individual had experienced profound changes in the gut microbiota after developing diarrhea which was consistent with the results of david et al 2014 in summary the structure of an individual s gut microbiota can be affected by some events and these influences may profoundly change the network structure of the gut microbiota in a short time 5 discussion inspired by macarthur and wilson s theory of island biogeography macarthur et al 1967 levin 1969 the classic neutral theory has a metacommunity and a local community the driving forces of community change are not the same between the metacommunity and the local community hubble 2001 in the metacommunity the events of death reproduction and speciation drive microbiota change potentially stein et al 2013 models the gut microbiota as a metacommunity and established their glv model this makes their model faces some limitations in application stein et al 2013 assumed that once a species becomes extinct it cannot return it means that once a zero value observation appears in a time series of observations at a certain sample time the observation value of the species should be zero after that time therefore stein et al 2013 had to select time series of the sample data without the zero observation value to fit their model this choice also made it convenient for them to estimate the model parameters by taking the logarithm of both sides of the model and then generating the corresponding approximation the model s problem estimation is transformed into the problem of least square estimation although it is possible to obtain a lot of statistical information this inability to deal with microbial time series observations with a zero value is a major limitation of the model of stein et al 2013 in contrast we developed a stochastic glv model from the gut microbiota perspective being a local community under this assumption the number of individual microbes in the gut microbiota is driven by the death reproduction immigration and emigration of species macarthur and wilson 1967 hubbell 2001 in the human body s digestive system the oral cavity esophagus stomach and other organs precede the intestinal tract the microbiotas in these organs will move into the gut together with food water and other substances simultaneously the microbiota in the intestinal tract will move out of the gut together with other substances in feces therefore it is reasonable to regard the gut microbiota as a local community because it is difficult to quantify the respective effects of these factors we used the random variable ξ i to allow comprehensive quantification of the roles of these factors the immigration of species from the external environment will change the number of individual species in the local community which in our model is quantified using the random variable η i the results of our model fitting to the real data were agreement with the theoretical expectation the interactions between gut organisms were varied across individuals and time periods table 2 fig 4 our model captured significant immigration effects fig 3 showed the property of gut microbiota as a local community the mean value of compound increase rate were all negative this was defferent with previous growth rate fisher et al 2014 stein et al 2013 we speculated that the emigration effect of gut organisms exists our results agree that temporal variability of gut microbiota is a personalized feature flores et al 2014 to date various types of dynamic models have been proposed for microbial communities the models always focus on specific aspects the stability of the community may 1972 alban and ramette 2007 shang et al 2017 levine et al 2017 grilli et al 2017 tarmo et al 2017 gavina et al 2018 gibbs et al 2018 the neutrality fisher and mehta 2014 washburne et al 2016 or mechanisms of species abundance distribution mcgill et al 2007 matthews and whittaker 2015 glv models are more popular in research because of their strong theoretical foundation in community ecology and dynamical systems theory fisher et al 2014 bucci et al 2016 shang et al 2017 yoshimura 2018 joseph et al 2020 remien et al 2018 xu et al 2020 descheemaeker et al 2020 glv model implemented with stochastic elements is more appropriate for modeling the dynamics of microbial communities faust et al 2018 and can capture the characteristics of experimental time series of microbial communities descheemaeker et al 2020 however to our knowledge there has not yet been implemented a stochastic glv incorporating immigration terms for experimental time series of microbial communities the design of our model takes into account these issues thus our model can capture more dynamic features of microbial communities if the effects of emigration immigration are classified as neutrality and the interactions between species are classified as niche our model can be used to discuss the characteristics of the construction and evolution mechanism of gut community thus our model can shed new light on reaserach of gut microbiota both in theory and practice 6 conclusions we have proposed a stochastic glv model based on a local community perspective to study human gut microbiota and have provided a reliable parameter estimation method using this model we investigated the network structure and random changes in the gut microbiotas of different individuals and between the microbial communities of the same individual at different times our model overcomes the limitation of zero observation in time series of microbiota and can capture changes caused by the immigration of species our model and method also can be applied to more general temporal metagenomic data funding

24541,in environments with strong seasonality many herbivorous zooplankton remain active only during the productive season and undergo a period of inactivity and suppressed development termed diapause during the unproductive season the ability to time the diapause entry and exit in response to the seasonality of the environment is thus essential for their survival however timing of diapause may become challenging when environmental conditions vary stochastically across shorter and longer timescales and particularly when zooplankton lack external cues to predict these variations in this study we used a novel individual based model to study the emerging patterns of diapause timing of the high latitude marine herbivorous copepod calanus finmarchicus under shorter 6 h and longer term interannual environmental stochasticity the model simulated growth development survival and reproduction income breeding of a c finmarchicus population over multiple calendar years and traced the emergence of behavioral responses and life history strategies the emergent timing of diapause entry and exit were robust to shorter term environmental stochasticity which was manifested through morphological i e body and energy reserve sizes and behavioral plasticity i e diel vertical migration longer term stochastic variations of temperature and food environments altered the timing of diapause entry which occurred earlier in warmer years with higher growth potential and vice versa irrespective of the modelled environmental variability diapause exit occurred asynchronously throughout the year this appeared to be a consequence of a diversified bet hedging strategy where parents spread the starvation mortality risk of ascending to the upper pelagial at food deprived times of the year among their offspring this was a potent strategy particularly in simulations where the timing of the algal bloom varied stochastically between years since a fraction of the population was present in the upper pelagial year round and those that coincided with the emergence of the pelagic primary production survived and produced the next generation keywords environmental heterogeneity bet hedging phenotypic plasticity overwintering oversummering copepods 1 introduction characterizing variability in natural environments and understanding the adaptations of organisms to these changes are fundamental aspects of behavioral and evolutionary ecology environmental changes occur both across time temporal environmental heterogeneity and space spatial environmental heterogeneity pigliucci 2001 a part of this heterogeneity follows well established cyclic patterns such as the diel and seasonal variability of solar irradiance or trends such as the gradual change of climate across latitude and altitude organisms generally respond to environmental heterogeneity in three main ways i when environmental changes are long lasting and the selection pressures are persistent standing genetic variation together with recombination and mutation will produce locally adapted genotypes through adaptive evolution adaptive tracking byers 2005 ii when selection pressures fluctuate across shorter spatio temporal scales a strategy termed phenotypic plasticity becomes potent this involves the production of different phenotypes by a single genotype that characterize various physiological morphological behavioral and life history responses ghalambor et al 2007 iii in environments with highly unpredictable variability a strategy termed bet hedging reduces fitness fluctuations of genotypes between generations slatkin 1974 this may occur through the production of phenotypes that perform reasonably well under good and bad environmental scenarios conservative bet hedging or by spreading the risk of certain behavioral and life history decisions among an array of different phenotypes diversified bet hedging simons 2011 zooplankton in high latitude marine environments are particularly exposed to spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity in terms of time the daylength photoperiod may transit from near continuous darkness polar night 0l 24d to near continuous daylight midnight sun 24l 0d within a year this seasonality results in a productive season with well demarcated windows of high primary production e g spring summer and an unproductive season e g autumn winter although these irradiance driven environmental variations are largely predictable notable stochastic oscillations occur atop these diel and seasonal patterns for example shorter term variations of cloud cover can attenuate subsurface irradiance and momentarily influence the efficiency of visually orientating pelagic predators eiane et al 1997 ryer and olla 1999 in addition the upper pelagic ambient temperature and primary production may also vary in the shorter term depending on the fluctuations of irradiance extent of convective vertical mixing horizontal advection and grazing pressure brainerd and gregg 1995 cushing 1990 wang et al 2005 wood and corcoran 1966 in the longer term timing and the duration of the productive season may vary between years depending on the fluctuations of ambient temperature water column stratification ice retreat timing and nutrient supply uitz et al 2010 wassmann et al 2006 in terms of space zooplankton encounter environmental gradients e g temperature salinity density dissolved oxygen food availability predation risk during their routine vertical excursions through the water column zooplankton also continuously drift with water currents which can either be of shorter spatial extent e g cross shelf exchange processes torgersen and huse 2005 or of broader trans latitude extent e g ji et al 2012 although vertical and latitudinal environmental gradients follow generic trends and are predictable to some extent frequent changes in vertical mixing and mesoscale phenomena such as eddies hydrographical fronts and varying bottom depths can induce stochastic environmental variations in space mann and lazier 2006 mcgillicuddy 2016 adaptations of high latitude zooplankton to predictable cyclic environmental variations are relatively well understood these adaptations are most pronounced among the herbivore community hagen and auel 2001 varpe 2012 the food phytoplankton availability for herbivorous zooplankton is seasonally limited and restricted to the upper pelagial photic zone the earliest available food emerges in the spring when the upper pelagial is typically colder and perhaps under ice cover this may reduce grazing assimilation and growth rates of herbivorous zooplankton huntley and lopez 1992 romare et al 2005 although the primary production generally extends towards summer the near constant summertime illumination elevates the light dependent visual predation risk in the upper pelagial zooplankton tend to minimize visual predation risk by descending to deeper darker layers to take refuge during daytime while ascending to the near surface layers to feed during the night a behavior known as diel vertical migration dvm reviewed in bandara et al 2021 brierley 2014 although dvm is effective against visual predation risk it typically shrinks the daily foraging window which leads to slower growth and development rates bandara et al 2018 loose and dawidowicz 1994 because of higher predation risk or fading food concentrations towards autumn most herbivorous zooplankton descend to deeper waters and enter a state of hibernation termed diapause for 6 8 months of the year reviewed in bandara et al 2021 baumgartner and tarrant 2017 investigations of the adaptations of high latitude zooplankton to stochastic environmental variability are mostly conducted in the shorter term and focus on the plasticity of zooplankton behavior to stochastic environmental oscillations for example eiane and parisi 2001 and record and young 2006 used empirical data and simulation models to study the changes of zooplankton dvm in response to variations in cloud cover their findings suggest that zooplankton can instantaneously modify their dvm behavior to increase grazing time in near surface layers even at midday when the skies are relatively cloudy and dark a classic example of the plasticity of dvm behavior see bandara et al 2021 for a review similar cases of dvm plasticity have been observed and predicted in response to sudden and often unpredictable subsurface irradiance attenuation episodes caused by solar and lunar eclipses e g strömberg et al 2002 tarling et al 1999 smoke from wildfire e g urmy et al 2016 suspended matter and algal blooms e g fiksen and carlotti 1998 williamson et al 2020 investigations of the influence of longer term environmental stochasticity on diapause timing of high latitude zooplankton are rare and the present knowledgebase is largely theory driven for example ji 2011 viewed the model predicted variations of diapause entry timing of the high latitude copepod calanus finmarchicus in the light of phenotypic plasticity which allows the animals to cope with spatial and temporal interannual environmental stochasticity expected in the western north atlantic further a model for c finmarchicus by fiksen 2000 demonstrated prioritized reserve accumulation and early diapause entry in stochastic settings see also kvile et al 2018 varpe and ejsmond 2018 since diapause entry usually negates the attainment of sexual maturity and production of an additional generation or two within the same productive season see also kaartvedt 2000 varpe and fiksen 2010 such strategies are viewed as acts of conservative bet hedging which can be essential for survival when the growth potential i e food availability and temperature varies stochastically between years empirical evidence in this regard exists in freshwater literature where diapausing stages i e resting eggs of rotifers are produced earlier when the length of the growing season varies stochastically over time e g franch gras et al 2019 tarazona et al 2017 in contrast the role of bet hedging in diapause exit is poorly understood except in the case of the hatching of resting eggs from egg banks evans and dennehy 2005 in addition there is no broad agreement about the mechanism s by which high latitude herbivorous zooplankton time their diapause exit in relation to the interannually variable timing of pelagic primary production the timing of diapause exit becomes even more enigmatic when diapausing populations are advected into different environments by moving water masses espinasse et al 2016 rullyanto et al 2015 this is because timing and the duration of primary production vary significantly across space daase et al 2013 falk petersen et al 2009 and diapausing populations seem to lack perceivable cues to predict the timing of pelagic primary production particularly when they occupy habitats several thousand meters below the productive near surface waters østvedt 1955 our research focuses on investigating the adaptations of a predominantly herbivorous high latitude copepod calanus finmarchicus to environmental stochasticity c finmarchicus is a species that encounters pronounced environmental variability in their natural habitats since its geographical range spans across ca 40 of latitudes across the north atlantic towards the high arctic conover 1988 fleminger and hulsemann 1977 melle et al 2014 in this study we present an individual based model that can simulate the life cycle of c finmarchicus in great spatial temporal and biological resolution and use it to investigate its adaptations to environmental stochasticity in particular we invoke the potential ecological roles of adaptive tracking phenotypic plasticity and bet hedging as strategies that aids c finmarchicus to time its diapause in environments where the irradiance temperature food availability and predation risk vary stochastically on diurnal seasonal and interannual basis 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview the present model is an extension of our previous work bandara et al 2018 and 2019 which were aimed towards investigating the adaptations of high latitude herbivorous copepods calanus spp to predictable cyclic diel and seasonal environmental heterogeneity deterministic settings in this study we added a level of stochastic environmental variations atop these predictable cyclic patterns further we upgraded the genetic algorithm based strategy oriented construct of the predecessor models to a more versatile individual based construct and made notable changes and upgrades to the growth and development survival and reproductive submodels see appendix a1 in supplementary material for a detailed comparison of the present model and its predecessors the model comprises two entities model copepods and the model environment model copepods are simplified representations of calanus finmarchicus in terms of morphology morphometry behavior and life history see section 2 2 1 1 for details the behavioral and life history strategies of model copepods are determined by five evolvable attributes genes that collectively form their genome the genome of each copepod contains information on energy allocation patterns body size and the timing of dvm diapause and seasonal vertical migration svm fig 1 a b table 1 the model environment is a 500 m deep unidimensional seasonal setting resolved to 1 m bins see section 2 2 1 2 for details this model follows an open ended life cycle simulation approach accordingly starting from an artificially seeded batch of eggs the growth and development survival and reproduction of model copepods are simulated in model environments at 6 h temporal and 1 m vertical spatial resolution see section 2 2 2 for details during reproduction the genome information of male and female copepods is recombined and mutated to generate new genotypes that may produce phenotypes with different behavioral and life history strategies i e each mating male and female pair can produce a range of phenotypes fig 1b the model environments may vary stochastically in the shorter term between 6 h intervals or longer term interannually during the simulation simulations are performed for 100 calendar years i e several hundred generations assuming a 1 year generation time for c finmarchicus depending on the simulated environmental dynamics model copepods with favorable strategies may attain higher fitness and their genes may eventually be fixed in the population over time fig 1c 2 2 model description 2 2 1 entities 2 2 1 1 model copepods c finmarchicus is a predominantly herbivorous copepod species that inhabits the north atlantic and arctic oceans conover 1988 viable c finmarchicus populations can range from the gulf of maine 43 n fish 1936 to north of the svalbard archipelago 80 n daase and eiane 2007 this broad trans latitude geographical distribution is due to their association with atlantic water masses which transport c finmarchicus populations from their center of distribution in the north atlantic towards the arctic ocean this exposes them to notable variations in temperature irradiance food and predation environments c finmarchicus has a life cycle with 13 developmental stages egg six naupliar stages five copepodite stages and adults in higher latitudes it typically follows an annual life cycle one generation per year whereas in lower latitudes it may complete 2 3 generations each year melle et al 2014 towards the end of the feeding season late juvenile stages copepodite stages iv and v of c finmarchicus store lipids and descend to deeper waters for diapause falk petersen et al 2009 diapause duration varies between 4 and 6 months during which the stored lipids are metabolized at a considerably lower rate than for metabolism during the parts of the year when they are active hirche 1996a maps et al 2013 fig 1a c finmarchicus has many similarities with other herbivorous copepods such as calanoides acutus in the southern ocean and calanus glacialis in the northern hemisphere 2 2 1 2 model environment the model environment characterizes three variables irradiance temperature and food concentration their formulation is originally based on cottier et al 2010 and are described in detail in bandara et al 2018 and 2019 in the most basic form the model runs in a deterministic environment fig 2 a c to simulate shorter term environmental stochasticity we modified the deterministic model environment by introducing uniform random variations in the range of 25 to temperature and food concentration at each 6 h time interval fig 2e f similarly uniform random variations were introduced to irradiance in the range of 90 and 0 to simulate the attenuation of incident irradiance due to cloud cover fig 2d to simulate the longer term interannual environmental stochasticity we introduced uniform random variations to the maximum sea surface temperature in the range of 3 c which in turn drives the modelled maximum food concentration in the range of 45 µg c l 1 and the timing and duration of thermal stratification and pelagic primary production in the range of 75 d fig 2g i the above data ranges were defined based on i environmental data collected by autonomous surface and underwater vehicles and ferryboxes operating in

1 growth and development the growth and development of model copepods follow the formulations developed for c finmarchicus by maps et al 2012a and bandara et al 2019 all rates below are given as hourly estimates which are adjusted to the temporal resolution of the model 6 h in calculations the body mass µg c is the sole proxy of body size used in this model the somatic growth rate of individual i at timestep t in depth bin z g µg c ind 1 h 1 is estimated in carbon units as a balance between the assimilation a µg c ind 1 h 1 and metabolic rates b µg c ind 1 h 1 as 1 g i t z a i t z b i t z the assimilation rate is a product of the ingestion rate i µg c ind 1 h 1 and the assimilation coefficient a table 1 the growth equation can thus be rearranged into 2 g i t z a i i t z b i t z at the reference temperature of 2 c the ingestion rate relates with the structural mass of the copepods wc µg c as 3 i i t b w c i t m here the terms b and m represent mass coefficient and exponent of ingestion table 1 the ingestion rate relates exponentially with the ambient temperature as 4 i i t z i i t c exp n t t z here i is the maximum temperature dependent ingestion rate and c and n are temperature coefficient and exponent of ingestion table 1 the ambient food concentration f µg c l 1 maps the temperature dependent ingestion rate between 0 and 1 as 5 i i t z i i t z d i t f t z 1 d i t f t z here the ingestion rate becomes solely temperature dependent above a satiation food concentration which is given by the size dependence of the parameter d as 6 d i t 0 30 w c i t 0 138 the satiation food concentration thus increases with the body mass of the copepods and falls in the range of 75 125 µg c l 1 cf campbell et al 2001 huntley and boyd 1984 the growth formulations in eqs 1 6 do not apply to eggs and the first two nauplii stages ni and nii which do not feed instead they encounter a negative growth as the energy reserves are catabolized to meet the energetic demands marshall and orr 1972 the development of non feeding stages is thus solely temperature dependent corkett et al 1986 and occurs following a bělehrádek function as 7 d i t z 4 q j t t z 9 11 2 05 here d is the estimated development time in 6 h time intervals and thus the scalar 4 on the right hand side of the eq 7 the stage specific 1 j 3 values for the parameter q are based on the estimates of campbell et al 2001 table 1 the development of feeding stages niii adult 3 j 13 occurs as the structural mass of copepods wc exceed a stage specific critical molting mass wj we estimated the wj values following the growth formulations of maps et al 2012a for c finmarchicus at each environmental setting we produced the minimum and maximum estimates for wj i e wj min and wj max by running the maps et al 2012a model for annual maximum and minimum temperatures at non limiting food concentrations consequently wj min and wj max estimates fluctuate between years depending on the interannual ambient temperature and food concentration variations the gene α 0 1 maintains the variability of body size within the copepod population the environment specific critical molting mass for any developmental stage niii onwards is estimated as 8 w j i w j m i n i w j m a x i w j m i n i α i here based on the value of the gene α the ontogenetic body mass trajectories of copepods tend to occupy a fixed fraction of the estimated minima and maxima 2 2 2 2 survival 2 2 2 2 1 predation risk similar to the study by bandara et al 2019 the predation risk in this model possesses two components the light and size dependent visual predation risk and the non visual tactile predation risk the light dependency of visual predation risk is given as 9 l t z l t 0 exp ψ z here lt 0 and lt z are the estimated irradiance µmol m 2 s 1 on the modelled sea surface and at depth z 500 m z 0 m the constant ψ represents the water column light attenuation coefficient table 1 we scaled lt z to obtain a probability metric l t z that ranges between 0 1 0 9 which offers non zero probability for survival and death respectively at the highest and lowest levels of irradiance bandara et al 2018 2019 the visual predation risk mv i e the probability of death by visual predation is thus given as 10 m v i t z l t z k i t 1 1 exp 350 w c s i t 75 here k 10 7 0 25 is a scalar for visual predation risk that adjusts the visual predation risk to the temporal resolution of the model the asymptotic exponential function at the right hand side of eq 10 represents the size dependence of visual predation risk fig 3 a where wcs µg c is the total mass of the copepod i e the sum of the structural mass wc and the energy reserve mass ws unlike the light and size dependent visual predation risk the modelled non visual predation risk mn i e the probability of death by non visual predation range 10 7 10 3 is kept constant over time and depth for simplicity eiane and parisi 2001 2 2 2 2 2 diel vertical migration dvm in this model the shorter term vertical behavior of the modelled copepods is driven by their photoreactive behavior ringelberg 2010 thereby the model copepods react to absolute light intensity and tend to avoid irradiance levels above an individual specific threshold determined by the gene β 0 1 if the maximum irradiance of the current environmental setting is lmax µmol m 2 s 1 the threshold irradiance of a given individual at a given time lthreshold µmol m 2 s 1 is estimated as 11 l t h r e s h o l d i t l m a x β i l m a x β i 1 exp 350 w c s i t 75 the asymptotic exponential function at the right hand side of the eq 11 highlights the size dependency of the threshold irradiance which decreases and light sensitivity and risk averseness increases over a copepod s lifespan fig 3b accordingly at any given time the model copepods tend to remain at a depth which provides the maximum growth potential eq 1 below the estimated irradiance threshold bandara et al 2019 given the diel periodicity of modelled irradiance fig 2a b the above photoreactive behavior leads to a classic dvm pattern i e the occupation of shallower waters during nighttime and retreat to deeper waters during daytime for each copepod at any given time we predicted the depth with maximum growth potential below the threshold irradiance deterministically and assumed that the neutrally buoyant copepods reach this depth via cruising van someren gréve et al 2017 where individuals swim at a constant velocity fig 3c as 12 u i t 5 2287 w c i t 0 4862 2 2 2 2 3 energy storage the entire surplus assimilation eq 1 of younger developmental stages niii ciii is allocated to somatic growth indicated by the structural mass wc µg c late juvenile civ and cv stages can allocate an individual specific fraction of the surplus assimilation to build up an energy reserve indicated by the energy reserve mass ws µg c which may occupy up to the entirety of the individual s structural mass here gene γ 0 1 defines the pattern of energy allocation where the entire surplus assimilation is allocated to structural growth if γ 0 and energy reserves if γ 1 the adult stages of this model do not build up energy reserves but inherit energy reserves accumulated in their pre adulthood 2 2 2 2 4 diapause and seasonal vertical migration svm each model copepod possesses an equal probability to either i perform a seasonal descent into deeper waters undergo diapause ascend back to near surface waters svm and then develop into adults or ii directly develop into adulthood without diapause and svm as in our predecessor models we used the state of the energy reserve as a proxy of timing of diapause entry and exit a reasonable assumption for the primarily income breeding c finmarchicus varpe and ejsmond 2018 here copepods descend to deeper waters when their stores reach an individual specific fraction of the structural mass either at civ or cv stage which is determined by the gene δ 0 1 the selection of diapause habitat is simple and similar to that of carlotti and wolf 1998 and bandara et al 2019 where individuals are randomly placed at depth below the mixed layer 300 500 m during diapause the vertical position of each copepod passively varies by a random amount at each time step 25 m the model copepods utilize stored reserves to meet the energy requirements during diapause which occurs at a lower rate compared to the basal metabolic rate diapause terminates when an individual specific fraction of the stored reserves is exhausted which is determined by the gene ε 0 1 as c finmarchicus is not known to possess 1 year life cycles reviewed in bandara 2014 falk petersen et al 2009 we did not model a diapause strategy among adult stages and thus the maximum generation time simulated in this model is 1 year the copepods that develop directly into adulthood may produce one or more generations within a calendar year 2 2 2 2 5 metabolism the metabolic rate is the sum of the basal metabolic rate bb µg c ind 1 h 1 and the active metabolic rate ba µg c ind 1 h 1 these hourly estimates are adjusted to the temporal resolution of the model 6 h during calculations at the reference temperature 2 c the relationship of bb with the body mass is given as 13 b b i t f w c s i t o here f and o are mass coefficient and exponent of respiration table 1 the relationship between the basal metabolic rate and the ambient temperature is given as 14 b b i t z b b i t g exp p t t z here b b is the temperature dependent basal metabolic rate and g and p are temperature coefficient and exponent of metabolism respectively table 1 the active metabolism ba which is assumed to account for 1 5 bb is added when the individuals are swimming via cruising bandara et al 2019 during diapause the ba is 0 and bb occurs at 75 reduced rate maps et al 2013 at each time interval the metabolic costs are deducted from the gross assimilation eq 1 when metabolic demand is larger than assimilated energy energy reserves are mobilized 2 2 2 2 6 starvation risk starvation sets in when the metabolic demands exceed energy reserves when a model copepod starves the structural mass is catabolized to meet the metabolic demands this loss of structural mass increases the starvation risk ms i e the probability of death by starvation as 15 m s i t 1 1 exp 0 25 w c x i t 0 05 here wcx is the catabolized structural mass expressed as a proportion to the maximum structural mass attained prior to structural catabolization the above function approaches an upper asymptote 1 00 fig 3d as wcx reaches 0 50 the chossat s rule chossat 1843 2 2 2 2 7 population ceiling the maximum population size pmax allowed in this model is 106 which is solely dependent upon the available computational resources for model simulation not on natural resource food limitation due to the lack of two way coupling between the feeding and phytoplankton dynamics in this model to avoid abruptly cutting off the population at pmax when the population size at a given time pt approaches pmax a computational resource dependent artificial mortality ma set in as 16 m a t 0 1 1 exp 0 95 p m a x p t 0 0125 p m a x therefore ma is negligible at smaller population sizes and begins to increase exponentially as pt approaches pmax fig 3e ma operates irrespective of copepod s internal states such as the body mass energy reserve mass and the developmental stage 2 2 2 3 reproduction cv stages possess an equal probability of molting into either an adult male or a female sex ratio 1 we assumed that adult stages reproduce immediately following the final molt the possibility of sex switching at the adult stage sexual dimorphism svensen and tande 1999 is disregarded for simplicity the adult males in this model do not feed mauchline 1998 but use energy reserves to meet their metabolic demands and thus are generally short lived females mate only once in their lifetime hirche 1996b marshall and orr 1972 titelman et al 2007 with a random male however modelled males can mate with more than one female nicholls 1933 when mating a copy of the male genome is transferred to the female we assumed that adult females follow a pure income breeding strategy cf varpe et al 2009 where the egg production is entirely dependent on the food intake hirche 1996b the egg production ei t is estimated as 17 e i t w r i t w e here wr is the matter allocated to the egg production and we is the unit egg mass table 1 during egg production the male and female genes recombine at a probability of 0 70 per gene following a heuristic crossover method haupt and haupt 2004 michalewicz 1996 recombined genetic information undergoes mutation at a probability of 0 20 per gene using random replacement eiben and smith 2003 females can produce a maximum of 1000 eggs carlotti and hirche 1997 and are killed afterwards hence assuming strict semelparity varpe and ejsmond 2018 to allow space in the simulated population as the maximum allowed population size pmax in this model is limited to 106 the total egg production of the population at a given time may exceed pmax this excess egg production is systematically cut off using a fecundity proportional selection method as 18 e i t 0 i f p t p m a x e i t i f i 1 p t e i t p m a x p t e i t i 1 p t e i t p m a x p t i f i 1 p t e i t p m a x p t here ei t is the estimated egg production of a given mated female at a given time and pt is the estimated population size at that time 2 3 model operation the model initializes at time t at 0000 h of 1 january of year 1 with the generation of a model environment for the entire calendar year up to 1800 h on 31 december in stochastic simulations see below the model environment may vary between time intervals and or between calendar years the simulation begins with the seeding of 100 eggs with random gene combinations to random depths 100 m of the water column at each time interval throughout the first calendar year of the simulation i e a total of 146 000 eggs at each time interval the somatic growth developmental progression reserve build up in late juvenile stages and the vertical position of each copepod is simulated and are updated into five state variables thereafter each copepod is assessed for survival as 19 s i t 0 i f 1 m v i t m n i t m s i t m a t ω i t 1 i f 1 m v i t m n i t m s i t m a t ω i t here s is a binary state variable survivorship which takes the default value 1 alive and is set to 0 dead if the estimated survival probability is smaller than the individual and time specific random number ωit drawn from a uniform probability distribution when a copepod is presumed dead i e si t 0 all the corresponding state variable values are erased to allow space for a new individual in the simulated population at each time interval when the survival assessment of all copepods is complete the population size pt is estimated and updated into a state variable population size as 20 p t i 1 p m a x s t the model employs two types of tracking bookkeeping variables high resolution trackers are updated at each time interval and record the total and stage specific population sizes the number of diapause entries number of diapause exits and the number of direct developments i e individuals that develop directly into adulthood without diapause along with their structural and energy reserve masses into a set of unidimensional arrays further the vertical distribution of the population along with the distribution of temperature food concentration and irradiance throughout the water column are recorded into a set of two dimensional arrays at each time interval in stochastic environments high resolution trackers are written to the disk at the end of each calendar year of the simulation in the deterministic environment high resolution trackers are only recorded and written to the disk at the final calendar year of the simulation low resolution trackers keep an annual mean of the genome information of the population and are written to disk at the end of the final calendar year of the simulation the model simulations continue over multiple years and terminate as t approaches a termination time which is typically 1800 h of 31 december of the year 100 2 4 simulation experiments model simulations were performed under four main scenarios i a basic model simulation was performed in a deterministic environment fig 2a c ii model simulations were performed in an environment with shorter term 6 h stochasticity fig 2d f in this environment the mean ambient temperature food concentration predation risk k mn 10 5 and the timing and duration of pelagic primary production remained constant between years iii model simulations were performed in an environment with both shorter and longer term stochasticity in ambient irradiance temperature and food availability fig 2g iv the model was run in the same environment in the above scenario iii but with the addition of uniformly random interannual variations to visual k range 10 7 0 25 fig 2h and non visual predation risks mn range 10 7 10 3 fig 2i 2 5 model development analysis and archiving the model was developed in fortran 95 iso iec 1539 1 1997 with the support of openmp application program interface modules for parallelization the model simulations were performed in a custom built gaming rig with a liquid cooled intel core i9 7920x processor with 24 nodes workers running at an overclocked turbo frequency of ca 4 4 ghz the model outputs were analyzed using r version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 and rkward version 0 7 0 rödiger et al 2012 in ubuntu version 18 04 the data presented in both the deterministic and shorter term stochastic simulation experiments are outputs from the final calendar year of simulations in contrast in the simulation experiments with shorter and longer term environmental stochasticity we used the mean values of environmental variables and emerging behavioral and life history attributes from each calendar year in data presentation to interpret the environmental correlates of emerging strategies in stochastic environments the above values were standardized i e centered by mean and divided by standard deviation and used in a principal component analysis pca which was run in a correlation matrix raw data of these simulations along with the source code of the model can be downloaded at https git io jclnw 3 results 3 1 emergent strategies and population dynamics 3 1 1 deterministic model environment the abundance of the simulated c finmarchicus population peaked in spring april may and then in autumn july september fig 4 a the first peak was dominated by eggs and younger developmental stages fig 4b the proportion of late juvenile stages copepodite stages iv and v began to increase towards mid may by late june a fraction of civs and cvs descended to deeper waters and entered diapause fig 4c h the size of the energy reserve of these diapause entries was relatively low mean 11 µg c fig 4d which was metabolized over a relatively short duration ca 1 3 months these individuals therefore ascended to the surface waters again relatively quickly after what seems to be a short summertime diapause consequently the number of diapause exits with nearly spent energy reserves increased from july to august 1000 1600 exits d 1 fig 4e f the proportion of adult males and females gradually increased from july onwards fig 4b approximately 34 of these adult stages emerged following the final molt of summertime diapause exits the rest of the adults matured from late juvenile stages and completed their final molt without undergoing diapause fig 4g a late summer egg production peak although less prominent compared to that in the spring coincided with the emergence of adults in july and contributed to a second generation fig 4b the proportion of second generation civ and cv stages began to increase towards autumn and ca 60 of them migrated to deeper waters for diapause with considerably higher energy reserves compared to the summertime diapause entries mean ws 80 µg c fig 4b d h some second generation civs and cvs did not undergo diapause and developed directly to adults and produced a third generation in late august and early september fig 4b while the third generation copepods developed under diminishing food conditions some of their late juvenile stages predominantly civs descended to deeper waters with relatively low energy reserves and entered diapause by mid september mean ws 21 µg c figs 2c and 4c d h individuals that did not reach an overwintering stage or those that failed to build sufficient energy reserves starved to death in the upper pelagial as the modelled food supply faded into the winter diapause exit continued during the autumn to winter transition october december in smaller numbers 200 exits d 1 mostly civ stages the energy reserves of these diapaus exits were spent and consequently they died in the upper pelagial due to starvation fig 4e h in contrast the diapause exits that emerged between late winter and early spring february may ca 400 exits d 1 were predominantly large cvs with higher energy reserves fig 4f these had post diapause energy reserves that prevented starvation and aided the elevation of their structural mass to attain sexual maturity and mate so that spawning commenced as soon as food levels increased in early march 3 1 2 stochastic model environments 3 1 2 1 shorter term stochasticity under shorter term environmental stochasticity fig 2d f the fraction of late juvenile civ and cv stages that entered diapause increased slightly 2 relative to the simulation in the deterministic environmental setting fig 4k o and diapause index in fig 5 although the timing of diapause entry and exit were not markedly different the structural mass and energy reserve levels of diapause entries and diapause exits differed significantly from the deterministic simulation figs 4k n and 5 particularly the 2nd and 3rd quarters of diapause entries which endured the longest diapause duration were on average 20 40 smaller in structural mass and carried ca 40 less lipid reserves figs 4l and 5 as a result when they emerged from diapause between january and late june i e 1st quarter of diapause exits they had on average 9 µg c of reserves remaining which was 50 compared to those in the deterministic environment fig 5 in contrast the mean structural and energy reserve masses of the 1st quarter of diapause entries that endured the shortest diapause duration were ca 20 higher than in the deterministic setting many of them emerged in the late summer and early autumn 2nd quarter of diapause exits with higher energy reserves fig 5 these energy reserves allowed for reduced starvation especially since feeding opportunities gradually deteriorated towards autumn fig 2f and these larger individuals had to frequently evacuate the productive near surface waters as they performed diel vertical migrations to reduce predation risk fig 4p the mean size at sexual maturity of the simulated c finmarchicus population decreased by ca 12 and the timing of egg production occurred ca 12 d later in the stochastic model environment fig 5 3 1 2 2 longer term stochasticity in all model environments where longer term interannual stochasticity was added to the shorter term stochasticity food concentration and the duration of the productive season were positively correlated to ambient temperature altogether the growth potential eigenvectors i iii fig 6 cf fig 2g i consequently in warmer years the timing of the pelagic bloom occurred earlier compared to colder years eigenvector iv fig 6 when both visual and non visual predation risks were modest and constant between years the mean timing of diapause entry and the structural and energy reserve masses of diapause entries were negatively correlated with the growth potential eigenvectors ix x and xi in fig 6a this shows that in warmer years with higher growth potential the simulated c finmarchicus population entered diapause earlier in the year at smaller body size and with less reserves fig 7 c d k l similarly size at sexual maturity correlated negatively with the growth potential eigenvector xv fig 6a the mean timing of diapause exit correlated with structural and energy reserve masses of diapause exits but not with the growth potential eigenvectors xii xiii xiv fig 6a this is because the early diapause exits which ascended to near surface waters during the spring summer transition were large developmental stages mainly cvs with high energy reserves while those emerged during the autumn winter transition were smaller civs and cvs with nearly depleted reserves fig 7e f m n the diapause index correlated negatively with the growth potential eigenvector viii fig 6a and suggests that a higher proportion of late juvenile stages remained in diapause until feeding opportunities emerged in the following productive season in colder years with lower growth potential fig 7e m in warmer years with higher growth potential most late juvenile stages directly developed to adulthood and produced additional generation s fig 7g o although the timing of egg production eigenvector xvi correlated positively with the timing of diapause exit fig 6a the lack of a strong positive correlation e g alike that between temperature and food concentration suggests that non diapausing late juvenile stages that directly develop into adults contributed to a substantial fraction of the total egg production irrespective of the modelled interannual variations of growth potential interannual stochastic variability in both visual or non visual predation risks eigenvectors vi and vii fig 6 had little effect on the mean timing or structural and energy reserve masses at diapaus entry fig 6b c and panels c d e k of figs 8 9 however visual predation risk correlated positively with the mean timing of diapause exit fig 6b indicating that diapause of the simulated c finmarchicus population terminated later in years with higher visual predation risk and vice versa fig 8e m this predicted shift in the timing of diapause exit primarily accounts for the fraction of c finmarchicus population that exits diapause during late summer and autumn because the mean timing of diapause exit always fell between late summer and early autumn when the largest number of copepods exited diapause in all model simulations fig 8e m non visual predation risk correlated negatively with the timing of diapause exit fig 6c therefore in years with higher non visual predation risk diapause exit of the simulated c finmarchicus population occurred relatively earlier than in years with lower risk january april fig 9e m 4 discussion two main diapause strategies emerged in the simulated c finmarchicus population irrespective of the level of environmental variability i a mid to late spring diapause entry as civs or smaller cvs with limited energy reserves and a late summer to autumn diapause exit which resembles an oversummering strategy wang et al 2003 and ii a summer autumn diapause entry predominantly as cvs with larger reserve loads and a diapause exit during the winter spring transition which resembles a classic overwintering strategy sømme 1934 as a result of both strategies being present in the population diapause entry occurred throughout the productive season and diapause exit occurred asynchronously throughout the year in varying numbers additionally and as a third strategy a part of the population did not undergo diapause at all and instead developed directly to adults in the attempt to reproduce within the same productive season the proportions of the diapausing and non diapausing populations varied between years despite the equal probabilities forced at the diapausing and non diapausing decision this occurred due to the differential survival rates associated with the diapausing and non diapausing strategies given the interannual stochastic variations of the model environment 4 1 the curious case of oversummering in high latitude herbivorous copepods overwintering is a state of dormancy that increases survival during unproductive winter periods where food is scarce sømme 1934 overwintering has been studied extensively since the pioneering work of gran 1902 oversummering is comparatively less well studied oversummering c sinicus in the yellow sea is probably the most well known among marine copepods pu et al 2004 wang et al 2005 where cvs occupying the yellow sea cold water mass enters diapause as the upper pelagial warms up and feeding opportunities deteriorate towards summer li et al 2004 recent studies point to an oversummering strategy among some c finmarchicus populations in the western north atlantic for example an individual based modeling study of c finmarchicus in the gulf of maine by maps et al 2012b predicted that a part of the simulated population that enters diapause in mid summer returns to the upper pelagial in autumn while using a late pelagic algal bloom for feeding and reproduction their model predicted oversummering timing and durations align well with the field data durbin et al 1997 saumweber and durbin 2006 however the environmental dynamics e g ambient temperature and the timing and duration of the productive season of these northwest atlantic study locations considerably differ from those of the present model and direct comparisons to field data should be made with caution in the northeast atlantic russell 1926 noted a mid summer seasonal descent of c finmarchicus populations of the english channel and described it as a strategy to avoid harmful levels of summertime irradiance further kaartvedt 2000 highlighted that c finmarchicus populations in the norwegian sea may enter diapause in summer primarily due to the elevated predation risk imposed by seasonally migrating planktivorous fish however as none of these studies continued towards autumn we do not know if these summer diapause entries had ascended back to the upper pelagial later in the same productive season from the classic of østvedt 1955 to more recent studies such as strand et al 2020 we see civ and cv stages remaining in the near surface layers of the norwegian sea towards autumn however it is unclear whether these late developmental stages are a part of a non diapausing multigenerational development or remnants of a brief summer diapause a main problem of entering diapause earlier in the year late spring and early summer is that these diapause entries require substantial energy reserves to remain dormant until the following productive season for example a copepod that enters diapause in late may or early june at the deterministic model environment has to remain dormant for ca 10 months before the pelagic primary production commences in the following year fig 2c this is unlikely for most copepods given the modelled diapause metabolic rate at 0 c fig 2b eq 14 and their lower energy reserve sizes fig 4d instead energy reserve exhaustion drove large numbers of these early diapause entries to the upper pelagial between late summer and autumn fig 4e f m n where they successfully produced another generation since food was still available at the time figs 2c f and 4b j in the model this evolved into an adaptive strategy in both deterministic and stochastic settings since the summertime escape from the upper pelagial reduced the mortality risk imposed by visual predation and there was sufficient food for the growth and development of their offspring until autumn this somewhat resembles the summer diapause of freshwater zooplankton in response to vertebrate pijanowska and stolpe 1996 and invertebrate strickler and twombly 1975 predation where resting eggs are produced prior to the elevation of seasonal predation risk a well studied conservative bet hedging strategy garcía roger et al 2017 despite this interesting model prediction that highlights underlying trade offs in the annual routine of these copepods we are uncertain about how likely it is that such briefer summer descents are to be expected for northeast atlantic c finmarchicus this is because contrast to our model summer autumn food conditions in nature are far from guaranteed due to grazing pressure and nutrient limitation and consequently most early diapause entries that exit diapause in late summer and autumn with exhausted energy reserves usually starve to death without contributing to another generation pepin and head 2009 4 2 timing of diapause in response to environmental stochasticity 4 2 1 shorter term environmental stochasticity the shorter term stochastic oscillations of ambient temperature and food concentration collectively induced growth potential variations between the simulated 6 h timesteps fig 2e f and eqs 1 6 however diapause timing of the simulated c finmarchicus population was robust to these shorter term growth potential variations fig 5 this robustness was manifested through the plasticity of behavioral and morphological morphometric attributes first copepods abandoned their routine dvm behavior that emerged in the deterministic environment fig 4h and spent more time in near surface waters especially during time intervals with higher simulated cloud cover to elevate foraging effort fig 4p nonetheless this did not fully compensate for the growth potential variability which is indicated by the lower mean structural and energy reserve masses of late juvenile civ and cv stages compared to the deterministic setting figs 4d l and 5 since it takes lesser time to attain a lower body mass at a prescribed growth potential in this model eqs 1 8 the lower structural and energy reserve masses of late juvenile stages compensated for potential delays of diapause entry caused by environmental variability however this body size plasticity came at a significant cost in the form of reduced survival and reproductive output at their springtime ascent these smaller post diapause stages had little energy reserves figs 4f n and 5 this reduced the survivorship among the earliest diapause exits that ascended to near surface waters preceding the onset of the pelagic primary production further as the attainment of sexual maturity generally requires a significant elevation of the structural mass from late juvenile copepodite stages eq 8 the relatively smaller diapause exits took a longer time to develop towards sexual maturity and caused the 12 d delay in the mean timing of egg production fig 5 however a further delay in egg production did not occur as the c finmarchicus reached sexual maturity at ca 12 lesser size fig 5 this caused ca 20 drop in egg production since the fecundity of the modelled copepods is proportional to their body size eq 17 4 2 2 longer term environmental stochasticity 4 2 2 1 diapause entry the mean timing of diapause entry was highly plastic to the modelled interannual variations of growth potential and occurred earlier in warmer years with earlier onset and longer duration of pelagic primary production and vice versa figs 6a cf fig 7 in a ca two decade timeseries study espinasse et al 2018 reported a similar phenological shift in the seasonal appearance of cvs among two distinct c finmarchicus populations inhabiting northern icelandic and western spitsbergen shelves further a five year study on a co occurring copepod c glacialis reported ca 3 week delay in the appearance of lipid accumulated late juvenile stages during abnormally colder years when the pelagic primary production occurred relatively late in the white sea pertsova and kosobokova 2010 growth potential implications on the diapause entry of c finmarchicus are also found along spatial gradients for example melle et al 2014 reported a notable 30 60 d delay in c finmarchicus diapause entry in the northwest atlantic compared to northeast atlantic the earlier onset of primary production in the warmer upper pelagial of the northeast atlantic generally warrant faster growth rates and a large fraction of c finmarchicus population enters diapause between late may and july in contrast the pelagic primary production of the northwest atlantic occurs relatively late and slower growth rates sustained in the colder upper pelagial generally delays their diapause entry similarly in colder seasonally ice covered high arctic fjords where the period of net positive pelagic primary production commences in mid june and is limited in duration to 2 3 months the timing of c finmarchicus diapause entry can shift to august september arnkværn et al 2005 bandara et al 2016 it has been hypothesized that elevated predation risk imposed by planktivorous fish drive parts of the c finmarchicus populations in the norwegian sea to diapause depths by mid summer thus negating the possibility to produce an additional generation or two in the autumn kaartvedt 2000 varpe and fiksen 2010 in contrast our predecessor model bandara et al 2019 which assumed an annual life cycle for c finmarchicus at 70 n highlighted the possibility of elevated visual predation risk to cause a relative delay in the timing of diapause entry due to the reduced growth rates induced by diel vertical migration consequently the modelled copepods required more time to develop into civs or cvs with sufficient energy reserves for overwintering however in the present model the visual predation risk did not significantly influence i the predicted mean timing of diapause entry ii the mean structural and energy reserve masses of diapause entries iii generation time or iv the extent of summer diapause fig 6b cf fig 8 in this model visual predation risk varied interannually following a uniformly random probability distribution fig 2h in the studies of varpe and fiksen 2010 and bandara et al 2019 a higher predation risk was sustained or assumed across multiple generations for example bandara et al 2019 maintained elevated visual predation potential for ca 400 generations thus maintaining a constant top down selection pressure over an adequate time period for life histories of the simulated copepods to evolve since the top down selection pressure of the stochastic versions of the present model varied randomly between years it is unlikely that life history responses such as smaller body masses and reduced energy stores are evolved in higher predation risk environments this adaptive evolution adaptive tracking of body size contrasts the body size plasticity predicted under uniformly random interannual fluctuations of bottom up selection pressures i e temperature and food availability fig 7 where the response of copepods body size and hence the reserve size is near instantaneous due to the strict food and temperature dependence of the growth and developmental formulations eqs 1 8 4 2 2 2 diapause exit the proximate drivers of the diapause exit and seasonal ascent of high latitude copepods are not well understood and an array of internal and external cues are hypothesized reviewed in bandara et al 2021 baumgartner and tarrant 2017 miller et al 1991 according to recent studies lipid modulated endogenous timers play a crucial role in diapause exit of c finmarchicus häfker et al 2018 skottene et al 2019 similarly the modelled proximate driver of diapause exit in this study is the exhaustion of energy reserves represented by the gene ε this in association with the lipid based diapause entry attribute i e gene δ table 1 created more or less a continuum of diapause exit strategies that spanned asynchronously throughout the year in both deterministic and stochastic model environments e g fig 4e m observations on asynchronous diapause exit and seasonal ascent of calanus spp have been noted in several high latitude year round zooplankton investigations particularly fjord environments e g bandara et al 2016 darnis and fortier 2014 dezutter et al 2019 wallace et al 2010 further wintertime upper pelagial occupation of calanus spp is documented across numerous high latitude locations such as western and northern norwegian fjords balinö and aksnes 1993 falkenhaug et al 1997 open waters of the norwegian and barents seas bathmann et al 1990 heath and jónasdóttir 1999 pedersen et al 1995 greenland sea hirche 1991 and in fjords on the svalbard archipelago berge et al 2009 darnis et al 2017 it is unclear why calanus spp ascend to the upper pelagial several months prior to the commencement of pelagic primary production some studies are insightful of the ability of winter active predators to drive diapausing populations out of the deeper pelagial błachowiak samołyk et al 2015 sims et al 2003 results of the simulations performed under variable non visual predation risk also points towards the same direction where the diapausing c finmarchicus population tended to ascend earlier at higher levels of non visual predation risk fig 6c cf fig 9 however a major contrast between the simulated calanus population and those in the field is that when driven to the upper pelagial the latter may survive the unproductive winter given their omnivorous feeding strategy cleary et al 2017 ohman et al 1998 søreide et al 2008 in this model most individuals that exited diapause and ascended to the upper pelagial during the unproductive season october february died from starvation as they were modelled as strict herbivores figs 4 7 9 it may be questioned how such a wasteful strategy that causes mass wintertime mortality becomes prominent in a model of artificial evolution when the mutation probability of gene ε was reduced to 0 02 1 10th of the normal value in a trial simulation performed in a deterministic model environment the year round diapause exit largely diminished and was limited to the spring and mid summer data not presented however when the same modification was attempted in a trial simulation performed in an environment with shorter and longer term stochasticity the model collapsed within a few years due to the inability of copepods to maintain a viable population over the simulated timeseries this suggests that the year round diapause exit was crucial to the year to year survival of the simulated c finmarchicus population especially since the copepods in diapause cannot predict the time at which the pelagic primary production starts in the following year the asynchronous year round diapause exit predicted in this model represents a diversified bet hedging strategy where parents parental genotypes through random mating recombination and mutation produce a series of offspring with diverse diapause exit strategies phenotypes across which the mortality starvation risk of ascending to the upper pelagial at the wrong food deprived time of the year is spread philippi and seger 1989 slatkin 1974 similar diversified bet hedging strategies are common among many freshwater zooplankton e g rotifers and cladocerans that undergo diapause as resting eggs here parents produce resting eggs through sexual reproduction which sinks to the sediment and remain viable for many years and act as germ banks from which the offspring emerge asynchronously in time brendonck and de meester 2003 the population level consequences of such bet hedging strategies are paramount particularly because synchronous hatching of resting eggs can be detrimental to the population when there are pronounced stochastic variations in the environment and if there are no widespread proximate cues to predict those variations hairston jr 1996 therefore the asynchronous diapause exit of marine zooplankton predicted by our model and the asynchronous hatching of resting eggs from egg banks seems to be analogous strategies selected for by environmental variability as more detailed in situ data are about to become increasingly available via autonomous vehicles gliders and floats equipped with imaging devices e g lombard et al 2019 this predicted outcome could soon be tested in various ecosystems around the world 5 conclusions most marine zooplankton live in a near continuous flow and faces uncertainty in foraging and predator encounter probabilities in the shorter term seuront et al 2004 visser et al 2008 along with longer term interannual variations of temperature food and predation environments they occupy a world of highly variable bottom up and top down selection pressures across time and space lurling and de senerpont domis 2013 understanding adaptations of zooplankton to environmental heterogeneity is not an easy task however mechanistic simulation models provide a cost effective supplement to field studies and laboratory experiments in this regard the present model extends the capabilities of our predecessor models and sheds new light on the timing and body size dynamics of the high latitude copepod c finmarchicus against stochastic environmental variations that occur atop predictable cyclic diel and seasonal patterns see also fiksen 2000 although spatial environmental heterogeneity is not explicitly formulated in this model its computationally efficient simulation framework opens future opportunities to couple this unidimensional individual based biological model

24541,in environments with strong seasonality many herbivorous zooplankton remain active only during the productive season and undergo a period of inactivity and suppressed development termed diapause during the unproductive season the ability to time the diapause entry and exit in response to the seasonality of the environment is thus essential for their survival however timing of diapause may become challenging when environmental conditions vary stochastically across shorter and longer timescales and particularly when zooplankton lack external cues to predict these variations in this study we used a novel individual based model to study the emerging patterns of diapause timing of the high latitude marine herbivorous copepod calanus finmarchicus under shorter 6 h and longer term interannual environmental stochasticity the model simulated growth development survival and reproduction income breeding of a c finmarchicus population over multiple calendar years and traced the emergence of behavioral responses and life history strategies the emergent timing of diapause entry and exit were robust to shorter term environmental stochasticity which was manifested through morphological i e body and energy reserve sizes and behavioral plasticity i e diel vertical migration longer term stochastic variations of temperature and food environments altered the timing of diapause entry which occurred earlier in warmer years with higher growth potential and vice versa irrespective of the modelled environmental variability diapause exit occurred asynchronously throughout the year this appeared to be a consequence of a diversified bet hedging strategy where parents spread the starvation mortality risk of ascending to the upper pelagial at food deprived times of the year among their offspring this was a potent strategy particularly in simulations where the timing of the algal bloom varied stochastically between years since a fraction of the population was present in the upper pelagial year round and those that coincided with the emergence of the pelagic primary production survived and produced the next generation keywords environmental heterogeneity bet hedging phenotypic plasticity overwintering oversummering copepods 1 introduction characterizing variability in natural environments and understanding the adaptations of organisms to these changes are fundamental aspects of behavioral and evolutionary ecology environmental changes occur both across time temporal environmental heterogeneity and space spatial environmental heterogeneity pigliucci 2001 a part of this heterogeneity follows well established cyclic patterns such as the diel and seasonal variability of solar irradiance or trends such as the gradual change of climate across latitude and altitude organisms generally respond to environmental heterogeneity in three main ways i when environmental changes are long lasting and the selection pressures are persistent standing genetic variation together with recombination and mutation will produce locally adapted genotypes through adaptive evolution adaptive tracking byers 2005 ii when selection pressures fluctuate across shorter spatio temporal scales a strategy termed phenotypic plasticity becomes potent this involves the production of different phenotypes by a single genotype that characterize various physiological morphological behavioral and life history responses ghalambor et al 2007 iii in environments with highly unpredictable variability a strategy termed bet hedging reduces fitness fluctuations of genotypes between generations slatkin 1974 this may occur through the production of phenotypes that perform reasonably well under good and bad environmental scenarios conservative bet hedging or by spreading the risk of certain behavioral and life history decisions among an array of different phenotypes diversified bet hedging simons 2011 zooplankton in high latitude marine environments are particularly exposed to spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity in terms of time the daylength photoperiod may transit from near continuous darkness polar night 0l 24d to near continuous daylight midnight sun 24l 0d within a year this seasonality results in a productive season with well demarcated windows of high primary production e g spring summer and an unproductive season e g autumn winter although these irradiance driven environmental variations are largely predictable notable stochastic oscillations occur atop these diel and seasonal patterns for example shorter term variations of cloud cover can attenuate subsurface irradiance and momentarily influence the efficiency of visually orientating pelagic predators eiane et al 1997 ryer and olla 1999 in addition the upper pelagic ambient temperature and primary production may also vary in the shorter term depending on the fluctuations of irradiance extent of convective vertical mixing horizontal advection and grazing pressure brainerd and gregg 1995 cushing 1990 wang et al 2005 wood and corcoran 1966 in the longer term timing and the duration of the productive season may vary between years depending on the fluctuations of ambient temperature water column stratification ice retreat timing and nutrient supply uitz et al 2010 wassmann et al 2006 in terms of space zooplankton encounter environmental gradients e g temperature salinity density dissolved oxygen food availability predation risk during their routine vertical excursions through the water column zooplankton also continuously drift with water currents which can either be of shorter spatial extent e g cross shelf exchange processes torgersen and huse 2005 or of broader trans latitude extent e g ji et al 2012 although vertical and latitudinal environmental gradients follow generic trends and are predictable to some extent frequent changes in vertical mixing and mesoscale phenomena such as eddies hydrographical fronts and varying bottom depths can induce stochastic environmental variations in space mann and lazier 2006 mcgillicuddy 2016 adaptations of high latitude zooplankton to predictable cyclic environmental variations are relatively well understood these adaptations are most pronounced among the herbivore community hagen and auel 2001 varpe 2012 the food phytoplankton availability for herbivorous zooplankton is seasonally limited and restricted to the upper pelagial photic zone the earliest available food emerges in the spring when the upper pelagial is typically colder and perhaps under ice cover this may reduce grazing assimilation and growth rates of herbivorous zooplankton huntley and lopez 1992 romare et al 2005 although the primary production generally extends towards summer the near constant summertime illumination elevates the light dependent visual predation risk in the upper pelagial zooplankton tend to minimize visual predation risk by descending to deeper darker layers to take refuge during daytime while ascending to the near surface layers to feed during the night a behavior known as diel vertical migration dvm reviewed in bandara et al 2021 brierley 2014 although dvm is effective against visual predation risk it typically shrinks the daily foraging window which leads to slower growth and development rates bandara et al 2018 loose and dawidowicz 1994 because of higher predation risk or fading food concentrations towards autumn most herbivorous zooplankton descend to deeper waters and enter a state of hibernation termed diapause for 6 8 months of the year reviewed in bandara et al 2021 baumgartner and tarrant 2017 investigations of the adaptations of high latitude zooplankton to stochastic environmental variability are mostly conducted in the shorter term and focus on the plasticity of zooplankton behavior to stochastic environmental oscillations for example eiane and parisi 2001 and record and young 2006 used empirical data and simulation models to study the changes of zooplankton dvm in response to variations in cloud cover their findings suggest that zooplankton can instantaneously modify their dvm behavior to increase grazing time in near surface layers even at midday when the skies are relatively cloudy and dark a classic example of the plasticity of dvm behavior see bandara et al 2021 for a review similar cases of dvm plasticity have been observed and predicted in response to sudden and often unpredictable subsurface irradiance attenuation episodes caused by solar and lunar eclipses e g strömberg et al 2002 tarling et al 1999 smoke from wildfire e g urmy et al 2016 suspended matter and algal blooms e g fiksen and carlotti 1998 williamson et al 2020 investigations of the influence of longer term environmental stochasticity on diapause timing of high latitude zooplankton are rare and the present knowledgebase is largely theory driven for example ji 2011 viewed the model predicted variations of diapause entry timing of the high latitude copepod calanus finmarchicus in the light of phenotypic plasticity which allows the animals to cope with spatial and temporal interannual environmental stochasticity expected in the western north atlantic further a model for c finmarchicus by fiksen 2000 demonstrated prioritized reserve accumulation and early diapause entry in stochastic settings see also kvile et al 2018 varpe and ejsmond 2018 since diapause entry usually negates the attainment of sexual maturity and production of an additional generation or two within the same productive season see also kaartvedt 2000 varpe and fiksen 2010 such strategies are viewed as acts of conservative bet hedging which can be essential for survival when the growth potential i e food availability and temperature varies stochastically between years empirical evidence in this regard exists in freshwater literature where diapausing stages i e resting eggs of rotifers are produced earlier when the length of the growing season varies stochastically over time e g franch gras et al 2019 tarazona et al 2017 in contrast the role of bet hedging in diapause exit is poorly understood except in the case of the hatching of resting eggs from egg banks evans and dennehy 2005 in addition there is no broad agreement about the mechanism s by which high latitude herbivorous zooplankton time their diapause exit in relation to the interannually variable timing of pelagic primary production the timing of diapause exit becomes even more enigmatic when diapausing populations are advected into different environments by moving water masses espinasse et al 2016 rullyanto et al 2015 this is because timing and the duration of primary production vary significantly across space daase et al 2013 falk petersen et al 2009 and diapausing populations seem to lack perceivable cues to predict the timing of pelagic primary production particularly when they occupy habitats several thousand meters below the productive near surface waters østvedt 1955 our research focuses on investigating the adaptations of a predominantly herbivorous high latitude copepod calanus finmarchicus to environmental stochasticity c finmarchicus is a species that encounters pronounced environmental variability in their natural habitats since its geographical range spans across ca 40 of latitudes across the north atlantic towards the high arctic conover 1988 fleminger and hulsemann 1977 melle et al 2014 in this study we present an individual based model that can simulate the life cycle of c finmarchicus in great spatial temporal and biological resolution and use it to investigate its adaptations to environmental stochasticity in particular we invoke the potential ecological roles of adaptive tracking phenotypic plasticity and bet hedging as strategies that aids c finmarchicus to time its diapause in environments where the irradiance temperature food availability and predation risk vary stochastically on diurnal seasonal and interannual basis 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview the present model is an extension of our previous work bandara et al 2018 and 2019 which were aimed towards investigating the adaptations of high latitude herbivorous copepods calanus spp to predictable cyclic diel and seasonal environmental heterogeneity deterministic settings in this study we added a level of stochastic environmental variations atop these predictable cyclic patterns further we upgraded the genetic algorithm based strategy oriented construct of the predecessor models to a more versatile individual based construct and made notable changes and upgrades to the growth and development survival and reproductive submodels see appendix a1 in supplementary material for a detailed comparison of the present model and its predecessors the model comprises two entities model copepods and the model environment model copepods are simplified representations of calanus finmarchicus in terms of morphology morphometry behavior and life history see section 2 2 1 1 for details the behavioral and life history strategies of model copepods are determined by five evolvable attributes genes that collectively form their genome the genome of each copepod contains information on energy allocation patterns body size and the timing of dvm diapause and seasonal vertical migration svm fig 1 a b table 1 the model environment is a 500 m deep unidimensional seasonal setting resolved to 1 m bins see section 2 2 1 2 for details this model follows an open ended life cycle simulation approach accordingly starting from an artificially seeded batch of eggs the growth and development survival and reproduction of model copepods are simulated in model environments at 6 h temporal and 1 m vertical spatial resolution see section 2 2 2 for details during reproduction the genome information of male and female copepods is recombined and mutated to generate new genotypes that may produce phenotypes with different behavioral and life history strategies i e each mating male and female pair can produce a range of phenotypes fig 1b the model environments may vary stochastically in the shorter term between 6 h intervals or longer term interannually during the simulation simulations are performed for 100 calendar years i e several hundred generations assuming a 1 year generation time for c finmarchicus depending on the simulated environmental dynamics model copepods with favorable strategies may attain higher fitness and their genes may eventually be fixed in the population over time fig 1c 2 2 model description 2 2 1 entities 2 2 1 1 model copepods c finmarchicus is a predominantly herbivorous copepod species that inhabits the north atlantic and arctic oceans conover 1988 viable c finmarchicus populations can range from the gulf of maine 43 n fish 1936 to north of the svalbard archipelago 80 n daase and eiane 2007 this broad trans latitude geographical distribution is due to their association with atlantic water masses which transport c finmarchicus populations from their center of distribution in the north atlantic towards the arctic ocean this exposes them to notable variations in temperature irradiance food and predation environments c finmarchicus has a life cycle with 13 developmental stages egg six naupliar stages five copepodite stages and adults in higher latitudes it typically follows an annual life cycle one generation per year whereas in lower latitudes it may complete 2 3 generations each year melle et al 2014 towards the end of the feeding season late juvenile stages copepodite stages iv and v of c finmarchicus store lipids and descend to deeper waters for diapause falk petersen et al 2009 diapause duration varies between 4 and 6 months during which the stored lipids are metabolized at a considerably lower rate than for metabolism during the parts of the year when they are active hirche 1996a maps et al 2013 fig 1a c finmarchicus has many similarities with other herbivorous copepods such as calanoides acutus in the southern ocean and calanus glacialis in the northern hemisphere 2 2 1 2 model environment the model environment characterizes three variables irradiance temperature and food concentration their formulation is originally based on cottier et al 2010 and are described in detail in bandara et al 2018 and 2019 in the most basic form the model runs in a deterministic environment fig 2 a c to simulate shorter term environmental stochasticity we modified the deterministic model environment by introducing uniform random variations in the range of 25 to temperature and food concentration at each 6 h time interval fig 2e f similarly uniform random variations were introduced to irradiance in the range of 90 and 0 to simulate the attenuation of incident irradiance due to cloud cover fig 2d to simulate the longer term interannual environmental stochasticity we introduced uniform random variations to the maximum sea surface temperature in the range of 3 c which in turn drives the modelled maximum food concentration in the range of 45 µg c l 1 and the timing and duration of thermal stratification and pelagic primary production in the range of 75 d fig 2g i the above data ranges were defined based on i environmental data collected by autonomous surface and underwater vehicles and ferryboxes operating in the northern norwegian sea 68 71 n between 2018 and 2019 and ii era interim reanalysis archives of european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf berrisford et al 2011 2 2 2 submodels 2 2 2 1 growth and development the growth and development of model copepods follow the formulations developed for c finmarchicus by maps et al 2012a and bandara et al 2019 all rates below are given as hourly estimates which are adjusted to the temporal resolution of the model 6 h in calculations the body mass µg c is the sole proxy of body size used in this model the somatic growth rate of individual i at timestep t in depth bin z g µg c ind 1 h 1 is estimated in carbon units as a balance between the assimilation a µg c ind 1 h 1 and metabolic rates b µg c ind 1 h 1 as 1 g i t z a i t z b i t z the assimilation rate is a product of the ingestion rate i µg c ind 1 h 1 and the assimilation coefficient a table 1 the growth equation can thus be rearranged into 2 g i t z a i i t z b i t z at the reference temperature of 2 c the ingestion rate relates with the structural mass of the copepods wc µg c as 3 i i t b w c i t m here the terms b and m represent mass coefficient and exponent of ingestion table 1 the ingestion rate relates exponentially with the ambient temperature as 4 i i t z i i t c exp n t t z here i is the maximum temperature dependent ingestion rate and c and n are temperature coefficient and exponent of ingestion table 1 the ambient food concentration f µg c l 1 maps the temperature dependent ingestion rate between 0 and 1 as 5 i i t z i i t z d i t f t z 1 d i t f t z here the ingestion rate becomes solely temperature dependent above a satiation food concentration which is given by the size dependence of the parameter d as 6 d i t 0 30 w c i t 0 138 the satiation food concentration thus increases with the body mass of the copepods and falls in the range of 75 125 µg c l 1 cf campbell et al 2001 huntley and boyd 1984 the growth formulations in eqs 1 6 do not apply to eggs and the first two nauplii stages ni and nii which do not feed instead they encounter a negative growth as the energy reserves are catabolized to meet the energetic demands marshall and orr 1972 the development of non feeding stages is thus solely temperature dependent corkett et al 1986 and occurs following a bělehrádek function as 7 d i t z 4 q j t t z 9 11 2 05 here d is the estimated development time in 6 h time intervals and thus the scalar 4 on the right hand side of the eq 7 the stage specific 1 j 3 values for the parameter q are based on the estimates of campbell et al 2001 table 1 the development of feeding stages niii adult 3 j 13 occurs as the structural mass of copepods wc exceed a stage specific critical molting mass wj we estimated the wj values following the growth formulations of maps et al 2012a for c finmarchicus at each environmental setting we produced the minimum and maximum estimates for wj i e wj min and wj max by running the maps et al 2012a model for annual maximum and minimum temperatures at non limiting food concentrations consequently wj min and wj max estimates fluctuate between years depending on the interannual ambient temperature and food concentration variations the gene α 0 1 maintains the variability of body size within the copepod population the environment specific critical molting mass for any developmental stage niii onwards is estimated as 8 w j i w j m i n i w j m a x i w j m i n i α i here based on the value of the gene α the ontogenetic body mass trajectories of copepods tend to occupy a fixed fraction of the estimated minima and maxima 2 2 2 2 survival 2 2 2 2 1 predation risk similar to the study by bandara et al 2019 the predation risk in this model possesses two components the light and size dependent visual predation risk and the non visual tactile predation risk the light dependency of visual predation risk is given as 9 l t z l t 0 exp ψ z here lt 0 and lt z are the estimated irradiance µmol m 2 s 1 on the modelled sea surface and at depth z 500 m z 0 m the constant ψ represents the water column light attenuation coefficient table 1 we scaled lt z to obtain a probability metric l t z that ranges between 0 1 0 9 which offers non zero probability for survival and death respectively at the highest and lowest levels of irradiance bandara et al 2018 2019 the visual predation risk mv i e the probability of death by visual predation is thus given as 10 m v i t z l t z k i t 1 1 exp 350 w c s i t 75 here k 10 7 0 25 is a scalar for visual predation risk that adjusts the visual predation risk to the temporal resolution of the model the asymptotic exponential function at the right hand side of eq 10 represents the size dependence of visual predation risk fig 3 a where wcs µg c is the total mass of the copepod i e the sum of the structural mass wc and the energy reserve mass ws unlike the light and size dependent visual predation risk the modelled non visual predation risk mn i e the probability of death by non visual predation range 10 7 10 3 is kept constant over time and depth for simplicity eiane and parisi 2001 2 2 2 2 2 diel vertical migration dvm in this model the shorter term vertical behavior of the modelled copepods is driven by their photoreactive behavior ringelberg 2010 thereby the model copepods react to absolute light intensity and tend to avoid irradiance levels above an individual specific threshold determined by the gene β 0 1 if the maximum irradiance of the current environmental setting is lmax µmol m 2 s 1 the threshold irradiance of a given individual at a given time lthreshold µmol m 2 s 1 is estimated as 11 l t h r e s h o l d i t l m a x β i l m a x β i 1 exp 350 w c s i t 75 the asymptotic exponential function at the right hand side of the eq 11 highlights the size dependency of the threshold irradiance which decreases and light sensitivity and risk averseness increases over a copepod s lifespan fig 3b accordingly at any given time the model copepods tend to remain at a depth which provides the maximum growth potential eq 1 below the estimated irradiance threshold bandara et al 2019 given the diel periodicity of modelled irradiance fig 2a b the above photoreactive behavior leads to a classic dvm pattern i e the occupation of shallower waters during nighttime and retreat to deeper waters during daytime for each copepod at any given time we predicted the depth with maximum growth potential below the threshold irradiance deterministically and assumed that the neutrally buoyant copepods reach this depth via cruising van someren gréve et al 2017 where individuals swim at a constant velocity fig 3c as 12 u i t 5 2287 w c i t 0 4862 2 2 2 2 3 energy storage the entire surplus assimilation eq 1 of younger developmental stages niii ciii is allocated to somatic growth indicated by the structural mass wc µg c late juvenile civ and cv stages can allocate an individual specific fraction of the surplus assimilation to build up an energy reserve indicated by the energy reserve mass ws µg c which may occupy up to the entirety of the individual s structural mass here gene γ 0 1 defines the pattern of energy allocation where the entire surplus assimilation is allocated to structural growth if γ 0 and energy reserves if γ 1 the adult stages of this model do not build up energy reserves but inherit energy reserves accumulated in their pre adulthood 2 2 2 2 4 diapause and seasonal vertical migration svm each model copepod possesses an equal probability to either i perform a seasonal descent into deeper waters undergo diapause ascend back to near surface waters svm and then develop into adults or ii directly develop into adulthood without diapause and svm as in our predecessor models we used the state of the energy reserve as a proxy of timing of diapause entry and exit a reasonable assumption for the primarily income breeding c finmarchicus varpe and ejsmond 2018 here copepods descend to deeper waters when their stores reach an individual specific fraction of the structural mass either at civ or cv stage which is determined by the gene δ 0 1 the selection of diapause habitat is simple and similar to that of carlotti and wolf 1998 and bandara et al 2019 where individuals are randomly placed at depth below the mixed layer 300 500 m during diapause the vertical position of each copepod passively varies by a random amount at each time step 25 m the model copepods utilize stored reserves to meet the energy requirements during diapause which occurs at a lower rate compared to the basal metabolic rate diapause terminates when an individual specific fraction of the stored reserves is exhausted which is determined by the gene ε 0 1 as c finmarchicus is not known to possess 1 year life cycles reviewed in bandara 2014 falk petersen et al 2009 we did not model a diapause strategy among adult stages and thus the maximum generation time simulated in this model is 1 year the copepods that develop directly into adulthood may produce one or more generations within a calendar year 2 2 2 2 5 metabolism the metabolic rate is the sum of the basal metabolic rate bb µg c ind 1 h 1 and the active metabolic rate ba µg c ind 1 h 1 these hourly estimates are adjusted to the temporal resolution of the model 6 h during calculations at the reference temperature 2 c the relationship of bb with the body mass is given as 13 b b i t f w c s i t o here f and o are mass coefficient and exponent of respiration table 1 the relationship between the basal metabolic rate and the ambient temperature is given as 14 b b i t z b b i t g exp p t t z here b b is the temperature dependent basal metabolic rate and g and p are temperature coefficient and exponent of metabolism respectively table 1 the active metabolism ba which is assumed to account for 1 5 bb is added when the individuals are swimming via cruising bandara et al 2019 during diapause the ba is 0 and bb occurs at 75 reduced rate maps et al 2013 at each time interval the metabolic costs are deducted from the gross assimilation eq 1 when metabolic demand is larger than assimilated energy energy reserves are mobilized 2 2 2 2 6 starvation risk starvation sets in when the metabolic demands exceed energy reserves when a model copepod starves the structural mass is catabolized to

reproduce immediately following the final molt the possibility of sex switching at the adult stage sexual dimorphism svensen and tande 1999 is disregarded for simplicity the adult males in this model do not feed mauchline 1998 but use energy reserves to meet their metabolic demands and thus are generally short lived females mate only once in their lifetime hirche 1996b marshall and orr 1972

1 with the generation of a model environment for the entire calendar year up to 1800 h on 31 december in stochastic simulations see below the model environment may vary between time intervals and or between calendar years the simulation begins with the seeding of 100 eggs with random gene combinations to random depths 100 m of the water column at each time interval throughout the first calendar year of the simulation i e a total of 146 000 eggs at each time interval the somatic growth developmental progression reserve build up in late juvenile stages and the vertical position of each copepod

random number ωit drawn from a uniform probability distribution when a copepod is presumed dead i e si t 0 all the corresponding state variable values are erased to allow space for a new individual in the simulated population at each time interval when the survival assessment of all copepods is complete the population size pt is estimated and updated into a state variable population size as 20 p t

number of diapause entries number of diapause exits and the number of direct developments i e individuals that develop directly into adulthood without diapause along with their structural and energy reserve masses into a set of unidimensional arrays further the vertical distribution of the population along with the distribution of temperature food concentration and irradiance throughout the water column are recorded into a set of two dimensional arrays at each time interval in stochastic environments high resolution trackers are written to the disk at the end of each calendar year of the simulation in the deterministic environment high resolution trackers are only recorded and written to the disk at the final calendar year of the simulation low resolution trackers keep an annual mean of the genome information of the population and are written to disk at the end of the final calendar year of the simulation the model simulations continue over multiple years and terminate as t approaches a termination time which is typically 1800 h of 31 december of the year 100 2 4 simulation experiments model simulations were performed under four main scenarios i a basic model simulation was performed in a deterministic environment fig 2a c ii model simulations were performed in an environment with shorter term 6 h stochasticity fig 2d f in this environment the mean ambient temperature food concentration predation risk k mn 10 5 and the timing and duration of pelagic primary production remained constant between years iii model simulations were performed in an environment with both shorter and longer term stochasticity in ambient irradiance temperature and food availability fig 2g iv the model was run in the same environment in the above scenario iii but with the addition of uniformly random interannual variations to visual k range 10 7 0 25 fig 2h and non visual predation risks mn range 10 7 10 3 fig 2i 2 5 model development analysis and archiving the model was developed in fortran 95 iso iec 1539 1 1997 with the support of openmp application program interface modules for parallelization the model simulations were performed in a custom built gaming rig with a liquid cooled intel core i9 7920x processor with 24 nodes workers running at an overclocked turbo frequency of ca 4 4 ghz the model outputs were analyzed using r version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 and rkward version 0 7 0 rödiger et al 2012 in ubuntu version 18 04 the data presented in both the deterministic and shorter term stochastic simulation experiments are outputs from the final calendar year of simulations in contrast in the simulation experiments with shorter and longer term environmental stochasticity we used the mean values of environmental variables and emerging behavioral and life history attributes from each calendar year in data presentation to interpret the environmental correlates of emerging strategies in stochastic environments the above values were standardized i e centered by mean and divided by standard deviation and used in a principal component analysis pca which was run in a correlation matrix raw data of these simulations along with the source code of the

peaked in spring april may and then in autumn july september fig 4 a the first peak was dominated by eggs and younger developmental stages fig 4b the proportion of late juvenile stages copepodite stages iv and v began to increase towards mid may by late june a fraction of civs and cvs descended to deeper waters and entered diapause fig 4c h the size of the energy reserve of these diapause entries was relatively low mean 11 µg c fig 4d which was metabolized over a relatively short duration ca 1 3 months these individuals therefore ascended to the surface waters again relatively quickly after what seems to be a short summertime diapause consequently the number of diapause exits with nearly spent energy reserves increased from july to august 1000 1600 exits d 1 fig 4e f the proportion of adult males and females gradually increased from july onwards fig 4b approximately 34 of these adult stages emerged following the final molt of summertime diapause exits the rest of the adults matured from late juvenile stages and completed their final molt without undergoing diapause fig 4g a late summer egg production peak although less prominent compared to that in the spring coincided with the emergence of adults in july and contributed to a second generation fig 4b the proportion of second generation civ and cv stages began to increase towards autumn and ca 60 of them migrated to deeper waters for diapause with considerably higher energy reserves compared to the summertime diapause entries mean ws 80 µg c fig 4b d h some second generation civs and cvs did not undergo diapause and developed directly to adults and produced a third generation in late august and early september fig 4b while the third generation copepods developed under diminishing food conditions some of their late juvenile stages predominantly civs descended to deeper waters with relatively low energy reserves and entered diapause by mid september mean ws 21 µg c figs 2c and 4c d h individuals that did not reach an overwintering stage or those that failed to build sufficient energy reserves starved to death in the upper pelagial as the modelled food supply faded into the winter diapause exit continued during the autumn to winter transition october december in smaller numbers 200 exits d 1 mostly civ stages the energy reserves of these diapaus exits were spent and consequently they died in the upper pelagial due to starvation fig 4e h in contrast the diapause exits that emerged between late winter and early spring february may ca 400 exits d 1 were predominantly large cvs with higher energy reserves fig 4f these had post diapause energy reserves that prevented starvation and aided the elevation of their structural mass to attain sexual maturity and mate so that spawning commenced as soon as food levels increased in early march 3 1 2 stochastic model environments 3 1 2 1 shorter term stochasticity under shorter term environmental stochasticity fig 2d f the fraction of late juvenile civ and cv stages that entered diapause increased slightly 2 relative to the simulation in the deterministic environmental setting fig 4k o and diapause index in fig 5 although the timing of diapause entry and exit were not markedly different the structural mass and energy reserve levels of diapause entries and diapause exits differed significantly from the deterministic simulation figs 4k n and 5 particularly the 2nd and 3rd quarters of diapause entries which endured the longest diapause duration were on average 20 40 smaller in structural mass and carried ca 40 less lipid reserves figs 4l and 5 as a result when they emerged from diapause between january and late june i e 1st quarter of diapause exits they had on average 9 µg c of reserves remaining which was 50 compared to those in the deterministic environment fig 5 in contrast the mean structural and energy reserve masses of the 1st quarter of diapause entries that endured the shortest diapause duration were ca 20 higher than in the deterministic setting many of them emerged in the late summer and early autumn 2nd quarter of diapause exits with higher energy reserves fig 5 these energy reserves allowed for reduced starvation especially since feeding opportunities gradually deteriorated towards autumn fig 2f and these larger individuals had to frequently evacuate the productive near surface waters as they performed diel vertical migrations to reduce predation risk fig 4p the mean size at sexual maturity of the simulated c finmarchicus population decreased by ca 12 and the timing of egg production occurred ca 12 d later in the stochastic model environment fig 5 3 1 2 2 longer term stochasticity in all model environments where longer term interannual stochasticity was added to the shorter term stochasticity food concentration and the duration of the productive season were positively correlated to ambient temperature altogether the growth potential eigenvectors i iii fig 6 cf fig 2g i consequently in warmer years the timing of the pelagic bloom occurred earlier compared to colder years eigenvector iv fig 6 when both visual and non visual predation risks were modest and constant between years the mean timing of diapause entry and the structural and energy reserve masses of diapause entries were negatively correlated with the growth potential eigenvectors ix x and xi in fig 6a this shows that in warmer years with higher growth potential the simulated c finmarchicus population entered diapause earlier in the year at smaller body size and with less reserves fig 7 c d k l similarly size at sexual maturity correlated negatively with the growth potential eigenvector xv fig 6a the mean timing of diapause exit correlated with structural and energy reserve masses of diapause exits but not with the growth potential eigenvectors xii xiii xiv fig 6a this is because the early diapause exits which ascended to near surface waters during the spring summer transition were large developmental stages mainly cvs with high energy reserves while those emerged during the autumn winter transition were smaller civs and cvs with nearly depleted reserves fig 7e f m n the diapause index correlated negatively with the growth potential eigenvector viii fig 6a and suggests that a higher proportion of late juvenile stages remained in diapause until feeding opportunities emerged in the following productive season in colder years with lower growth potential fig 7e m in warmer years with higher growth potential most late juvenile stages directly developed to adulthood and produced additional generation s fig 7g o although the timing of egg production eigenvector xvi correlated positively with the timing of diapause exit fig 6a the lack of a strong positive correlation e g alike that between temperature and food concentration suggests that non diapausing late juvenile stages that directly develop into adults contributed to a substantial fraction of the total egg production irrespective of the modelled interannual variations of growth potential interannual stochastic variability in both visual or non visual predation risks eigenvectors vi and vii fig 6 had little effect on the mean timing or structural and energy reserve masses at diapaus entry fig 6b c and panels c d e k of figs 8 9 however visual predation risk correlated positively with the mean timing of diapause exit fig 6b indicating that diapause of the simulated c finmarchicus population terminated later in years with higher visual predation risk and vice versa fig 8e m this predicted shift in the timing of diapause exit primarily accounts for the fraction of c finmarchicus population that exits diapause during late summer and autumn because the mean timing of diapause exit always fell between late summer and early autumn when the largest number of copepods exited diapause in all model simulations fig 8e m non visual predation risk correlated negatively with the timing of diapause exit fig 6c therefore in years with higher non visual predation risk diapause exit of the simulated c finmarchicus population occurred relatively earlier than in years with lower risk january april fig 9e m 4 discussion two main diapause strategies emerged in the simulated c finmarchicus population irrespective of the level of environmental variability i a mid to late spring diapause entry as civs or smaller cvs with limited energy reserves and a late summer to autumn diapause exit which resembles an oversummering strategy wang et al 2003 and ii a summer autumn diapause entry predominantly as cvs with larger reserve loads and a diapause exit during the winter spring transition which resembles a classic overwintering strategy sømme 1934 as a result of both strategies being present in the population diapause entry occurred throughout the productive season and diapause exit occurred asynchronously throughout the year in varying numbers additionally and as a third strategy a part of the population did not undergo diapause at all and instead developed directly to adults in the attempt to reproduce within the same productive season the proportions of the diapausing and non diapausing populations varied between years despite the equal probabilities forced at the diapausing and non diapausing decision this occurred due to the differential survival rates associated with the diapausing and non diapausing strategies given the interannual stochastic variations of the model environment 4 1 the curious case of oversummering in high latitude herbivorous copepods overwintering is a state of dormancy that increases survival during unproductive winter periods where food is scarce sømme 1934 overwintering has been studied extensively since the pioneering work of gran 1902 oversummering is comparatively less well studied oversummering c sinicus in the yellow sea is probably the most well known among marine copepods pu et al 2004 wang et al 2005 where cvs occupying the yellow sea cold water mass enters diapause as the upper pelagial warms up and feeding opportunities deteriorate towards summer li et al 2004 recent studies point to an oversummering strategy among some c finmarchicus populations in the western north atlantic for example an individual based modeling study of c finmarchicus in the gulf of maine by maps et al 2012b predicted that a part of the simulated population that enters diapause in mid summer returns to the upper pelagial in autumn while using a late pelagic algal bloom for feeding and reproduction their model predicted oversummering timing and durations align well with the field data durbin et al 1997 saumweber and durbin 2006 however the environmental dynamics e g ambient temperature and the timing and duration of the productive season of these northwest atlantic study locations considerably differ from those of the present model and direct comparisons to field data should be made with caution in the northeast atlantic russell 1926 noted a mid summer seasonal descent of c finmarchicus populations of the english channel and described it as a strategy to avoid harmful levels of summertime irradiance further kaartvedt 2000 highlighted that c finmarchicus populations in the norwegian sea may enter diapause in summer primarily due to the elevated predation risk imposed by seasonally migrating planktivorous fish however as none of these studies continued towards autumn we do not know if these summer diapause entries had ascended back to the upper pelagial later in the same productive season from the classic of østvedt 1955 to more recent studies such as strand et al 2020 we see civ and cv stages remaining in the near surface layers of the norwegian sea towards autumn however it is unclear whether these late developmental stages are a part of a non diapausing multigenerational development or remnants of a brief summer diapause a main problem of entering diapause earlier in the year late spring and early summer is that these diapause entries require substantial energy reserves to remain dormant until the following productive season for example a copepod that enters diapause in late may or early june at the deterministic model environment has to remain dormant for ca 10 months before the pelagic primary production commences in the following year fig 2c this is unlikely for most copepods given the modelled diapause metabolic rate at 0 c fig 2b eq 14 and their lower energy reserve sizes fig 4d instead energy reserve exhaustion drove large numbers of these early diapause entries to the upper pelagial between late summer and autumn fig 4e f m n where they successfully produced another generation since food was still available at the time figs 2c f and 4b j in the model this evolved into an adaptive strategy in both deterministic and stochastic settings since the summertime escape from the upper pelagial reduced the mortality risk imposed by visual predation and there was sufficient food for the growth and development of their offspring until autumn this somewhat resembles the summer diapause of freshwater zooplankton in response to vertebrate pijanowska and stolpe 1996 and invertebrate strickler and twombly 1975 predation where resting eggs are produced prior to the elevation of seasonal predation risk a well studied conservative bet hedging strategy garcía roger et al 2017 despite this interesting model prediction that highlights underlying trade offs in the annual routine of these copepods we are uncertain about how likely it is that such briefer summer descents are to be expected for northeast atlantic c finmarchicus this is because contrast to our model summer autumn food conditions in nature are far from guaranteed due to grazing pressure and nutrient limitation and consequently most early diapause entries that exit diapause in late summer and autumn with exhausted energy reserves usually starve to death without contributing to another generation pepin and head 2009 4 2 timing of diapause in response to environmental stochasticity 4 2 1 shorter term environmental stochasticity the shorter term stochastic oscillations of ambient temperature and food concentration collectively induced growth potential variations between the simulated 6 h timesteps fig 2e f and eqs 1 6 however diapause timing of the simulated c finmarchicus population was robust to these shorter term growth potential variations fig 5 this robustness was manifested through the plasticity of behavioral and morphological morphometric attributes first copepods abandoned their routine dvm behavior that emerged in the deterministic environment fig 4h and spent more time in near surface waters especially during time intervals with higher simulated cloud cover to elevate foraging effort fig 4p nonetheless this did not fully compensate for the growth potential variability which is indicated by the lower mean structural and energy reserve masses of late juvenile civ and cv stages compared to the deterministic setting figs 4d l and 5 since it takes lesser time to attain a lower body mass at a prescribed growth potential in this model eqs 1 8 the lower structural and energy reserve masses of late juvenile stages compensated for potential delays of diapause entry caused by environmental variability however this body size plasticity came at a significant cost in the form of reduced survival and reproductive output at their springtime ascent these smaller post diapause stages had little energy reserves figs 4f n and 5 this reduced the survivorship among the earliest diapause exits that ascended to near surface waters preceding the onset of the pelagic primary production further as the attainment of sexual maturity generally requires a significant elevation of the structural mass from late juvenile copepodite stages eq 8 the relatively smaller diapause exits took a longer time to develop towards sexual maturity and caused the 12 d delay in the mean timing of egg production fig 5 however a further delay in egg production did not occur as the c finmarchicus reached sexual maturity at ca 12 lesser size fig 5 this caused ca 20 drop in egg production since the fecundity of the modelled copepods is proportional to their body size eq 17 4 2 2 longer term environmental stochasticity 4 2 2 1 diapause entry the mean timing of diapause entry was highly plastic to the modelled interannual variations of growth potential and occurred earlier in warmer years with earlier onset and longer duration of pelagic primary production and vice versa figs 6a cf fig 7 in a ca two decade timeseries study espinasse et al 2018 reported a similar phenological shift in the seasonal appearance of cvs among two distinct c finmarchicus populations inhabiting northern icelandic and western spitsbergen shelves further a five year study on a co occurring copepod c glacialis reported ca 3 week delay in the appearance of lipid accumulated late juvenile stages during abnormally colder years when the pelagic primary production occurred relatively late in the white sea pertsova and kosobokova 2010 growth potential implications on the diapause entry of c finmarchicus are also found along spatial gradients for example melle et al 2014 reported a notable 30 60 d delay in c finmarchicus diapause entry in the northwest atlantic compared to northeast atlantic the earlier onset of primary production in the warmer upper pelagial of the northeast atlantic generally warrant faster growth rates and a large fraction of c finmarchicus population enters diapause between late may and july in contrast the pelagic primary production of the northwest atlantic occurs relatively late and slower growth rates sustained in the colder upper pelagial generally delays their diapause entry similarly in colder seasonally ice covered high arctic fjords where the period of net positive pelagic primary production commences in mid june and is limited in duration to 2 3 months the timing of c finmarchicus diapause entry can shift to august september arnkværn et al 2005 bandara et al 2016 it has been hypothesized that elevated predation risk imposed by planktivorous fish drive parts of the c finmarchicus populations in the norwegian sea to diapause depths by mid summer thus negating the possibility to produce an additional generation or two in the autumn kaartvedt 2000 varpe and fiksen 2010 in contrast our predecessor model bandara et al 2019 which assumed an annual life cycle for c finmarchicus at 70 n highlighted the possibility of elevated visual predation risk to cause a relative delay in the timing of diapause entry due to the reduced growth rates induced by diel vertical migration consequently the modelled copepods required more time to develop into civs or cvs with sufficient energy reserves for overwintering however in the present model the visual predation risk did not significantly influence i the predicted mean timing of diapause entry ii the mean structural and energy reserve masses of diapause entries iii generation time or iv the extent of summer diapause fig 6b cf fig 8 in this model visual predation risk varied interannually following a uniformly random probability distribution fig 2h in the studies of varpe and fiksen 2010 and bandara et al 2019 a higher predation risk was sustained or assumed across multiple generations for example bandara et al 2019 maintained elevated visual predation potential for ca 400 generations thus maintaining a constant top down selection pressure over an adequate time period for life histories of the simulated copepods to evolve since the top down selection pressure of the stochastic versions of the present model varied randomly between years it is unlikely that life history responses such as smaller body masses and reduced energy stores are evolved in higher predation risk environments this adaptive evolution adaptive tracking of body size contrasts the body size plasticity predicted under uniformly random interannual fluctuations of bottom up selection pressures i e temperature and food availability fig 7 where the response of copepods body size and hence the reserve size is near instantaneous due to the strict food and temperature dependence of the growth and developmental formulations eqs 1 8 4 2 2 2 diapause exit the proximate drivers of the diapause exit and seasonal ascent of high latitude copepods are not well understood and an array of internal and external cues are hypothesized reviewed in bandara et al 2021 baumgartner and tarrant 2017 miller et al 1991 according to recent studies lipid modulated endogenous timers play a crucial role in diapause exit of c finmarchicus häfker et al 2018 skottene et al 2019 similarly the modelled proximate driver of diapause exit in this study is the exhaustion of energy reserves represented by the gene ε this in association with the lipid based diapause entry attribute i e gene δ table 1 created more or less a continuum of diapause exit strategies that spanned asynchronously throughout the year in both deterministic and stochastic model environments e g fig 4e m observations on asynchronous diapause exit and seasonal ascent of calanus spp have been noted in several high latitude year round zooplankton investigations particularly fjord environments e g bandara et al 2016 darnis and fortier 2014 dezutter et al 2019 wallace et al 2010 further wintertime upper pelagial occupation of calanus spp is documented across numerous high latitude locations such as western and northern norwegian fjords balinö and aksnes 1993 falkenhaug et al 1997 open waters of the norwegian and barents seas bathmann et al 1990 heath and jónasdóttir 1999 pedersen et al 1995 greenland sea hirche 1991 and in fjords on the svalbard archipelago berge et al 2009 darnis et al 2017 it is unclear why calanus spp ascend to the upper pelagial several months prior to the commencement of pelagic primary production some studies are insightful of the ability of winter active predators to drive diapausing populations out of the deeper pelagial błachowiak samołyk et al 2015 sims et al 2003 results of the simulations performed under variable non visual predation risk also points towards the same direction where the diapausing c finmarchicus population tended to ascend earlier at higher levels of non visual predation risk fig 6c cf fig 9 however a major contrast between the simulated calanus population and those in the field is that when driven to the upper pelagial the latter may survive the unproductive winter given their omnivorous feeding strategy cleary et al 2017 ohman et al 1998 søreide et al 2008 in this model most individuals that exited diapause and ascended to the upper pelagial during the unproductive season october february died from starvation as they were modelled as strict herbivores figs 4 7 9 it may be questioned how such a wasteful strategy that causes mass wintertime mortality becomes prominent in a model of artificial evolution when the mutation probability of gene ε was reduced to 0 02 1 10th of the normal value in a trial simulation performed in a deterministic model environment the year round diapause exit largely diminished and was limited to the spring and mid summer data not presented however when the same modification was attempted in a trial simulation performed in an environment with shorter and longer term stochasticity the model collapsed within a few years due to the inability of copepods to maintain a viable population over the simulated timeseries this suggests that the year round diapause exit was crucial to the year to year survival of the simulated c finmarchicus population especially since the copepods in diapause cannot predict the time at which the pelagic primary production starts in the following year the asynchronous year round diapause exit predicted in this model represents a diversified bet hedging strategy where parents parental genotypes through random mating recombination and mutation produce a series of offspring with diverse diapause exit strategies phenotypes across which the mortality starvation risk of ascending to the upper pelagial at the wrong food deprived time of the year is spread philippi and seger 1989 slatkin 1974 similar diversified bet hedging strategies are common among many freshwater zooplankton e g rotifers and cladocerans that undergo diapause as resting eggs here parents produce resting eggs through sexual reproduction which sinks to the sediment and remain viable for many years and act as germ banks from which the offspring emerge asynchronously in time brendonck and de meester 2003 the population level consequences of such bet hedging strategies are paramount particularly because synchronous hatching of resting eggs can be detrimental to the population when there are pronounced stochastic variations in the environment and if there are no widespread proximate cues to predict those variations hairston jr 1996 therefore the asynchronous diapause exit of marine zooplankton predicted by our model and the asynchronous hatching of resting eggs from egg banks seems to be analogous strategies selected for by environmental variability as more detailed in situ data are about to become increasingly available via autonomous vehicles gliders and floats equipped with imaging devices e g lombard et al 2019 this predicted outcome could soon be tested in various ecosystems around the world 5 conclusions most marine zooplankton live in a near continuous flow and faces uncertainty in foraging and predator encounter probabilities in the shorter term seuront et al 2004 visser et al 2008 along with longer term interannual variations of temperature food and predation environments they occupy a world of highly variable bottom up and top down selection pressures across time and space lurling and de senerpont domis 2013 understanding adaptations of zooplankton to environmental heterogeneity is not an easy task however mechanistic simulation models provide a cost effective supplement to field studies and laboratory experiments in this regard the present model extends the capabilities of our predecessor models and sheds new light on the timing and body size dynamics of the high latitude copepod c finmarchicus against stochastic environmental variations that occur atop predictable cyclic diel and seasonal patterns see also fiksen 2000 although spatial environmental heterogeneity is not explicitly formulated in this model its computationally efficient simulation framework opens future opportunities to couple this unidimensional individual based biological model

24542,motivation certain early succession habitats may emerge only at restricted locations following disturbance therefore whether disturbances tend to occur at certain sites or not can significantly affect habitat availability and metapopulation persistence of early successional habitat specialists available models that combine metapopulation and landscape processes do not address how to model mobile spatially shifting disturbance intensities independent of factors of site suitability we present a model that allows the study on how a mobile disturbance pattern of either natural or anthropogenic origin affects patch network and metapopulation dynamics in realistic heterogeneous landscapes methods we simulate metapopulation dynamics using a realistic landscape and varying patch destruction and turnover rates we model the local patch emergence rate as the function of site suitability to patch emergence a permanent factor and local disturbance intensity which we first estimate from empirical data and then simulate using annually updating spatial random fields using this model we test whether and how a mobile disturbance pattern affects metapopulation persistence of the false heath fritillary butterfly melitaea diamina results in our case study a mobile disturbance pattern caused new patches to emerge further away from occupied patches over time this decreased the probability of new patches becoming colonized and thus impaired metapopulation persistence even when the median distance between patches appeared unchanging however if disturbances moved to areas that were highly suitable to patch emergence increased habitat availability could compensate the otherwise detrimental effects of a mobile disturbance pattern disturbances that had a moderate degree of mobility had the most uncertain effects to metapopulation persistence conclusions our modelling approach distinguishes between two processes behind the spatio temporal pattern and rates of patch emergence disturbance dynamics and varying site suitability it enables the use of social and environmental data for forecasting habitat availability for early succession habitat specialists under alternative future scenarios it can be applied and developed further to suit multiple study systems our case study suggests that for species conservation it is either beneficial to organize recurring management activities to take place at constant locations or to gradually shift them towards areas that are highly suitable to patch emergence keywords habitat dynamics metapopulation dynamics habitat

succession habitats are typically short lived they are quickly taken over by bushes and young trees in the absence of continued disturbances or management wahlberg et al 2002 harper 2007 greenberg et al 2011 certain types of early succession habitats for instance certain communities of herbaceous flora cousins and eriksson 2008 also emerge only at geographically restricted chytrý et al 2003

that disturbances occur at sites that are suitable for their emergence disturbances that generate early succession habitats may follow spatio temporal patterns natural disturbances such as wildfires floods and windfalls are driven by climatic geographic and meteorological factors ballinger et al 2007 zwolak 2009 panayotov et al 2011 disturbances of anthropogenic origin such as forestry or agricultural practices hodgson et al 2009 occur at specific locations due to complex socio economic factors such as patterns of land ownership population density land use regulations and economic demand aviron et al 2005 renwick et al 2013 climatic and cultural changes including agricultural policies storkey et al 2012 batáry et al 2015 or generational shifts in land ownership ingram et al 2013 duesberg et al 2017 may break long term patterns of land use and shift land use activities to new locations it is therefore vital to understand changes in disturbances with respect to landscape suitability to the emergence of specific types of early succession habitats to be able to forecast early succession habitat availability in changing landscapes changes in habitat availability may be particularly critical to dispersal limited species which persist in fragmented habitat patch networks via colonization extinction dynamics hanski 1998 the short lifetimes of early succession habitats generate turnover where patches disappear from the patch network and are replaced by new patches elsewhere e g johst et al 2011 thus metapopulations experience higher local extinction rates boughton and malvadkar 2002 johst et al 2011 and need higher colonization rates to persist johst et al 2002 hastings 2003 verheyen et al 2004 in dynamic than in static patch networks short patch lifetimes may also cause fluctuations in patch availability which impair metapopulation persistence van teeffelen et al 2012 de roissart et al 2015 in summary metapopulation persistence in dynamic landscapes depends both on species traits e g species ability to colonize patches and on the landscape level pattern of disturbances and patch emergences past models of metapopulation dynamics have accounted for landscape heterogeneity in its suitability to patch emergence in various geographic scales larson et al 2004 hodgson et al 2009 naujokaitis lewis et al 2013 metapopulation models have also accounted for the disturbance pattern e g by modelling metapopulation dynamics under alternative landscape management scenarios drechsler et al 2007 hodgson 2009 drechsler and johst 2010 landscape heterogeneity in site suitability to patch emergence and disturbance dynamics have also been modelled together e g midgley et al 2010 latif et al 2013 miller et al 2015 in a non metapopulation context however existing models do not provide ways for linking all of the three aspects the disturbance pattern metapopulation dynamics and landscape heterogeneity in wider geographic scales despite this having been a long term aim in ecological research franklin 2013 we present a model for the study on how the spatio temporal disturbance pattern affects patch network and metapopulation persistence in heterogeneous landscapes we simulate metapopulation dynamics using a realistic landscape and varying patch destruction and turnover rates we model the local patch emergence rate as the product of site suitability to patch emergence here a permanent or longer term characteristic of the site due to e g biogeographical factors and local contemporary disturbance intensity first we estimate disturbance intensity from empirical data assuming it is the cause of unexplained spatial variation in patch locations apart from biogeographical and longer term land use factors in our study system this assumption is based on the well known characteristics of false heath fritillary habitats yet the absence of these sites at many sub regions with suitable climates and soils after the initial estimation from empirical data we subsequently model the disturbance pattern using spatial random fields that change form annually with varying degrees of mobility utilizing the fitted spatial pattern allows us to model location changes in disturbances while maintaining the spatial scale of the disturbance pattern which is often typical to the type of disturbance modelled e g johst et al 2001 siriwardena 2010 we test our model using data on the false heath fritillary butterfly melitaea diamina lang 1789 in finland where the species is dependant on highly dynamic fabritius and mcbride 2017 valeriana sambucifolia meadows on moist and calcareous soils wahlberg 1997 our study aimed at answering the following questions q1 do false heath fritillary habitat patches occur at sites with distinguishable characteristics e g certain soil and land use types q2 how does increasing mobility of the disturbance pattern affect metapopulation persistence especially in relation to increasing patch turnover rate our results demonstrate that a mobile disturbance pattern may affect the persistence of an early succession habitat specialist in multiple ways 2 material methods 2 1 study area and survey data the false heath fritillary habitat patch network in the west coast of finland 62 25 n 21 5 e 3200 km2 fig 1 top left consists of 459 identified habitat patches with mean patch area of 1 55 ha range 0 03 9 46 ha in 2000 2007 the regional environmental authorities recorded 70 patches location area and false heath fritillary sightings and the rest were recorded in 2009 2011 during a false heath fritillary distribution survey conducted for the purpose of this study each year of the survey some of the previously identified patches were revisited to reassess their occupancy 0 sightings at occupied patches the data thus consist of presences or absences for the surveyed populations but includes missing observations each year for details of the surveys see supplement appendix 1 2 2 a stochastic patch occupancy model in a dynamic patch network we created a continuous time stochastic patch occupancy model ovaskainen and hanski 2001 for discrete time spoms see moilanen 1999 2004 and references therein that incorporates the extinction colonisation dynamics of a false heath fritillary metapopulation events 1 2 fig 2 and the emergence destruction patch turnover dynamics of its patch network events 3 4 fig 2 at any given time the simulated patch network consists of a gridded study landscape and a discrete set of patches i characterized by their centroid coordinates x i and y i patch area a i and occupancy status o i 1 for occupied and o i 0 for empty patches the dynamics of the model consist of four kinds of events 1 colonization of unoccupied patches by the butterfly 2 extinction of occupied patches 3 destruction of existing patches implying extinction of the butterfly population if occupied at the time of the destruction and 4 emergence of new patches initially not occupied by the butterfly fig 2 we model the colonization rate of patch i by the butterfly metapopulation as a sum of contributions from the occupied patches j 1 c i c j i n e α d i j a i ζ i m a j ζ e m o j where c is an overall colonization rate parameter d i j is the distance between pacthes i and j the parameter measures the spatial scale of connectivity as in harrison et al 2011 and the parameters ζ i m and ζ e m model how patch area influences the processes of immigration and emigration respectively ovaskainen and hanski 2001 2003 we model the extinction rate of a patch i occupied by the butterfly by 2 e i e a i ζ ex where e is an overall extinction rate parameter and ζ e x models how extinction risk depends on patch area ovaskainen and hanski 2001 and references therein existing patches were assumed to be destroyed at rate 3 δ i ε that was assumed to be the same for all patches we modelled the emergence rate of a patch centroid at a grid cell location x y that does not already contain a patch centroid by 4 β x y ε p x y z 1 p x y z where p x y is the probability predicted by a patch location model that the grid cell x y is overlaid by a patch and z is the ratio of the expected size of a patch to the grid cell see section patch location and area models and appendix 2 for details since in this model β x y increases with increasing ε parameter ε in practice modelled not only the patch destruction rate but also the patch turnover rate the percentage of patches in the system that are replaced by new ones within a given time area of a new patch was randomized from a patch area model see section patch location and area models below for details including random residual variance in case the new created patch would overlap with another patch based on their radii r a π assuming patches to be circular patch location and size were randomized again until the patch did not overlap with others all patches that emerged during the simulation were originally unoccupied we simulated the continuous time markov process with the gillespie 1977 algorithm sampling the time until the next event from the exponential distribution with parameter set to the total rate i 1 n c i i 1 n e i i 1 n δ i x y 1 m β x y and then randomizing which event takes place based on the relative rates of the possible individual events 2 3 patch location and area models we modelled the locations and areas of false heath fritillary habitat patches patches in the study region as a function of soil and land use type suitability to patch emergence soil suitability categories 1 3 presented in table 1 distance to fields dfield in metres distance to rivers driver in metres and topographic wetness index twi wilson and gallant 2000 wilson 2012 twi twi is a measure of drainage in a landscape and can be used to identify dips and hollows that retain water for longer periods exclusive of permanent water bodies like lakes and swamps wilson 2012 wilson and gallant 2000 for technical details on the preparation of the covariate layers see supplement appendix 3 we transformed variables as needed to account for skewed distributions then normalized the continuous variables to zero mean and unit variance we modelled the locations of patches patch location model by fitting a logistic regression model that had patch existence at a grid cell patches n 26 000 000 as the response variable and soil dfield driver and twi at the respective grid cell as covariates since our patch network data were based on a landscape level survey of aerial photographs before conducting visits to potential sites we treated the patch network pattern as presence absence data for modelling patch locations we modelled the sizes of patches patch area model by fitting a linear model that had log transformed patch area as the response variable and the average values of soil dfield driver and twi of the grid cells overlaid by the patch as covariates we considered the average of soil values of grid cells overlaid by a patch as a reasonable proxy for patch quality even though this measure may contain slight bias due the soil suitability classes not being commensurate we randomized one grid cell out of each patch and so many grid cells outside of patches that the proportion of meadow versus non meadow cells in the sample equalled to the corresponding proportion in the patches grid layer we fitted both non spatial and spatial model versions for both models the spatial models included a gaussian markov random field based on a matérn covariance function matérn 1960 lindgren et al 2011 to account for a possible spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals dormann et al 2007 for details on model selection and evaluation see supplement appendix 3 we interpolated and rasterized the linear predictions l l x y and l a x y and the gaussian markov random fields f l x y and f a x y of the selected patch location and area models fig 1 subscripts l x y and a x y refer to the values of the patch location l and area a models for the location x y respectively we scaled the random fields f l x y to zero mean by including the empirical mean f l x y to the linear predictor and predicted the probabilities of patch occurrence as p x y logi t 1 logit l l x y logit f l x y similarly we defined the predicted size of an emerging patch as a x y e l o g l a x y f a x y u u stands for the residual variation for each emerging patch and follows the distribution u n 0 σ 2 where σ 2 stands for the estimated nugget variance of the patch area model for details on the interpolation and rasterization of predictions see supplement appendix 3 for computational reasons we aggregated the prediction rasters of these models to 200 m x 200 m resolution when applying them as part of the patch occupancy models 2 4 parameterisation of the stochastic patch occupancy model we estimated the overall colonization c and extinction e rate parameters of the false heath fritillary from the 2009 2012 survey data appendix 1 by using an approximate bayesian computation abc beaumont 2010 csilléry et al 2010 approach and a simple rejection algorithm modified from rubin 1984 as summary statistics in the abc we used the fraction of occupied patches from the pooled data for all of the years 2009 2012 the fraction of cases in which a patch observed occupied was still observed occupied after 1 2 or 3 years and the fraction of cases in which a patch observed empty was still observed empty after 1 or 2 years we assumed uniform priors for both e and c in the range 0 1 based on initial exploration we sampled 10 000 candidate values from the prior simulated metapopulation dynamics using the candidate values and approximated the posterior by the top 1 of the values in terms of their match to the real data with respect to the summaries in the scenario simulations we set the parameters e and c to their posterior mean values for details of the abc approach see supplement appendix 3 we set the spatial scale of connectivity α 0 7 km 1 based on previous studies on the false heath fritillary moilanen 1999 moilanen and cabeza 2002 ovaskainen 2008 and the effects of patch area to the extinction ζ e x 0 17 immigration ζ i m 0 30 and emigration ζ e m 0 07 based on analyses on a closely related species glanville fritillary butterfly ovaskainen and hanski 2004 2 5 model analysis we used the parameterized metapopulation model to examine how an increasing degree of mobility of the disturbance pattern disturbance mobility φ influences the dynamics of the butterfly metapopulations under increasing patch turnover rates ε we modelled a mobile disturbance pattern letting the random fields f l x y and f a x y change annually leading to spatially autocorrelated random annual changes in β x y and e a x y at each location this was done by generating matérn random fields using the inla qsample function in inla rue et al 2009 2013 blangiardo et al 2013 that had the statistical properties of the random fields of the path location and area models but that differed each year from the random fields of the previous year we used the ar 1 process ω t φ ω t 1 η where φ depicts the proportion of stability of spatial random fields between two consecutive years ω t represents the random field in year t and η represents another random field that was chosen so that the stationary state of the process was the matérn covariance function with the estimated variance and spatial scale parameters thus decreasing the value of the parameter φ would result in a higher degree of mobility of the disturbance pattern when simulating the system we varied the parameter of mobility of the disturbance pattern as 1 0 98 0 94 0 61 so that the disturbance pattern was either stationary φ 1 or the characteristic decay time of the disturbance pattern 1 log φ the time after which the impact of the spatial pattern to future patterns has decreased to 1 e equalled 50 16 or 2 years respectively the parameter θ 1 η the log transformed local variance parameter of the simulated matérn random fields η in the inla implementation was set to 9 θ 1 η θ 1 ω log 1 φ 2 2 based on the respective local variance parameter of the random fields of the original matérn random fields θ 1 ω we did not modify the spatial scale parameter θ 2 of the generated random fields we scaled all resulting fields ω t to the same variance as the original field ω we simulated fabritius 2021 all models with the patch destruction parameter varied as ε 0 015 0 03 0 15 which range includes the estimated annual habitat destruction rate of false heath fritillary habitat patches estimated from field data 0 076 95 ci 0 058 0 10 fabritius mcbride 2017 for details of the metapopulation simulations see supplement appendix 3 3 results 3 1 locations and sizes of false heath fritillary habitats with respect to site characteristics the locations and sizes of false heath fritillary habitat patches depended on site related covariates wet calcareous soils near rivers away from cultivated fields had the highest probabilities for patch occurrence table 2 as there was spatial autocorrelation in the patch network configuration a model with a spatial term marginal likelihood 2176 10 predicted patch occurrences better than a non spatial model marginal likelihood 2451 21 the predictions given by the resulting model of patch occurrences correlated well with realized occurrences while slightly underestimating patch proportions at high predicted probabilities of occurrence appendix 4 figure s1 largest patches occurred at intermediate moisture and where soil and land use type suitability was high table 3 extinction and colonization rate estimates for the false heath fritillary had wide credible ranges but the majority of accepted values were more concentrated around the posterior means and the posterior means of both parameters fit well within the centre of the joint parameter distribution e 0 154 95 cr i 0 0519 0 271 and c 0 749 95 cr i 0 225 0 979 appendix 4 figure s2 3 2 effects of a mobile disturbance pattern on metapopulation persistence a mobile disturbance pattern impaired metapopulation persistence in our study system patch occupancies decreased and metapopulations were more likely to go extinct with slower patch turnover rates when the mobility of the disturbance pattern increased fig 3 metapopulation persistence was impaired despite the fact that the characteristics of the patch network median number of patches and the median distance to the nearest neighbour patch appendix 4 figure s3 s4 decreased only marginally or remained essentially the same in all simulations a mobile disturbance pattern φ 1 impaired metapopulation persistence via mechanisms that were different from those of an increased habitat turnover rate fast habitat turnover rates increased the proportion of deterministic patch extinctions appendix 4 figure s5 and thus decreased the average lifetimes of local populations appendix 4 figure s6 as a result more and more patch emergences were required to increase patch colonization rates appendix 4 figure s7 a mobile disturbance pattern caused new emerging patches to appear further away from i e within poorer connectivity to occupied patches appendix 4 figure s8 this decreased the probability of the new patches becoming colonized appendix 4 figure s9 as a result metapopulation persistence became more and more dependant on old large patches which could maintain local populations from the beginning of the simulation appendix 4 figure s10 3 3 the degree of mobility of the disturbance pattern and metapopulation persistence disturbances that had a moderate degree of mobility i e that changed place at a moderate speed had the most uncertain effects to habitat availability and metapopulation persistence the number appendix 4 figure s3 median distance appendix figure s4 and connectivity appendix 4 figure s8 of patches at the end of the simulations varied the most when the mobility of the disturbance pattern equalled characteristic decay times of 16 and 50 years φ 0 94 and φ 0 98 respectively patch occupancy varied the most with the characteristic decay time of 50 years φ 0 98 fig 3 as metapopulations started going extinct if the decay time was shorter than this the uncertain effects of the moderately mobile disturbance pattern were caused by the fact that slowly moving disturbances had the largest effect to the patch network in the time scale of the simulations if disturbances moved to take place at areas of high site suitability to patch emergence in terms of site specific covariates high numbers of new patches emerged especially with high patch turnover rates appendix 4 figure s11 and high numbers of patch emergences increased patch colonizations appendix 4 figure s7 however the more mobility of the disturbance pattern increased corresponding to lower values of φ the more likely it became that the overall changes to mean probability to patch emergence started to even out after multiple changes appendix 4 figure s12 also since high disturbance mobility reduced the probability of new patches becoming colonized less colonizations resulted from disturbances occurring at high local site suitability to patch emergence appendix 4 figure s13 therefore whether disturbances moved to sites of poor or high suitability patch emergence could greatly affect patch occupancy but only if disturbance mobility was slow 4 discussion our case study confirms past findings that metapopulation persistence in dynamic landscapes is maintained best if apart from increasing the area quality or lifetime of existing patches nicol and possingham 2010 marcot et al 2012 resetarits and binckley 2013 new emerging patches appear close to occupied patches where they have a high likelihood of becoming colonized templeton et al 2011 southwell 2016 southwell et al 2016 our modelling approach shows that the prerequisite of such a pattern is a stationary disturbance pattern or a disturbance pattern with high temporal autocorrelation if disturbances occur repeatedly at specific regions local patch networks are likely to remain well connected even after multiple consecutive patch destructions and emergences along these lines our simulated false heath fritillary population was able to persist through the simulations with a patch turnover rate that matched the patch destruction rate estimated from empirical data ε 0 075 fabritius and mcbride 2017 when the disturbance pattern was stationary but not when it was very mobile φ 0 61 our case study also suggested that in certain circumstances it might also be a viable option to gradually direct disturbances of anthropogenic origin to take place at areas that would be even more suitable to patch emergence this was supported by the fact that in our simulations there was a strong connection between high landscape level mean probabilities of patch emergence and high patch emergence and colonization rates when the degree of mobility in the disturbance pattern was moderate with regard to conservation of early succession habitat specialists such a management alternative might be attractive e g if potential nearby locations were more easily manageable via agri environment schemes or if maintenance activities at the nearby location were likely to result in higher quality habitat such an approach however may also have drawbacks as e g past studies on climate change induced range shifts on metapopulations suggest that populations may be either too slow to track the changing habitat networks or lose genetic diversity while doing so cobben et al 2011 schippers et al 2011 mestre et al 2017 often the optimal solution is heavily dependant on the population dynamics of the species being studied third our case study also contributes to the discussion on what features of a dynamic patch network may predict and may thus help to monitor metapopulation persistence in our simulations the number of and median distance between patches did not predict the patch network s capacity to sustain a metapopulation as sites of high suitability to patch emergence were determined by hydrological patterns and narrow stripes of calcareous soils across the study landscape consequently new patches aggregated in stripe like areas and maintained nearly unchanging median distance between patches while occupied patch sub networks were driven away from each other and metapopulation persistence was impaired therefore with regard to dynamic patch systems conservation managers might benefit more from monitoring the connectivity of emerging patches to occupied ones than from assessing the structure of the patch network from snapshot data moreover our study shows that conservation managers may want to watch for possible changes in disturbance generating factors that operate on moderate time scales e g generational shifts in land ownership or rural desertification since these may lead into cessation of longer term stationary disturbance patterns that have maintained habitat networks more profoundly the approach we have introduced for modelling patch networks in dynamic landscapes distinguishes two processes behind the pattern and rates of patch emergence the disturbance pattern and its coincidence with site suitability to patch emergence modelling disturbance intensities by using spatial random fields suits modelling disturbances over larger regions where modelling of exact annual management schemes by property borders or management units is not needed as e g in wätzold et al 2008 hodgson et al 2009 but the focus is rather in modelling regional variations and changes in mean disturbance frequencies or mean annual probabilities of local disturbance these modelling choices enable the use of various kinds of social and environmental data for forecasting habitat availability for early succession habitat specialists under alternative scenarios data sets on anticipated changes in land ownership density of active farmers forestry practices demands for agricultural products bryngelsson et al 2016 or regional administrative differences in agri environmental incentives kleijn and sutherland 2003 may offer new avenues for forecasting regional disturbance intensities other potential data include those of anticipated changes in climatic factors that operate on regional scales e g variations in the frequency of floods and windstorms e g wade et al 2015 which are often used e g in studies of forest succession simulations e g scheller et al 2007 our model can be developed further to simulate either more deterministic directional shifts of disturbances or gradual deterministic changes in disturbance intensities for these purposes our modelling approach could also be used to include gradual deterministic changes in the permanent site suitability factors while maintaining the current disturbance pattern this could be used for instance to model the effects of climate change to dynamic habitat patch networks radchuk et al 2013 utilization of our model also calls for consideration of how to reliably determine which proportion of spatial variation in patch locations is caused by factors other than disturbance intensity in this study we assumed that all unexplained spatial variation in patch locations was caused by regional differences in disturbance intensity in future studies the distinction of these factors should be developed further in the case of habitat specialist species modelling of the distributions of the target species and their key habitat resources such as host plants wisz et al 2013 pollock et al 2014 may improve habitat suitability models moreover site suitability and disturbance intensity could be modelled jointly iverson et al 2011 maire et al 2012 disturbance data could be acquired by recording not only the locations of currently suitable habitats but also of the locations of overgrown otherwise potential habitat sites during the field monitoring phase fabritius and mcbride 2017 additionally spatial data on current disturbance frequencies could be included in the joint modelling in conclusion separating disturbance dynamics from site suitability for habitat emergence is an important object in the modelling of habitat availability and metapopulation dynamics for early successional habitat specialists our study presents a method for the incorporation of wider range variations in disturbance dynamics into these models and can be developed further to accommodate social and environmental data for forecasting and scenario analysis

24542,motivation certain early succession habitats may emerge only at restricted locations following disturbance therefore whether disturbances tend to occur at certain sites or not can significantly affect habitat availability and metapopulation persistence of early successional habitat specialists available models that combine metapopulation and landscape processes do not address how to model mobile spatially shifting disturbance intensities independent of factors of site suitability we present a model that allows the study on how a mobile disturbance pattern of either natural or anthropogenic origin affects patch network and metapopulation dynamics in realistic heterogeneous landscapes methods we simulate metapopulation dynamics using a realistic landscape and varying patch destruction and turnover rates we model the local patch emergence rate as the function of site suitability to patch emergence a permanent factor and local disturbance intensity which we first estimate from empirical data and then simulate using annually updating spatial random fields using this model we test whether and how a mobile disturbance pattern affects metapopulation persistence of the false heath fritillary butterfly melitaea diamina results in our case study a mobile disturbance pattern caused new patches to emerge further away from occupied patches over time this decreased the probability of new patches becoming colonized and thus impaired metapopulation persistence even when the median distance between patches appeared unchanging however if disturbances moved to areas that were highly suitable to patch emergence increased habitat availability could compensate the otherwise detrimental effects of a mobile disturbance pattern disturbances that had a moderate degree of mobility had the most uncertain effects to metapopulation persistence conclusions our modelling approach distinguishes between two processes behind the spatio temporal pattern and rates of patch emergence disturbance dynamics and varying site suitability it enables the use of social and environmental data for forecasting habitat availability for early succession habitat specialists under alternative future scenarios it can be applied and developed further to suit multiple study systems our case study suggests that for species conservation it is either beneficial to organize recurring

twi topographic wetness index 1 introduction early succession habitats are open environments that emerge at recently disturbed sites and provide living environments for many pioneering species early succession habitats are typically short lived they are quickly taken over by bushes and young trees in the absence of continued disturbances or management wahlberg et al 2002 harper 2007 greenberg et al 2011 certain types of early succession habitats for instance certain communities of herbaceous flora cousins and eriksson 2008 also emerge only at geographically restricted chytrý et al 2003 schuster and diekmann 2003 sites that possess specific conditions such as specific soil moisture ph and nutrient levels therefore the existence of certain types of early succession habitats requires that disturbances occur at sites that are suitable for their emergence disturbances that generate early succession habitats may follow spatio temporal patterns natural disturbances such as wildfires floods and windfalls are driven by climatic geographic and meteorological factors ballinger et al 2007 zwolak 2009 panayotov et al 2011 disturbances of anthropogenic origin such as forestry or agricultural practices hodgson et al 2009 occur at specific locations due to complex socio economic factors such as patterns of land ownership population density land use regulations and economic demand aviron et al 2005 renwick et al 2013 climatic and cultural changes including agricultural policies storkey et al 2012 batáry et al 2015 or generational shifts in land ownership ingram et al 2013 duesberg et al 2017 may break long term patterns of land use and shift land use activities to new locations it is therefore vital to understand changes in disturbances with respect to landscape suitability to the emergence of specific types of early succession habitats to be able to forecast early succession habitat availability in changing landscapes changes in habitat availability may be particularly critical to dispersal limited species which persist in fragmented habitat patch networks via colonization extinction dynamics hanski 1998 the short lifetimes of early succession habitats generate turnover where patches disappear from the patch network and are replaced by new patches elsewhere e g johst et al 2011 thus metapopulations experience higher local extinction rates boughton and malvadkar 2002 johst et al 2011 and need higher colonization rates to persist johst et al 2002 hastings 2003 verheyen et al 2004 in dynamic than in static patch networks short patch lifetimes may also cause fluctuations in patch availability which impair metapopulation persistence van teeffelen et al 2012 de roissart et al 2015 in summary metapopulation persistence in dynamic landscapes depends both on species traits e g species ability to colonize patches and on the landscape level pattern of disturbances and patch emergences past models of metapopulation dynamics have accounted for

in site suitability to patch emergence and disturbance dynamics have also been modelled together e g midgley et al 2010 latif et al 2013 miller et al 2015 in a non metapopulation context however existing models do not provide ways for linking all of the three aspects the disturbance pattern metapopulation dynamics and landscape heterogeneity in wider geographic scales despite this having been a long term aim in ecological research franklin 2013 we present a model for the study on how the spatio temporal disturbance pattern affects patch network and metapopulation persistence in heterogeneous landscapes we simulate metapopulation dynamics using a realistic landscape and varying patch destruction and turnover rates we model the local patch emergence rate as the product of site suitability to patch emergence here a permanent or longer term characteristic of the site due to e g biogeographical factors and local contemporary disturbance intensity first we estimate disturbance intensity from empirical data assuming it is the cause of unexplained spatial variation in patch locations apart from biogeographical and longer term land use factors in our study system this assumption is based on the well known characteristics of false heath fritillary habitats yet the absence of these sites at many sub regions with suitable climates and soils after the initial estimation from empirical data we subsequently model the disturbance pattern using spatial random fields that change form annually with varying degrees of mobility utilizing the fitted spatial pattern allows us to model location changes in disturbances while maintaining the spatial scale of the disturbance pattern which is often typical to the type of disturbance modelled e g johst et al 2001 siriwardena 2010 we test our model using data on the false heath fritillary butterfly melitaea diamina lang 1789 in finland where the species is dependant on highly dynamic fabritius and mcbride 2017

distinguishable characteristics e g certain soil and land use types q2 how does increasing mobility of the disturbance pattern affect metapopulation persistence especially in relation to increasing patch turnover rate our results demonstrate that a mobile disturbance pattern may affect the persistence of an early succession habitat specialist in multiple ways 2 material methods 2 1 study area and survey data the false heath fritillary habitat patch network in the west coast of finland 62 25 n 21 5 e 3200 km2 fig 1 top left consists of 459 identified habitat patches with mean patch area of 1 55 ha range 0 03 9 46 ha in 2000 2007 the regional environmental authorities recorded 70 patches location area and false heath fritillary sightings and the rest were recorded in 2009 2011 during a false heath fritillary distribution survey conducted for the purpose of this study each year of the survey some of the previously identified patches were revisited to reassess their occupancy 0 sightings at occupied patches the data thus consist of presences or absences for the surveyed populations but includes missing observations each year for details of the surveys see supplement appendix 1 2 2 a stochastic patch occupancy model in a dynamic patch network we created a continuous time stochastic patch occupancy model ovaskainen and hanski 2001 for discrete time spoms see moilanen 1999 2004 and references therein that incorporates the extinction colonisation dynamics of a false heath fritillary metapopulation events 1 2 fig 2 and the emergence destruction patch turnover dynamics of its patch network events 3 4 fig 2 at any given time the simulated patch network consists of a gridded study landscape and a discrete set of patches i characterized by their centroid coordinates x i and y i patch area a i and occupancy status o i 1 for occupied and o i 0 for empty patches the dynamics of the model consist of four kinds of events 1 colonization of unoccupied patches by the butterfly 2 extinction of occupied patches 3 destruction of existing patches implying extinction of the butterfly population if occupied at the time of the destruction and 4 emergence of new patches initially not occupied by the butterfly fig 2 we model the colonization rate of patch i by the butterfly metapopulation as a sum of contributions from the occupied patches j 1 c i c j i n e α d i j a i ζ i m a j ζ e m o j where c is an overall colonization rate parameter d i j is the distance between pacthes i and j the parameter measures the spatial scale of connectivity as in harrison et al 2011 and the parameters ζ i m and ζ e m model how patch area influences the processes of immigration and emigration respectively ovaskainen and hanski 2001 2003 we model the extinction rate of a patch i occupied by the butterfly by 2 e i e a i ζ ex where e is an overall extinction rate parameter and ζ e x models how extinction risk depends on patch area ovaskainen and hanski 2001 and references therein existing patches were assumed to be destroyed at rate 3 δ i ε that was assumed to be the same for all patches we modelled the emergence rate of a patch centroid at a grid cell location x y that does not already contain a patch centroid by 4 β x y ε p x y z 1 p x y z where p x y is the probability predicted by a patch location model that the grid cell x y is overlaid by a patch and z is the ratio of the expected size of a patch to the grid cell see section patch location and area models and appendix 2 for details since in this model β x y increases with increasing ε parameter ε in practice modelled not only the patch destruction rate but also the patch turnover rate the percentage of patches in the system that are replaced by new ones within a given time area of a new patch was randomized from a patch area model see section patch location and area models below for details including random residual variance in case the new created patch would overlap with another patch based on their radii r a π assuming patches to be circular patch location and size were randomized again until the patch did not overlap with others all patches that emerged during the simulation were originally unoccupied we simulated the continuous time markov process with the gillespie 1977 algorithm sampling the time until the next event from the exponential distribution with parameter set to the total rate i 1 n c i i 1 n e i i 1 n δ i x y 1 m β x y and then randomizing which event takes place based on the relative rates of the possible individual events 2 3 patch location and area models we modelled the locations and areas of false heath fritillary habitat patches patches in the study region as a function of soil and land use type suitability to patch emergence soil suitability categories 1 3 presented in table 1 distance to fields dfield in metres distance to rivers driver in metres and topographic wetness index twi wilson and gallant 2000 wilson 2012 twi twi is a measure of drainage in a landscape and can be used to identify dips and hollows that retain water for longer periods exclusive of permanent water bodies like lakes and swamps wilson 2012 wilson and gallant 2000 for technical details on the preparation of the covariate layers see supplement appendix 3 we transformed variables as needed to account for skewed distributions then normalized the continuous variables to zero mean and unit variance we modelled the locations of patches patch location model by fitting a logistic regression model that had patch existence at a grid cell patches n 26 000 000 as the response variable and soil dfield driver and twi at the respective grid cell as covariates since our patch network data were based on a landscape level survey of aerial photographs before conducting visits to potential sites we treated the patch network pattern as presence absence data for modelling patch locations we modelled the sizes of patches patch area model by fitting a linear model that had log transformed patch area as the response variable and the average values of soil dfield driver and twi of the grid cells overlaid by the patch as covariates we considered the average of soil values of grid cells overlaid by a patch as a reasonable proxy for patch quality even though this measure may contain slight bias due the soil suitability classes not being commensurate we randomized one grid cell out of each patch and so many grid cells outside of patches that the proportion of meadow versus non meadow cells in the sample equalled to the corresponding proportion in the patches grid layer we fitted both non spatial and spatial model versions for both models the spatial models included a gaussian markov random field based on a matérn covariance function matérn 1960 lindgren et al 2011 to account for a possible spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals dormann et al 2007 for details on model selection and evaluation see supplement appendix 3 we interpolated and rasterized the linear predictions l l x y and l a x y and the gaussian markov random fields f l x y and f a x y of the selected patch location and area models fig 1 subscripts l x y and a x y refer to the values of the patch location l and area a models for the location x y respectively we scaled the random fields f l x y to zero mean by including the empirical mean f l x y to the linear predictor and predicted the probabilities of patch occurrence as p x y logi t 1 logit l l x y logit f l x y similarly we defined the predicted size of an emerging patch as a x y e l o g l a x y f a x y u u stands for the residual variation for each emerging patch and follows the distribution u n 0 σ 2 where σ 2 stands for the estimated nugget variance of the patch area model for details on the interpolation and rasterization of predictions see supplement appendix 3 for computational reasons we aggregated the prediction rasters of these models to 200 m x 200 m resolution when applying them as part of the patch occupancy models 2 4 parameterisation of the stochastic patch occupancy model we estimated the overall colonization c and extinction e rate parameters of the false heath fritillary from the 2009 2012 survey data appendix 1 by using an approximate bayesian computation abc beaumont 2010 csilléry et al 2010 approach and a simple rejection algorithm modified from rubin 1984 as summary statistics in the abc we used the fraction of occupied patches from the pooled data for all of the years 2009 2012 the fraction of cases in which a patch observed occupied was still observed occupied after 1 2 or 3 years and the fraction of cases in which a patch observed empty was still observed empty after 1 or 2 years we assumed uniform priors for both e and c in the range 0 1 based on initial exploration we sampled 10 000 candidate values from the prior simulated metapopulation dynamics using the candidate values and approximated the posterior by the top 1 of the values in terms of their match to the real data with respect to the summaries in the scenario simulations we set the parameters e and c to their posterior mean values for details of the abc approach see supplement appendix 3 we set the spatial scale of connectivity α 0 7 km 1 based on previous studies on the false heath fritillary moilanen 1999 moilanen and cabeza 2002 ovaskainen 2008 and the effects of patch area to the extinction ζ e x 0 17 immigration ζ i m 0 30 and emigration ζ e m 0 07 based on analyses on a closely related species glanville fritillary butterfly ovaskainen and hanski 2004 2 5 model analysis we used the parameterized metapopulation model to examine how an increasing degree of mobility of the disturbance pattern disturbance mobility φ influences the dynamics of the butterfly metapopulations under increasing patch turnover rates ε we modelled a mobile disturbance pattern letting the random fields f l x y and f a x y change annually leading to spatially autocorrelated random annual changes in β x y and e a x y at each location this was done by generating matérn random fields using the inla qsample function in inla rue et al 2009 2013 blangiardo et al 2013 that had the statistical properties of the random fields of the path location and area models but that differed each year from the random fields of the previous year we used the ar 1 process ω t φ ω t 1 η where φ depicts the proportion of stability of spatial random fields between two consecutive years ω t represents the random field in year t and η represents another random field that was chosen so that the stationary state of the process was the matérn covariance function with the estimated variance and spatial scale parameters thus decreasing the value of the parameter φ would result in a higher degree of mobility of the disturbance pattern when simulating the system we varied the parameter of mobility of the disturbance pattern as 1 0 98 0 94 0 61 so that the disturbance pattern was either stationary φ 1 or the characteristic decay time of the disturbance pattern 1 log φ the time after which the impact of the spatial pattern to future patterns has decreased to 1 e equalled 50 16 or 2 years respectively the parameter θ 1 η the log transformed local variance parameter of the simulated matérn random fields η in the inla implementation was set to 9 θ 1 η θ 1 ω log 1 φ 2 2 based on the respective local variance parameter of the random fields of the original matérn random fields θ 1 ω we did not modify the spatial scale parameter θ 2 of the generated random fields we scaled all resulting fields ω t to the same variance as the original field ω we simulated fabritius 2021 all models with the patch destruction parameter varied as ε 0 015 0 03 0 15 which range includes the estimated annual habitat destruction rate of false heath fritillary habitat patches estimated from field data 0 076 95 ci 0 058 0 10 fabritius mcbride 2017 for details of the metapopulation simulations see supplement appendix 3 3 results 3 1 locations and sizes of false heath fritillary habitats with respect to site characteristics the locations and sizes of false heath fritillary habitat patches depended on site related covariates wet calcareous soils near rivers away from cultivated fields had the highest probabilities for patch occurrence table 2 as there was spatial autocorrelation in the patch network configuration a model with a spatial term marginal likelihood 2176 10 predicted patch occurrences better than a non spatial model marginal likelihood 2451 21 the predictions given by the resulting model of patch occurrences correlated well with realized occurrences while slightly underestimating patch proportions at high predicted probabilities of occurrence appendix 4 figure s1 largest patches occurred at intermediate moisture and where soil and land use type suitability was high table 3 extinction and colonization rate estimates for the false heath fritillary had wide credible ranges but the majority of accepted values were more concentrated around the posterior means and the posterior means of both parameters fit well within the centre of the joint parameter distribution e 0 154 95 cr i 0 0519 0 271 and c 0 749 95 cr i 0 225 0 979 appendix 4 figure s2 3 2 effects of a mobile disturbance pattern on metapopulation persistence a mobile disturbance pattern impaired metapopulation persistence in our study system patch occupancies decreased and metapopulations were more likely to go extinct with slower patch turnover rates when the mobility of the disturbance pattern increased fig 3 metapopulation persistence was impaired despite the fact that the characteristics of the patch network median number of patches and the median distance to the nearest neighbour patch appendix 4 figure s3 s4 decreased only marginally or remained essentially the same in all simulations a mobile disturbance pattern φ 1 impaired metapopulation persistence via mechanisms that were different from those of an increased habitat turnover rate fast habitat turnover rates increased the proportion of deterministic patch extinctions appendix 4 figure s5 and thus decreased the average lifetimes of local populations appendix 4 figure s6 as a result more and more patch emergences were required to increase patch colonization rates appendix 4 figure s7 a mobile disturbance pattern caused new emerging patches to appear further away from i e within poorer connectivity to occupied patches appendix 4 figure s8 this decreased the probability of the new patches becoming colonized appendix 4 figure s9 as a result metapopulation persistence became more and more dependant on old large patches which could maintain local populations from the beginning of the simulation appendix 4 figure s10 3 3 the degree of mobility of the disturbance pattern and metapopulation persistence disturbances that had a moderate degree of mobility i e that changed place at a moderate speed had the most uncertain effects to habitat availability and metapopulation persistence the number appendix 4 figure s3 median distance appendix figure s4 and connectivity appendix 4 figure s8 of patches at the end of the simulations varied the most when the mobility of the disturbance pattern equalled characteristic decay times of 16 and 50 years φ 0 94 and φ 0 98 respectively patch occupancy varied the most with the characteristic decay time of 50 years φ 0 98 fig 3 as metapopulations started going extinct if the decay time was shorter than this the uncertain effects of the moderately mobile disturbance pattern were caused by the fact that slowly moving disturbances had the largest effect to the patch network in the time scale of the simulations if disturbances moved to take place at areas of high site suitability to patch emergence in terms of site specific covariates high numbers of new patches emerged especially with high patch turnover rates appendix 4 figure s11 and high numbers of patch emergences increased patch colonizations appendix 4 figure s7 however the more mobility of the disturbance pattern increased corresponding to lower values of φ the more likely it became that the overall changes to mean probability to patch emergence started to even out after multiple changes appendix 4 figure s12 also since high disturbance mobility reduced the probability of new patches becoming colonized less colonizations resulted from disturbances occurring at high local site suitability to patch emergence appendix 4 figure s13 therefore whether disturbances moved to sites of poor or high suitability patch emergence could greatly affect patch occupancy but only if disturbance mobility was slow 4 discussion our case study confirms past findings that metapopulation persistence in dynamic landscapes is maintained best if apart from increasing the area quality or lifetime of existing patches nicol and possingham 2010 marcot et al 2012 resetarits and binckley 2013 new emerging patches appear close to occupied patches where they have a high likelihood of becoming colonized templeton et al 2011 southwell 2016 southwell et al 2016 our modelling approach shows that the prerequisite of such a pattern is a stationary disturbance pattern or a disturbance pattern with high temporal autocorrelation if disturbances occur repeatedly at specific regions local patch networks are likely to remain well connected even after multiple consecutive patch destructions and emergences along these lines our simulated false heath fritillary population was able to persist through the simulations with a patch turnover rate that matched the patch destruction rate estimated from empirical data ε 0 075 fabritius and mcbride 2017 when the disturbance pattern was stationary but not when it was very mobile φ 0 61 our case study also suggested that in certain circumstances it might also be a viable option to gradually direct disturbances of anthropogenic origin to take place at areas that would be even more suitable to patch emergence this was supported by the fact that in our simulations there was a strong connection between high landscape level mean probabilities of patch emergence and high patch emergence and colonization rates when the degree of mobility in the disturbance pattern was moderate with regard to conservation of early succession habitat specialists such a management alternative might be attractive e g if potential nearby locations were more easily manageable via agri environment schemes or if maintenance activities at the nearby location were likely to result in higher quality habitat such an approach however may also have drawbacks as e g past studies on climate change induced range shifts on metapopulations suggest that populations may be either too slow to track the changing habitat networks or lose genetic diversity while doing so cobben et al 2011 schippers et al 2011 mestre et al 2017 often the optimal solution is heavily dependant on the population dynamics of the species being studied third our case study also contributes to the discussion on what features of a dynamic patch network may predict and may thus help to monitor metapopulation persistence in our simulations the number of and median distance between patches did not predict the patch network s capacity to sustain a metapopulation as sites of high suitability to patch emergence were determined by hydrological patterns and narrow stripes of calcareous soils across the study landscape consequently new patches aggregated in stripe like areas and maintained nearly unchanging median distance between patches while occupied patch sub networks were driven away from each other and metapopulation persistence was impaired therefore with regard to dynamic patch systems conservation managers might benefit more from monitoring the connectivity of emerging patches to occupied ones than from assessing the structure of the patch network from snapshot data moreover our study shows that conservation managers may want to watch for possible changes in disturbance generating factors that operate on moderate time scales e g generational shifts in land ownership or rural desertification since these may lead into cessation of longer term stationary disturbance patterns that have maintained habitat networks more profoundly the approach we have introduced for modelling patch networks in dynamic landscapes distinguishes two processes behind the pattern and rates of patch emergence the disturbance pattern and its coincidence with site suitability to patch emergence modelling disturbance intensities by using spatial random fields suits modelling disturbances over larger regions where modelling of exact annual management schemes by property borders or management units is not needed as e g in wätzold et al 2008 hodgson et al 2009 but the focus is rather in modelling regional variations and changes in mean disturbance frequencies or mean annual probabilities of local disturbance these modelling choices enable the use of various kinds of social and environmental data for forecasting habitat availability for early succession habitat specialists under alternative scenarios data sets on anticipated changes in land ownership density of active farmers forestry practices demands for agricultural products bryngelsson et al 2016 or regional administrative differences in agri environmental incentives kleijn and sutherland 2003 may offer new avenues for forecasting regional disturbance intensities other potential data include those of anticipated changes in climatic factors that operate on regional scales e g variations in the frequency of floods and windstorms e g wade et al 2015 which are often used e g in studies of forest succession simulations e g scheller et al 2007 our model can be developed further to simulate either more deterministic directional shifts of disturbances or gradual deterministic changes in disturbance intensities for these purposes our modelling approach could also be used to include gradual deterministic changes in the permanent site suitability factors while maintaining the current disturbance pattern this could be used for instance to model the effects of climate change to dynamic habitat patch networks radchuk et al 2013 utilization of our model also calls for consideration of how to reliably determine which proportion of spatial variation in patch locations is caused by factors other than disturbance intensity in this study we assumed that all unexplained spatial variation in patch locations was caused by regional differences in disturbance intensity in future studies the distinction of these factors should be developed further in the case of habitat specialist species modelling of the distributions of the target species and their key habitat resources such as host plants wisz et al 2013 pollock et al 2014 may improve habitat suitability models moreover site suitability and disturbance intensity could be modelled jointly iverson et al 2011 maire et al 2012 disturbance data could be acquired by recording not only the locations of currently suitable habitats but also of the locations of overgrown otherwise potential habitat sites during the field monitoring phase fabritius and mcbride 2017 additionally spatial data on current disturbance frequencies could be included in the joint modelling in conclusion separating disturbance dynamics from site suitability for habitat emergence is an important object in the modelling of habitat availability and metapopulation dynamics for early successional habitat specialists our study presents a method for the incorporation of wider range variations in disturbance dynamics into these models and can be developed further to accommodate social and environmental data for forecasting and scenario analysis

24543,despite the strenuous efforts devoted to its elimination chagas disease is still prevalent in large regions of latin america its main vector triatoma infestans kissing bug feeds on people and domestic animals and finds refuge in the peripheral structures of rural and semi rural houses here we propose a mathematical model based on discrete time equations that describe the evolution of the populations of all the stages of t infestans residing in a chicken coop a typical bug reservoir in non urban habitats the chicken coop has also been used as a suitable location for observations of t infestans populations under realistic controlled conditions the variables that govern the model are the time of the year the temperature and the blood intake by the triatomines using the available data we design fitting functions such as maximum blood intake development time mortality rate egg fertility etc for each population group then we validate our model using d gorla s experimental work on t infestans populations finally we analyze the minimum conditions of temperature and food availability necessary for the survival of t infestans showing that average daily temperatures below 12 c or average yearly temperatures below 16 c or above 32 c lead to colony extinction feeding also regulates the colony size and we find that if a few triatomines 5 of the colony are well fed and the rest occasionally get a meager meal the colony size can be on average constant over the years by quantifying what happens in structures crucial to the species survival our model is an important step forward towards the formulation of a general population model for t infestans in the grand chaco under current conditions keywords kissing bug triatoma infestans population dynamics chagas disease 1 introduction chagas disease whose causative agent is the protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi is endemic to large regions of latin america where the total exposed population is estimated at 60 million the main vector responsible for the transmission of this parasite is arguably the blood sucking insect triatoma infestans which can be found in urban rural and wild habitats in many south american countries bustamante et al 2016 the use of insecticides and the improvement in living conditions are the only effective tools for its control gorla et al 2010 moreno et al 2012 gurevitz et al 2013 gorla et al 2015 residual insecticide applications have been successful in decreasing the prevalence of the vector transmitted infections in some regions in particular brazil chile and uruguay have eliminated transmission by t infestans cucunubá et al 2017 however vector control strategies have been hindered by the ability of the insect to find suitable refuges in peridomestic structures such as the corrals and chicken coops that are usually found around rural dwellings in the south american grand chaco region the environmental conditions of these structures reduce the efficacy of the traditional insecticide spraying techniques amelotti et al 2013 as a consequence this vector still presents a serious health and social problem as shown by schofield long ago schofield 1982 blood intake and ambient temperature are the main determinants of t infestans development experimental studies of the influence of climatic and nutritional factors on these populations have been usually carried out using restrained chickens as food sources juarez 1970 rabinovich 1972 schofield 1982 gorla and schofield 1985 it is therefore useful to have a population model that considers the most important factors influencing t infestans populations in all stages of its life cycle in this paper we use the results of studies of t infestans in chicken coops to develop a comprehensive model that incorporates the separate influences of temperature and blood intake on the egg nymphal and adult stages of t infestans we validate the model by applying it to a series of experiments performed by d gorla gorla and schofield 1985 our study can be taken as a necessary starting point for the analysis of the population dynamics of triatominae residing in a rural house and its environs where people and domestic animals live and perpetuate the chagas endemic gürtler et al 1993 the bugs have a life cycle that can last between one and two years depending on the climate and nutritional conditions of the insect canale 1985 and consists of eggs five nymphal stages and adult male and female bugs in sylvatic environments these insects feed by taking blood from mammals and birds in rural regions they feed on the blood of people domestic animals such as cats and dogs and on farmyard animals such as chickens pigs goats etc gürtler et al 1993 cecere et al 1997 gürtler et al 1998 gürtler et al 2014 it has been determined that mammal blood has a higher nutritional content for the triatomines than bird blood guarneri et al 2000 j nattero 2011 but in both cases the nutritional content is sufficient for the development of a colony of t infestans it has also been observed that chagas disease is only suffered by mammals and not by birds since birds are immune to t cruzi minter 1976 however the presence of birds does influence the proliferation of the insect and has an indirect impact on the endemic cecere et al 1997 gürtler 1998 in general the published works on the development and growth of t infestans fed on bird blood have focused on the observation of the insect populations under conditions of constant temperature and feeding frequency rabinovich 1972 guarneri et al 2000 j nattero 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 other works have focused on the influence of temperature joërg 1962 blaksley 1968 juarez 1970 or food hack 1955 perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 dale 1978 on the triatomine life cycle but with the exception of schofield 1982 we know of no experimental works where both situations have been studied simultaneously it is of interest to analyze exhaustively how temperature and food together influence the evolution of a t infestans colony under realistic conditions to do this we propose a mathematical model that describes the life of the insect in a chicken coop in a rural habitat using data from field studies carried out in recent decades this will amplify and complement the information provided by existing models rabinovich 1990 gorla 1992 castañera et al 2003 in the next section we develop and justify the model some details are relegated to the supplementary materials in section 3 we validate the model applying it to the results of various experiments carried out by d gorla section 4 includes a discussion of various aspects of our model and its predictions for the influence of the environmental conditions on the triatomines 2 materials and methods our model consists of eight discrete time equations that describe the populations of the five nymphal stages adult male and female bugs and eggs to better compare the model predictions with the experimental data a closed system is considered bugs are not allowed to either enter or leave the coop initially we determine the most relevant factors that impact on each stage of the triatomine life cycle for this purpose it is convenient to classify all the stages into three groups nymphs adult bugs and eggs the information collected to build the model comes mainly from lab work and to a lesser extent from field work in all cases chickens were used to feed the triatomines the model is assumed to be valid over the whole temperature range where t infestans is viable but we will use different temperature domains in the figures to show in the clearest possible way the general functional forms and their supporting experimental data which are taken from many sources we will model the following quantities blood intake development times death rates male female composition egg maturation fertility and fecundity 2 1 nymphs 2 1 1 blood intake the relationship between nymph blood intake and temperature has been carefully studied by schofield schofield 1982 and in somewhat less detail by juarez juarez 1970 here we define the maximum blood intake cmax as the amount of blood that a triatomine takes in a meal when left in contact with a restrained hen for a time equal or longer than 30 min because after this time it can be assumed that the insect has already filled its abdomen with blood schofield 1982 the blood take was made weekly as reported in both publications but to simplify the model we will consider daily average values that is the weekly intake divided by 7 between 25 and 30 c cmax takes higher values than for lower or higher temperatures at 45 c the bugs die in less than an hour schofield 1982 although it is not clear up to what maximum temperature they can be effectively fed at the other extreme of temperatures joërg 1962 observed that at 10 c the nymphs stop feeding in juarez 1970 the values of cmax for each nymphal stage are given for 25 and 30 c in schofield 1982 these values are given for 22 27 and 35 c but only for all stages together not for each stage separately however it is possible to estimate cmax for the nymphal stages using a simple criterion detailed in appendices a1 because we work with data from different publications instead of working with the average daily blood intake as an independent variable we consider the fraction of maximum intake xc which is equal to unity if the feeding time is equal to or greater than 30 min see table 1 when blood intake is not complete xc is calculated as the ratio of the amount of blood ingested to the value of cmax at the corresponding temperature this allows us to incorporate data from other publications rabinovich 1972 guarneri et al 2000 where although the amount of ingested blood is not specified it is reported that the meal duration is longer than 30 min so xc 1 from this new variable and the temperature we develop functions describing the nymph development times and mortality rates 2 1 2 development times the development time is the time it takes a nymph newly entered a stadium to move to the next stage table 2 contains the development times obtained from different publications that report experiments where the nymphs were fed weekly with chicken blood except in guarneri et al 2000 where they were fed with pigeon blood the temperature and the blood intake level which we call xc are also detailed in table 2 when the nymphs do not feed xc 0 no development is observed for this reason the null symbol appears in table 2 lack of development not only occurs when there is no blood ingestion it was found that there is a minimum threshold for feeding hack 1955 perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 below which the nymphs remain in their stage for a long time until they die without having made their next molt this threshold value is not known precisely for each stage but from the last two references it can be estimated to be between 10 and 20 of the optimal intake value which would be equivalent to a single short duration blood meal during the stage in the range of 20 c 30 c that is to say the nymph need not be satiated after the ingestion if the meal is complete and the nymph fills its abdomen with blood at least once it is very likely to develop and molt except for second stage nymphs for which the odds of molting are still low j p s 1973 therefore with these considerations a threshold value of 20 of optimal intake has been chosen if xc 0 20 the nymph will not complete its development as shown in table 2 at 10 c nymphs do not ingest blood and do not develop completely joërg 1962 hack 1955 as already mentioned at 45 c the bugs die in less than an hour schofield 1982 so we consider a somewhat lower temperature as the limit for life 43 c there is no detailed information on the nymphal development time in the regions near the critical temperatures 10 c and 43 c for the lower critical region only data for nymphs i at 15 c are available schofield 1982 following a drop in temperature from about 20 c to 15 c the development times grow exponentially reaching more than a year see fig 1 according to catalá 1991 only unfed bugs are observed below 16 5 c in rural houses combining this information with the data of schofield 1982 we set 15 c as the lowest possible temperature for development for the upper critical region only information up to 35 c is available schofield 1982 unlike in the lower critical region here the development times remain practically constant therefore due to the lack of information extrapolation is used to estimate the behavior of the development curves near the upper critical temperature fig 1 shows the development times of nymphal stage i from table 2 as functions of temperature and blood intake level in fig 1 we also include the development function for the first nymphal stage dev ni t xc this function describes nymphal development and we model it as follows first we consider xc 1 the value for which the available dataset is largest and fit a temperature function using least squares red curve in fig 1 we then consider the values xc 0 43 and xc 0 27 and again fit temperature functions for each blood intake level yellow and blue curves in fig 1 respectively but now using the same functional form as for xc 1 finally we analyze the relation between the three curves in order to determine the function dev ni t xc which is given by eq 1 1 de v i t xc α 1 i α 2 i xc exp 0 4 t β 1 i β 2 i xc for 15 t 43 and xc 0 2 with i α1i 104 α2i 104 β1i β2i ni 17 8 7 9 57 3 35 3 nii 18 2 8 4 39 1 16 7 niii 22 3 10 5 35 3 15 9 niv 23 7 10 9 53 3 30 4 nv 52 7 24 4 120 5 68 5 the units of eq 1 are c for the temperature t and days for the dev i function the exponential form suggests itself when we observe the sharp increase of the development time at 15 c and the tail in the t 22 c region eq 1 contains all the available information about the development times of the five nymphal stages as functions of temperature and blood intake for t 15 c or xc 0 2 there is no development so the dev i function is effectively infinite in that domain for t 43 c the nymphs cannot survive if xc 0 2 a linear function provides a suitable description of the decrease in development time with blood intake level the parameters α1i and α2i describe the separation between the exponential curves at different intake levels represented by the red yellow and blue curves in fig 1 lastly parameters β1i and β2i correspond to the y intercept in the high temperature region sm fig 1 sm2 shows the development times for the other nymphal stages for these stages we have no information for development times at 15 c for this reason we use the same exponential coefficient obtained for nymphs i which is equal to 0 4 in eq 1 in any case the development times in this temperature range are so long that it is unlikely that a nymph will complete its development and move on to the next stage 2 1 3 nymph mortality rates nymph mortality is another phenomenon that depends on the temperature and the average blood intake we will use mortality rates which in the case of nymphs are given by the ratio of the percentage of nymphs that die during the development of a stage for a given temperature and feeding time to the duration of this stage two types of mortality percentages are mentioned in schofield 1982 one is the average for all the stages taken together at a fixed temperature and feeding time and the other is the average for one specific stage at a fixed temperature but for all feeding times therefore given that the mortality percentage for each stage has not been specified for all the temperatures and development times the mortality rates will be estimated by means of a simple statistical analysis that is detailed in a2 the ratio between the death probability and the development time in each stage increases as the temperature increases see table a2 this is so because development times are shorter at temperatures close to 35 c than at temperatures close to 20 c and also because there is a higher probability of death in the region near 35 c than in the region near 20 c schofield 1982 working as we did to design the development function and following the same criteria we use table a2 to model the mortality function death i t xc for nymphs with i ni nii nv fig 2 exhibits the values in table a2 for the first nymphal stage together with the fit of the proposed death ni function this figure shows that there is an increase in the mortality rate below 15 c and that the curves corresponding to different values of xc converge to a single black solid curve at 10 c the reason is that there is no development of the nymphal stage below 15 c and no blood ingestion below 10 c then there is a single curve below this last temperature corresponding to the no development xc 0 case the xc 0 mortality rate is assumed to be almost constant in the temperature domain shown in fig 2a where we take it to be equal to the value obtained from a study carried out at room temperature between 20 and 26 c approximately to determine the number of days the nymphs of stage i survive under starvation conditions perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 the mortality rate above 28 c increases with the temperature and blood intake this is in part because the development times are shorter above 30 c and the mortality rate is the proportion of dead nymphs over the development duration development times are also shorter when blood intake is greater so that the mortality function is higher at these ingestion levels the dotted curve in fig 2a corresponds to the mortality rate for the development limit at low intake that is when xc 0 20 at lower intake values the nymph does not develop so in the absence of data it is assumed that the mortality is the same as for zero ingestion black curve fig 2b shows the mortality function over a wider range of temperatures where abrupt changes in mortality are observed for temperatures below 0 c and above 38 c the proposed mortality function is given by eq 2 the parameters values of this equation are detailed in table sm1 2 d e a t h i t x c 1 f t a i b i log h x c 1 exp β 1 i 13 t β 2 i 1 exp α 1 i α 2 i log h x c t t i with f t 1 1 exp t 1 8 1 exp 1 5 t 42 and h x c x c θ x c 0 2 ε the units of eq 2 are c for the temperature t and day 1 for the death i function to understand this note that the mortality function was built starting from fits to experimental values that were each calculated as the ratio between the number of bugs that died in a given stage and the length of that stage if we measure this length in days the function has automatically units of 1 day eq 2 is of the form 1 f xc t where f is a positive function for t 10 c 43 c and vanishingly small for other values in the t domain as shown in fig 2b the functional form within the brackets in eq 2 is chosen as a ratio of two functions because the constant xc curves intersect each other at about t 28 c while f t cancels the second term in eq 2 in the regions of lethal daily mean temperatures 1 c and 43 c so that death i 1 there as for the parameters ai determines the vertical position of the entire curve corresponding to xc 1 0 red curve bi is associated with the distance between any curve at constant intake and the curve at maximum intake for example in fig 2a the separation of the yellow blue and black curves with respect to the red curve bi increases with the separation between curves the position of the curve for zero development solid black curve is determined by the value of β2i this parameter determines the rate of convergence towards the zero development curve in the region of 10 c 15 c the convergence being faster for larger values of β1i moreover α1i determines the growth rate of all the curves from 20 c to 40 c but without modifying the maximum intake curve therefore α2i and ti determine the position and change of shape of the curves corresponding to an intake xc 1 with respect to the curve for xc 1 in the region of 26 30 c in fig 2a this displacement of the curves occurs at about 28 c all parameters have been determined by a least squares fit finally we set h xc xc for xc 0 20 and h xc ε for xc 0 20 the small constant ε 10 8 was introduced to avoid an indetermination in the function f figure sm2 shows the mortality function for nymphs ii iii iv and v together with the experimental values obtained from publications referenced in fig 2 2 2 adult bugs 2 2 1 male female composition according to various authors the proportion of adult males and females tends to be homogeneous rabinovich for example determines an average composition of 55 9 of females and 44 1 of males at the time of emergence from their previous stage rabinovich 1972 perlowagora szumlewicz p s 1975 finds a composition of 55 3 of females and 44 7 of males di iorio 2017 observes 47 2 of females and 52 8 of males we can therefore consider that when stage v nymphs make the last molt 50 enter the adult female population and 50 enter the adult male population 2 2 2 female blood ingestion most strains of adult male and female t infestans ingest less blood than nymphs v perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 schofield 1982 although in some cases the opposite is observed in females catalá et al 1992 females that have started fertilizing eggs ingest more blood than virgin females canale 1985 and the number of fertilized eggs depends among other factors on the amount of blood ingested by adult females schofield 1982 j nattero 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 it is therefore convenient to develop a function that describes the maximum blood intake by females i e when xc 1 we call this function cmax fem t fig 3 shows experimental values of average daily blood intake by females together with the proposed cmax fem function as mentioned above the blood intake also depends on the t infestans strain given that the amount of blood ingested by females is along with egg fecundity a factor that directly influences the future size of the colony we introduce a parameter γ that accounts for the different feeding capacities of the various strains the proposed cmax fem function is given by 3 c m a x f e m t 8 5 γ 1 exp 0 8 16 t 1 exp 0 65 t 36 where t is in c and cmax fem in mg blood day this function is plotted in fig 3 red curve for γ 1 it can be interpreted as the amount of blood a female ingests on average per day if it is in a habitat such that it can feed weekly until sated if instead there are limitations on the amount of blood that can be obtained then the ingestion will be smaller and equal to xc cmax fem t the parameter γ changes only the amplitude of cmax fem the coefficients in eq 3 have been determined by a least squares fit 2 2 3 adult mortality rates to determine the mortality rates in adult bugs we work as we did with nymphs with the difference that now these rates are calculated over the duration of adulthood that is from the fifth molt until the death of the bug in fig 4 we plot experimental values for the mortality rate of female bugs at different temperatures and blood ingestion levels the proposed fit for the female mortality function death fem t xc is also included and is detailed in eq 4 because there is little information about the male mortality rates perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 rabinovich 1972 we will use the same mortality function as for females but multiplied by a constant death male t xc δ death fem t xc from rabinovich 1972 we set δ 0 63 for 0 c t 40 c which means that males have a longer life expectancy than females the mortality rate functions for adult bugs are given by 4 d e a t h f e m t x c 1 f t 0 9918 0 00123 log x c 1 exp 2 13 t 0 002 1 exp 0 31 t 45 with f t 1 1 exp t 2 1 exp 1 5 t 42 and 5 d e a t h m a l e t x c δ d e a t h f e m t x c with δ 0 63 if 0 t 40 and δ 1 otherwise where t is in c and death i in day 1 eqs 4 and 5 are similar to eq 2 but simpler the minimum intake threshold is not present for adult bugs because there are no future molts in adulthood this implies that the function h xc that appears in eq 2 is no longer necessary below 10 c and above 37 c death fem and death male are similar to the nymph mortality functions see fig 2b like the previous equations coefficients of eq 4 were determined by a least squares fit 2 3 eggs there are three factors that influence egg production and development fecundity maturation and fertility fecundity is the number of eggs a female produces which depends on the amount of blood it ingests in the adulthood and on the strain of t infestans dale 1978 schofield 1982 nattero et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 maturation is the time necessary for the newly laid egg to develop until it hatches which depends on the environment temperature hack 1955 juarez 1970 rabinovich 1972 schofield 1982 canale 1985 lazzari 1991 fertility is the percentage of eggs that finally hatch which depends mainly on the temperature humidity and strain of t infestans clark 1935 hack 1955 juarez 1970 schofield 1982 gorla and schofield 1985 canale 1985 nattero et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 parasites and egg predators such as arthropods may also decrease the number of hatching eggs gorla and schofield 1985 2 3 1 fecundity according to perlowagora szumlewicz 1975 fecundity of female insects that are found in their natural habitat is higher than fecundity of females found in laboratories in that study oviposition was examined over four years and it was observed that although blood intake varied little 4 oviposition was reduced by half after the four years this phenomenon can also be seen if fecundity measurements are compared between field and laboratory experiments among the publications describing laboratory experiments the highest recorded fecundity we found is that of dale 1978 which is approximately 2 5 eggs per day for a weekly meal in other publications this number is smaller and in some cases less than unity schofield 1982 to design the fecundity function fec t we first work with schofield s data schofield 1982 to determine the temperature dependence according to that paper in the region near 35 c blood intake decreases see fig 3 but the amount of oviposition varies very little so that the fecundity function is higher at this temperature than for lower temperatures 22 32 c then we introduce a parameter λ as we did with γ for female blood intake to describe the dependence of fecundity on strain for schofield 1982 λ 1 and for other experiments it usually takes values higher than 1 the numbers of fertilized eggs per milligram of blood ingested taken from four publications are plotted in fig 5 for various temperatures a least squares fit of the proposed functional form for the fecundity function fec t is also plotted this function is given by 6 f e c t 0 04 λ 1 exp 1 5 t 39 5 1 1 exp 1 2 19 5 t 1 1 exp 0 7 35 t where t has units of c and fec t units of egg number mg blood 2 3 2 maturation as mentioned earlier the maturation time is the time it takes for an egg to develop from its oviposition until the moment when a first stage nymph emerges this time depends only on the environment temperature and this dependence is similar in other species clark 1935 rabinovich et al 2006 according to these authors in the range from 27 c to 33 c this time is a minimum and below 16 c and above 35 c eggs do not hatch clark observed that above 35 c the outer egg wall hardens and the first stage nymph cannot emerge clark 1935 the maturation time will be fitted with the maturation function mat t for its design we considered fit functions proposed by clark 1935 and rabinovich et al 2006 for r prolixus and t guasayana respectively and we also take experimental values of t infestans from other sources rabinovich 1972 juarez 1970 lazzari 1991 r p 2000 rabinovich et al 2006 we considered results for other species because the experimental values available for t infestans are for a restricted temperature domain 25 c to 30 c these values and functions are plotted in sm fig 3 see sm3 the procedure to determine the mat function is as follows 1 from the models of the maturation function for other species it is found that a quadratic function is a good approximation 2 the parameters are chosen so that the function passes through the values of juarez 1970 since two experimental values at 25 c and 30 c are available from this publication 3 applying a least squares fit with all experimental values we determine the vertical position of the proposed function this function is given by 7 m a t t 0 24 t 33 2 12 for 16 t 35 it can be seen from fig sm3 that according to the proposed mat function the minimum development time occurs at 33 c and is equal to 12 days and that the maximum development time is between 16 and 17 c and is about 80 days this last time is an estimate since there are no data on the maturation of t infestans eggs at these temperatures note that the growth range for eggs is narrower than that for nymphs up to 35 c instead of 43 c due to the previously described hardness of the egg wall at high temperatures for temperatures lower than 16 c no maturation occurs the maturation time could be taken to be infinite based on the above mentioned models for the eggs of other species and because the variation in growth times is not as abrupt at low temperatures as it is for nymphs in eq 7 we choose a quadratic function for the egg maturation time 2 3 3 fertility fertility is the percentage of eggs that hatch after maturation the most complete study we found on how fertility varies with temperature and humidity is clark 1935 which focused on r prolixus this author observed that between 16 c and 34 c eggs hatch normally and that outside this temperature range fertility is zero an abrupt jump from 15 c to 16 c can be seen in fig 6 going from 0 fertility total egg mortality to 100 fertility he also observed that 100 fertility is only possible between 16 c and 32 c between 32 c and 34 c fertility decreases humidity was also considered in this publication and it was found that for humidity in the range 55 95 fertility is optimal in the region of the most favorable temperatures roca and lazzari observed no significant differences on t infestans egg hatching percentage for a big range of humidity values roca 1994 for this reason we design a fertility function that only depends on the temperature considering what was observed in clark 1935 and the experimental values for t infestans fertility presented in fig 6 the fit of the fertility function fer t is performed following the same three steps used to determine the maturation function the fer t function is given by 8 f e r t 0 85 σ 1 exp 0 3 13 t 1 exp 1 4 t 31 5 for t 15 0 for t 15 where t has units of c and fer is unitless a parameter σ was introduced in eq 8 to account for the fact that parasitoids and arthropods are usually present in chicken coops and are sometimes the cause of many egg deaths gorla and schofield 1985 cecere et al 2003 this parameter takes values between 0 and 1 depending on the eggs environment if no egg predators are present σ 1 the coefficients in eq 8 have been determined by a least squares fit 2 4 enviromental aspects 2 4 1 outdoor and indoor temperatures the outdoor temperature we consider is the average daily temperature which in the north of argentina can be described approximately by the equation 9 t o u t t a cos 2 π t 365 b where a and b are constants that depend on geographic conditions t is the day of the year and t out has units of c from eq 9 it is observed that december 31 is the hottest day of the year which is consistent with the measurements of the country s national meteorological service smn 2018 the temperature inside a rural chicken coop differs by a few degrees from the outside temperature both in winter and in summer this phenomenon was studied in gorla 1983 and it was determined that there is a linear relationship between both temperatures given by the following function 10 t t o u t 0 71 t o u t 8 52 c this implies that if the outside temperature is less more than 29 c then the temperature inside the chicken coop will be higher lower than that outside this temperature difference has a positive effect on the triatomine s life cycle for example if t out 15 c then t 19 2 c which is a suitable temperature for the eggs to develop while at 15 c there would be no development 2 4 2 predation mortality t infestans is an excellent competitor capable of displacing other triatomines probably due to its efficient feeding pereira et al 2006 this ability to compete extends to intraspecific competition which is characterized by multiple factors such as shelter arrival order zacharias et al 2017 dispersal pattern hernandez 2013 density dependence and medium heterogeneity which leads to nonequivalent refuges lardeux 2013 predator skill etc it is also relevant that adults may emit territorial signals that affect nymph activity abrahan et al 2018 therefore not all insects will reach the same levels of blood intake in a chicken coop the triatomine s blood intake is limited by the access to the hen and by the success in the blood meal since the bite causes irritation in the hen taylor et al 2016 in fact this irritation is what limits the number of insects that can access the blood meal according to bar et al 1994 the stage with the highest predation mortality by the hen is the first in this study it is reported that 63 of nymphs i die and that 93 of this percentage that is 59 of total nymphs i is due exclusively to predation in the four upper stages and in adulthood these values decrease considerably with the average mortality being close to 17 and of this percentage 24 is due to predation this means that on average only 4 of the triatomines beyond the first stage die by predation schweigmann schweigmann et al 1995 studied how many third and fifth stage nymphs and how many adult bugs manage to feed while being in a cage with a chicken overnight this experiment was performed 6 times with 40 nymphs and twice with 20 adults at a time in the first case of the total of 240 nymphs 192 80 survived but only 119 managed to feed themselves 49 6 of the initial 240 the main causes of death were trampling by chickens and to a lesser extent being eaten by the birds as for adults of the 40 that were used 33 survived 82 5 and 24 managed to feed 60 of the initial 40 a greater success rate was observed in adults although the experiments are not comparable since they involve different numbers of insects we note that experimental populations were small compared to real populations in rural chicken coops in some cases up to 3000 insects per coop were observed cecere et al 2003 taking the nymphs as a reference since a greater number of them were used in each experiment we can thus assume that 20 daily bites is a lower bound for k the maximum number of daily bites that a chicken tolerates considering these data we use the following assumptions to build the model ø there are three possible blood intake groups g 1 g 2 and g 3 g 1 is the high level intake group xc 1 0 5 g 2 is the low level intake group 0 xc 2 0 5 and g 3 is the no intake group xc 3 0 the value of k determines the joint size of g 1 and g 2 here g z denotes both group z and its size ø when the total number m of triatomines is less than g 1 then they all belong to g 1 if their number is greater than g 1 the surplus number m g 1 will enter g 2 until m g 1 g 2 if m g 1 g 2 the remainder will go to g 3 ø a nymph that belongs to one of the three intake groups will continue belonging to that group when moving to the next stage ø the no intake group consists only of first stage nymphs since the upper stage nymphs have already taken a blood meal at least once otherwise they could not have entered the upper stages these first stage nymphs will appear when group g 2 is full ø the mortality rate for the no intake group is equal to the death ni t 0 function plus a constant d1 which is large due to the high predation suffered by this group this constant depends on the experiment itself ø the mortality rate for triatomines that ingest blood is equal to the mortality function which depends on their blood intake and the temperature plus a constant due to predation by the birds for nymphal stages i ii and iii this constant is d2 regardless of whether blood ingestion is moderate or high for stages iv v and adults that constant is d3 as expected d1 d2 d3 since the predation probability decreases as the nymph passes to the next stage these parameters depend on the experiment ø since eqs 1 6 were all designed starting from experimental data for which the feeding frequency was always weekly to compare our model with gorla s data we assume that the feeding of the triatomines inside the chicken coop is also weekly on average therefore the total number of individuals that take blood from each hen is equal to 7 k k is the maximum number of daily bites 2 4 3 average calculations when the development time for a nymphal stage is determined by means of the dev i t xc function see eq 1 it is clear that if the blood intake and the temperature remain constant as it could happen in a laboratory experiment then the development time remains constant over time t however in cases where at least one of these two variables depends on time the development time for the nymphal stage in question will also vary over time for example if the temperature increases monotonically from day to day the development time will in general get shorter see fig 1 in this way the nymphs that just enter a stage say at t ta will develop faster and faster until they enter the next stage at t tb for a time that will be between the value of the dev function corresponding to day ta and its value at tb to calculate this final development time given by tb ta a daily average of the values that the dev function takes is performed until the condition that this average is less than or equal to t ta is fulfilled in this case t is always the present day when the algorithm is computing once this condition is reached the development time will be equal to tb ta if for any of the days in which the calculations are performed there is no development for example if the temperature is below 15 c so for that day the dev function does not contribute thus if there are m days with zero development the time to be considered in the average is tb ta m the average functions for development and maturation are described in a3 see eqs a1 and a2 we also define a development operator u z i t eqs a3 and a4 which gives the number of individuals in the stage i and ingestion group z that survived and completed the development and are ready to enter the stage i 1 at time t 2 5 system of equations the eight model equations are as follow 11 egg t δ t egg t egg t deat h egg t δ t z fem t z x c z cmax t δ t fec t u egg t z 12 ni t δ t ni t z u egg t z ni t z deat

in terms of the populations at time t each equation contains the information necessary to determine the number of individuals in the corresponding stage of life based on time of the year temperature and food the parameter μ in the last two equations represents the percentage of females that emerge from the fifth nymphal stage and 1 μ the percentage of males as mentioned earlier we choose a homogeneous composition of females and males μ 0 5 in fig 7 a conceptual diagram of our model is shown in order to visualize eqs 11 18 3 results to test the complete model we first used experimental field work carried out in 1985 by d gorla gorla and schofield 1985 who has given us detailed information about it the experiment consisted of studying the population evolution of various colonies of t infestans that lived in rural chicken coops for three years then based on the parameters used in the model to simulate the aforementioned experiment we determine the limit conditions of the annual temperature and blood ingestion by a colony of triatomines to thrive in a chicken coop 3 1 gorla 1985 this experiment was carried out in the town of huascha located in a rural region of the province of córdoba argentina six chicken coops were built two hens were introduced in each of three of them and four hens in each of the other three an initial population of 304 individuals including eggs of t infestans was also introduced per chicken coop with a composition given by 116 eggs 82 nymphs i 48 nymphs ii 16 nymphs iii 11 nymphs iv 19 nymphs v 6 females and 6 males the parameters we choose are given in table 3 we consider average blood level intakes of xc 1 0 8 and xc 2 0 4 for the high and low ingestion groups respectively xc 1 0 8 as a representative value for the range 0 6 xc 1 0 and xc 2 0 4 as a representative value for the range 0 2 xc 0 6 the sizes of the two ingestion groups g 1 and g 2 and the parameters d1 d2 d3 and σ are determined by an optimization algorithm this algorithm compares gorla s values with a very large number of model runs measuring the difference between these values using a relative least squares method thus the chosen six parameter set g 1 g 2 d1 d2 d3 σ is the one that generates the minimum computed difference as for the other parameters we assume that γ 1 since no information about blood intake is available the determination of λ is detailed in a4 and the maximum number of daily btes is given by k g 1 g 2 7 see subsection 2 4 2 the experiment began in middle march 1981 day 75 of the year and lasted approximately three years with an average annual temperature of 19 c and an amplitude of 6 c parameters b and a of eq 9 respectively the temperature correction inside the chicken coop is taken into account using eq 10 figs 8 and 9 compare gorla s results for n 2 two hens per chicken coop with those of the model figures sm4 and sm5 show the comparison for n 4 in the case n 2 the general behavior of the model is similar to that of the three chicken coops with the exception of a few months for the chicken coop represented by the dotted line whose evolution is considerably different from that of the other coops a slight growth in the egg population is observed at the beginning of each spring and then a larger one at the end of summer see fig 8 then nymphs i arise in some cases of the experiment at the end of summer or else during the fall as it is the case with the model most of these nymphs die because they fail to feed and also because the temperature begins to be unfavorable for their development since in mid autumn it is about 24 c inside the chicken coops eqs 9 and 10 and drops to 22 c in late autumn in this temperature range the development time begins to increase see fig 1 this results in less than half of the nymphs i moving on to the next stage as shown in fig 8 the population behavior of nymphs ii and iii is more irregular than that of eggs and other stages in the model there is an annual peak during the spring for these two stages and then a lower but wider one during the first half of the next year while in the experiment it is observed that already for the third year there are long lasting peaks during the first half of the year for nymphs iv fig 9 the trend begins to be more stable with a higher peak at the end of the year and again a lower and longer one in the autumn this is observed in good detail between the second and third years for nymphs v these two peaks are no longer observed since they overlap resulting in a single peak which in the model occurs at the beginning of the year and in gorla s experiment at the end of the previous year this can be seen clearly in the chicken coop represented by dotted lines which had the largest growth this overlap between the two peaks occurs because the development time of nymphs v is longer than that of all the predecessor stages so that nymphs v emerging from the two nymph iv peaks merge at the end of the summer see table 2 finally there is in the model a strong emergence of males and females during summer and autumn and from winter the populations decrease until the last months of the year similar behavior is observed in the chicken coop described by dotted lines and also in the other two coops but where growth begins earlier in spring see third year from our discussion here and in the sm it can be seen that in general for all stages in both cases n 2 and n 4 there are more similarities between the model and the experiment during the third year we believe that this is due to the time it takes for populations to stabilize which may be different in the model and in the experiment since in the latter there are small natural fluctuations that are not covered by the model in subsection 3 3 we analyze the time required to stabilize the model populations 3 2 population details the population growth in the model for n 2 and n 4 is completely stabilized in annual periods after the sixth year although the general tendency is already evident after three years fig 10 shows the evolution of all populations for eight years for a four hen chicken coop this situation is satisfied as expected provided that the chicken coop is a closed system where triatomines do not enter or leave and can be censored the periodically stable egg population has a large peak in the first half of each year and then a tiny one in the second half the populations of nymphs ii iii and iv have also two annual peaks one high and narrow and the other lower but of longer duration finally the stable populations of nymphs i and v and of adult males and females have a single annual peak that lasts about six months except for that of nymphs v that lasts only three months the existence of a group with a high level of blood intake g 1 is important for the colony even if this group is composed only of a few individuals for the following reason if a nymph i manages to obtain high intake blood meals particularly when xc 1 0 7 it will have higher chances of moving on to the next stage and continue feeding under this regime see subsection 2 4 2 at the same time nymphs in the low intake group g 2 will keep taking a low amount of blood in their future stages xc 2 0 5 as a result nymphs in g 1 have a higher probability to get to adulthood and there will be a greater number of adult bugs in group g 1 than in group g 2 since fertility increases with blood ingestion it is expected that the highest number of eggs laid come from group g 1 in other words although the number of nymphs i in group g 1 is five times smaller than that in group g 2 the former acquires a much more important role for the survival of the colony fig 11 shows the populations of nymphs i and females for both intake groups and n 4 3 3 limit temperatures after determining the model parameters that describe the development of triatomines under conditions similar to those used by d gorla we now search for the upper and lower limits of outside temperature for which a t infestans colony can develop only the environment temperature is modified and the other parameters and initial conditions remain the same as those used in the previous subsection for simplicity the total size of the colony nymphs and adults is plotted without considering eggs we only consider the case n 4 in fig sm6 see sm4 this total population is plotted for the temperature parameters used in the previous subsection a 6 c and b 19 c see eqs 9 and 10 we observe that the most important parameter for the colony survival is the annual mean temperature b and to a lesser extent the oscillation amplitude a for example if b 16 c for any reasonable amplitude between 4 c and 10 c the colony does not survive if on the other hand b 17 c the colony only survives if a 6 c in fig 12 these two situations are plotted 1 a 5 c and b 16 c 2 a 5 c and b 17 c case 2 is not viable for permanent development since a fluctuation such that the amplitude in a given year exceeds 5 c may kill the population during the winter perhaps with a few triatomines remaining the largest and most stable population for reasonable parameters a and b occurs when a 5 c and b 24 c for a 5 c and b 24 c the population continues to be large but undergoes more pronounced seasonal variations see fig sm7 for higher values of b the stable population is lower until it reaches its minimum for b 31 c if a 8 c if 8 c a 10 c b 29 c see fig 13 3 4 minimum blood intake next we investigate the minimum values of blood ingestion that ensure the colony survival we will consider the same parameters as in table 3 but will introduce some simplifications to generate a clearer prediction the chicken coop has only one hen n 1 and at first there is no high intake group g 1 0 and the low intake group is g 2 188 which is the total initial number of nymphs and adult bugs by relaxing the value of the xc 2 threshold which was previously taken equal to 0 5 we will determine the minimum level of blood ingestion in this group xc 2 for which the population does not go extinct for a value of xc 2 0 56 after a transitory the total average population decreases continuously while for xc 2 0 56 the population reaches stable seasonal oscillations fig 14 shows these situations for xc 2 0 55 and xc 2 0 57 this implies that for the survival of the colony the value xc 0 2 necessary for a nymph to move to the next stage see subsection 2 1 2 is not enough climate influences development times and mortality rates so it is not surprising that for a nymph i to reach adulthood a blood intake greater than xc 0 2 is needed the condition xc 2 0 56 is necessary only when there is no other intake class when the high intake group g 1 is present with a few triatomines the situation changes in a very positive way for the colony since these few individuals generate an increase of the oviposition and this compensates for the deaths of the triatomines from the low intake group g 2 this situation can be clearly seen in fig 15 where the triatomine population is plotted for two cases one with xc 1 0 and xc 2 0 50 g 2 188 yielding population extinction and the other with xc 1 0 90 and g 1 10 5 of the colony and xc 2 0 50 and g 2 178 in which the colony is established and survives figure sm8 shows the female populations by intake group for the same two cases when the high intake group with 10 triatomines is introduced g 1 10 there is a single adult female with this ingestion level while the lower intake group with a large number of triatomines g 2 178 has a maximum of five females these five females yield a 70 of total oviposition while the only female in the high intake group is responsible for the remaining 30 of oviposition 4 discussion the model that we have proposed allows us to describe the evolution of a colony of t infestans within a chicken coop the eggs all nymphal stages and the adult phase of the bugs have been considered for each of these stages functions have been developed that describe the most important aspects of their growth development times mortality rates fecundity egg maturation and fertility see eqs 1 8 these functions have the advantage that they are continuous and that they have been designed for a complete domain of temperatures and blood intake levels this permits its use in other models that simulate different scenarios both in laboratories with constant or variable temperatures and in rural chicken coops and other structures with variable temperatures details of the environment that influence the life of triatomines have also been considered the temperature difference between the chicken coop and the outside studied in gorla 1983 is very important eq 10 particularly in cold times of the year because it allows the colony to develop in peridomestic structures when the outside temperature is insufficient by means of our model we observe that for regions of low thermal amplitude a 6 c in eq 9 an average daily outdoor temperature of 12 c for the coldest day of the year is the lowest limit of temperature for which the colony can survive subsection 3 3 although for an outside temperature of about 11 c eq 10 gives an interior temperature of 16 c at which nymphs can feed and molt it is not enough for the survival of the colony since the mortality rates and development times as a whole are so unfavorable at 16 c that they cause the colony to become extinct over the years we remark that in our model we use a temperature that is a function of smooth daily variation eq 9 and involves a daily average of the temperature records this does not preclude that t infestans can be found in rural regions with low thermal amplitude where temperature minima well below 12 c may occur in the early morning hours or even that for a few days the average daily temperature may fall below 12 c what our model shows is that when considering a fit using smooth temperature variations throughout a year average values below 12 c would eventually lead to colony extinction we also observe that for regions with an average annual temperature below 16 c regardless of the temperature range the colony does not survive either from fig 13 we see that average yearly temperatures above about 32 c are generally not favorable for t infestans especially if seasonal temperature variations are strong the increase in the average yearly temperatures that accompanies climactic change is thus likely to shift southward the geographic region where t infestans thrives the low temperature threshold 16 c predicted by our model agrees with the current geographical distribution of t infestans in argentina where the insect is found in the central and northern regions of the country but not in the south galvão et al 2003 being the mean annual temperature that separates the southern and central regions equal to approximately 15 c although this last result cannot be derived from our small scale model it is reassuring that it agrees with its outcome since peridomestic structures mainly chicken coops are the main reason for the persistence of t infestans in the grand chaco region and perhaps beyond the main features of individual chicken coop populations there should have a strong influence on triatomine populations on a bigger scale although the results cannot be automatically extrapolated on account of the mobility of the bugs and their finding of refuge in other structures the model can be used as a steppingstone to a more general formulation the model also considers the relationship between the feeding of the colony and its development as an approximation and for simplicity we have considered that each triatomine from the colony belongs to the same blood intake group high low or no intake throughout its life according to bar bar et al 1994 and cecere cecere et al 2003 the refuge chosen by the triatomines considerably influences their chances since a good refuge minimizes the risks to feed by reducing the distance that the insect must travel to the source of food this approach also considers that the group with no intake g 3 is made up only of nymphs of the first stage since by not feeding they are unable to pass to the second nymphal stage in addition these nymphs have the highest predation mortality rate of all stages so it is to be expected that there will be a high decrease in the number of nymphs ii in relation to nymphs i in contrast to the moderate decrease that occurs in higher stages which is verified experimentally bar et al 1994 cecere et al 2003 when working with blood intake groups the model allows estimating how feeding regulates the colony size we observed that it is enough for a few triatomines to have a high level of blood intake in order to stabilize the population gorla gorla 1992 observed that at low triatomine densities after the application of insecticide for vector control if this insecticide is applied in the hottest months of the year it is enough that a few bugs survive for the colony not to become extinct but if it is applied in the colder months instead the probability of extinction increases considerably although our model does not explicitly describe the application of insecticide we observe that what has been studied by gorla can be explained from fig sm9 since a single female that manages to feed well may be enough for the colony to survive if this female or a small number of them survives the spraying in summer a good meal would lead to abundant oviposition not only because of the blood intake but also due to the favorable temperature see fig 5 but if instead the above occurs in winter fertility would not only be affected by temperature but also by the volume of blood intake see fig 3 regardless of whether a high value for xc 1 is being considered oviposition is expected to be low another result is the great difference in the number of triatomines that reach adulthood in g 1 and g 2 this can be seen in fig 11 where for an intake level of xc 1 0 8 10 of the triatomines in this group are females while for group g 2 with xc 2 0 4 only 1 7 is made up of females and in turn this 1 7 is stable due to the females of the high intake group g 1 since we observe that for xc 0 56 the colony does not survive unless there is another group of triatomines with a higher intake level subsection3 4 if this required group has an intake level of xc 0 9 we find that it must contain a fraction of 5 or higher of the colony to guarantee its preservation it is thus essential for the colony that at least a few triatomines get abundant meals regarding the limitations of our model working with a closed system does not allow modeling the entry and exit of adult bugs these may rise in flight when food is scarce lehane et al 1992 ceballos et al 2005 gurevitz et al 2006 abrahan et al 2016 leading to the colonization of new spaces however if all the bugs in a closed system manage to feed they are not expected to seek to leave the colony in this case the colony is strong and it is unlikely that other bugs will try to settle in the coop extensions to the macro scale suitable for the conditions in chile canals et al 2017 ayala et al 2019 and colombia cordovez et al 2014 have already been proposed these extensions account for climatic influences and predict chagas incidence for instance through calculations of the reproductive number r0 we note two important differences between the subjects of these publications and the grand chaco case chile has been able to eliminate the vectorial transmission of chagas since 1999 and in colombia the main chagas vector is rhodnius prolixus not t infestans it is also relevant that this type of model has also been developed for malaria parham 2010 a different problem arises if chagas is favored by the domiciliation of sylvatic vector species a case that may be investigated with the use of agent based models el saadi 2020 5 conclusion we have developed a discrete equation model to describe all the stages of a population of t infestans in a chicken coop a typical peridomestic structure that has allowed the bug to survive in the grand chaco region in spite of strenuous eradication campaigns the parameter values were taken from experimental results which were used to validate the model the dependence on the temperature and feeding ability were analyzed carefully and we found the minimum conditions of temperature and food availability required for the survival of a t infestans colony the model which is valid over the whole temperature range where the triatomine is viable can be easily adapted to an open system considering the interaction with triatomines inhabiting other rural dwelling structures credit authorship

24543,despite the strenuous efforts devoted to its elimination chagas disease is still prevalent in large regions of latin america its main vector triatoma infestans kissing bug feeds on people and domestic animals and finds refuge in the peripheral structures of rural and semi rural houses here we propose a mathematical model based on discrete time equations that describe the evolution of the populations of all the stages of t infestans residing in a chicken coop a typical bug reservoir in non urban habitats the chicken coop has also been used as a suitable location for observations of t infestans populations under realistic controlled conditions the variables that govern the model are the time of the year the temperature and the blood intake by the triatomines using the available data we design fitting functions such as maximum blood intake development time mortality rate egg fertility etc for each population group then we validate our model using d gorla s experimental work on t infestans populations finally we analyze the minimum conditions of temperature and food availability necessary for the survival of t infestans showing that average daily temperatures below 12 c or average yearly temperatures below 16 c or above 32 c lead to colony extinction feeding also regulates the colony size and we find that if a few triatomines 5 of the colony are well fed and the rest occasionally get a meager meal the colony size can be on average constant over the years by quantifying what happens in structures crucial to the species survival our model is an important step forward towards the formulation of a general population model for t infestans in the grand chaco under current conditions keywords kissing bug triatoma infestans population dynamics chagas disease 1 introduction chagas disease whose causative agent is the protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi is endemic to large regions of latin america where the total exposed population is estimated at 60 million the main vector responsible for the transmission of this parasite is arguably the blood sucking insect triatoma infestans which can be found in urban rural and wild habitats in many south american countries bustamante et al 2016 the use of insecticides and the improvement in living conditions are the only effective tools for its control gorla et al 2010 moreno et al 2012 gurevitz et al 2013 gorla et al 2015 residual insecticide applications have been successful in decreasing the prevalence of the vector transmitted infections in some regions in particular brazil chile and uruguay have eliminated transmission by t infestans cucunubá et al 2017 however vector control strategies have been hindered by the ability of the insect to find suitable refuges in peridomestic structures such as the corrals and chicken coops that are usually found around rural dwellings in the south american grand chaco region the environmental conditions of these structures reduce the efficacy of the traditional insecticide spraying techniques amelotti et al 2013 as a consequence this vector still presents a serious health and social problem as shown by schofield long ago schofield 1982 blood intake and ambient temperature are the main determinants of t infestans development experimental studies of the influence of climatic and nutritional factors on these populations have been usually carried out using restrained chickens as food sources juarez 1970 rabinovich 1972 schofield 1982 gorla and schofield 1985 it is therefore useful to have a population model that considers the most important factors influencing t infestans populations in all stages of its life cycle in this paper we use the results of studies of t infestans in chicken coops to develop a comprehensive model that incorporates the separate influences of temperature and blood intake on the egg nymphal and adult stages of t infestans we validate the model by applying it to a series of experiments performed by d gorla gorla and schofield 1985 our study can be taken as a necessary starting point for the analysis of the population dynamics of triatominae residing in a rural house and its environs where people and domestic animals live and perpetuate the chagas endemic gürtler et al 1993 the bugs have a life cycle that can last between one and two years depending on the climate and nutritional conditions of the insect canale 1985 and consists of eggs five nymphal stages and adult male and female bugs in sylvatic environments these insects feed by taking blood from mammals and birds in rural regions they feed on the blood of people domestic animals such as cats and dogs and on farmyard animals such as chickens pigs goats etc gürtler et al 1993 cecere et al 1997 gürtler et al 1998 gürtler et al 2014 it has been determined that mammal blood has a higher nutritional content for the triatomines than bird blood guarneri et al 2000 j nattero 2011 but in both cases the nutritional content is sufficient for the development of a colony of t infestans it has also been observed that chagas disease is only suffered by mammals and not by birds since birds are immune to t cruzi minter 1976 however the presence of birds does influence the proliferation of the insect and has an indirect impact on the endemic cecere et al 1997 gürtler 1998 in general the published works on the development and growth of t infestans fed on bird blood have focused on the observation of the insect populations under conditions of constant temperature and feeding frequency rabinovich 1972 guarneri et al 2000 j nattero 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 other works have focused on the influence of temperature joërg 1962 blaksley 1968 juarez 1970 or food hack 1955 perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 dale 1978 on the triatomine life cycle but with the exception of schofield 1982 we know of no experimental works where both situations have been studied simultaneously it is of interest to analyze exhaustively how temperature and food together influence the evolution of a t infestans colony under realistic conditions to do this we propose a mathematical model that describes the life of the insect in a chicken coop in a rural habitat using data from field studies carried out in recent decades this will amplify and complement the information provided by existing models rabinovich 1990 gorla 1992 castañera et al 2003 in the next section we develop and justify the model some details are relegated to the supplementary materials in section 3 we validate the model applying it to the results of various experiments carried out by d gorla section 4 includes a discussion of various aspects of our model and its predictions for the influence of the environmental conditions on the triatomines 2 materials and methods our model consists of eight discrete time equations that describe the populations of the five nymphal stages adult male and female bugs and eggs to better compare the model predictions with the experimental data a closed system is considered bugs are not allowed to either enter or leave the coop initially we determine the most relevant factors that impact on each stage of the triatomine life cycle for this purpose it is convenient to classify all the stages into three groups nymphs adult bugs and eggs the information collected to build the model comes mainly from lab work and to a lesser extent from field work in all cases chickens were used to feed the triatomines the model is assumed to be valid over the whole temperature range where t infestans is viable but we will use different temperature domains in the figures to show in the clearest possible way the general functional forms and their supporting experimental data which are taken from many sources we will model the following quantities blood intake development times death rates male female composition egg maturation fertility and fecundity 2 1 nymphs 2 1 1 blood intake the relationship between nymph blood intake and temperature has been carefully studied by schofield schofield 1982 and in somewhat less detail by juarez juarez 1970 here we define the maximum blood intake cmax as the amount of blood that a triatomine takes in a meal when left in contact with a restrained hen for a time equal or longer than 30 min because after this time it can be assumed that the insect has already filled its abdomen with blood schofield 1982 the blood take was made weekly as reported in both publications but to simplify the model we will consider daily average values that is the weekly intake divided by 7 between 25 and 30 c cmax takes higher values than for lower or higher temperatures at 45 c the bugs die in less than an hour schofield 1982 although it is not clear up to what maximum temperature they can be effectively fed at the other extreme of temperatures joërg 1962 observed that at 10 c the nymphs stop feeding in juarez 1970 the values of cmax for each nymphal stage are given for 25 and 30 c in schofield 1982 these values are given for 22 27 and 35 c but only for all stages together not for each stage separately however it is possible to estimate cmax for the nymphal stages using a simple criterion detailed in appendices a1 because we work with data from different publications instead of working with the average daily blood intake as an independent variable we consider the fraction of maximum intake xc which is equal to unity if the feeding time is equal to or greater than 30 min see table 1 when blood intake is not complete xc is calculated as the ratio of the amount of blood ingested to the value of cmax at the corresponding temperature this allows us to incorporate data from other publications rabinovich 1972 guarneri et al 2000 where although the amount of ingested blood is not specified it is reported that the meal duration is longer than 30 min so xc 1 from this new variable and the temperature we develop functions describing the nymph development times and mortality rates 2 1 2 development times the development time is the time it takes a nymph newly entered a stadium to move to the next stage table 2 contains the development times obtained from different publications that report experiments where the nymphs were fed weekly with chicken blood except in guarneri et al 2000 where they were fed with pigeon blood the temperature and the blood intake level which we call xc are also detailed in table 2 when the nymphs do not feed xc 0 no development is observed for this reason the null symbol appears in table 2 lack of development not only occurs when there is no blood ingestion it was found that there is a minimum threshold for feeding hack 1955 perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 below which the nymphs remain in their stage for a long time until they die without having made their next molt this threshold value is not known precisely for each stage but from the last two references it can be estimated to be between 10 and 20 of the optimal intake value which would be equivalent to a single short duration blood meal during the stage in the range of 20 c 30 c that is to say the nymph need not be satiated after the ingestion if the meal is complete and the nymph fills its abdomen with blood at least once it is very likely to develop and molt except for second stage nymphs for which the odds of molting are still low j p s 1973 therefore with these considerations a threshold value of 20 of optimal intake has been chosen if xc 0 20 the nymph will not complete its development as shown in table 2 at 10 c nymphs do not ingest blood and do not develop completely joërg 1962 hack 1955 as already mentioned at 45 c the bugs die in less than an hour schofield 1982 so we consider a somewhat lower temperature as the limit for life 43 c there is no detailed information on the nymphal development time in the regions near the critical temperatures 10 c and 43 c for the lower critical region only data for nymphs i at 15 c are available schofield 1982 following a drop in temperature from about 20 c to 15 c the development times grow exponentially reaching more than a year see fig 1 according to catalá 1991 only unfed bugs are observed below 16 5 c in rural houses combining this information with the data of schofield 1982 we set 15 c as the lowest possible temperature for development for the upper critical region only information up to 35 c is available schofield 1982 unlike in the lower critical region here the development times remain practically constant therefore due to the lack of information extrapolation is used to estimate the behavior of the development curves near the upper critical temperature fig 1 shows the development times of nymphal stage i from table 2 as functions of temperature and blood intake level in fig 1 we also include the development function for the first nymphal stage dev ni t xc this function describes nymphal development and we model it as follows first we consider xc 1 the value for which the available dataset is largest and fit a temperature function using least squares red curve in fig 1 we then consider the values xc 0 43 and xc 0 27 and again fit temperature functions for each blood intake level yellow and blue curves in fig 1 respectively but now using the same functional form as for xc 1 finally we analyze the relation between the three curves in order to determine the function dev ni t xc which is given by eq 1 1 de v i t xc α 1 i α 2 i xc exp 0 4 t β 1 i β 2 i xc for 15 t 43 and xc 0 2 with i α1i 104 α2i 104 β1i β2i ni 17 8 7 9 57 3 35 3 nii 18 2 8 4 39 1 16 7 niii 22 3 10 5 35 3 15 9 niv 23 7 10 9 53 3 30 4 nv 52 7 24 4 120 5 68 5 the units of eq 1 are c for the temperature t and days for the dev i function the exponential form suggests itself when we observe the sharp increase of the development time at 15 c and the tail in the t 22 c region eq 1 contains all the available information about the development times of the five nymphal stages as functions of temperature and blood intake for t 15 c or xc 0 2 there is no development so the dev i function is effectively infinite in that domain for t 43 c the nymphs cannot survive if xc 0 2 a linear function provides a suitable description of the decrease in development time with blood intake level the parameters α1i and α2i describe the separation between the exponential curves at different intake levels represented by the red yellow and blue curves in fig 1 lastly parameters β1i and β2i correspond to the y intercept in the high temperature region sm fig 1 sm2 shows the development times for the other nymphal stages for these stages we have no information for development times at 15 c for this reason we use the same exponential coefficient obtained for nymphs i which is equal to 0 4 in eq 1 in any case the development times in this temperature range are so long that it is unlikely that a nymph will complete its development and move on to the next stage 2 1 3 nymph mortality rates nymph mortality is another phenomenon that depends on the temperature and the average blood intake we will use mortality rates which in the case of nymphs are given by the ratio of the percentage of nymphs that die during the development of a stage for a given temperature and feeding time to the duration of this stage two types of mortality percentages are mentioned in schofield 1982 one is the average for all the stages taken together at a fixed temperature and feeding time and the other is the average for one specific stage at a fixed temperature but for all feeding times therefore given that the mortality percentage for each stage has not been specified for all the temperatures and development times the mortality rates will be estimated by means of a simple statistical analysis that is detailed in a2 the ratio between the death probability and the development time in each stage increases as the temperature increases see table a2 this is so because development times are shorter at temperatures close to 35 c than at temperatures close to 20 c and also because there is a higher probability of death in the region near 35 c than in the region near 20 c schofield 1982 working as we did to design the development function and following the same criteria we use table a2 to model the mortality function death i t xc for nymphs with i ni nii nv fig 2 exhibits the values in table a2 for the first nymphal stage together with the fit of the proposed death ni function this figure shows that there is an increase in the mortality rate below 15 c and that the curves corresponding to different values of xc converge to a single black solid curve at 10 c the reason is that there is no development of the nymphal stage below 15 c and no blood ingestion below 10 c then there is a single curve below this last temperature corresponding to the no development xc 0 case the xc 0 mortality rate is assumed to be almost constant in the temperature domain shown in fig 2a where we take it to be equal to the value obtained from a study carried out at room temperature between 20 and 26 c approximately to determine the number of days the nymphs of stage i survive under starvation conditions perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 the mortality rate above 28 c increases with the temperature and blood intake this is in part because the development times are shorter above 30 c and the mortality rate is the proportion of dead nymphs over the development duration development times are also shorter when blood intake is greater so that the mortality function is higher at these ingestion levels the dotted curve in fig 2a corresponds to the mortality rate for the development limit at low intake that is when xc 0 20 at lower intake values the nymph does not develop so in the absence of data it is assumed that the mortality is the same as for zero ingestion black curve fig 2b shows the mortality function over a wider range of temperatures where abrupt changes in mortality are observed for temperatures below 0 c and above 38 c the proposed mortality function is given by eq 2 the parameters values of this equation are detailed in table sm1 2 d e a t h i t x c 1 f t a i b i log h x c 1 exp β 1 i 13 t β 2 i 1 exp α 1 i α 2 i log h x c t t i with f t 1 1 exp t 1 8 1 exp 1 5 t 42 and h x c x c θ x c 0 2 ε the units of eq 2 are c for the temperature t and day 1 for the death i function to understand this note that the mortality function was built starting from fits to experimental values that were each calculated as the ratio between the number of bugs that died in a given stage and the length of that stage if we measure this length in days the function has automatically units of 1 day eq 2 is of the form 1 f xc t where f is a positive function for t 10 c 43 c and vanishingly small for other values in the t domain as shown in fig 2b the functional form within the brackets in eq 2 is chosen as a ratio of two functions because the constant xc curves intersect each other at about t 28 c while f t cancels the second term in eq 2 in the regions of lethal daily mean temperatures 1 c and 43 c so that death i 1 there as for the parameters ai determines the vertical position of the entire curve corresponding to xc 1 0 red curve bi is associated with the distance between any curve at constant intake and the curve at maximum intake for example in fig 2a the separation of the yellow blue and black curves with respect to the red curve bi increases with the separation between curves the position of the curve for zero development solid black curve is determined by the value of β2i this parameter determines the rate of convergence towards the zero development curve in the region of 10 c 15 c the convergence being faster for larger values of β1i moreover α1i determines the growth rate of all the curves from 20 c to 40 c but without modifying the maximum intake curve therefore α2i and ti determine the position and change of shape of the curves corresponding to an intake xc 1 with respect to the curve for xc 1 in the region of 26 30 c in fig 2a this displacement of the curves occurs at about 28 c all parameters have been determined by a least squares fit finally we set h xc xc for xc 0 20 and h xc ε for xc 0 20 the small constant ε 10 8 was introduced to avoid an indetermination in the function f figure sm2 shows the mortality function for nymphs ii iii iv and v together with the experimental values obtained from publications referenced in fig 2 2 2 adult bugs 2 2 1 male female composition according to various authors the proportion of adult males and females tends to be homogeneous rabinovich for example determines an average composition of 55 9 of females and 44 1 of males at the time of emergence from their previous stage rabinovich 1972 perlowagora szumlewicz p s 1975 finds a composition of 55 3 of females and 44 7 of males di iorio 2017 observes 47 2 of females and 52 8 of males we can therefore consider that when stage v nymphs make the last molt 50 enter the adult female population and 50 enter the adult male population 2 2 2 female blood ingestion most strains of adult male and female t infestans ingest less blood than nymphs v perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 schofield 1982 although in some cases the opposite is observed in females catalá et al 1992 females that have started fertilizing eggs ingest more blood than virgin females canale 1985 and the number of fertilized eggs depends among other factors on the amount of blood ingested by adult females schofield 1982 j nattero 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 it is therefore convenient to develop a function that describes the maximum blood intake by females i e when xc 1 we call this function cmax fem t fig 3 shows experimental values of average daily blood intake by females together with the proposed cmax fem function as mentioned above the blood intake also depends on the t infestans strain given that the amount of blood ingested by females is along with egg fecundity a factor that directly influences the future size of the colony we introduce a parameter γ that accounts for the different feeding capacities of the various strains the proposed cmax fem function is given by 3 c m a x f e m t 8 5 γ 1 exp 0 8 16 t 1 exp 0 65 t 36 where t is in c and cmax fem in mg blood day this function is plotted in fig 3 red curve for γ 1 it can be interpreted as the amount of blood a female ingests on average per day if it is in a habitat such that it can feed weekly until sated if instead there are limitations on the amount of blood that can be obtained then the ingestion will be smaller and equal to xc cmax fem t the parameter γ changes only the amplitude of cmax fem the coefficients in eq 3 have been determined by a least squares fit 2 2 3 adult mortality rates to determine the mortality rates in adult bugs we work as we did with nymphs with the difference that now these rates are calculated over the duration of adulthood that is from the fifth molt until the death of the bug in fig 4 we plot experimental values for the mortality rate of female bugs at different temperatures and blood ingestion levels the proposed fit for the female mortality function death fem t xc is also included and is detailed in eq 4 because there is little information about the male mortality rates perlowagora szumlewicz et al 1973 rabinovich 1972 we will use the same mortality function as for females but multiplied by a constant death male t xc δ death fem t xc from rabinovich 1972 we set δ 0 63 for 0 c t 40 c which means that males have a longer life expectancy than females the mortality rate functions for adult bugs are given by 4 d e a t h f e m t x c 1 f t 0 9918 0 00123 log x c 1 exp 2 13 t 0 002 1 exp 0 31 t 45 with f t 1 1 exp t 2 1 exp 1 5 t 42 and 5 d e a t h m a l e t x c δ d e a t h f e m t x c with δ 0 63 if 0 t 40 and δ 1 otherwise where t is in c and death i in day 1 eqs 4 and 5 are similar to eq 2 but simpler the minimum intake threshold is not present for adult bugs because there are no future molts in adulthood this implies that the function h xc that appears in eq 2 is no longer necessary below 10 c and above 37 c death fem and death male are similar to the nymph mortality functions see fig 2b like the previous equations coefficients of eq 4 were determined by a least squares fit 2 3 eggs there are three factors that influence egg production and development fecundity maturation and fertility fecundity is the number of eggs a female produces which depends on the amount of blood it ingests in the adulthood and on the strain of t infestans dale 1978 schofield 1982 nattero et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 maturation is the time necessary for the newly laid egg to develop until it hatches which depends on the environment temperature hack 1955 juarez 1970 rabinovich 1972 schofield 1982 canale 1985 lazzari 1991 fertility is the percentage of eggs that finally hatch which depends mainly on the temperature humidity and strain of t infestans clark 1935 hack 1955 juarez 1970 schofield 1982 gorla and schofield 1985 canale 1985 nattero et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2014 parasites and egg predators such as arthropods may also decrease the number of hatching eggs gorla and schofield 1985 2 3 1 fecundity according to perlowagora szumlewicz 1975 fecundity of female insects that are found in their natural habitat is higher than fecundity of females found in laboratories in that study oviposition was examined over four years and it was observed that although blood intake varied little 4 oviposition was reduced by half after the four years this phenomenon can also be seen if fecundity measurements are compared between field and laboratory experiments among the publications describing laboratory experiments the highest recorded fecundity we found is that of dale 1978 which is approximately 2 5 eggs per day for a weekly meal in other publications this number is smaller and in some cases less than unity schofield 1982 to design the fecundity function fec t we first work with schofield s data schofield 1982 to determine the temperature dependence according to that paper in the region near 35 c blood intake decreases see fig 3 but the amount of oviposition varies very little so that the fecundity function is higher at this temperature than for lower temperatures 22 32 c then we introduce a parameter λ as we did with γ for female blood intake to describe the dependence of fecundity on strain for schofield 1982 λ 1 and for other experiments it usually takes values higher than 1 the numbers of fertilized eggs per milligram of blood ingested taken from four publications are plotted in fig 5 for various temperatures a least squares fit of the proposed functional form for the fecundity function fec t is also plotted this function is given by 6 f e c t 0 04 λ 1 exp 1 5 t 39 5 1 1 exp 1 2 19 5 t 1 1 exp 0 7 35 t where t has units of c and fec t units of egg number mg blood 2 3 2 maturation as mentioned earlier the maturation time is the time it takes for an egg to develop from its oviposition until the moment when a first stage nymph emerges this time depends only on the environment temperature and this dependence is similar in other species clark 1935 rabinovich et al 2006 according to these authors in the range from 27 c to 33 c this time is a minimum and below 16 c and above 35 c eggs do not hatch clark observed that above 35 c the outer egg wall hardens and the first stage nymph cannot emerge clark 1935 the maturation time will be fitted with the maturation function mat t for its design we considered fit functions proposed by clark 1935 and rabinovich et al 2006 for r prolixus and t guasayana respectively and we also take experimental values of t infestans from other sources rabinovich 1972 juarez 1970 lazzari 1991 r p 2000 rabinovich et al 2006 we considered results for other species because the experimental values available for t infestans are for a restricted temperature domain 25 c to 30 c these values and functions are plotted in sm fig 3 see sm3 the procedure to determine the mat function is as follows 1 from the models of the maturation function for other species it is found that a quadratic function is a good approximation 2 the parameters are chosen so that the function passes through the values of juarez 1970 since two experimental values at 25 c and 30 c are available from this publication 3 applying a least squares fit with all experimental values we determine the vertical position of the proposed function this function is given by 7 m a t t 0 24 t 33 2 12 for 16 t 35 it can be seen from fig sm3 that according to the proposed mat function the minimum development time occurs at 33 c and is equal to 12 days and that the maximum development time is between 16 and 17 c and is about 80 days this last time is an estimate since there are no data on the maturation of t infestans eggs at these temperatures note that the growth range for eggs is narrower than that for nymphs up to 35 c instead of 43 c due to the previously described hardness of the egg wall at high temperatures for temperatures lower than 16 c no maturation occurs the maturation time could be taken to be infinite based on the above mentioned models for the eggs of other species and because the variation in growth times is not as abrupt at low temperatures as it is for nymphs in eq 7 we choose a quadratic function for the egg maturation time 2 3 3 fertility fertility is the percentage of eggs that hatch after maturation the most complete study we found on how fertility varies with temperature and humidity is clark 1935 which focused on r prolixus this author observed that between 16 c and 34 c eggs hatch normally and that outside this temperature range fertility is zero an abrupt jump from 15 c to 16 c can be seen in fig 6 going from 0 fertility total egg mortality to 100 fertility he also observed that 100 fertility is only possible between 16 c and 32 c between 32 c and 34 c fertility decreases humidity was also considered in this publication and it was found that for humidity in the range 55 95 fertility is optimal in the region of the most favorable temperatures roca and lazzari observed no significant differences on t infestans egg hatching percentage for a big range of humidity values roca 1994 for this reason we design a fertility function that only depends on the temperature considering what was observed in clark 1935 and the experimental values for t infestans fertility presented in fig 6 the fit of the fertility function fer t is performed following the same three steps used to determine the maturation function the fer t function is given by 8 f e r t 0 85 σ 1 exp 0 3 13 t 1 exp 1 4 t 31 5 for t 15 0 for t 15 where t has units of c and fer is unitless a parameter σ was introduced in eq 8 to account for the fact that parasitoids and arthropods are usually present in chicken coops and are sometimes the cause of many egg deaths gorla and schofield 1985 cecere et al 2003 this parameter takes values between 0 and 1 depending on the eggs environment if no egg predators are present σ 1 the coefficients in eq 8 have been determined by a least squares fit 2 4 enviromental aspects 2 4 1 outdoor and indoor temperatures the outdoor temperature we consider is the average daily temperature which in the north of argentina can be described approximately by the equation 9 t o u t t a cos 2 π t 365 b where a and b are constants that depend on geographic conditions t is the day of the year and t out has units of c from eq 9 it is observed that december 31 is the hottest day of the year which is consistent with the measurements of the country s national meteorological service smn 2018 the temperature inside a rural chicken coop differs by a few degrees from the outside temperature both in winter and in summer this phenomenon was studied in gorla 1983 and it was determined that there is a linear relationship between both temperatures given by the following function 10 t t o u t 0 71 t o u t 8 52 c this implies that if the outside temperature is less more than 29 c then the temperature inside the chicken coop will be higher lower than that outside this temperature difference has a positive effect on the triatomine s life cycle for example if t out 15 c then t 19 2 c which is a suitable temperature for the eggs to develop while at 15 c there would be no development 2 4 2 predation mortality t infestans is an excellent competitor capable of displacing other triatomines probably due to its efficient feeding pereira et al 2006 this ability to compete extends to intraspecific competition which is characterized by multiple factors such as shelter arrival order zacharias et al 2017 dispersal pattern hernandez 2013 density dependence and medium heterogeneity which leads to nonequivalent refuges lardeux 2013 predator skill etc it is also relevant that adults may emit territorial signals that affect nymph activity abrahan et al 2018 therefore not all insects will reach the same levels of blood intake in a chicken coop the triatomine s blood intake is limited by the access to the hen and by the success in the blood meal since the bite causes irritation in the hen taylor et al 2016 in fact this irritation is what limits the number of insects that can access the blood meal according to bar et al 1994 the stage with the highest predation mortality by the hen is the first in this study it is reported that 63 of nymphs i die and that 93 of this percentage that is 59 of total nymphs i is due exclusively to predation in the four upper stages and in adulthood these values decrease considerably with the average mortality being close to 17 and of this percentage 24 is due to predation this means that on average only 4 of the triatomines beyond the first stage die by predation schweigmann schweigmann et al 1995 studied how many third and fifth stage nymphs and how many adult bugs manage to feed while being in a cage with a chicken overnight this experiment was performed 6 times with 40 nymphs and twice with 20 adults at a time in the first case of the total of 240 nymphs 192 80 survived but only 119 managed to feed themselves 49 6 of the initial 240 the main causes of death were trampling by chickens and to a lesser extent being eaten by the birds as for adults of the 40 that were used 33 survived 82 5 and 24 managed to feed 60 of the initial 40 a greater success rate was observed in adults although the experiments are not comparable since they involve different numbers of insects we note that experimental populations were small compared to real populations in rural chicken coops in some cases up to 3000 insects per coop were observed cecere et al 2003 taking the nymphs as a reference since a greater number of them were used in each experiment we can thus assume that 20 daily bites is a lower bound for k the maximum number of daily bites that a chicken tolerates considering these data we use the following assumptions to build the model ø there are three possible blood intake groups g 1 g 2 and g 3 g 1 is the high level intake group xc 1 0 5 g 2 is the low level intake group 0 xc 2 0 5 and g 3 is the no intake group xc 3 0 the value of k determines the joint size of g 1 and g 2 here g z denotes both group z and its size ø when the total number m of triatomines is less than g 1 then they all belong to g 1 if their number is greater than g 1 the surplus number m g 1 will enter g 2 until m g 1 g 2 if m g 1 g 2 the remainder will go to g 3 ø a nymph that belongs to one of the three intake groups will continue belonging to that group when moving to the next stage ø the no intake group consists only of first stage nymphs since the upper stage nymphs have already taken a blood meal at least once otherwise they could not have entered the upper stages these first stage nymphs will appear when group g 2 is full ø the mortality rate for the no intake group is equal to the death ni t 0 function plus a constant d1 which is large due to the high predation suffered by this group this constant depends on the experiment itself ø the mortality rate for triatomines that ingest blood is equal to the mortality function which depends on their blood intake and the temperature plus a constant due to predation by the birds for nymphal stages i ii and iii this constant is d2 regardless of whether blood ingestion is moderate or high for stages iv v and adults that constant is d3 as expected d1 d2 d3 since the predation probability decreases as the nymph passes to the next stage these parameters depend on the experiment ø since eqs 1 6 were all designed starting from experimental data for which the feeding frequency was always weekly to compare our model with gorla s data we assume that the feeding of the triatomines inside the chicken coop is also weekly on average therefore the total number of individuals that take blood from each hen is equal to 7 k k is the maximum number of daily bites 2 4 3 average calculations when the development time for a nymphal stage is determined by means of the dev i t xc function see eq 1 it is clear that if the blood intake and the temperature remain constant as it could happen in a laboratory experiment then the development time remains constant over time t however in cases where at least one of these two variables depends on time the development time for the nymphal stage in question will also vary over time for example if the temperature increases monotonically from day to day the development time will in general get shorter see fig 1 in this way the nymphs that just enter a stage say at t ta will develop faster and faster until they enter the next stage at t tb for a time that will be between the value of the dev function corresponding to day ta and its value at tb to calculate this final development time given by tb ta a daily average of the values that the dev function takes is performed until the condition that this average is less than or equal to t ta is fulfilled in this case t is always the present day when the algorithm is computing once this condition is reached the development time will be equal to tb ta if for any of the days in which the calculations are performed there is no development for example if the temperature is below 15 c so for that day the dev function does not contribute thus if there are m days with zero development the time to be considered in the average is tb ta m the average functions for development and maturation are described in a3 see eqs a1 and a2 we also define a development operator u z i t eqs a3 and a4 which gives the number of individuals in the stage i and ingestion group z that survived and completed the development and are ready to enter the stage i 1 at time t 2 5 system of equations the eight model equations are as follow 11 egg t δ t egg t egg t deat h egg t δ t z fem t z x c z cmax t δ t fec t u egg t z 12 ni t δ t ni t z u egg t z ni t z deat

in terms of the populations at time t each equation contains the information necessary to determine the number of individuals in the corresponding stage of life based on time of the year temperature and food the parameter μ in the last two equations represents the percentage of females that emerge from the fifth nymphal stage and 1 μ the percentage of males as mentioned earlier we choose a homogeneous composition of females and males μ 0 5 in fig 7 a conceptual diagram of our model is shown in order to visualize eqs 11 18 3 results to test the complete model we first used experimental field work carried out in 1985 by d gorla gorla and schofield 1985 who has given us detailed information about it the experiment consisted of studying the population evolution of various colonies of t infestans that lived in rural chicken coops for three years then based on the parameters used in the model to simulate the aforementioned experiment we determine the limit conditions of the annual temperature and blood ingestion by a colony of triatomines to thrive in a chicken coop 3 1 gorla 1985 this experiment was carried out in the town of huascha located in a rural region of the province of córdoba argentina six chicken coops were built two hens were introduced in each of three of them and four hens in each of the other three an initial population of 304 individuals including eggs of t infestans was also introduced per chicken coop with a composition given by 116 eggs 82 nymphs i 48 nymphs ii 16 nymphs iii 11 nymphs iv 19 nymphs v 6 females and 6 males the parameters we choose are given in table 3 we consider average blood level intakes of xc 1 0 8 and xc 2 0 4 for the high and low ingestion groups respectively xc 1 0 8 as a representative value for the range 0 6 xc 1 0 and xc 2 0 4 as a representative value for the range 0 2 xc 0 6 the sizes of the two ingestion groups g 1 and g 2 and the parameters d1 d2 d3 and σ are determined by an optimization algorithm this algorithm compares gorla s values with a very large number of model runs measuring the difference between these values using a relative least squares method thus the chosen six parameter set g 1 g 2 d1 d2 d3 σ is the one that generates the minimum computed difference as for the other parameters we assume that γ 1 since no information about blood intake is available the determination of λ is detailed in a4 and the maximum number of daily btes is given by k g 1 g 2 7 see subsection 2 4 2 the experiment began in middle march 1981 day 75 of the year and lasted approximately three years with an average annual temperature of 19 c and an amplitude of 6 c parameters b and a of eq 9 respectively the temperature correction inside the chicken coop is taken into account using eq 10 figs 8 and 9 compare gorla s results for n 2 two hens per chicken coop with those of the model figures sm4 and sm5 show the comparison for n 4 in the case n 2 the general behavior of the model is similar to that of the three chicken coops with the exception of a few months for the chicken coop represented by the dotted line whose evolution is considerably different from that of the other coops a slight growth in the egg population is observed at the beginning of each spring and then a larger one at the end of summer see fig 8 then nymphs i arise in some cases of the experiment at the end of summer or else during the fall as it is the case with the model most of these nymphs die because they fail to feed and also because the temperature begins to be unfavorable for their development since in mid autumn it is about 24 c inside the chicken coops eqs 9 and 10 and drops to 22 c in late autumn in this temperature range the development time begins to increase see fig 1 this results in less than half of the nymphs i moving on to the next stage as shown in fig 8 the population behavior of nymphs ii and iii is more irregular than that of eggs and other stages in the model there is an annual peak during the spring for these two stages and then a lower but wider one during the first half of the next year while in the experiment it is observed that already for the third year there are long lasting peaks during the first half of the year for nymphs iv fig 9 the trend begins to be more stable with a higher peak at the end of the year and again a lower and longer one in the autumn this is observed in good detail between the second and third years for nymphs v these two peaks are no longer observed since they overlap resulting in a single peak which in the model occurs at the beginning of the year and in gorla s experiment at the end of the previous year this can be seen clearly in the chicken coop represented by dotted lines which had the largest growth this overlap between the two peaks occurs because the development time of nymphs v is longer than that of all the predecessor stages so that nymphs v emerging from the two nymph iv peaks merge at the end of the summer see table 2 finally there is in the model a strong emergence of males and females during summer and autumn and from winter the populations decrease until the last months of the year similar behavior is observed in the chicken coop described by dotted lines and also in the other two coops but where growth begins earlier in spring see third year from our discussion here and in the sm it can be seen that in general for all stages in both cases n 2 and n 4 there are more similarities between the model and the experiment during the third year we believe that this is due to the time it takes for populations to stabilize which may be different in the model and in the experiment since in the latter there are small natural fluctuations that are not covered by the model in subsection 3 3 we analyze the time required to stabilize the model populations 3 2 population details the population growth in the model for n 2 and n 4 is completely stabilized in annual periods after the sixth year although the general tendency is already evident after three years fig 10 shows the evolution of all populations for eight years for a four hen chicken coop this situation is satisfied as expected provided that the chicken coop is a closed system where triatomines do not enter or leave and can be censored the periodically stable egg population has a large peak in the first half of each year and then a tiny one in the second half the populations of nymphs ii iii and iv have also two annual peaks one high and narrow and the other lower but of longer duration finally the stable populations of nymphs i and v and of adult males and females have a single annual peak that lasts about six months except for that of nymphs v that lasts only three months the existence of a group with a high level of blood intake g 1 is important for the colony even if this group is composed only of a few individuals for the following reason if a nymph i manages to obtain high intake blood meals particularly when xc 1 0 7 it will have higher chances of moving on to the next stage and continue feeding under this regime see subsection 2 4 2 at the same time nymphs in the low intake group g 2 will keep taking a low amount of blood in their future stages xc 2 0 5 as a result nymphs in g 1 have a higher probability to get to adulthood and there will be a greater number of adult bugs in group g 1 than in group g 2 since fertility increases with blood ingestion it is expected that the highest number of eggs laid come from group g 1 in other words although the number of nymphs i in group g 1 is five times smaller than that in group g 2 the former acquires a much more important role for the survival of the colony fig 11 shows the populations of nymphs i and females for both intake groups and n 4 3 3 limit temperatures after determining the model parameters that describe the development of triatomines under conditions similar to those used by d gorla we now search for the upper and lower limits of outside temperature for which a t infestans colony can develop only the environment temperature is modified and the other parameters and initial conditions remain the same as those used in the previous subsection for simplicity the total size of the colony nymphs and adults is plotted without considering eggs we only consider the case n 4 in fig sm6 see sm4 this total population is plotted for the temperature parameters used in the previous subsection a 6 c and b 19 c see eqs 9 and 10 we observe that the most important parameter for the colony survival is the annual mean temperature b and to a lesser extent the oscillation amplitude a for example if b 16 c for any reasonable amplitude between 4 c and 10 c the colony does not survive if on the other hand b 17 c the colony only survives if a 6 c in fig 12 these two situations are plotted 1 a 5 c and b 16 c 2 a 5 c and b 17 c case 2 is not viable for permanent development since a fluctuation such that the amplitude in a given year exceeds 5 c may kill the population during the winter perhaps with a few triatomines remaining the largest and most stable population for reasonable parameters a and b occurs when a 5 c and b 24 c for a 5 c and b 24 c the population continues to be large but undergoes more pronounced seasonal variations see fig sm7 for higher values of b the stable population is lower until it reaches its minimum for b 31 c if a 8 c if 8 c a 10 c b 29 c see fig 13 3 4 minimum blood intake next we investigate the minimum values of blood ingestion that ensure the colony survival we will consider the same parameters as in table 3 but will introduce some simplifications to generate a clearer prediction the chicken coop has only one hen n 1 and at first there is no high intake group g 1 0 and the low intake group is g 2 188 which is the total initial number of nymphs and adult bugs by relaxing the value of the xc 2 threshold which was previously taken equal to 0 5 we will determine the minimum level of blood ingestion in this group xc 2 for which the population does not go extinct for a value of xc 2 0 56 after a transitory the total average population decreases continuously while for xc 2 0 56 the population reaches stable seasonal oscillations fig 14 shows these situations for xc 2 0 55 and xc 2 0 57 this implies that for the survival of the colony the value xc 0 2 necessary for a nymph to move to the next stage see subsection 2 1 2 is not enough climate influences development times and mortality rates so it is not surprising that for a nymph i to reach adulthood a blood intake greater than xc 0 2 is needed the condition xc 2 0 56 is necessary only when there is no other intake class when the high intake group g 1 is present with a few triatomines the situation changes in a very positive way for the colony since these few individuals generate an increase of the oviposition and this compensates for the deaths of the triatomines from the low intake group g 2 this situation can be clearly seen in fig 15 where the triatomine population is plotted for two cases one with xc 1 0 and xc 2 0 50 g 2 188 yielding population extinction and the other with xc 1 0 90 and g 1 10 5 of the colony and xc 2 0 50 and g 2 178 in which the colony is established and survives figure sm8 shows the female populations by intake group for the same two cases when the high intake group with 10 triatomines is introduced g 1 10 there is a single adult female with this ingestion level while the lower intake group with a large number of triatomines g 2 178 has a maximum of five females these five females yield a 70 of total oviposition while the only female in the high intake group is responsible for the remaining 30 of oviposition 4 discussion the model that we have proposed allows us to describe the evolution of a colony of t infestans within a chicken coop the eggs all nymphal stages and the adult phase of the bugs have been considered for each of these stages functions have been developed that describe the most important aspects of their growth development times mortality rates fecundity egg maturation and fertility see eqs 1 8 these functions have the advantage that they are continuous and that they have been designed for a complete domain of temperatures and blood intake levels this permits its use in other models that simulate different scenarios both in laboratories with constant or variable temperatures and in rural chicken coops and other structures with variable temperatures details of the environment that influence the life of triatomines have also been considered the temperature difference between the chicken coop and the outside studied in gorla 1983 is very important eq 10 particularly in cold times of the year because it allows the colony to develop in peridomestic structures when the outside temperature is insufficient by means of our model we observe that for regions of low thermal amplitude a 6 c in eq 9 an average daily outdoor temperature of 12 c for the coldest day of the year is the lowest limit of temperature for which the colony can survive subsection 3 3 although for an outside temperature of about 11 c eq 10 gives an interior temperature of 16 c at which nymphs can feed and molt it is not enough for the survival of the colony since the mortality rates and development times as a whole are so unfavorable at 16 c that they cause the colony to become extinct over the years we remark that in our model we use a temperature that is a function of smooth daily variation eq 9 and involves a daily average of the temperature records this does not preclude that t infestans can be found in rural regions with low thermal amplitude where temperature minima well below 12 c may occur in the early morning hours or even that for a few days the average daily temperature may fall below 12 c what our model shows is that when considering a fit using smooth temperature variations throughout a year average values below 12 c would eventually lead to colony extinction we also observe that for regions with an average annual temperature below 16 c regardless of the temperature range the colony does not survive either from fig 13 we see that average yearly temperatures above about 32 c are generally not favorable for t infestans especially if seasonal temperature variations are strong the increase in the average yearly temperatures that accompanies climactic change is thus likely to shift southward the geographic region where t infestans thrives the low temperature threshold 16 c predicted by our model agrees with the current geographical distribution of t infestans in argentina where the insect is found in the central and northern regions of the country but not in the south galvão et al 2003 being the mean annual temperature that separates the southern and central regions equal to approximately 15 c although this last result cannot be derived from our small scale model it is reassuring that it agrees with its outcome since peridomestic structures mainly chicken coops are the main reason for the persistence of t infestans in the grand chaco region and perhaps beyond the main features of individual chicken coop populations there should have a strong influence on triatomine populations on a bigger scale although the results cannot be automatically extrapolated on account of the mobility of the bugs and their finding of refuge in other structures the model can be used as a steppingstone to a more general formulation the model also considers the relationship between the feeding of the colony and its development as an approximation and for simplicity we have considered that each triatomine from the colony belongs to the same blood intake group high low or no intake throughout its life according to bar bar et al 1994 and cecere cecere et al 2003 the refuge chosen by the triatomines considerably influences their chances since a good refuge minimizes the risks to feed by reducing the distance that the insect must travel to the source of food this approach also considers that the group with no intake g 3 is made up only of nymphs of the first stage since by not feeding they are unable to pass to the second nymphal stage in addition these nymphs have the highest predation mortality rate of all stages so it is to be expected that there will be a high decrease in the number of nymphs ii in relation to nymphs i in contrast to the moderate decrease that occurs in higher stages which is verified experimentally bar et al 1994 cecere et al 2003 when working with blood intake groups the model allows estimating how feeding regulates the colony size we observed that it is enough for a few triatomines to have a high level of blood intake in order to stabilize the population gorla gorla 1992 observed that at low triatomine densities after the application of insecticide for vector control if this insecticide is applied in the hottest months of the year it is enough that a few bugs survive for the colony not to become extinct but if it is applied in the colder months instead the probability of extinction increases considerably although our model does not explicitly describe the application of insecticide we observe that what has been studied by gorla can be explained from fig sm9 since a single female that manages to feed well may be enough for the colony to survive if this female or a small number of them survives the spraying in summer a good meal would lead to abundant oviposition not only because of the blood intake but also due to the favorable temperature see fig 5 but if instead the above occurs in winter fertility would not only be affected by temperature but also by the volume of blood intake see fig 3 regardless of whether a high value for xc 1 is being considered oviposition is expected to be low another result is the great difference in the number of triatomines that reach adulthood in g 1 and g 2 this can be seen in fig 11 where for an intake level of xc 1 0 8 10 of the triatomines in this group are females while for group g 2 with xc 2 0 4 only 1 7 is made up of females and in turn this 1 7 is stable due to the females of the high intake group g 1 since we observe that for xc 0 56 the colony does not survive unless there is another group of triatomines with a higher intake level subsection3 4 if this required group has an intake level of xc 0 9 we find that it must contain a fraction of 5 or higher of the colony to guarantee its preservation it is thus essential for the colony that at least a few triatomines get abundant meals regarding the limitations of our model working with a closed system does not allow modeling the entry and exit of adult bugs these may rise in flight when food is scarce lehane et al 1992 ceballos et al 2005 gurevitz et al 2006 abrahan et al 2016 leading to the colonization of new spaces however if all the bugs in a closed system manage to feed they are not expected to seek to leave the colony in this case the colony is strong and it is unlikely that other bugs will try to settle in the coop extensions to the macro scale suitable for the conditions in chile canals et al 2017 ayala et al 2019 and colombia cordovez et al 2014 have already been proposed these extensions account for climatic influences and predict chagas incidence for instance through calculations of the reproductive number r0 we note two important differences between the subjects of these publications and the grand chaco case chile has been able to eliminate the vectorial transmission of chagas since 1999 and in colombia the main chagas vector is rhodnius prolixus not t infestans it is also relevant that this type of model has also been developed for malaria parham 2010 a different problem arises if chagas is favored by the domiciliation of sylvatic vector species a case that may be investigated with the use of agent based models el saadi 2020 5 conclusion we have developed a discrete equation model to describe all the stages of a population of t infestans in a chicken coop a typical peridomestic structure that has allowed the bug to survive in the grand chaco region in spite of strenuous eradication campaigns the parameter values were taken from experimental results which were used to validate the model the dependence on the temperature and feeding ability were analyzed carefully and we found the minimum conditions of temperature and food availability required for the survival of a t infestans colony the model which is valid over the whole temperature range where the triatomine is viable can be easily adapted to an open system considering the interaction with triatomines inhabiting other rural dwelling structures credit authorship

24544,this study employs a structural equation model sem principal component analysis pca and artificial neural network ann to construct a hybrid pca sem ann model for the prediction of water use efficiency wue the structural relationship and the degree of influence among factors is determined by sem and is transformed into ann s topology where pca is employed to reduce spatial dimensionality the applied results in kashgar xinjiang china show that different influencing factors on wue present a diversity with different levels the ann structure optimized by sem fits better and the pca sem ann model has high explanatory and precision for environmental control of the ecosystem as well as wue simulation the model can be widely applied to the vegetation ecosystem in the entire xinjiang or elsewhere providing a theoretical basis and a simulation method for improving the efficient water use capacity as well as predicting the future response of wue to climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sem pca ann wue vegetation ecosystem 1 introduction as the most basic component of the terrestrial ecosystem vegetation directly reflects the changes in the ecosystem liao 2012 niu et al 2019 and plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gases and maintaining climate stability water use efficiency wue can reflect the mass of dry matter biomass produced by consumption per unit of water which is a comprehensive index for evaluating vegetation growth cao et al 2009 it plays an important role in describing the interaction between the carbon cycle and the water cycle of terrestrial ecosystems wue is estimated by the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp or net primary productivity npp to evapotranspiration et jassal et al 2009 studies have shown that internal factors affecting wue include various processes such as stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and species genetic differences chen et al 2002 shi et al 2004 external factors are divided into two parts firstly directly affecting wue and secondly indirectly affecting wue such as acting on the ecological processes of vegetation itself there are critical values for the impact of precipitation and temperature on wue whether too high or too low will result in inhibition huang et al 2016 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2016 found that 82 of arid regions showed a negative correlation between wue and humidity index and there was a lag effect in the response zou et al 2017 explored the temporal and spatial evolution of wue in the central asia and xinjiang china and found that the increase in wue was mainly due to the increase in precipitation and the conversion of cropland to forest and grassland while the decrease in wue was mainly due to the transformation of crop types and excessive water use in irrigated agricultural areas besides there are huge differences in the wue of different vegetation types in xinjiang china huang et al 2017 since wue links vegetation productivity and water consumption it is vital for models to provide knowledge and understanding of its ecological mechanism models at the ecosystem scale are powerful tools that can extrapolate current information in space and time and provide up scaling as well as exploring the connection between environmental variables and plant physiology cramer et al 2001 simioni et al 2009 zhu et al 2011 at present process based ecosystem models are usually used in the simulation of regional wue such as dynamic land ecosystem model dlem integrated biosphere simulatointegrated ecosystem model ibis and aqua crop model that is the estimation of carbon storage by simulating the photosynthesis and respiration of vegetation zhang et al 2012 zhou 2013 for a large agricultural region an input output geographic information system gis method is used mcvicar et al 2002 which strongly relies on data and cannot be transferred to other global agricultural regions for the temporal and spatial variability with remote sensing being widely used for the simulation given its inherent high spatial density the databases are able to immediately generate high priority data sets and improve follow on data sets mo et al 2005 meanwhile some specific models tracing processes of dry matter accumulation combined with remote sensing data to accomplish the prediction of wue have been put forward plummer 2000 moulin et al 1995 however research on the statistical models that combine observation and remote sensing data to consider the combined influence of various factors on wue is lacking the objective of this study is to analyze both direct and indirect impacts of various influencing factors on wue and to achieve a better predictability in contrast to previous studies on the linearity of wue ma et al 2019 we use sem to quantitatively analyze the multi level effects of driving factors on wue so as to fully consider the interaction between each factor and wue on that basis influencing pathways are transformed into the topological structure of artificial neural network ann and principal component analysis pca is applied for spatial dimensionality reduction thus the proposed pca sem ann model is used to simulate wue sem is an important tool for quantitatively analyzing multivariate data by adding intermediate variables it can be judged whether different factors have direct or indirect effects on the overall patterns of wue niu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 when sem is used to study natural systems it gives different results from conventional univariate relationships grace and keeley 2008 although ann is limited as a black box model in terms of providing little explanatory insight into the contribution of the independent parameters in the prediction it is undoubtedly a powerful tool for delineating nonlinearity kim et al 2019 which is confirmed to be universal and highly flexible function approximators for any data and is well applicable for ecological models sovan and guégan 1999 pca is promoted for efficiency of modelling volodymyr et al 2007 because it helps to reduce the dimensionality and complete the spatial partition as factors make distinct contributions to wue in different regions through exploring pathways of influence by sem effectively dividing spatial features by pca and predicting wue in ann this hybrid pca sem ann model can help understand the impact of the various mechanisms of wue and can help support decision making for agricultural water management and improve efficient water use capacity of the ecosystem we chose kashgar xinjiang china for application of the model the intermediate factor enhanced vegetation index evi has been widely used in vegetation dynamic detection exploring the relationship between vegetation and hydrological and climatic factors jahan et al 2011 zhu and li 2017 studies have shown that evi can be simulated and predicted through certain climatic factors fu et al 2018 by adjusting input data and relevant parameters the model can be employed in other regions consequently this approach can provide an analytical basis and methodology for predicting response of wue under climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in kashgar which lies in the southwest of xinjiang in northwestern china and covers 162 000 square kilometers the annual mean temperature is 11 7 c the annual mean precipitation is 61 5mm and the annual duration of sunlight is 2500h bureau of statistics in kashgar 2019 meanwhile as the demand for water resources in society continues to increase the healthy ecological environment of water is still a challenge there are mainly four types of vegetation types an evergreen needleleaf forest enf grassland shrubland and cropland spatial distribution is shown in fig 1 2 2 data and preprocessing 2 2 1 meteorological data compared with the standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation

the deviations between all known points and predicted values finally the standard deviation was obtained by r 3 5 2 to calibrate the kriging results in addition we have compared the interpolated data with meteorological data from european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf https www ecmwf int indicating the kriging results are reasonable so we conducted the study on the basis of existing data vapor pressure deficit vpd was estimated using following eq jiao et al 2019 1 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 970 100 r h where vpd is vapor pressure deficit kpa t is monthly averaged

was processed into monthly averages from 2000 to 2013 and the nearest resampling method was utilized to uniformly aggregate these datasets into a spatial accuracy of 0 083 wue fitted in this paper is calculated from gpp and et data using 2 w u e g p p e t where wue refers to water use efficiency in gc m 2 mm 1 gpp is monthly averaged gross primary productivity in gc m 2 et is monthly averaged evapotranspiration in mm 2 3 methods 2 3 1 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis pca is a statistical method to reduce the dimension of multi dimensional variables and is used for pattern recognition data compression high resolution spectrum analysis and adaptive beamforming jolliffe 1986 with pca the scatter of district related factors is rotated so that the maximum variance is explained by the first principal component after which a second axis is calculated it orthogonalizes the components of the input vectors orders the principal components so that those with the largest variation come first and eliminates those which contribute the least to the variation in the dataset volodymyr et al 2007 since pca is sensitive to outliers we chose a robust principal component analysis method using a varimax rotation hubert et al 2005 apart from reducing dimensionality of a large number of interrelated variables in this study we also apply pca to spatial variables as the resulting contribution of estimated principal components in variance explanation is calculated and those that contribute less than 2 to the total variation are eliminated in order to improve the accuracy of the wue prediction which was completed using spss 24 2 3 2 structural equation model sem the structural equation model is a crucial tool for analyzing multivariate data it can deal with the causal relationship between multiple factors on the basis of comprehensive path analysis factor analysis regression analysis as well as the analysis of variance which can reflect complex data models shi et al 2017 the path modeling method used in this study is based on variance and iterates through the method of determining the external weight and the estimated value of the latent variable so that the estimation of all parameters reaches the state of convergence under restricted conditions thus the residual variance in all prediction relationships is minimized it focuses on understanding and simultaneously evaluating both direct and indirect pathways within the complex network of interacting environmental variable it makes sem well suited for exploring multiple hypotheses about the different processes operating in a system deutsch et al 2020 in this study the model is considered effective if χ 2 d f 3 goodness of fit index gfi 0 9 and normed fit index nfi 0 9 wen et al 2004 gfi and nfi can be expressed as 3 g f i 1 t r e 1 s i 2 t r e 1 s 2 and 4 n f i χ n 2 χ t 2 χ n 2 where s is the covariance matrix e is the reproducing covariance matrix and χ n 2 χ t 2 refer to χ 2 by the virtual fit model and hypothesis model respectively after preliminary modeling and analysis the structural equation model for different vegetation types was constructed with evi as the intermediate variable with the help of amos 24 2 3 3 artificial neutral network ann ann is a non linear statistical data modelling tool used for prediction and classification sor et al 2017 which can be trained multiple times to improve its performance however the topological structure of ann is mainly determined based on experience and cannot explain precisely the influence path and degree of influence among variables therefore in the simulation of wue in this study sem and ann are combined to make full use of their respective advantages the results of sem are applied to the topology of ann and the connection is determined according to the relationship among the variables whose weights between the nodes correspond to the load and coefficient in the sem model the training algorithm is levenberg marquardt lm and 70 15 and 15 of the input data are randomly selected for training testing and validation this is further verified through cross validation by matlab to estimate the accuracy of classification for wue forecasting model those with ecological mechanisms require descriptions of physical and biological processes which contain many parameters for calibration zhang et al 2012 among the machine learning methods ann can deal with complex information among the data with the input layer hidden layer and output layer the influencing degrees obtained from sem were set as training weights in ann to improve the model s accuracy apart from ann s high practicality and easy operation in the neural network fitting tool nftool in matlab software amit et al 2015 which provides a universal use it has tolerance for the form of input data as well there are no requirements for normality steady state and standardization meanwhile effective climatological input parameters for ann modeling were found with the help of pca venkateswarlu et al 2020 the process of pca sem ann model application used in this paper is shown in fig 2 2 4 selection of study period and factors in kashgar region the temperature and precipitation are quite low from december to february vegetation growth is slow fixed amount of gpp tends to be zero and evapotranspiration fluctuates without obvious regularity therefore the data from december to february of the following year were excluded in this study where the research period is from march 2000 to november 2013 as wue is the ratio of gpp to et the factors affecting gpp or et will cause some impact on wue temperature t affects the activity of enzymes involved in photosynthesis and leaf evapotranspiration precipitation p can supplement the soil moisture content which vegetation needs to absorb through roots to complete its own physiological and ecological process vapor pressure deficit vpd is related to the diffusion of water vapor at the level of leaves wind speed ws affects the resistance of the boundary layer on the leaf surface and thus affects transpiration rn provides energy for all activities of vegetation and soil evaporation compared with photosynthetically active radiation directly related to photosynthesis rn has a wider range of influence zhang et al 2020 spei interferes with et and reflects the degree of drought in the area it can be calculated from meteorological data evi reflects the biological characteristics such as the quantity and survival situation of the vegetation which are closely related to gpp hence we select seven factors such as t p vpd ws rn spei and evi for modeling additionally p t ws rn vpd and spei all have a certain impact on evi that is in addition to directly affecting wue they can also indirectly affect wue by affecting evi 2 5 model evaluation the ideal model requires the predicted value to match the true value this requires the use of indicators to measure the gap between predicted value and true value and the closer the predicted value is to the true value the better the result song and zhang 2020 in this study the pca sem ann results are verified by r values and the spatial evaluation is done with mean square error mse and r2 mse is quite sensitive to the errors that occur in a single set of measurements which can well reflect the accuracy of the model the smaller the mse values the better the predictability r and r2 represent the coefficient of determination between the true values and the predicted values the closer r and r2 is to 1 the better the model prediction these measures can be expressed as follows 5 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 6 r i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 7 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i represents the simulated wue y i is the mean wue and y i is the true value of wue 3 results 3 1 sem on wue of different vegetation types in kashgar region in addition an intermediate variable evi is introduced to describe the complex impact of a variety of driving factors on wue in the construction of sem for enf after repeated modeling and analysis we eliminate ws to ensure the effectiveness of the sem model the fitting indicators of sem indicate that the models of four vegetation types are reliable table 1 the results of sem show that different factors present various sensitivities in different vegetation types wue is heavily positively influenced by t and evi and negatively influenced by p in grassland and shrubland fig 3 fig 4 in cropland vpd and p play a vital role in inhibition while evi promotes wue to a large extent fig 5 meanwhile spei and vpd are mainly negative controlling factors and p is the prominent positive factor in enf fig 6 the promotion and inhibition of driving factors on wue are irregular and closely related to the physiological and ecological characteristics of the vegetation itself in arid and semiarid regions the amount and distribution of precipitation and drought during the year are key factors to dominate ecosystem wue and affect the availability of topsoil water to plants hao et al 2018 jia et al 2016 wang et al 2020 when the temperature is in the range of 15 25 c the wue of vegetation will be higher and will decrease if the temperature is too high or too low wei et al 2016 there is a critical value for the effect of p on wue when it is lower than this critical value p promotes wue and when it is higher than the critical value it inhibits wue and the sensitivity of different vegetation types to temperature is different in addition p not only affects the photosynthesis and evapotranspiration of vegetation but also regulates soil moisture thereby affecting wue tian et al 2010 ni et al 2017 during the study period vpd and spei not only have a significant direct negative impact on wue but also indirectly affect wue through evi the same as the results of zhou et al 2014 overall rn inhibits wue in a direct way but promotes evi thus indirectly affecting wue whose effect for cropland is particularly significant this indicates that cropland is more vulnerable to thermal disturbances as rn determines seasonal variability in et zhang et al 2016 furthermore ws plays a subordinate role in controlling wue among which the impact on shrubland was slightly significant with a lower modulus probably due to its denser leaves and the convection of ws would not have much impact on the canopy 3 2 pca sem ann model of different vegetation types the topological structure of ann is determined based on the interactions obtained by sem and pca is applied to reduce the spatial dimension after preliminarily judging whether it is suitable for principal component analysis with the input factors of spatial rasters each raster contains its time series from 2000 2013 and has different spatial location the corresponding relationship between the principal component and the analysis items the loading factors are obtained and the spatial factors that contribute less than 2 to the total variation and those with severe deviations in the principal component correspondence are eliminated thereby the spatial dimensionality reduction is conducted to clarify the spatial classification so as to improve the accuracy of the model according to the results of the eigenvalues the first two pcs are retained to represent the total variability these principal component coefficients define new coordinates and the new axes classify the resulted new variables represented by vectors niu et al 2017 effectively clustering the wue in terms of different locations then the spatial raster data of different vegetation types inputted as samples so as to construct the pca sem ann model of different vegetation types in kashgar region lm algorithm is used for model training and the weights are repeatedly trained by comparing the actual calculated wue with that simulated by the model in order to obtain a smaller deviation and a better simulation effect in order to verify the fit of pca sem ann model we respectively compare its r values with the sem ann model without spatial pca as well as the ann model without sem pathways in cropland enf and shrubland the r values of the test set in pca sem ann model are 0 67 0 94 and 0 80 which are significantly better compared with the sem ann model r 0 60 0 77 0 78 respectively and the ann model r 0 45 0 74 0 57 respectively the goodness of fit between simulated and actual wue is shown in fig 7 fig 8 9 as for grassland fig 10 the predictive ability of pca sem ann for wue r 0 69 is not higher than the sem ann model r 0 89 or even slightly lower than the ann model without sem pathways r 0 82 despite the spatial pca we can still use sem ann model to achieve a better simulation of wue 3 3 spatial evaluation of pca sem ann model we compare the mse and r of the simulation results to obtain the spatial bias by ann model without sem pathways sem ann model and pca sem ann model as shown in figs 11 and 12 and table 2 these figures suggest that mse values reduce comprehensively fig 11 table 2 indicating that the pca sem ann model improves the accuracy of simulation and exhibit a high level of predictive accuracy with spatial distribution mse values present higher value in the north and lower in the south which is consistent among the three models mse values of shrubland enf and the northwestern part of cropland decline notably overall r2 are getting closer to 1 and the values over 0 80 are taking up more space especially in northern and central kashgar accounting for 12 32 and 48 of the total grids from fig 12 a to c and illustrating that the proposed model can be a quite efficient tool in the pca sem ann model r2 over 0 70 are more than 60 of the total however r2 in the north are apparently higher and those in the southeast corner are relatively low which differs with the results of mse values this outcome is mainly attributed to the ability of the pca sem ann architecture in capturing non linear relationships and the fluctuations of wue over different vegetation types additionally human activities such as grazing urbanization as well as other unforeseen circumstances may cause bias 4 discussion most previous studies for predicting the influencing factors on wue have used sem or ann separately wang et al 2020 boulos 2020 the high applicability of pca sem ann model lies in its special pattern which is applicable for many other regions the process is as follows first choose different driving factors according to the region and explore their own influencing pathways via sem then the pathways are transferred into the topology of the ann furthermore the input data is facilitated by the pca s valid segmentation finally run the model to check the results in the pca sem ann model built in the study area the r value of cropland is relatively low after preliminary analysis the main reasons are thought to be as follows first the impact of irrigation water on wue of the cropland is not considered in the simulation it is necessary to obtain more accurate irrigation data which will be added in the model construction for further discussion second wue in cropland is also closely related to planting structure planting period water and fertilizer management and so on the above factors will induce a certain degree of error which needs to be further studied as a result the current model can be extended to the simulation of wue in the entire xinjiang but needs to be trained and parameterized in the future overall this study supports the contention that patterns of wue are influenced by various factors including both indirect as well as direct pathways even if the pca sem ann model does not improve values of r as the results of grassland in this study we can still apply sem ann model to significantly improve the prediction of wue where r is 0 89 compared with 0 82 of ann model without sem pathways the reasons why pca sem ann model does not improve r in grassland are 1 the data distribution of each category in the training data plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the model liu et al 2021 as numerous environmental factors make contributions to wue variability wang et al 2018 the wue of grassland has a large fluctuation which varies from 0 11 gc m 2 mm 1 to 13 42 gc m 2 mm 1 therefore the training may not be optimal leading to deviations in results 2 grassland covers a large part of land use with 537 grids which are mainly distributed in southwestern kashgar including meadow desert grassland alpine and sub alpine grassland with different characteristics themselves we need a further detailed classification to amplify the sorting of input data so as to make a more precise simulation 3 in our study we ignore consequence resulting from human activity and changes in land use cover for example grazing may decrease photosynthetic area thus declining aboveground biomass of grassland li et al 2018 urbanization may alter the water potential and change the stomata characteristics of plants so carbon assimilation may be decreased harrison et al 2010 in future research additional factors should be taken into consideration to reduce bias 5 conclusions based on remote sensing gpp data and et dataset the study involved calculation of the wue of four different vegetation types in kashgar region from 2000 to 2013 sem is used to quantitatively analyze the pathways and degree of influence of various driving factors on wue then the relationships of sem are converted into the topological structure of ann and the degree of influence is set as the training weight finally pca was applied to reduce the spatial dimensionality to complete the construction of the pca sem ann model through the model we can clarify the influence mechanisms of various factors on wue and improve the accuracy of wue simulation so as to improve prediction by setting the intermediate variable evi the multi level response among different factors and wue can be better described under different vegetation types p is the main factor affecting wue evi is also a crucial factor in grassland shrubland and cropland while simulating and predicting wue it is necessary to pay more attention to these significant factors in addition the impact of driving factors on wue varies greatly in different vegetation types indicating that the types of vegetation and their own genetic characteristics should also be fully considered during analysis after the optimization of sem and the dimensionality reduction of pca the non linear relationship of various factors on wue is explained through the middle path of evi fitting results show that the pca sem ann model has high interpretability and accuracy for environmental control of the ecosystem as well as wue simulation in the study area except for grassland owing to its huge discrepancy moreover the error analysis reveals improvement of the model s simulation ability as mse values are get lower and r values become closer to 1 however the spatial differences need further study in depth at the same time evi can be predicted through meteorological factors in summary the pca sem ann model can provide a theoretical basis and method to the prediction of wue under future scenarios and is applicable to many other regions credit authorship

24544,this study employs a structural equation model sem principal component analysis pca and artificial neural network ann to construct a hybrid pca sem ann model for the prediction of water use efficiency wue the structural relationship and the degree of influence among factors is determined by sem and is transformed into ann s topology where pca is employed to reduce spatial dimensionality the applied results in kashgar xinjiang china show that different influencing factors on wue present a diversity with different levels the ann structure optimized by sem fits better and the pca sem ann model has high explanatory and precision for environmental control of the ecosystem as well as wue simulation the model can be widely applied to the vegetation ecosystem in the entire xinjiang or elsewhere providing a theoretical basis and a simulation method for improving the efficient water use capacity as well as predicting the future response of wue to climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sem pca ann wue vegetation ecosystem 1 introduction as the most basic component of the terrestrial ecosystem vegetation directly reflects the changes in the ecosystem liao 2012 niu et al 2019 and plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gases and maintaining climate stability water use efficiency wue can reflect the mass of dry matter biomass produced by consumption per unit of water which is a comprehensive index for evaluating vegetation growth cao et al 2009 it plays an important role in describing the interaction between the carbon cycle and the water cycle of terrestrial ecosystems wue is estimated by the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp or net primary productivity npp to evapotranspiration et jassal et al 2009 studies have shown that internal factors affecting wue include various processes such as stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and species genetic differences chen et al 2002 shi et al 2004 external factors are divided into two parts firstly directly affecting wue and secondly indirectly affecting wue such as acting on the ecological processes of vegetation itself there are critical values for the impact of precipitation and temperature on wue whether too high or too low will result in inhibition huang et al 2016 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2016 found that 82 of arid regions showed a negative correlation between wue and humidity index and there was a lag effect in the response zou et al 2017 explored the temporal and spatial evolution of wue in the central asia and xinjiang china and found that the increase in wue was mainly due to the increase in precipitation and the conversion of cropland to forest and grassland while the decrease in wue was mainly due to the transformation of crop types and excessive water use in irrigated agricultural areas besides there are huge differences in the wue of different vegetation types in xinjiang china huang et al 2017 since wue links vegetation productivity and water consumption it is vital for models to provide knowledge and understanding of its ecological mechanism models at the ecosystem scale are powerful tools that can extrapolate current information in space and time and provide up scaling as well as exploring the connection between environmental variables and plant physiology cramer et al 2001 simioni et al 2009 zhu et al 2011 at present process based ecosystem models are usually used in the simulation of regional wue such as dynamic land ecosystem model dlem integrated biosphere simulatointegrated ecosystem model ibis and aqua crop model that is the estimation of carbon storage by simulating the photosynthesis and respiration of vegetation zhang et al 2012 zhou 2013 for a large agricultural region an input output geographic information system gis method is used mcvicar et al 2002 which strongly relies on data and cannot be transferred to other global agricultural regions for the temporal and spatial variability with remote sensing being widely used for the simulation given its inherent high spatial density the databases are able to immediately generate high priority data sets and improve follow on data sets mo et al 2005 meanwhile some specific models tracing processes of dry matter accumulation combined with remote sensing data to accomplish the prediction of wue have been put forward plummer 2000 moulin et al 1995 however research on the statistical models that combine observation and remote sensing data to consider the combined influence of various factors on wue is lacking the objective of this study is to analyze both direct and indirect impacts of various influencing factors on wue and to achieve a better predictability in contrast to previous studies on the linearity of wue ma et al 2019 we use sem to quantitatively analyze the multi level effects of driving factors on wue so as to fully consider the interaction between each factor and wue on that basis influencing pathways are transformed into the topological structure of artificial neural network ann and principal component analysis pca is applied for spatial dimensionality reduction thus the proposed pca sem ann model is used to simulate wue sem is an important tool for quantitatively analyzing multivariate data by adding intermediate variables it can be judged whether different factors have direct or indirect effects on the overall patterns of wue niu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 when sem is used to study natural systems it gives different results from conventional univariate relationships grace and keeley 2008 although ann is limited as a black box model in terms of providing little explanatory insight into the contribution of the independent parameters in the prediction it is undoubtedly a powerful tool for delineating nonlinearity kim et al 2019 which is confirmed to be universal and highly flexible function approximators for any data and is well applicable for ecological models sovan and guégan 1999 pca is promoted for efficiency of modelling volodymyr et al 2007 because it helps to reduce the dimensionality and complete the spatial partition as factors make distinct contributions to wue in different regions through exploring pathways of influence by sem effectively dividing spatial features by pca and predicting wue in ann this hybrid pca sem ann model can help understand the impact of the various mechanisms of wue and can help support decision making for agricultural water management and improve efficient water use capacity of the ecosystem we chose kashgar xinjiang china for application of the model the intermediate factor enhanced vegetation index evi has been widely used in vegetation dynamic detection exploring the relationship between vegetation and hydrological and climatic factors jahan et al 2011 zhu and li 2017 studies have shown that evi can be simulated and predicted through certain climatic factors fu et al 2018 by adjusting input data and relevant parameters the model can be employed in other regions consequently this approach can provide an analytical basis and methodology for predicting response of wue under climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in kashgar which lies in the southwest of xinjiang in northwestern china and covers 162 000 square kilometers the annual mean temperature is 11 7 c the annual mean precipitation is 61 5mm and the annual duration of sunlight is 2500h bureau of statistics in kashgar 2019 meanwhile as the demand for water resources in society continues to increase the healthy ecological environment of water is still a challenge there are mainly four types of vegetation types an evergreen needleleaf forest enf grassland shrubland and cropland spatial distribution is shown in fig 1 2 2 data and preprocessing 2 2 1 meteorological data compared with the standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei combines the flexible time scale of spi and the sensitive response to evaporation of pdsi which has shown strong practicability in agricultural ecological and hydrological applications vicente serrano et al 2012 spei with a spatial resolution of 0 5 used in this study comes from the spei drought index data set in xinjiang yao et al 2019 precipitation

51704 51717 51804 51810 and 51811 after processing the station data as a monthly average kriging interpolation is used for spatial interpolation by arcmap 10 0 we used cross validation by analyzing the deviations between all known points and predicted values finally the standard deviation was obtained by r 3 5 2 to calibrate the kriging results in addition we have compared the interpolated data with meteorological data from european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf https www ecmwf int indicating the kriging results are reasonable so we conducted the study on the basis of existing data vapor pressure deficit vpd was estimated using following eq jiao et al 2019 1 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 970 100 r h where vpd is vapor pressure deficit kpa t is monthly averaged temperature c rh is monthly averaged relative humidity 2 2 2 remote sensing data gross primary productivity of vegetation in this paper is the modis gpp mod17a2 with a spatial resolution of 250 m and 16 d provided by nasa evapotranspiration comes from the nasa hydrology and earth science scholarship program http www ntsg umt edu with a resolution of 8 km 8 km evi is from the 250 m evi monthly composite product provided by geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the vegetation cover comes from eu land cover data 2000 http www gvm jrc it glc2000 and the vegetation types have been reclassified accordingly the vegetation covers a total of approximately 65696 square kilometers including enf 3989 km2 grassland 45580 km2 shrubland 2971 km2 and cropland 13156 km2 net solar radiation

observations of satellites to calculate surface radiation on a global scale through remote sensing inversion algorithms wielicki et al 1998 after the extraction and analysis by arcmap 10 0 all data was processed into monthly averages from 2000 to 2013 and the nearest resampling method was utilized to uniformly aggregate these datasets into a spatial accuracy of 0 083 wue fitted in this paper is calculated from gpp and et data using 2 w u e g p p e t where wue refers to water use efficiency in gc m 2 mm 1 gpp is monthly averaged gross primary productivity in gc m 2 et is monthly averaged evapotranspiration in mm 2 3 methods 2 3 1 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis pca is a statistical method to reduce the dimension of multi dimensional variables and is used for pattern recognition data compression high resolution spectrum analysis and adaptive beamforming jolliffe 1986 with pca the scatter of district related factors is rotated so that the maximum variance is explained by the first principal component after which a second axis is calculated it orthogonalizes the components of the input vectors orders the principal components so that those with the largest variation come first and eliminates those which contribute the least to the variation in the dataset volodymyr et al 2007 since pca is sensitive to outliers we chose a robust principal component analysis method using a varimax rotation hubert et al 2005 apart from reducing dimensionality of a large number of interrelated variables in this study we also apply pca to spatial variables as the resulting contribution of estimated principal components in variance explanation is calculated and those that contribute less than 2 to the total variation are eliminated in order to improve the accuracy of the wue prediction which was completed using spss 24 2 3 2 structural equation model sem the structural equation model is a crucial tool for analyzing multivariate data it can deal with the causal relationship between multiple factors on the basis of comprehensive path analysis factor analysis regression analysis as well as the analysis of variance which can reflect complex data models shi et al 2017 the path modeling method used in this study is based on variance and iterates through the method of determining the external weight and the estimated value of the latent variable so that the estimation of all parameters reaches the state of convergence under restricted conditions thus the residual variance in all prediction relationships is minimized it focuses on understanding and simultaneously evaluating both direct and indirect pathways within the complex network of interacting environmental variable it makes sem well suited for exploring multiple hypotheses about the different processes operating in a system deutsch et al 2020 in this study the model is considered effective if χ 2 d f 3 goodness of fit index gfi 0 9 and normed fit index nfi 0 9 wen et al 2004 gfi and nfi can be expressed as 3 g f i 1 t r e 1 s i 2 t r e 1 s 2 and 4 n f i χ n 2 χ t 2 χ n 2 where s is the covariance matrix e is the reproducing covariance matrix and χ n 2 χ t 2 refer to χ 2 by the virtual fit model and hypothesis model respectively after preliminary modeling and analysis the structural equation model for different vegetation types was constructed with evi as the intermediate variable with the help of amos 24 2 3 3 artificial neutral network ann ann is a non linear statistical data modelling tool used for prediction and classification sor et al 2017 which can be trained multiple times to improve its performance however the topological structure of ann is mainly determined based on experience and cannot explain precisely the influence path and degree of influence among variables therefore in the simulation of wue in this study sem and ann are combined to make full use of their respective advantages the results of sem are applied to the topology of ann and the connection is determined according to the relationship among the variables whose weights between the nodes correspond to the load and coefficient in the sem model the training algorithm is levenberg marquardt lm and 70 15 and 15 of the input data are randomly selected for training testing and validation this is further verified through cross validation by matlab to estimate the accuracy of classification for wue forecasting model those with ecological mechanisms require descriptions of physical and biological processes which contain many parameters for calibration zhang et al 2012 among the machine learning methods ann can deal with complex information among the data with the input layer hidden layer and output layer the influencing degrees obtained from sem were set as training weights in ann to improve the model s accuracy apart from ann s high practicality and easy operation in the neural network fitting tool nftool in matlab software amit et al 2015 which provides a universal use it has tolerance for the form of input data as well there are no requirements for normality steady state and standardization meanwhile effective climatological input parameters for ann modeling were found with the help of pca venkateswarlu et al 2020 the process of pca sem ann model application used in this paper is shown in fig 2 2 4 selection of study period and factors in kashgar region the temperature and precipitation are quite low from december to february vegetation growth is slow fixed amount of gpp tends to be zero and evapotranspiration fluctuates without obvious regularity therefore the data from december to february of the following year were excluded in this study where the research period is from march 2000 to november 2013 as wue is the ratio of gpp to et the factors affecting gpp or et will cause some impact on wue temperature t affects the activity of enzymes involved in photosynthesis and leaf evapotranspiration precipitation p can supplement the soil moisture content which vegetation needs to absorb through roots to complete its own physiological and ecological process vapor pressure deficit vpd is related to the diffusion of water vapor at the level of leaves wind speed ws affects the resistance of the boundary layer on the leaf surface and thus affects transpiration rn provides energy for all activities of vegetation and soil evaporation compared with photosynthetically active radiation directly related to photosynthesis rn has a wider range of influence zhang et al 2020 spei interferes with et and reflects the degree of drought in the area it can be calculated from meteorological data evi reflects the biological characteristics such as the quantity and survival situation of the vegetation which are closely related to gpp hence we select seven factors such as t p vpd ws rn spei and evi for modeling additionally p t ws rn vpd and spei all have a certain impact on evi that is in addition to directly affecting wue they can also indirectly affect wue by affecting evi 2 5 model evaluation the ideal model requires the predicted value to match the true value this requires the use of indicators to measure the gap between predicted value and true value and the closer the predicted value is to the true value the better the result song and zhang 2020 in this study the pca sem ann results are verified by r values and the spatial evaluation is done with mean square error mse and r2 mse is quite sensitive to the errors that occur in a single set of measurements which can well reflect the accuracy of the model the smaller the mse values the better the predictability r and r2 represent the coefficient of determination between the true values and the predicted values the closer r and r2 is to 1 the better the model prediction these measures can be expressed as follows 5 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 6 r i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 7 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i represents the simulated wue y i is the mean wue and y i is the true value of wue 3 results 3 1 sem on wue of different vegetation types in kashgar region in addition an intermediate variable evi is introduced to describe the complex impact of a variety of driving factors on wue in the construction of sem for enf after repeated modeling and analysis we eliminate ws to ensure the effectiveness of the sem model the fitting indicators of sem indicate that the models of four vegetation types are reliable table 1 the results of sem show that different factors present various sensitivities in different vegetation types wue is heavily positively influenced by t and evi and negatively influenced by p in grassland and shrubland fig 3 fig 4 in cropland vpd and p play a vital role in inhibition while evi promotes wue to a large extent fig 5 meanwhile spei and vpd are mainly negative controlling factors and p is the prominent positive factor in enf fig 6 the promotion and inhibition of driving factors on wue are irregular and closely related to the physiological and ecological characteristics of the vegetation itself in arid and semiarid regions the amount and distribution of precipitation and drought during the year are key factors to dominate ecosystem wue and affect the availability of topsoil water to plants hao et al 2018 jia et al 2016 wang et al 2020 when the temperature is in the range of 15 25 c the wue of vegetation will be higher and will decrease if the temperature is too high or too low wei et al 2016 there is a critical value for the effect of p on wue when it is lower than this critical value p promotes wue and when it is higher than the critical value it inhibits wue and the sensitivity of different vegetation types to temperature is different in addition p not only affects the photosynthesis and evapotranspiration of vegetation but also regulates soil moisture thereby affecting wue tian et al 2010 ni et al 2017 during the study period vpd and spei not only have a significant direct negative impact on wue but also indirectly affect wue through evi the same as the results of zhou et al 2014 overall rn inhibits wue in a direct way but promotes evi thus indirectly affecting wue whose effect for cropland is particularly significant this indicates that cropland is more vulnerable to thermal disturbances as rn determines seasonal variability in et zhang et al 2016 furthermore ws plays a subordinate role in controlling wue among which the impact on shrubland was slightly significant with a lower modulus probably due to its denser leaves and the convection of ws would not have much impact on the canopy 3 2 pca sem ann model of different vegetation types the topological structure of ann is determined based on the interactions obtained by sem and pca is applied to reduce the spatial dimension after preliminarily judging whether it is suitable for principal component analysis with the input factors of spatial rasters each raster contains its time series from 2000 2013 and has different spatial location the corresponding relationship between the principal component and the analysis items the loading factors are obtained and the spatial factors that contribute less than 2 to the total variation and those with severe deviations in the principal component correspondence are eliminated thereby the spatial dimensionality reduction is conducted to clarify the spatial classification so as to improve the accuracy of the model according to the results of the eigenvalues the first two pcs are retained to represent the total variability these principal component coefficients define new coordinates and the new axes classify the resulted new variables represented by vectors niu et al 2017 effectively clustering the wue in terms of different locations then the spatial raster data of different vegetation types inputted as samples so as to construct the pca sem ann model of different vegetation types in kashgar region lm algorithm is used for model training and the weights are repeatedly trained by comparing the actual calculated wue with that simulated by the model in order to obtain a smaller deviation and a better simulation effect in order to verify the fit of pca sem ann model we respectively compare its r values with the sem ann model without spatial pca as well as the ann model without sem pathways in cropland enf and shrubland the r values of the test set in pca sem ann model are 0 67 0 94 and 0 80 which are significantly better compared with the sem ann model r 0 60 0 77 0 78 respectively and the ann model r 0 45 0 74 0 57 respectively the goodness of fit between simulated and actual wue is shown in fig 7 fig 8 9 as for grassland fig 10 the predictive ability of pca sem ann for wue r 0 69 is not higher than the sem ann model r 0 89 or even slightly lower than the ann model without sem pathways r 0 82 despite the spatial pca we can still use sem ann model to achieve a better simulation of wue 3 3 spatial evaluation of pca sem ann model we compare the mse and r of the simulation results to obtain the spatial bias by ann model without sem pathways sem ann model and pca sem ann model as shown in figs 11 and 12 and table 2 these figures suggest that mse values reduce comprehensively fig 11 table 2 indicating that the pca sem ann model improves the accuracy of simulation and exhibit a high level of predictive accuracy with spatial distribution mse values present higher value in the north and lower in the south which is consistent among the three models mse values of shrubland enf and the northwestern part of cropland decline notably overall r2 are getting closer to 1 and the values over 0 80 are taking up more space especially in northern and central kashgar accounting for 12 32 and 48 of the total grids from fig 12 a to c and illustrating that the proposed model can be a quite efficient tool in the pca sem ann model r2 over 0 70 are more than 60 of the total however r2 in the north are apparently higher and those in the southeast corner are relatively low which differs with the results of mse values this outcome is mainly attributed to the ability of the pca sem ann architecture in capturing non linear relationships and the fluctuations of wue over different vegetation types additionally human activities such as grazing urbanization as well as other unforeseen circumstances may cause bias 4 discussion most previous studies for predicting the influencing factors on wue have used sem or ann separately wang et al 2020 boulos 2020 the high applicability of pca sem ann model lies in its special pattern which is applicable for many other regions the process is as follows first choose different driving factors according to the region and explore their own influencing pathways via sem then the pathways are transferred into the topology of the ann furthermore the input data is facilitated by the pca s valid segmentation finally run the model to check the results in the pca sem ann model built in the study area the r value of cropland is relatively low after preliminary analysis the main reasons are thought to be as follows first the impact of irrigation water on wue of the cropland is not considered in the simulation it is necessary to obtain more accurate irrigation data which will be added in the model construction for further discussion second wue in cropland is also closely related to planting structure planting period water and fertilizer management and so on the above factors will induce a certain degree of error which needs to be further studied as a result the current model can be extended to the simulation of wue in the entire xinjiang but needs to be trained and parameterized in the future overall this study supports the contention that patterns of wue are influenced by various factors including both indirect as well as direct pathways even if the pca sem ann model does not improve values of r as the results of grassland in this study we can still apply sem ann model to significantly improve the prediction of wue where r is 0 89 compared with 0 82 of ann model without sem pathways the reasons why pca sem ann model does not improve r in grassland are 1 the data distribution of each category in the training data plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the model liu et al 2021 as numerous environmental factors make contributions to wue variability wang et al 2018 the wue of grassland has a large fluctuation which varies from 0 11 gc m 2 mm 1 to 13 42 gc m 2 mm 1 therefore the training may not be optimal leading to deviations in results 2 grassland covers a large part of land use with 537 grids which are mainly distributed in southwestern kashgar including meadow desert grassland alpine and sub alpine grassland with different characteristics themselves we need a further detailed classification to amplify the sorting of input data so as to make a more precise simulation 3 in our study we ignore consequence resulting from human activity and changes in land use cover for example grazing may decrease photosynthetic area thus declining aboveground biomass of grassland li et al 2018 urbanization may alter the water potential and change the stomata characteristics of plants so carbon assimilation may be decreased harrison et al 2010 in future research additional factors should be taken into consideration to reduce bias 5 conclusions based on remote sensing gpp data and et dataset the study involved calculation of the wue of four different vegetation types in kashgar region from 2000 to 2013 sem is used to quantitatively analyze the pathways and degree of influence of various driving factors on wue then the relationships of sem are converted into the topological structure of ann and the degree of influence is set as the training weight finally pca was applied to reduce the spatial dimensionality to complete the construction of the pca sem ann model through the model we can clarify the influence mechanisms of various factors on wue and improve the accuracy of wue simulation so as to improve prediction by setting the intermediate variable evi the multi level response among different factors and wue can be better described under different vegetation types p is the main factor affecting wue evi is also a crucial factor in grassland shrubland and cropland while simulating and predicting wue it is necessary to pay more attention to these significant factors in addition the impact of driving factors on wue varies greatly in different vegetation types indicating that the types of vegetation and their own genetic characteristics should also be fully considered during analysis after the optimization of sem and the dimensionality reduction of pca the non linear relationship of various factors on wue is explained through the middle path of evi fitting results show that the pca sem ann model has high interpretability and accuracy for environmental control of the ecosystem as well as wue simulation in the study area except for grassland owing to its huge discrepancy moreover the error analysis reveals improvement of the model s simulation ability as mse values are get lower and r values become closer to 1 however the spatial differences need further study in depth at the same time evi can be predicted through meteorological factors in summary the pca sem ann model can provide a theoretical basis and method to the prediction of wue under future scenarios and is applicable to many other regions credit authorship
